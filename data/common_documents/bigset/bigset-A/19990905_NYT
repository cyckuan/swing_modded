ANGELS LOOK FOR MANAGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Now that the Anaheim Angels players
essentially forced Terry Collins out as manager, who's next? What
type of manager is needed to lead a team that has had so much
trouble getting along with each other?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the list of candidates includes Don Baylor, Kevin
Kennedy, Chris Chambliss, Willie Randolph, Phil Garner and Davey
Lopes. Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn played for Kennedy in Boston
and the two are close, but Vaughn won't offer an endorsement to the
front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be my decision,'' Vaughn said. ``(Kennedy's)
an intense guy. I don't believe in that East Coast/West Coast
thing. Kevin's a West Coast guy and he's as intense as Earl Weaver
was with the Baltimore Orioles.''
</P>
<P>
   But wasn't Collins intense? Is intensity the answer?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need to have is a pact between the manager, coaching
staff and players,'' Vaughn said. ``It's like a written document.
If you as a player give everything you've got and have the right
attitude, the manager will lead you strategically on the field.
That's what you're looking for in a manager _ somebody who will
treat you like a man and in return you give him everything you've
got. If you don't prepare, you're letting down everybody who is
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   For other Angels players, however, the question of who should
lead the team is none of their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``From any player's standpoint, nobody should be commenting on
what the team needs,'' right fielder Tim Salmon said. ``You should
take care of your own business and get yourself ready. We've got 30
games left, and that's what our focus should be. As far as who the
coaches are or who takes over, we shouldn't be thinking about that.
I do all I can to not think about those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss, a former Yankees player and now the club's hitting
coach, interviewed for the Angels' managerial job before the 1997
season that Collins eventually got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in any major-league managing job, there's no
secret about that,'' Chambliss said. ``When I interviewed with Bill
(Bavasi, the Angels GM) he said to me it was a very good interview.
He was very positive about it. But I wasn't asked back a second
time. That was really the extent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, who is the hitting coach for the Atlanta Braves, said
he's interested but won't necessarily jump at the first
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization's philosophy of planning for the future is
something I'm more concerned with,'' he said recently. ``They have
to be an organization that is building toward winning. There are so
many young guys in the majors now that should be in Double-A or
Triple-A. There's no depth in the minor leagues.''

DURZAO DOES IT AGAIN FOR D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - For one night, at least, the Diamondbacks had enough
sand bags to keep San Francisco's rising river of momentum away.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona accomplished its objective by overcoming an early 3-0
deficit for a 5-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Saturday night
in front of 48,730 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie first baseman Erubiel Durazo continued his remarkable
development with a pair of home runs off right-hander John Smoltz,
and left-hander Greg Swindell and right-hander Matt Mantei held the
Braves hitless over the final three innings.
</P>
<P>
   After three straight losses, the Diamondbacks finally were able
to put their 80th victory on the board (80-56). They were able to
maintain their five-game lead in the National League West Division
despite the Giants' eighth straightvictory.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (86-51) had won 10 in a row at home and 14 of its last
15. The Braves saw their lead in the NL East trimmed to 3{ games by
the New York Mets, who defeated the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan Klesko hit a three-run homer in the first inning off
right-hander Andy Benes, his second long shot in as many nights,
the Diamondbacks looked to be well on the way to dropping another
game to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go through the ``Here we go (again)'' routine, but
the guys here have a lot of confidence in the ability that allowed
themto get here, to finish the job,'' said Arizona Manager Buck
Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a solo homer by Randall Simon in the fourth inning,
Benes settled down and went on to pick up his 10th victory of the
season (10-11).
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy bent but didn't break, and gave us a key shutdown inning
in the sixth,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had scored three times in the top of the sixth to take a
5-4lead.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez doubled to lead off the inning and Steve Finley
drove him in with a double. Durazo, who had hit a solo homer with
two out in the fourth off Smoltz (9-7), hit one into the night that
landed 435 feet away for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo put up big numbers at Double-A El Paso and Triple-A
Tucson, ``but doing it in the big leagues is a lot different,''
said Diamondbacks hitting coach Jim Presley.
</P>
<P>
   When Durazo first joined the big club on July 25, ``you could
see his potential. He was just `juicing it' in (batting
practice),'' Presley said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 225-pound Durazo is reminiscent of a
left-handed-hitting Andres ``Big Cat''Galarraga of the Braves,
turning easily on the fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Off-speed stuff has been another story, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about a 10-day `grace period' before they (pitchers)
get a line on you (weakness),'' Presley said. ``But to his credit,
Erubiel has adjusted pretty well and is continuing to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, a 25-year-old native of Mexico, said he has been taking
a lot of early batting practice to work on off-speed pitches and
thinks he has improved.
</P>
<P>
   The extra work paid off on Saturday night. The first homer off
Smoltz was on a change-up, and the second was on a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time in a situation like this and I want to
learn as much as I can,'' he said. ``This is the last month of the
season. We want to keep winning and I wand to make a
contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindell pitched the seventh and eighth. Walt Weiss, the leadoff
man in the seventh, reached base on an error by shortstop Hanley
Frias, but was erased on a double-play grounderby Chipper Jones to
end the inning. Swindell retired the side in order in the eighth
before Mantei took over in the ninth, striking out the side to earn
his 16th save with Arizona and 26th overall.
</P>
<P>
   In Swindell's last nine outings, opponents are hitting just .088
(3 for 34) off him. He appeared in his 50th game of the season and
lowered his ERA from 2.42 to 2.32. The more work he can get in, the
better. He appeared ina combined 81 games last season for Minnesota
and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A starter early in his career, Swindell now feels comfortable in
hismiddle-relief role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time when you come in,the game is on the line and
I like that. It's a challenge for me,'' he said. ``And it
definitely helps to get as much work as you can,not just with one
or two hitters, but with five or six or seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantei mixed his curveball in more with his blazing fastball.
Askedif it was the best stuff he's had since coming to Arizona, he
said, ``Pretty close. I've never had this result. The guys busted
their butts to get the lead back and we were able to hold it.
Swindell got more of a save than I did.'' &QL;

D-BACKS NOT WORRIED YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Before the game, Chicken Little phoned Henny Penny who
called Cocky Locky. who told Ducky Lucky who told Goosey Loosey who
told Turkey Lurkey who faxed ``The Arizona Republic'' and called
every radio sports talk show in town.
</P>
<P>
   The sky is falling!

</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had lost three in a row. And in the first
inning Saturday night _ look, the Giants are winning ``again'' _
gossip about the team's impending doom traveled almost as fast as
Ryan Klesko's three-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   But put down the phone. Now, take a deep breath. Do NOT panic.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Here in tomahawk country, where the incessant
``boo''m-boom-boom-boom of tom-tom mixes with a mournful war chant
that can put a visitor on edge, the division-leading Diamondbacks
won a very important game.
</P>
<P>
   They showed some fortitude. Resiliency. Something Grandma called
gumption.
</P>
<P>
   Down 3-0 after Klesko's homer, his second in two nights, the
Diamondbacks beat the Atlanta Braves and pitcher John Smoltz who is
as tough as the stubble of his beard.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks chipped away, coming from behind, on the road
before a sellout crowd. They won the way they have won many games
during this magical season _ with the long ball. Erubiel Durazo
tagged Smoltz for two home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Does Durazo understand how big those two swings were? How much
his heric ccontribution in this 5-4 win means to this team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not at this point in his life,'' Buck Showalter
deadpanned. ``And I'm not going to tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was especially big since San Francisco won in
Pittsburgh. Another Arizona loss would have cut the Diamondbacks
lead in the NL West to ``four'' games. Valley emergency crews would
be talking some fans down off high ledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our fans are a lot more worried than we are,'' Luis
Gonzalez said. The left fielder looked around the clubhouse.
``We've got veteran guys here. We're not panicking at all. You're
going to win a few in a row and lose a few in a row. That's part of
the life of a baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bunch of blue collar guys who play hard every game.
That's all you can ask for. Tonight, we showed the Braves and other
clubs that we're not going to give up at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks give no appearance that their esophagus is
constricted. They look and act like the same easy-going bunch that
that has won 80 games during this turnaround season.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before the first pitch, players strolled into the
visitors clubhouse. They traded hellos. The room came alive with
playful banter. Several players gathered around a big-screen TV and
watched the first half of the Michigan-Notre Dame football game.
Decked out in a Michigan sweatshirt and cap, which he wore backward
like a catcher, Brian Butterfield jumped to his feet, as if
electrically stimulated. `'First down!'' he cried. The third base
coach signaled like a game official with his hand. ````That''
way!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Butter,'' Gonzo called out. A grin spread across his long
angular face. ``You look a little intense. Loosen up!''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else appeared relaxed. Seated on opposite couches, Todd
Stottlemyre and Greg Colbrunn tossed a baseball back and forth
during commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey played with his son. Showalter's face lights up
when he tells how Jaelen Gilkey walked up to him and said, ``Buck
Showalter, sign me up!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old thought a moment.
</P>
<P>
   `'Fifty dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What position you want to play?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he would work on it. The problem, of course, is
finding a place for the kid in his staff. The manager has a
strikeout artist in Randy Johnson, who will start against Tom
Glavine Sunday. D-backs relievers shined again in this game. Greg
Swindell worked two hitless innings in relief of Andy Benes. And
Matt Mantei struck out the side in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Worry? You don't feel it in the clubhouse. You don't see it in
the youthful faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me? I'm pretty much the same every time I go out,'' Mantei
said. The closer grinned and put lyrics to the music of his pitch.
``Here's a fastball,'' he said. ``Hit it.'' &QL;

THROWN FOR LOSS BY JIM CROW  
 IN '40S, BLACKS FROM ASU FELT PAIN OF RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The bumpy, three-hour flight to Kansas made
George Diggs and Morrison Warren feel like dice inside a
crapshooter's grip. They strolled near their Wichita hotel to clear
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State football players knew something was wrong when
they returned to the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't those our bags?'' Diggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we already checked in,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're yours,'' the desk clerk said. ``We don't allow Negroes
in our hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was humiliating,'' Warren said recently of the 1946 trip to
Wichita State. That evening, a hotel porter had to drive the two
players, who are now brothers-in-law, to a hotel for Blacks.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-century later, he and Diggs remember it with
clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Baggage was a recurring theme during their careers at what was
then Arizona State College at Tempe, the baggage of being
African-American athletes when so few dotted college football's
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Their memories of those days are stirred because of Monday's
first-ever meeting between ASU and Texas Tech at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although these teams shared Border Conference residency from
1933 to 1955, they never met. The Jim Crow laws that legalized
segregation between Blacks and Whites were one reason. And by the
1950s, when most color barriers fell, the schools lost interest in
playing one another. ASU has had Black football players since 1937,
when pioneer Emerson Harvey took the field, and the Sun Devils were
strongly encouraged by Texas schools to leave those athletes home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt terrible,'' Diggs said, ``to not be able to go with
your teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue came to a head in a 1947 game against Texas College of
Mines, which is now Texas-El Paso. The school told Arizona State
that its two African-American players, standout running backs
Warren and Diggs, shouldn't come.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's administration debated the issue. If the two made the
trip, they would have been forced to eat and sleep apart from their
teammates. Safety was a concern.
</P>
<P>
   The ``El Paso Herald-Post'' quoted ASU Coach Eddie Doherty as
saying that if ``Morrison and his 200 pounds collided with a Mines
player and injured the Mines player, some of the more hot-headed
fans might stream out of the stands and attempt a lynching in
Southern style.''
</P>
<P>
   The players stayed home and their team lost, 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devasted,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad,'' Diggs said. ``We were part of the team and
wanted to be there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Their teammates were equally appalled. Both players were popular
on the team, not only because of their football skills but because
they were likable and classroom standouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really upset a lot of the guys that they couldn't go with
us,'' teammate Wilford (Whizzer) White said. ``They were really
great guys and great players. It hurt us on the field, too.
Morrison was our fullback, a good one, and Diggs was a good little
running back.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Onofrio, an assistant coach at the time, said: ``The team was
all for keeping everyone together. It didn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't to Diggs and Warren, who had spent several
years fighting for their country in World War II. Ironically, a
pre-Armistice Day celebration was held at halftime of the Mines
game in memory of soldiers killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ASU takes stand &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Mines experience not only upset the team, but the ASU
student body. It was the driving force behind the Arizona State
College Athletic Council's 1947 declaration that the school would
schedule games only against opponents that allowed all of ASU's
players to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stand ASU took was ad vertised in the Black press
throughout the country and that reflected quite well on ASU,'' said
Warren, 75, who received a doctorate at ASU and was a professor of
school administration and supervision there for many years. ``It
was quite a move on the part of this little teachers college. This
was during a time when Eastern teams were told not to bring their
Black players to the Cotton Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren has spent much of his life confronting racism. He moved
to Phoenix when he was 2 from Marlin, Texas, because his family
didn't want their children reared there.
</P>
<P>
   He attended a segregated school, Phoenix Union Colored High
School, and was forced to sit in the Negro sections of movie
theaters. He had been refused admittance at restaurants. When he
played football at Phoenix College in 1941 and 1942, before he
joined the service, he was not allowed to play against New Mexico
Military Institute at Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   He endured, he said, because of great support from both Phoenix
College and ASU. That wasn't always the case with opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go to areas where there would be difficulty on the
field,'' he said. ``It was the first experience for many people. If
I would tackle them, sometimes I might hear `Nigger.' But I also
made some great friendships on the other side of the ball, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude of the Texas schools worked against them when they
came to play in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   White said: ``When those teams would come here, it was really a
boost for us. We didn't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Texas schools began showing less resistance,
Texas Tech and ASU never scheduled games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When others were breaking the color barrier, Texas Tech
continued to hard line,'' said Bill Quinn, an ASU assistant coach
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kelley, an all-conference wide receiver from Texas Tech's
1948 team, said race was never an issue with his teammates and he
never heard an edict from the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave it a thought,'' he said. ``I really believe race
was never brought up by our administration. We competed against
Arizona State in other sports, and I remember running track against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I do believe a Black person is just as American
as Bill Kelley. I always thought the racial thing was blown out of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrier broken in '37 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Race was first an issue with the ASU football team in 1937, when
Harvey, a standout athlete from Sacramento, became a member. Tom
Lillico, ASU's new graduate manager of athletics at the time, found
Harvey working at a Walgreen's in San Francisco and encouraged him
to come to Arizona State Teachers College.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dean Smith's book, ``The Sun Devils, Eight Decades
of'' ``Arizona State Football,'' his teammates initially had mixed
reactions about his presence.
</P>
<P>
   But after Coach Rudy Lavik promoted him to starting blocking
back and defensive end, his skills convinced everyone he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   The football team encountered isolated cases of discrimination
down the road. When the 1951 team traveled to Arkansas, it stopped
at several restaurants before finding one that would serve both its
White and Black athletes.
</P>
<P>
   That's how both group of athletes wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both (Warren and Diggs) were very well-liked,'' Williams said.
``After college, when Morrison went to play professional football,
I wrote my family in Boston and said, `You've got to meet this guy
after a game and invite him to dinner. He's terrific.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although the names of Diggs, Warren and Harvey may not be as
ensconced in ASU lore as firmly as some, one ASU player said they
shouldn't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all athletes here, African-American or Caucasian,
should remember how fortunate we are that there were players like
that who paved the way,'' ASU senior cornerback Courtney Jackson
said. ``They stood for what they believed in. We should all be
proud.'' &QL;

STATE CALLING PLAYS ON STADIUM  
 CARDINALS HOPE `REGIONAL PARTNER SHIP' DEVELOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the Cardinals suffered a bitter election defeat
May 18 in Mesa's vote on a new stadium, team officials were
emphatic about one thing: They had no Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the team let the controversial Rio Salado Crossing
election debate die down, waiting for a glimmer of leadership from
somewhere in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That leadership quietly has emerged from the office of Gov. Jane
Hull, where officials have spent the summer evaluating information
from the Cardinals and the National Football League on the
public-private partnerships that have played a key role in
construction of more than 250 stadiums, arenas, performing arts
centers and convention centers built in North American this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards, the NFL and the governor's office hope a creative
proposal can be crafted that soon would give the team hope of
leaving aged Sun Devil Stadium and the ranks of NFL economic
have-nots, and give the Valley hope of luring more Super Bowls,
keeping the Fiesta Bowl in the upper echelon of bowls and luring
other major sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust is settled, and we look forward to progress over the
coming weeks,'' said Michael Bidwill, Cardinals vice president who
led the Rio Salado Crossing effort. ``It's becoming progressively
more difficult for the Cardinals to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they lack the revenue streams being generated for NFL
teams in a wave of new stadiums across the land, the Cardinals are
conservative financially. And because they lack a
climate-controlled stadium, they have difficulty attracting fans to
Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only team in the league that has trouble selling
half of our 50-yard line and 45-yard line seats,'' Bidwill said,
referring to the sunny, east side of the stadium. ``It's hard when
you can't move your inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals want a retractable roof stadium with a grass
field, and Bidwill said he still likes the design of the $497
million stadium proposed for the Rio Salado Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   It featured 67,000 seats and was expandable for the Super Bowl.
A new stadium would open revenue streams for the Cardinals from
suites, club seats, advertising signs, scoreboards, naming rights
and concessions that are limited at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill and others say the team learned a lesson in the Mesa
vote: An NFL stadium project is too much for one community to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa voters rejected, 60 percent to 40 percent, a proposed sales
tax increase for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Horrow, an NFL stadium consultant, said what is needed now
is a ``regional partnership.'' That is what Bidwill and the state
hope to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now in the control of leadership in more of a larger
jurisdiction, the state,'' Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   George Weisz, an executive assistant to Hull, said state
officials are reviewing various concepts and hope to make progress
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   No specific plan has emerged, but all the parties agree some
public participation will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   None of the new or remodeled stadiums in the NFL has been built
without some public support _ be it infrastructure, land or a
financing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, communications director for the NFL, said the
public can't expect the Cards to finance a stadium alone and run a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's economically unfeasible for an NFL owner to both finance
a stadium and operate a team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello also reiterated that the NFL will put the Super Bowl back
in the Valley if a new stadium is built.
</P>
<P>
   As new stadiums pop up around the league, the rich get richer
and the Cardinals find it harder to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Tennessee opened stadiums this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, Detroit, Pittsburgh, New England, Seattle and Denver
will be in new stadiums in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, San Diego, St. Louis, Oakland, Tampa Bay, Atlanta and
Jacksonville already are in new or remodeled stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   None was built solely by the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league and the various NFL cities have a long track record
of public-private partnership,'' Bidwill said. ``There is a
recognition by communities that it is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill said the Cardinals will make a significant financial
contribution to whatever proposal comes forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we want to remain in Arizona,'' he
said. ``We are working with the governor's office and are hopeful
that something can come together for the Cards, the Fiesta Bowl and
the community.'
</P>
<P>
   Horrow said the league is monitoring the situation and hoping
for a ``very creative solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of these deals in the '90s to some degree absolutely
requires a public-private partnership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearer than ever that the Cardinals need a new facility.
The league is following the situation closely and is dedicated to
working with the Cardinals and doing anything necessary to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrow said the Cardinals have become a ``have-not'' team
economically and are at a ``tremendous disadvantage competitively''
because of Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this effort has to move forward in a meaningful way
consistent with every other community that has come up with a Plan
B,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened in places such as Pittsburgh, where local tax
hikes were rejected by voters, but the state later stepped in and
devised a financing plan, Horrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Steelers will be on their way to playing in a new
stadium while the Cardinals still wait. &QL;

Comets' coronation delayed New York's long shot 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A little man wheeling the WNBA trophy was already on
the floor amid descending confetti when New York Liberty guard
Teresa Weatherspoon took her shot.
</P>
<P>
   With fourth-tenths of a second remaining, she put her practice
to the test when she let fly a desperation,
don't-even-bother-hailing-Mary 52-foot shot to win Game 2 of the
WNBA Finals, 68-67, over the Houston Comets. The victory forced a
decisive Game 3 at 2:30 p.m. today in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After Houston's Tina Thompson hit the apparent
championship-winning shot with 2.3 seconds remaining, Weatherspoon
took the inbounds pass, dribbled twice and took two steps near
midcourt and the sideline. She arched a one-handed shot that banked
off the glass and through the net, leaving the sellout crowd of
16,285 silent and WNBA dignitaries stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it left my hands I knew it was good,'' said Weatherspoon,
who finished with eight points, six rebounds and five assists. ``I
practice that shot after every practice, and every now and then I
hit it. I was just praying it would go in.'' .
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most heartbreaking loss I've been through,''
Houston coach Van Chancellor said. ``When Tina hit her shot I
thought we had a pretty good shot, but I didn't think she \R
Weatherspoon\S would hit a prayer. That shot wasn't the only thing
that beat us. Giving up 45 points in the second half did. We can't
give up 13 offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, which scored just two points in the first 10:24 of
the game, shot 30 percent and committed 10 turnovers in the first
half and trailed by 14 points at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't buy a basket, but I was getting shots,'' Liberty
guard Crystal Robinson said. ``Coach told me at halftime, `Keep
shooting, Crystal, you're a shooter and eventually they'll start to
fall.''' After shooting 1-for-6 in the first half, she scored
18-second half points on 5-of-5 shooting, including three
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes, who combined for 44
points in the Game 1 victory, were all but shut down in the second
half, shooting a combined 2-for-14 and scoring 13 points. The
Liberty went on a 19-3 run to take their first lead with 11:33
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets regained the lead and led by nine before New York
answered with a 9-0 run. Houston led by four with 3:54 remaining
before Kym Hampton's personal 5-0 run made it a one-point game with
less than one minute remaining The lead changed hands several times
after that before the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the intensity to win this game. We have to
match their intensity in the second half; that's our goal,'' Cooper
said. ``But, man, I can't believe she hit that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither could the man wheeling out the trophy. \Nsubheds:Briefly
In losing their first home playoff game ever and only their eighth
home game in 53 games, the Big Three for the Comets _ Tina
Thompson, Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes _ disappeared . In the
playoffs the trio had been averaging 48.1 points, more than 12
rebounds and 13 assists per game. In Game 2, they were limited to
41 points on 8-of-31 shooting with nine assists. ... Yesterday's
loss was Houston's first at home this season when leading at the
half. The Comets had been 15-0. ... Early in the second half,
Thompson caught an elbow near her right eye from New York's Sue
Wicks while going for a rebound. Thompson's right eye caught a
Wicks elbow, leaving Thompson on the floor for sometime. She
suffered a small bruise under her right eye that required a
bandage, but she returned to the game a few minutes later. ...
After losing Game 1, 73-60, New York coach Richie Adubato was
critical of one thing: officiating. The Comets went to the line 14
more times than the Liberty. He was fined $1,500 for his critiques.
In the news conference after yesterday's win, Adubato was reticent:
``I am not complaining about the foul line today ... even though it
was 42-22.'' That was the disparity between the number of foul
shots taken by the Comets compared to New York.

DE LA HOYA STRATEGY: TELL ANYTHING BUT TRUTH  
 AIM IS TO KEEP TRINIDAD CLUELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a business where deception is both an art form and a survival
skill, Oscar De La Hoya is an honest man.
</P>
<P>
   He lies.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya wasn't throwing any rhetorical feints last week when
he talked about his plans for Felix Trinidad on Sept. 18 in their
much-anticipated welterweight clash at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what I'm going to do inside the ring,'' De La
Hoya said in a conference call. ``I'm telling one person one thing,
another person another thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever comes out of my mouth about a strategy, it's all a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's frank comment about an ancient, even honored
practice was yet another example of a personality that often
appears to be at odds with a code as old as a jagged scar. Fighters
were lying before the CIA launched its first disinformation
campaign. It's just that nobody ever admits it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, De La Hoya always says and does things that
surprise, annoy, amuse and confuse. He's a mamma's boy with a mean
streak.
</P>
<P>
   With his Hollywood looks, he doesn't like to get hit, and pity
the fool who hits him. Ike Quartey discovered as much when a
seemingly beaten De La Hoya overwhelmed him late in their 12-round
fight with a last stand that was a mix of desperation and
determination.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dangerous combination, simply because nobody can ever be
certain when one or both will show up.
</P>
<P>
   As the opening bell for a fight with the potential to be among
the best in a decade approaches, the tide of ringside opinion is
swinging in favor of Trinidad, who last week predicted a
sixth-round knockout of De La Hoya as he broke camp in Puerto Rico
and headed for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It began to move in that direction a few weeks ago when
respected trainer Emanuel Steward, a former De La Hoya cornerman,
said Trinidad would win. Predictably, Steward created a bandwagon
that is getting very crowded. Steward said he told De La Hoya,
face-to-face, of his pick when the two had a chance encounter near
the fighter's training camp at Big Bear, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Steward explained his reasoning by saying that De La Hoya, the
World Boxing Council's unbeaten champion (31-0, 25 KOs), had too
many distractions. He plays golf, is getting married, just had a
child, fired a longtime adviser in Mike Hernandez and is trying to
become a mariachi singer.
</P>
<P>
   By Steward's way of thinking, Trinidad, the unbeaten
International Boxing Federation champion (35-0, 30 KOs), is more
devoted to his craft. While De La Hoya learns how to sing, Trinidad
is in the ring. That, at least, is the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their own opinion,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's
just sad people who know who I am and know what I can do will go
with the other guy. It shows what kind of person that is.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, Steward might have been doing De La Hoya a very
big favor. He sounded an alarm for a fighter who a year ago was
listed among ``Fortune'' magazine's top-earning athletes, with $37
million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By De La Hoya's own admission, there have been distractions.
Wealth buys a lot of them. He looked disinterested and often sloppy
in May before scoring an 11th-round stoppage of Oba Carr with a
sprained left hand that was virtually useless after the first
couple of rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this is a major fight, I'm hungry again,'' De La Hoya
said. ``After you've been through as much as I have been, you seem
to worry less about boxing. But this fight has made me re-focus. I
feel like the hungry fighter I was a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had lost some of his passion for the sport
since victories in two confrontations with his boyhood idol, Julio
Cesar Chavez, De La Hoya said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of a re-dedicated De La Hoya can't be a source of much
comfort to the Trinidad camp.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who really knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to say different things is just a matter of confusing
my opponent,'' De La Hoya said. ``To me, that's playing it smart.''
</P>
<P>
   To everybody else, it's De La Hoya playing a role that, on Sept.
18, might be worth an Oscar. &QL;

UA TRIES TO BOUNCE BACK AGAINST TCU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas - Arizona Coach Dick Tomey calls last week's
debacle at Penn State ``a measuring stick.'' For a man always in
search of progress, there wasn't much to measure. But Tomey clearly
used the stick.
</P>
<P>
   He used it on himself as a verbal lash in accepting
responsibility for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   And he used it on his team as he tried to prepare for today's
game against Texas Christian in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unmistakable sense of urgency in his tone
throughout practices in which he demanded that the Wildcats display
enthusiasm, energy and toughness. Tomey calls it heart, which is
something he also said was missing in Arizona's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst possible scenario, the Wildcats might discover
today that they lack more than just heart.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of cornerback Chris McAlister, offensive linemen
Yusuf Scott and Edwin Mulitalo, receiver Jeremy McDaniel, fullback
Kelvin Eafon and tight end Mike Lucky also might have stripped them
of more skill than they had realized.
</P>
<P>
   It probably would be premature to say all that after only one
game, no matter how one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   But overrated? Without a doubt. Penn State's whipping of Arizona
wiped away poll-created illusions that the Wildcats were one of the
nation's top five teams.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question involves the very identity of this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not very good right now, I do know that,'' said Bruce
Wiggins, the starting center. ``It's the truth. If I can't admit
it, we'll never get better.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who are these guys? Are they still a top 20 team? The
pollsters apparently think so. The Wildcats fell from No. 4 to No.
15 this week in the Associated Press. Are they still a favorite to
win the Pac-10? If you believe the polls, you have to think they
are. The Wildcats still are the highest-rated team in a conference
without contenders.
</P>
<P>
   For TCU, another date with a team from an apparently weak
conference has to be good news. The Horned Frogs ended last season
with an upset of Southern California in the Sun Bowl. TCU has to
hope it is picking up where it left off.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it's safe to assume that TCU looked at the Penn State
game films and put together a plan that will test Arizona's weak
defensive corners.
</P>
<P>
   In receiver-turned-quarterback Patrick Batteaux and tailback
LaDainian Tomlinson, the Horned Frogs have an option attack with at
least two runners who can get to the corners quickly. It would seem
that Arizona has an ideal counter with a defense that stopped
Nebraska's option in December's Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can quit looking at the highlights of last season,''
said Tomey, who might be looking for a shovel to replace that
measuring stick if the Wildcats stumble today. &QL;

WNBA EXPANSION DRAFT TO COME EARLY THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The all important details of the third WNBA expansion
draft remain a mystery, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   League President Val Ackerman said Saturday that the draft to
begin stocking Seattle, Portland, Indianapolis and Miami will be
held in December.
</P>
<P>
   That's two months sooner than the 1998 expansion draft when
Detroit and Washington joined the league and four months before
Minnesota and Orlando selected players from the existing teams in
April. The '99 expansion draft was especially late because of
collective bargaining negotiations with the new players union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you read right now is speculation,'' regarding the
number of players teams will be allowed to protect from the
expansion teams, Ackerman said. ``We have to make a judgment as to
how do we best balance the need to make our expansion teams
reasonably competitive and yet give the exisiting teams the
benefits of all their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that we will try and be very fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rampant that teams will be allowed to protect fewer
players than in the first two expansion drafts (six) and lose more
than one.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said she does not know if enough quality players will
sign with the league to allow it to stock the expansion teams with
at least one allocated player before the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some newcomers (Teresa Edwards, Katrina McClain,
Katy Steading among some of the former American Basketball League
players who did not immediately move to the WNBA) who weren't with
us and to some degree we have to figure out what their relationship
might be to the expansion teams,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of ABL players who went unpicked in the WNBA draft
and some WNBA veterans who lost jobs, like the Mercury's Umeki
Webb, also could come into play with the expansion teams before the
annual draft in April.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman also said the 2000 season, to begin 10 days to two
weeks earlier because to accomodate the Sydney Olympics, will
conclude with eight teams (four per conference) in the playoffs
that will expand to best-of-3 in every round.
</P>
<P>
   This season, six of 12 teams (three per conference) made the
playoffs with each conference champion having a first-round bye and
the No. 2-3 teams meeting in a single game.
</P>
<P>
   A site for the 2000 All-Star Game will be named this fall,
Ackerman said, ``in a city that has the prospect of getting
incredible fan support.''
</P>
<P>
   New York hosted the first All-Star Game, and the leading
candidates for the sequel are Houston, Phoenix and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman rates the chances of franchise relocation for 2000 as
unlikely, meaning that teams lagging in attendance (Charlotte at
7,081 per game and Utah at 7,544 in particular) are safe for at
least another season. &QL;

MIRACLE SHOT KEEPS LIBERTY ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If it takes a miracle to dethrone the Houston Comets,
the New York Liberty was the recipient of a major one Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When a prayer from several steps beyond midcourt went in for
Teresa Weatherspoon as the buzzer sounded and premature celebration
of a Comets WNBA championship three-peat went off, delirium at the
sold-out Compaq Center turned to disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had never lost a home playoff game, much less one it
led, 17-2, at the outset and 37-23 at halftime. Or 67-65 with 2.4
seconds left after a tough nine-foot bank shot that Tina Thompson
stuck over Crystal Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The banker that counted more, though, was the 47-foot heave by
Weatherspoon, perhaps the greatest shots in U.S. women's basketball
history.
</P>
<P>
   Only the 19-foot game winner by North Carolina's Charlotte Smith
in the 1994 NCAA Final compares, with bonus points for being in a
title game. The Liberty (21-16) only pulled even in the
best-of-three Finals. Game 3 is at 12:30 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to look for anyone, I was going to live or die
with the shot,'' said Weatherspoon, New York's point guard and
spiritual leader known more for her defense. ``I'd rather put it on
my shoulders than to see one of my teammates have to take that
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the Liberty had used all its timeouts, Weatherspoon
immediately took an inbounds from Becky Hammon and dribbled twice
vs. Thompson, who waved a hand at her as she let fly New York's
last chance to avenge its 1997 Finals loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?,'' Thompson screamed as the Liberty mobbed Weatherspoon
and the surreal finish sank in.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon, 33, a native of Texas, said she never had made a
shot ``to this magnitude.'' New York's Richie Adubato, 60, said he
has lost a half-dozen games in his 38-year coaching career on such
buckets, but never had won one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we work on that shot every day and it finally
won a game for us,'' Adubato said. He wasn't kidding. Weatherspoon,
Hammon and others hang around after practice with the assistant
coaches to pretend and dream of winning games just the way it went
down on national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to go shower so we can get out of there,'' Adubato
said. ``Now I'm glad I told them not to shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston (29-8) couldn't wash off the second half fast enough
after losing at home for only the third time in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mentally the celebration began too soon for the Comets,
who were blitzed, 14-2, coming out of intermission, then rebuilt a
52-43 lead only to let that get away in the final 9:10.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty forward Crystal Robinson, 1 for 6 at halftime, bombed in
18 second-half points while Houston guard Cynthia Cooper went
strangely silent (0 for 6 in the second half with just three free
throws).
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the three-time league scoring champion, had 29 points
Thursday in a 73-60 Game 1 win at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play in the second half and when you don't play, you
don't win,'' Cooper said. ``But we are the two-time champions and
I'll tell you what, we know what it takes to win. We're going to
come back here (today) and have what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' defense-driven, first-half dominance disguised some
problems: 37.5 percent shooting that dropped to 30 percent for the
game and a 21-15 rebound deficit that ended 34-28. Houston also
missed 10 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   New York received a stabilizing 10-point, 15-minute performance
from Hammon, a rookie guard. And 36-year-old Kym Hampton, in what
could have been her final game before retirement, came up with a
near double-double (10 points/nine rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   A Hampton three-pointer followed by a 15-footer gave the Liberty
a 63-62 lead at 1:24. Houston's Sheryl Swoopes drove to the basket,
was fouled by Hampton and made both free throws at 1:05.
</P>
<P>
   Off a Cooper steal, Thompson drove, was fouled by Sue Wicks and
made one free throw for a 65-63 lead with 28.4 seconds left. Then
after a timeout, Robinson pulled up to hit an 18-footer at 16.3.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson then answered that basket with her nine-footer, only
for Weatherspoon to have the final word. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - From age 5, she would run back and forth outside her
family's mobile home in Litchfield Park. Faster and faster each
time, arms unfurled behind her, she seemed to believe if she ran
fast enough she could fly.
</P>
<P>
   She's been running ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Now 14, the hazel-eyed girl who has spent much of her life in
foster care has become a living symbol of the national debate over
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge gave her
permission to travel to Kansas for a late-term abortion. She went
last week, and presumably had the procedure. She was 24 weeks
along.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows her decision. It was dissected and debated by
people who never knew her and likely never will.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows the girl. She has been lost in the legal
maneuvering to block the abortion and the second-guessing over
whether she was old enough to make the choice.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of her turbulent life emerges through interviews with
family members, people who know her both now and as a younger
child, and from court and police records.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic is not using her name because she is a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the girl is very bright. Tests she took in
eighth grade indicated that she was smart enough to be in high
school, her family says. She loves to read and talks of being a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's no dummy,'' says Sandy Harper, the fiancee of James
Harkins, the girl's maternal uncle. ``She's far from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper has known the girl since the days she made those laps
alongside the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   When the girl was 7, she played with Barbie dolls that were
missing an arm, a leg or even a head, but she didn't seem to mind,
says Lori Murphy Lane, who was the girl's neighbor at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The girl has a thing for fairies and gnomes, say those who know
her. And she likes to dance.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to be a normal kid with a normal family, says a
father whose children attended a West Valley charter school with
the girl.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the school while living in a Glendale group home
last year and part of this year. The girl quickly became a favorite
of parents and teachers, who said they worried about what she had
been through, and what was coming next.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one couple from the school even filed for
guardianship of the girl, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   They want her to stop running. They want to give her a home. &QL; 
LIFETIME OF HARDSHIP &QL; 
The girl, just 14, has lived through enough hardship for a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   She's been moved from foster home to foster home since she was
8.
</P>
<P>
   Her father has never been around, rarely seeing the girl and not
paying any child support, family members say. She was taken from
her mother after she ran away from home and refused to return,
claiming abuse, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In January, her mother was found stabbed to death near Glendale
Municipal Airport, the first homicide of the new year in the
Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is the fourth of her mother's eight children. The
others are scattered. One was adopted, one is in prison, two live
with their father and two are in foster homes. One died of sudden
infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was just a little thing, maybe 4 or 5, when Lane first
met her at their Litchfield Park trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   She says she watched what went on in the little girl's house
with horror.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother and the mother's boyfriend used drugs,
according to Lane, the mother's family and police reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, they done it,'' says Lane, who now lives in
Maryland with her husband and three sons.
</P>
<P>
   The home was unkempt and infested with roaches. The children
wore tattered secondhand clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always asking why my house was always clean and her
house looked like a pigpen,'' Lane says. ``I told her it was
because her mother was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane says she would wash the girl's hair, carefully picking out
the lice and their eggs. She was constantly infected, and the
school sent notices warning other parents. Her classmates teased
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was humiliating for her,'' Lane says. `It broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl would come to Lane's house when her mother wasn't at
home. Lane says the child was afraid of her mother's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Lane says the mother's boyfriend often abused the kids, hitting
them often enough and hard enough that she and other neighbors
called state Child Protective Services and the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was petrified to go to that house,'' Lane says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the girl told police that was why she ran away from
home in early January: She didn't want another beating, according
to news reports at the time.
</P>
<P>
   She left on a Sunday afternoon, hiding out in a cardboard box in
the desert behind an apartment complex, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane went looking for the girl. She and her son found her lying
in the box, Lane says, her thin legs sticking out of the opening.
She had a blanket and candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired of him doing what he is doing to me,'' Lane says
the girl told her.
</P>
<P>
   Lane persuaded her not to stay in the box, but the little girl
didn't go home, and her mother did not report her missing until she
was gone for 13{ hours, news reports said. Sheriff's deputies found
her at a friend's house on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and her mother's boyfriend were never charged with
child abuse, news reports said, though the girl has been in the
state's care ever since. &QL; 
REGULAR RUNAWAY &QL; 
This would not be the first time the girl ran away.
</P>
<P>
   She bolted regularly from the state's care, sometimes to look
for her mother, says Harper, her uncle's fiancee. At times, she got
as far as California, Oregon and Utah. Her flight record is such
that the judge ruled that she could be handcuffed on the way to get
- and even during _ the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She puts that little thumb out, and she's gone,'' Harper says.
</P>
<P>
   One place she didn't run from was the charter school she
attended while living in the Glendale group home. There, she
developed close relationships with kids and their parents, the
parents say.
</P>
<P>
   The girl went to church with one family, asking a lot of
questions about God and the Bible, the parents say. Her mother had
been a Wiccan, a group of self-titled ``witches'' who worship
nature, the parents and family members say.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had a Wicca book that belonged to her mother, according
to a police report. In June 1998, a staff member tried to take the
book from her.
</P>
<P>
   The staffer told police she was worried that the girl was
teaching other girls about witchcraft. During the confrontation,
the girl threw herself against a wall, punching a 10- by 10-inch
hole.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged with criminal damage and taken to Durango
Juvenile Detention Center in handcuffs, the police report says. She
was later released.
</P>
<P>
   The girl ran away from the same group home on Christmas Eve of
1998, the parents say, because staffers would not let her visit her
family. She went to see them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Her relatives bought her a few CDs and some clothes and gave her
some cash, family members say, and then she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't show back up at the group home until Jan. 4, about
two hours before her mother's body was found. &QL; 
MOM'S KILLER NOT FOUND &QL; 
Things had gotten worse for the girl's mother after her children
were taken by the state. Already pregnant with her youngest, she
tried to get her life together, her family says.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed sober for more than a year, turning in clean urine
samples to the state regularly, Harper says.
</P>
<P>
   But when she didn't get her kids back after some time, she went
back to her old ways, Harper says. Her killer has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   A CPS caseworker brought the girl to the funeral, where her
mother's body lay on a gurney, covered only by a sheet. Dried blood
was caked in her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just horrified the whole family,'' Harper says. ``Even
the adults.''
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the girl was taken back to school.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, she ran again.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Jan. 16 police report, staff at the group home
told police the girl was despondent over her mother's death and
threatening suicide when she left. The girl did not say where she
was going, only that ``I will know where I am when I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   She was picked up by police in early February and put in Durango
again. When she got out, she was moved to another group home.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the girl's maternal uncles, Bob Harkins and James
Harkins, want the girl to be allowed to live with them.
</P>
<P>
   James Harkins and his fiancee, Sandy Harper, manage an apartment
complex in Glendale. Bob Harkins lives with his girlfriend and
their 9-month-old baby in a four-bedroom house in the West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   For a time last year, the girl was allowed to visit her family
on the weekends. Then, in August of 1998, she was allowed to stay
with Bob Harkins for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But she ran again.
</P>
<P>
   She took off on Aug. 18, the first night of what was supposed to
be the weeklong visit. When Bob Harkins asked where she was going,
she said, ``I'm taking a boat to China.'' Her uncle called police
and CPS to report her missing, her family says.
</P>
<P>
   The girl needs close supervision, her family says. She lies
some. Last time Bob Harkins saw her _ about four or five months ago
_ she had short, purple hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to whap her upside her head,'' he says. ``She's
a kid, but she thinks she's an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Harkins thinks he can handle her, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no choice but to behave around me or I'll whup on her
butt or set her in her room,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was already pregnant the last time her family saw her,
Harper says. Her uncles wanted her to keep the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `If you want to keep this baby, we can do it
together as a family,' '' Harper says.
</P>
<P>
   But the girl didn't stick around.
</P>
<P>
   She was picked up on May 7 after giving false information about
who she was to a police officer, police reports say. Taken aside by
another officer, she confessed she was homeless and pregnant. She
was taken back to Durango.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that she first told state officials that she wanted
an abortion. She was granted permission but ran again and _ by the
time she returned late last month _ she was nearly six months
along. &QL; 
NEWS LEAKED TO MEDIA &QL; 
On Aug. 24, news of the court's order allowing the girl to travel
out of state to have a late-term abortion was leaked to the media.
It set off nearly two weeks of political and legal maneuvering to
stop the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order was upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court, and
she traveled to Kansas last week, where she reportedly underwent
the two- to three-day procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police are attempting to determine the identity of the
father of the girl's fetus. Though the girl is not cooperating with
the investigation, investigators have requested a sample from the
fetus to establish paternity, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect the father is a man in his early 20s, so any
sexual contact with the girl _ who would have been 13 at the time _
would constitute a sexual assault under Arizona law, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the alleged father, the girl wrote, ``I'm
pregnant. I mean, I'm really pregnant. You're the only person it
could have been.'' And she asks for $700 for an abortion. The
girl's family gave the letter and an address book belonging to the
girl to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's hungry for someone to take care of her and love her and
nurture her,'' Harper says. ``With their heart, not with any other
part of their body.''
</P>
<P>
   She is eager for the girl's return.
</P>
<P>
   Harper has the girl's Bible, the cover done in cross-stitch by
her grandmother, who died about five years ago. Inside is the
message, ``On the occasion of her third Christmas, December 25,
1987, My little ladybug, I love you very much. Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper keeps it by the girl's mother's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to take her in my arms,'' Harper says, ``and tell
her we'll get through this together.'' &QL;

CHOUINARD RELAXES, REGISTERS BIG YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Perhaps the biggest improvement among the Diamondbacks
over last season has been by right-handed middle reliever  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard, 0-2 with a 4.23 ERA in 26 games for Arizona last
season, is 5-2 with a 2.10 ERA in 22 games in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I sound like a broken record, but it's all about
confidence, trusting myself,'' he said. ``Last year, my slider was
a little loopy, but now I have the confidence that I can throw it
in just about any count to a right-hander, or I can come back with
my sinker, change-up or curve to a lefty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to try not to get into a pattern. You don't want
the hitter to know what you're going to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is staying within yourself. I was overthrowing a lot
last year, trying to impress people with stuff I didn't have. I'd
like to throw 100 mph like  &UR; Randy Johnson, but I can't. So I have
to try to get the guy out with the best stuff I have. Just so long
as you get the out, that's what counts.'' &QL; 
Anderson on target &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After picking up a victory last Sunday and retiring all six men
he faced against the Braves on Friday night, left-hander  &UR; Brian
 &UR; Anderson seems to be settling into his role in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between now and the first time I was in the
bullpen is my mechanics. And I've got more innings under my belt,''
he said. ``Before, my mechanics were all over the place. Everything
seemed foreign to me. I'm more comfortable.'' &QL; 
Scouting search continues &QL;
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola  &UR; Jr. said the interview process
is near completion in the club's search for a new scouting
director.
</P>
<P>
   Nine candidates have been interviewed, some from within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a matter of seeing if we want to bring anybody back,
or if we have enough information,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola hopes to have a person in place no later than the
first week of November, when the scouting directors have their
annual meetings, and so the new person can review and meet with his
staff. &QL; 
When the boss speaks . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola, a graduate of Notre Dame, was asked whether he made
any wagers with a few members of the club who are Michigan fans on
Saturday's college football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I just walked through the clubhouse and said, `All of you
with one-year contracts, let's hear a little more enthusiasm (for
the Fighting Irish),' '' said Garagiola, whose alma mater put up a
good battle but lost. &QL; 
Short stop &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the Diamondbacks have struck out 18 times against the
Braves in the first two games of this series, they still will need
to average about 13 over their remaining 26 games to match last
season's 1,239, which led the major leagues. &QL;

AGGIES' OFFENSE SIZZLES, THEN SAGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. _ Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum was eager] to see
the 1999 debut of an offense that he felt had more capability than
at any time since Bucky Richardson ran 400-point attacks in
1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, it's doubtful he'll find much more than a
quarter's worth of real pleasure in the sixth-ranked Aggies' 37-17
victory against Louisiana Tech last night before 40,328 at
Independence Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For after posting a 24-point second quarter and rolling up 308
yards in the first half _ 4 yards fewer than last season's game
average _ the A&AMP;M offense sputtered and wheezed much like last
season's just-adequate unit that ranked 91st of 112 teams in NCAA
Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay (45-65-1,
331 yards) was able to spend way too much time on the field in the
second half. And that forced a weary Aggies defense into some
face-saving heroics after the Bulldogs closed to 30-17 on Rattay's
8-yard scoring pass to Delwyn Daigre six minutes into the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Cornelius Anthony led a charge that dropped Bulldogs
tailback John Simon for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-goal at the A&AMP;M
1 with 8:43 to play. Linebacker Brian Gamble thwarted the next
possession with a fumble recovery three minutes later, and
cornerback Jason Webster's interception with 3:47 left finally
sparked the offense into a late response.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Randy McCown found Bethel Johnson for a 12-yard
touchdown pass with 47 seconds left that capped an impressive debut
for the sophomore wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous,'' Anthony said. ``But a team with the type
passing attack they have, once you get them down you have to keep
driving at them. They're just like a boxer who staggers, but you
can't knock him down.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown finished a career-best 17-for-28 passing for 252 yards
and two touchdowns. Johnson caught four passes for 106 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense came out great in the first half,'' McCown said.
``We got a little complacent in the second half. We didn't come out
with the kind of fire we had in the \R30-point\S first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum was more generic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of good things out of this game tonight,'' Slocum
said. ``But we also have a lot of things to work on. A good opening
win.''
</P>
<P>
   In that 24-point second quarter, the Aggies scored 17 points
after drives of 73, 75 and 68 yards, and McCown threw a 23-yard
touchdown pass to Chris Taylor following Dante Hall's 42-yard punt
return.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson helped set up two scores with two leaping catches of
McCown passes. His first acrobatic reception went for 46 yards _
McCown's longest completion of a 12-of-16 half that produced 209
yards. Hall took it in from the 18 for A&AMP;M's initial touchdown and
a 13-3 lead four plays later at 10:28.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who practiced last season but was ineligible as a
partial academic qualifier, also went high to take in a 33-yard
gain with three seconds left in the half to open the door for
Terrence Kitchens' 26-yard field goal and a 30-10 lead on the last
play of the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to have a good game, but I think I can do
better,'' Johnson said. ``I missed some balls I should have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens, a walk-on, opened his career as the replacement for
Russell Bynum by converting the first two field-goal attempts of
his career _ from 50 and 51 yards _ to open A&AMP;M scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's catch gave the Aggies a 20-3 lead at 8:38 of the second
quarter. Louisiana Tech answered with a 70-yard march that ended
with Rattay's 15-yard touchdown pass to Daigre to pull the Bulldogs
to 20-10. But the Aggies' 75-yard reply that featured two McCown
passes to Leroy Hodge for 34 yards re-extended the comfort zone
when fullback Ja'Mar Toombs bulled in from the one with 2:04 left
in the half.
\Nsubheds:EXTRA POINTS Before A&AMP;M kicker Terrance Kitchens kicked
field goals of 50 and 51 yards, the last Aggies field goal from
midfield was by Kyle Bryant against North Texas in 1997. ...
Officials delayed kickoff approximately 20 minutes because of
lightning in a nearby storm cloud, yet they permitted the Tech band
to perform pregame ceremonies while chatting on cell phones and
watching strikes off to the south. ... The Aggies' 30 first-half
points were the most since scoring 34 against Oklahoma in 1997.
Last season, the Aggies' highest halftime total was 14 points
(several times). The Aggies scored more than 30 in a game only
twice last season. ... Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay has earned a
spot as one of college football's top passing quarterbacks, but he
might not even be the best quarterback in his family. Louisiana
Tech was the only school to offer Rattay a scholarship, but younger
brother, John, of Phoenix Desert Vista High School, recently
committed to Tennessee after being the subject of a national
recruiting battle.

TROUBLE WITH ANGELS ON FIELD, NOT IN OF FICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it seemed the Anaheim Angels couldn't possibly sink
any lower, they did. The club that zoomed past Los Angeles and
Baltimore to gain the title of this year's most disappointing and
dysfunctional club watched its manager take the fall for its
players' failings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Terry Collins put his head under the guillotine for the Angels,
who just two months earlier awarded Collins with a two-year
contract extension. Next up is probably General Manger  &UR; Bill
Bavasi, who accepted blame for putting together a bad ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people took as much responsibility as Terry Collins, if
they had one-quarter the integrity he has, this wouldn't have
happened,'' said Angels President  &UR; Tony Tavares, whose own job
security may be on shaky ground these days. ``I don't think (the
players) quit on Terry, they quit on themselves. I've never been
more disappointed in a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who guided the Angels to second-place finishes the past
two years, knew the end was near after Wednesday night's blown lead
and blown tempers when the Angels watched an eighth-inning,
eight-run lead evaporate in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   During the Indians' uprising, a brawl broke out when Anaheim
reliever  &UR; Troy Percival plunked  &UR; David Justice one pitch after
 &UR; Richie
 &UR; Sexson hit a massive three-run home run. All heck broke loose and
after the melee ended, Percival noted that  &UR; Mo Vaughn, who was in
the clubhouse, did not join his teammates during the mostly
uneventful fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got respect for my infielders, they were out there _
( &UR; Gary)
 &UR; DiSarcina, ( &UR; Darin)  &UR; Erstad, ( &UR; Troy)  &UR; Glaus,'' Percival said.
``That's where you learn who the people are on your team who are
standing behind you 100 percent. In the future, you know what guys
will go to battle with you and which ones won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's name was conspicuously omitted. The next day, Vaughn
went into a pair of verbal tirades, filled with plenty of
expletives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to (expletive) hear me,'' Vaughn screamed in full
earshot of everyone in the clubhouse before Thursday's game. ``I've
been telling these (expletive) the same thing all year, keep that
(expletive) out of the papers. Be like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins had a meeting with his players after the game and
realized not one of his concerns had anything to do with baseball,
but rather the petty bickering that has plagued this club all
season. That's when he knew it might be time to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking for the guys, we're pretty much embarrassed and
ashamed with the way we've conducted ourselves,'' said DiSarcina,
arguably the most stand-up of the Angels players. ``Terry deserved
better. You don't realize what your actions can do until something
like this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one sad mess. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
The Florida Marlins budged last week, giving in to first-round
pick &UR; Josh Beckett's demands of not only a major league contract,
but also a $7 million signing bonus, the highest ever for a high
school player. What are the top three signing bonuses ever given to
players in the June draft? &QL; 
Birds dropping &QL; 
Troubles in Southern California aren't the only serious problems
afflicting a major league club. The Baltimore Orioles took some of
their internal problem public last week when General Manager
 &UR; Frank &UR; Wren and Manager  &UR; Ray Miller aired some of their differences
toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the Orioles roster was ``dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in baseball my whole life,'' Miller added. ``I'm a
realist. I know what I've got. I know what the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Miller doesn't think much of the 1999 Orioles. But
Wren, who wanted to fire Miller in April, did not take the same
view of one of the highest-priced and lowest-achieving clubs in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very difficult time justifying that,'' Wren said of
Miller's estimation of the club that leads the American League in
complete games.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's offense ranks fifth in the league in average and the
staff ERA ranks sixth while the club's defense ranks first in the
AL. Orioles owner  &UR; Peter Angelos has not been shy about making
changes. If Miller and Wren are fired, distinct possibilities, it
will mark the fourth managerial change and third in the GM chair in
the past six years for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's contract has an option for next season that must be
exercised within 72 hours of the final game. Regardless of whether
he's fired, Miller has lost his team. Many pitchers regularly
ignore commands from the dugout. One position player recently
blasted Miller loudly as ``incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles' problems don't just lie with management. Center
fielder  &UR; Brady Anderson was severely peeved last week when Miller
asked him to play left field for the first time since 1995, making
room for speedy rookie  &UR; Eugene Kingsale.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has lost a step or two on defense and has started
showing up later than any other player in the clubhouse recently,
has privately drawn the ire of Angelos. Of course, Anderson has
three years remaining on his five-year deal that includes a
no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy about it, but I've been told it's what's best
for the team,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   This entire situation is likely to get worse before it gets
better. &QL; 
Griffey in Gotham? &QL; 
Seattle's  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. thought he was answering an innocent
question: Could he ever see himself in Yankees pinstripes?
</P>
<P>
   Little did the perennial All-Star center fielder know the
firestorm that was about to begin in the Big Apple. The back page
of one of the New York tabloids had a blaring headline that read
``Shea-Hey Kid'' about Griffey's possibly coming to the Mets as a
free agent after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't talking about me playing for the Mets, but if I'd
ever play for the Yankees _ which is no, not as long as  &UR; George
Steinbrenner owns the team,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's disdain for the Yankees boss stems from an incident
when he was 12 years old and his father had just become the club's
left fielder through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Steinbrenner once refused to allow Griffey Jr. on
Yankee Stadium's field during batting practice one day in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steinbrenner sent a security guard to tell my father (that)
George didn't want him on the field, meaning me,'' Griffey said.
``My father had to come and tell me that, but I had heard the guy
anyway. Dad said telling me was the toughest thing he ever had to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, Griffey Jr. remembers  &UR; Graig Nettles' son
was allowed to remain on the field during batting practice. Griffey
insists that even if Steinbrenner apologizes, his stance against
the Yankees will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never stepped on the field in the stadium until I was a
Mariner,'' he said. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Right-handed pitcher  &UR; Matt White signed with Tampa Bay for a record
$10.2 million bonus after he became a loophole free agent shortly
after the 1996 June draft. Just weeks earlier, Diamondbacks first
baseman  &UR; Travis Lee, also a loophole free agent, had set the record
with a $10 million bonus.  &UR; Pat Burrell, top pick of the Phillies
last season, received an $8 million bonus, the largest ever awarded
by a club for a player it drafted. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By the way, October is looking very open: Visit the Web site
for the Los Angeles Dodgers and you learn how to rent Dodger
Stadium for weddings, class reunions, bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs
and, well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Don't even get him started on Taco Bell: Chicago White Sox
pitcher  &UR; Carlos Castillo, whose girth continues to expand with each
passing month, may have given himself away with this comment about
the increasingly disenchanted fans at Comiskey Park: ``When we go
to Burger King or McDonald's, we don't yell at them if our burgers
are not cooked right.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Von Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Right ERA, wrong Maddux: Entering the month,  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Maddux, not brother  &UR; Greg, had the lower ERA of the two siblings.
Mike Maddux, a Dodgers reliever, was 1-1 with 3.00 ERA.  &UR; Greg
Maddux, Atlanta's four-time Cy Young Award winner, was 17-6 with a
3.48 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; That's 22 down, three to go:  &UR; Craig Counsell becomes the last
of the former Marlins to return to Pro Player Stadium when the
Dodgers head to Miami later this week.  &UR; Alex Fernandez,  &UR; Antonio
 &UR; Alfonseca and  &UR; Cliff Floyd are the only remaining members from the
1997 championship club. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cole Liniak, acquired from Boston in the Rod Beck deal, became
the 83rd third baseman to start a game for the Chicago Cubs since
 &UR; Ron Santo's retirement in 1974. That's an average of almost 3.5
third basemen per season.
</P>
<P>
   If history is an indication, then outfielder  &UR; Vernon
 &UR; Wells will have a fine major league career. Last week, Wells became
only the third Toronto player ever to start the season at Class A
and finish in the big leagues, joining  &UR; Dave Stieb and  &UR; Lloyd
Moseby.
</P>
<P>
   History was repeated last weekend when  &UR; Brian Bohanon became the
third Colorado pitcher to throw a complete-game shutout at Coors
Field, beating Philadelphia, 4-0. The others were thrown by  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Thompson in 1996 and  &UR; Roger Bailey in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty Cleveland Indians might have six players reach 100
RBIs.  &UR; Manny Ramirez (139 through Saturday) and  &UR; Roberto
 &UR; Alomar (105) are already there. Next up are  &UR; Richie Sexson (96),
 &UR; Jim
 &UR; Thome (89),  &UR; Harold Baines (87) and  &UR; David Justice (78).
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals lead the majors in strikeouts. They have
nine players who have struck out at least 50 times. Leading that
list are  &UR; Mark McGwire (116) and  &UR; Fernando Tatis (110).
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs have six former members of the 1991 World
Series champion Minnesota Twins.  &UR; Mark Guthrie, who arrived last
week, joins  &UR; Rick Aguilera,  &UR; Gary Gaetti,  &UR; Jeff Reed,  &UR; Dan Serafini
and
 &UR; Kevin Tapani. Of course, Cubs President  &UR; Andy McPhail was the Twins
GM that year. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore owner  &UR; Peter Angelos has authorized serious
negotiations with ace pitcher  &UR; Mike Mussina. The right-handed
All-Star has one year remaining on a three-year, $20.45 million
deal. Expect Mussina to receive a  &UR; Pedro Martinez-type deal, worth
at least $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Jerry Manuel does not want to see it happen, but the
Chicago White Sox will listen to offers for first
baseman/designated hitter  &UR; Frank Thomas this winter. Thomas has
only 15 home runs, a far cry from the slugger who averaged 38.8
home runs over a five-year span from 1993 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Willie McGee's 40-year-old legs still are spry enough to outrun
most major league players. But the one-time NL MVP and World Series
hero is sounding like someone who may be ready to call it a career.
``I'm not concentrating. . . . I know what I'm going to do. I've
answered a lot of questions in my mind this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran  &UR; Frank Pulli, one of the 22 umpires whose resignations
were accepted last week, probably will not be out of a job very
long. Indications are strong that Pulli will be hired by Major
League Baseball in a supervisory capacity for umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals right-hander  &UR; Alan Benes,  &UR; Andy's brother, was
scheduled to make his final rehabilitation assignment outing
Saturday. The Cardinals expect to activate the younger Benes this
week, placing him in the rotation for the final month. He hasn't
pitched in the bigs since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Former Pittsburgh Pirates General Manager  &UR; Ted
 &UR; Simmons is on the verge of being hired by San Diego. Simmons will
take over as vice president for scouting and player development.
The Padres have been through 10 years when few of their drafted
players have made it through the system.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's  &UR; Jim Leyland already has told friends and family that
he will not return to manage the Rockies. This is the third time in
four years Leyland will walk in the middle of a multiyear contract.
Unlike the other times, don't expect him back next year. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; San Francisco Giants: The club that appeared all but out of the
NL West race two weeks ago has put it in high gear lately, having
won 14 of 17 entering a weekend series in Pittsburgh. The primary
reason for the surge has been left fielder  &UR; Barry Bonds, who has
been clubbing home runs at an amazing pace. During the 17-game
stretch, Bonds hit .353 with 14 home runs and 26 RBIs. ``It's why
he's got the title of superstar,'' Manager  &UR; Dusty Baker said. It
would take an incredible run by the Giants to overtake the
Diamondbacks, but this club has made miraculous comebacks in the
past two seasons. ``We understand these are the D-Day games that
will make us or break us,'' second baseman  &UR; Jeff Kent said. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Philadelphia Phillies: Once on the fringe of the wild card
race, the Phillies have seen the bottom drop from their playoff
hopes. Philadelphia entered its weekend series against Cincinnati
having lost seven in a row and 18 of its previous 24 games. The
Phillies were once 13 games over .500 and entered the Reds series
two games over. ``We've got to keep battling,'' Manager  &UR; Terry
Francona said. ``There's no choice. We're still a much better team
than last year. I know the record doesn't reflect it lately, but we
are.'' The Phillies lost 10 games in the standings during August,
going 10-17. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Manager  &UR; Lou Piniella after he was asked to assess the
powerful New York Yankees, who had just finished a three-game sweep
over his Mariners: ``They're a good club. Let's leave it at that.
Beyond that, there's nothing to say _ zilch, zero, nada, whatever
language you want to use.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota pitcher  &UR; Jason Ryan, one of the many rookies on the
Twins, had an amazing revelation recently when the Twins sent him
to an eye doctor. Ryan discovered he had difficulty seeing the
catcher's signals. Fitted with his new glasses, Ryan fired a
two-hitter against Toronto. ``It was great to throw to something
you could see,'' Ryan said. Ryan was one of the two pitchers the
Cubs sent Minnesota in May in the  &UR; Rick Aguilera trade. How did
Ryan go through the Cubs system so long without an eye
examination? &QL;

ALONE ON THE RESERVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST AND BETTY REID  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most isolated corners of northeastern Arizona, what may
be the last generation of traditional Native American people live
out their lives alone.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their children have left, lured by the opportunities and
relative ease of life outside the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   But the old people stay on, living in primitive hogans far from
villages or neighbors. It is a beautiful but dangerous isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Often, there is no one to help them cut firewood or haul water;
no one to repair their homes or oversee their medical care; no one
to help them get up when they fall. &QL; 
SOLITUDE IS DANDEROUS
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Halona can't erase the picture from his mind: He was
driving over juniper-dotted ridges and through sheep pastures to
the remote hogan of an 80-year-old woman, delivering hot meals for
the Navajo Nation.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the woman's hogan and knocked at the door, hot
lunch in hand. But the elderly woman who usually waited eagerly for
his arrival didn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   Halona walked behind the hogan and looked down the the hill.
There she was, curled in the dirt, shivering. She had fallen the
night before as she walked to the outhouse and lain there all
night, her hip shattered. There was no one close enough to hear her
cries for help. A week later, she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were her children when she needed them?'' Halona asked
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew the answer.
</P>
<P>
   They had taken jobs in distant cities. Others still lived on the
reservation but had too many problems and obligations of their own.
None was available to check regularly on the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of cases like this,'' said Laverne Wyaco, acting
director of the Navajo Area Agency on Aging in Window Rock. ``I
don't know how they get by. Many are left on their own with
dilapidated homes and no firewood and running water.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 30,000 elderly Navajos live in the three states
the reservation covers _ Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. An estimated
25 to 30 percent of them live alone.
</P>
<P>
   And the number is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the number of Indian seniors increased 52 percent
from 1980 to 1990 _ faster than the comparable White population
because of gains in reservation health care.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase in Native American elderly is a serious
concern to Dave Baldridge of the National Indian Council on Aging
in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see an explosion in their number over the next
40 years, and many of these cultures are already in crisis,''
Baldridge said. &QL; 
FACING THE PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   Navajo leaders are beginning to confront the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where your grandparents are?'' That's the question
Navajo Area Agency on Aging asks in a radio campaign to begin
airing in October.
</P>
<P>
   The ad will be broadcast first on reservations, and then later,
Wyaco expects, in Phoenix, Tucson and Albuquerque, where as many as
25 percent of Navajos reside.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards may follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to remind them to go back and help _ once a week or
once a month _ to make sure their mother or grandmother has food,
wood, water and companionship,'' Wyaco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people are leaving their parents on the reservation
for longer periods of time,'' said Tincer Nez Jr., 28, who returned
home to Tuba City after graduating from Stanford University. He now
heads the area's Agency on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the baby boomers are getting older; I don't know if we are
going to have enough government services for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chores young people would normally do if they were
home _ patching roofs, carpentry and general repairs _ are not
being done, Wyaco said. The result: a serious deterioration of
seniors' housing.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the homes of Navajo seniors are in need of
important repair, according to a 1995 study. Some help is available
through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but the waiting list runs
eight years. &QL; 
TRADITION FADING
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere in America, elderly live alone. But until recently,
that wasn't true of Navajos, who have a strong tradition of respect
for the elderly and of extended families living together.
</P>
<P>
   But today's tribal children are growing up on the reservation to
the sounds of MTV rather than traditional teachings, Baldridge
said. ``The media has shrunk our world, and not for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   And when those children grow up, more often than not, they leave
the reservation and their parents behind.
</P>
<P>
   Many try hard to maintain ties to family and home, but that's
difficult when jobs are far from the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   One of Halona's clients, Mary Chavez, tells him about her
children who work in Phoenix and Albuquerque but regularly drive to
bring her fresh laundry, fresh supplies and companionship.
</P>
<P>
   Some families encourage their older family members to move to
the cities with them. But most older Navajos and Hopis are so
spiritually rooted to their family land that they would rather
endure hardships than leave.
</P>
<P>
   Even moving a short distance from their old family homes is
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   During the cold winter months, Edna Tallas, 95, lives with her
daughter in a modern home with electricity and heat. But every
week, she hikes two steep miles to visit the stone home her
grandparents built in the Hopi village of Moenkopi.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Tallas was born, following timeless tradition, her
parents placed her umbilical cord in the ceiling so she would
always remember where home was.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas remembers, and she stays there when she can. But the
tumbledown house, with the wind whistling through cracks and holes
in the walls, is habitable only in the mild season. &QL; 
FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   Like many Hopis, Tallas and her family don't believe in nursing
homes. They believe that caring for elders is the family's
responsibility. Younger family members take care of Tallas and her
daughter, who was disabled last fall in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   But for the elderly who do not have willing families, there are
few options. Nursing home care is in short supply on all Arizona
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajos have a certified nursing home in Chinle, but for all
21 tribes in Arizona, there is only one other such home, on the
Gila River Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Many tribal elderly with serious illnesses have to be placed in
facilities off the reservation, where staff members don't speak
their languages and don't understand their customs.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-bed Chinle nursing home, by comparison, has a hogan out
front for ceremonies, and staff members speak Navajo. Many of the
rooms have rounded walls like a hogan, and some of the residents
make Navajo rugs in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional therapies are blended with modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Goldtooth, administrator of the Chinle nursing home,
said there is a long waiting list for the facility, a list that
will get even longer as the elderly population on reservations
grows.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began in late August on another home near Tucson on
Tohono O'odham Nation land. And a comprehensive senior living
community is to open in February in Flagstaff on the grounds of the
Museum of Northern Arizona. &QL; 
AT-HOME HELP AVAILABLE
</P>
<P>
   Other efforts are aimed at helping the elderly in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Hopi Tribe sends a van around once a month to
remote areas to pick up elderly residents and take them shopping
and socializing, said Eva Leslie, director of elderly services for
the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors ride two hours each way to have lunch in the village of
Moenkopi near the Navajo town of Tuba City.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day before they are again isolated in their mesas,
the van stops at Bashas' in Tuba City to stock up. Because of
limited space, each senior can take only two bags of groceries. In
many cases, that must last them until the van comes around again.
</P>
<P>
   Even these services are limited to those who can walk to the van
stop. Leslie worries about the Hopi elders who can't get out at all
and who don't have regular visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We barely reach 300 of our elderly,'' Leslie said. ``We aren't
reaching at least 1,200 others who need personal care or whose
family members, who take care of them 24 hours, need a respite.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting this summer, the Hopi Tribe, with assistance from the
American Association of Retired Persons and the Inter Tribal
Council of Arizona, began a yearlong program using door-to-door
volunteer interviewers.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers are looking for two categories of people in need:
elders and disabled individuals who are not receiving benefits they
are entitled to, and elders at high risk of neglect or abuse. Only
about 50 percent are receiving benefits for which they are
eligible, Leslie said.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of care services for the elderly are making a
difference, but they aren't keeping up with needs, said Holly
Staley, head of aging services for the Inter Tribal Council of
Arizona, which serves 19 of the 21 tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal governments have been slow to move, fearing that
making services too readily available will encourage young people
to neglect the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a request comes for services, we emphasize that
caring for the elderly person is really the family's
responsibility,'' Leslie said. &QL;

RAZORBACKS EASE THEIR WAY BY MUSTANGS

<P>
   DALLAS _ SMU opened its season against Arkansas in semi-grand
fashion last night, performing before their largest audience in the
Cotton Bowl in 21 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mustangs, the vast majority of the 51,019
attending were loudly yelping ``Sooey!'' most of the evening, as
the Razorbacks displayed a variety of awe-inspiring players in the
course of a 26-0 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list was the pitch-and-catch combo of quarterback
Clint Stoerner and wide receiver Anthony Lucas, which produced
three touchdowns and needed little assistance. Nevertheless, the
18th-ranked Razorbacks also unveiled the tailback of the future,
incoming freshman Cedric Cobbs, who added a long, swift scoring
sprint.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mustangs, who had already lost four starters, it was a
long, frustrating ordeal. The game required 31/2 to complete, and
for most of that time, SMU _ playing in front of its largest Cotton
Bowl crowd since an engagement with Texas A&AMP;M in 1978 _ was in
distress. The Razorbacks held a 373-175 advantage in total yards
and had two scoring drives that moved a total of 123 yards in 20
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played like a top 10 team tonight and I think that's what
they are,'' SMU coach Mike Cavan said. ``That receiver of their's,
Lucas, he's real class. We couldn't do anything offensively, and we
just couldn't seem to do anything together.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas coach Houston Nutt said, ``We played well on defense,
and it's always good to win the opener and to win a shutout.
Overall, I think we're a better team than the way we played
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening's first blow was delivered by Arkansas return man
Fred Talley, who took a reverse handoff and went 37 yards on a punt
return to the SMU 49, where he was knocked out of bounds by his own
blocker, Orlando Green.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner, 12-of-29 for 239 yards, launched the drive with a
first down by pulling the Mustangs offside with a long count and
finished it with a 28-yard pass to Lucas, who outmaneuvered Tracy
Hart in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The pair struck again early in the second period when Stoerner
executed a one-play, 11-second drive with a 70-yard flip to Lucas,
wide open behind two SMU defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The next drive went 53 yards in nine seconds, the time it took
Cobbs to spurt through the right side on a pitch, veer back to the
left past the linebackers, and outrun the secondary. Spelling
starter Chrys Chukwuma, Cobbs was Arkansas' leading rusher with 8
carries for 85 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner struck again in the third quarter with a 63-yard toss
to Lucas, who was again wide open and finished with 6 catches for
194 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pretty good start on my goal for the season, which
was to just be Anthony Lucas again,'' said the Razorbacks wide
receiver who set school records last year for reception yardage and
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner, who holds the school records for yardage and touchdown
passes, also got off to a good start, but for SMU it was a bitter
night. The Mustangs managed 35 rushing yards on 37 carries, and
quarterback Josh McCown hit only 9-of-25 passes for 72 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Rodnick Phillips, the top returning rusher in the WAC,
was held to 26 yards on 11 carries. Freshman Kris Briggs led SMU
rushers with 63 yards on 16 carries, all after the game was out of
reach. In their deepest penetration, the Mustangs reached the
Arkansas 30-yard line with eight minutes left, but could go no
further.

U.S. CHALLENGES ARIZONA'S PLAN FOR REDISTRICTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Department says Arizona has failed to prove that
its plan for redrawing legislative district boundary lines after
the 2000 census wouldn't discriminate against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's defense of its redistricting plan for legislative and
congressional seats is ``insufficient,'' the department's Civil
Rights Division said in a July 28 letter to the Arizona Attorney
General's Office that was obtained by ``The Arizona Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   The department gave Arizona two months to try again to show that
the plan wouldn't shortchange minorities by relying on census
figures that the department believes could undercount Native
Americans, Hispanics and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has the authority to block the
plan if not satisfied with Arizona's response.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is also drawing criticism from national civil
rights groups, was approved by the Legislature and signed April 22
by Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   The plan restricts the sort of census data that may be used to
redraw state maps of legislative and congressional districts to
reflect population shifts during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's approach, only numbers from the traditional
Census Bureau head count in 2000 would be employed. Citizens will
receive surveys in the mail, and census workers will be sent on
follow-up visits when there is no response. &QL; 
`SAMPLING' AN ISSUE &QL; 
The Census Bureau had hoped to augment that approach with a
scientific method known as ``statistical sampling,'' which is meant
to uncover the hardest-to-find Americans, particularly minorities
and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Without sampling, many civil rights advocates believe, minority
groups will be denied an equal voice in government and lose out on
federal aid because the census won't accurately reflect their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Hull does not believe Arizona's approach is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor wants to use a head count because she believes it
is the best way to make sure you do, in fact, get everybody,'' said
Francie Noyes, Hull's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted every 10 years, the census is an official snapshot of
America. The numbers are used not only to divvy up the 435 U.S.
House seats according to state populations, but also to allocate
billions of dollars in federal aid for schools, crime prevention,
transportation and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates that 8.4 million people, many of
them minorities, were missed in the 1990 head count. &QL; 
REPRESENTATION AT STAKE &QL; 
If minorities aren't sufficiently identified in the census,
according to civil rights advocates, then legislative districts may
be drawn in ways that split up certain groups arbitrarily, curbing
their clout in elections. Also, areas with large populations that
lack English-language proficiency may not qualify for voting
materials in their own language if they are not adequately counted.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said Arizona tied with Montana for the fourth-worst
undercount in the nation, 2.4 percent. The only higher undercounts
were the District of Columbia (3.4 percent), New Mexico (3.1
percent) and California (2.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware Arizona probably lost money because of an
undercount,'' Noyes said. ``No one prefers that. But she (Hull)
does believe that the most accurate way of getting everybody is to
count everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution
prevented sampling from being used for allocating congressional
seats among the 50 states, but that states are free to decide for
themselves which numbers to use for drawing their district maps. &QL; 
4 STATES BAR SAMPLING &QL; 
So far, Arizona is one of just four states to shut the door on
sampling as a tool to redraw district lines. Alaska, Colorado and
Kansas are the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that these will not be the only states that will
try to pass these types of measures,'' said Marisa Demeo, regional
counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns that MALDEF has, and many of the organizations
that support sampling, is that the partisan battle that began at
the national level is continuing at the state level now, and it's
at the expense of minorities, the poor, children and other
undercounted populations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, as well as the nation as a whole, sampling receives
more support from Democrats than Republicans. Sampling tends to
benefit population areas that more often _ although certainly not
always _ vote Democratic. The Clinton administration has been a
strong advocate for sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's non-sampling bill was sponsored by state Rep. Wes
Marsh, a Republican from District 28. Marsh was on duty with the
Arizona Air National Guard and unavailable for comment. &QL; 
MINORITIES OPPOSED &QL; 
The state House voted 37-19 to approve the measure last spring.
Opponents included 10 Democrats who are either Hispanic,
African-American or Native American, according to an analysis by
the state Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, we need to make sure not only that people know
about this, but know about the impact it's going to have,'' state
Rep. Ramon Valadez, a Democrat who voted against the bill, said
last week. ``Right now, we're fighting the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The law needs to be approved by the Justice Department because
it represents a change in voting policy, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's initial defense of the law, submitted in June, said
the law was written ``without discriminatory intent and will have
no discriminatory effect on members of racial or language minority
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department, not satisfied, has requested dozens
of documents from Arizona _ including years of election returns on
how minority candidates have fared in the state, and any studies on
``whether, or to what extent, voting in Arizona state legislative
or congressional elections since 1990 has been polarized by race.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has also been asked to supply ``names, addresses,
telephone numbers, organizational affiliations'' of all minority
groups it consulted before enacting the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Napolitano's office is complying with the
request and will have it completed by the due date of Sept. 24,
spokeswoman Pati Urias said. &QL;

COACH'S BAYLOR DEBUT SAILS WIDE LEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ Kyle Atteberry did not look like a man
who had just cost his team a football game.
</P>
<P>
   The senior kicker shanked his extra-point attempt to the left,
dooming the Baylor Bears to a 30-29, overtime loss to Boston
College and spoiling new coach Kevin Steele's first game at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally muffed it,'' Atteberry said. ``It's a routine kick.
You should be axed for that in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Atteberry said it with a smile on his face. He said it calmly.
He said it in a postgame format that some players about to be
fitted with goat's horns might have skipped.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was able to take it so well because his coach told
him he still loved him. Perhaps it was because his teammates
encouraged him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because he has football in the right perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate to have a good relationship with the Lord,'' he
said. ``I look at this as a building block in character
development.''
</P>
<P>
   His missed kick was the most magnifed play.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor tied the game 23-23 on a 73-yard pass play from Jermaine
Alfred to Andra Fuller and Atteberry's extra point with 5:42 left
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Boston College had the first possession. Running
back Cedric Washington scored on a 1-yard run and John Matich
kicked the extra point. Baylor then scored on a 1-yard run by
Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   While the missed kick cost the Bears a chance to tie, the loss
really wasn't Atteberry's fault. The Bears lost this one because of
a familiar problem.
</P>
<P>
   A defense that ranked 98th against the run last year in a 2-9
season couldn't stop an inexperienced Boston College offense, and
that proved to be the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find ways to help them stop the run,'' Steele
said. ``That was the key to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles returned just three starters on offense. They lost
All-American running back Mike Cloud, who gained 1,726 yards in
'98. His replacement, Washington, was operating behind an
inexperienced offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. Washington gained 177 yards and scored three
touchdowns. Overall, the Eagles rushed for 350 yards on 59 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to figure out how to get the run stopped,'' Steele
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears had plenty of bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred, who beat out Odell James to become the starter,
completed 15 of 18 passes for 244 yards and two touchdowns. He
threw passes that were there for his receivers as they were coming
out of their breaks. His long touchdown to Fuller was made with a
blitzing linebacker in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine's a winner, he's a champion,'' Steele said.
``Probably his greatest strength is he's a calm, cool competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The receiving corps, expected to be a weakness, came through
with some big catches. Fuller had six for 121 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker McKinley Bowie had an 83-yard interception return for
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams contributed a blocked punt by Samir Al-Amin that
led to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears also made some big mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Atteberry had a punt and an extra-point blocked by players who
came flying through the line. Running back Darrell Bush lost a
fumble with at the Boston College 25 early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the game came down to the inability to stop
the run.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles rallied from a 16-7 halftime deficit by running for
64 yards in a 68-yard drive for a field goal, and for all but three
yards in a 51-yard drive that gave them a 23-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is basic fundamentals, shedding blocks
better and all-out pursuit to the ball,'' defensive tackle Dwight
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bears had done a better job of stopping the run, the game
might never have gone to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because it did, Atteberry took full responsibility. He
refused to blame a last-second change in holders from Alfred, who
had blurred vision after scoring what appeared to be a game-tying
touchdown on a quarterback sneak, to Ryan Chapdelaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice with both holders, so that shouldn't be a
problem,'' he said. ``It was a great snap, a great hold. I just
missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor defenders could have said the same thing about the
Boston College running backs.
Kyle Atteberry, the third-team all-Big 12 punter, is the kicker for
the first time since 1996 when, as a redshirt freshman, he made 35
of 36 PATs. He missed one yesterday and had another blocked. ...
The Bears were flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct when players
left the bench area to celebrate McKinley Bowie's interception
return for a touchdown. ``I told them we've had so little to
celebrate I'll take that one,'' coach Kevin Steele said. ``I won't
take the next one.'' ... Bowie said the touchdown was his first
since his junior year in high school, when he was a quarterback.
... Steele said he was more disappointed for his players than for
himself after losing his first game. ``I wanted this one personally
so bad for these guys,'' he said. ``They needed something good to
happen to them.'' ... Senior defensive tackle Dwight Johnson said
the new coaching staff has brought a new attitude. ``The coaches
were real motivated,'' he said. ``There weren't any negative vibes.
Last year after a loss everybody was down. These coaches were up. I
feel like we're on the right track. We can get it turned around.''

PROTESTERS LEAVE, KIDS STILL THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Finally, it's quiet.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week now, grown-ups all over town have been
shouting at one another over a girl.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for adults to argue over children, of course.
This particular dis cussion got ugly because it concerned a
14-year-old who was pregnant and wanted to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who wanted to stop her and those who wanted to
let her go. Those who wanted the courts to handle things, and those
who wanted the govern ment to step in. Those who wanted to use
religious arguments to convince the girl not to have an abortion,
and those who tried to buy her off with cash.
</P>
<P>
   There was a candlelight vigil at the state Capitol and another
protest outside the Juvenile Court Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   There were promises from the Gover nor's Office to find out how
confidential information about the girl was made pub lic in the
first place, and promises from state legislators to tighten
procedures concerning juveniles and abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger spoke about the girl on her nationally
syndicated radio show. Presidential candidate Steve Forbes
condemned the judge involved in the case for granting the girl
permission to leave the state to undergo the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   All the grown-ups involved, however, said again and again,
louder and louder, that their primary concern was the 14-year-old
girl _ a ward of the state since she was 5 _ along with all the
children like her. &QL; 
AFTER THE SPOTLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   But, that was before that the candles were blown out and the TV
cameras started pointing in other directions.
</P>
<P>
   It's peaceful, now.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, I contacted the state De partment of Economic
Security, which handles adoption and foster care. With all the
people protesting and expressing their desire to help children, I
figured after more than a week there'd be no young sters left to
adopt in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are approximately 150 children right now who are legally
free for adop tion,'' said Lorraine Gordon of DES, ``and no one yet
stepping up to adopt.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children have some diffi culties, like the
14-year-old everyone's been talking about. It could be they were
abused. Or maybe their mother used drugs. Or, simply, they're no
longer ba bies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at pictures of some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The DES maintains a Web site _ www.de.state.az.us. Or, you can
call for information at (602) 255-KIDS or 1-877-543-7633.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youngest on the Web site is about 8,'' Gordon said. ``Many
of them are kids with special needs, but we do of fer a lot of
support services and an adop tion subsidy. We do everything we can
to make adoptions work.''
</P>
<P>
   They must.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 150 Arizona kids ready and waiting for
adoption, officials at DES say there are about 7,000 children in
foster care, with more entering the sys tem every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our foster parents are great,'' Gordon said. ``But we always
need more. In the ideal world, the foster homes would num ber five
times 7,000 so we could make sure we're getting the best possible
match between the children and the families.'' &QL; 
SO, WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, Dr. Laura hasn't opened her home to any of
those kids. Neither has Steve Forbes, who probably has many homes.
Nor have Rep. Matt Salmon and the other the fellows who of fered
the 14-year-old scholarship money if she didn't have the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I contacted Salmon's office last week to ask what he planned to
do with the money he pledged to the girl if she de cided to go
through with the abortion. Would he give it to another child? Or
use it to take in one of the 7,000 in foster homes? I never heard
back.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I haven't heard much of anything lately from the
once loud-talking grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   And neither have the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Stories come and go quickly in the news business, and I'd like
to say it's all over but the shouting. But, it turns out shouting
was all there was. &QL;

SPORTING CHANCE FOR SUCCESS TAKEN AND ESPN WON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Nothing dusts up a good argument like sports. But no
one can dispute one thing: When they switched on the cameras for
the first time in Bristol, Conn., on Sept. 7, 1979, no one dreamed
that ESPN would change _ for better and for worse _ the face of
sports forever.
</P>
<P>
   The chances seemed especially slim if you were an insomniac
trying to understand the intricacies of Australian Rules Football
in the middle of the night. (If you remember the guys in the weird
white hats and overcoats, you know what I'm talking about.)
</P>
<P>
   The network, which celebrates its 20th anniversary with a
three-hour special Tuesday, got off to an admittedly slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, ESPN, in September of 1979, it was
like Gilligan,'' the ever-loquacious Chris Berman said earlier this
summer. (Berman actually signed on at ESPN about a month after it
began.) ``We were going on a three-hour tour. I mean, we really did
think the ``Minnow'' would be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. Now there is ESPN; ESPN2; ESPNEWS; ``ESPN: The
Magazin''e; ESPN Zone restaurants; the ESPYs; those funny,
self-deprecating commercials (``Charlie? Charlie? Come out and get
your whippin' ''). Professional football. Professional baseball.
ESPN broadcasts in every continent _ yes, even Antarctica, although
there has been no noticeable increase in dog-sledding coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Other networks have copied ESPN's style of sports coverage.
There's even a network series _ ABC's great ``Sports Night'' _
based on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an outfit that used to televise darts tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever do a replay on darts?'' Berman asked. `` `Ooh, nice wrist
action. Really good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rasmussen, the public-relations director of a hockey team
who started the network, took quite a gamble when he launched ESPN.
As ubiquitous as sports coverage is now, it's hard to remember what
an odd idea an all-sports network was in 1979. (Yes, ESPN
originally stood for Entertainment and Sports Network, but we knew
where the bread was buttered. The name was changed officially to
ESPN Inc. in 1984.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it _ this is sports all the time,'' Berman
said.
</P>
<P>
   CONFIDENT BUT ALONE
</P>
<P>
   But he was confident that enough sports nuts existed to keep the
network afloat, Gilligan references notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I can't predict if cable TV is going to make it in the
'80s, or are we going to have enough money, or are we going to get
sponsors other than Ginsu knives, you know, to pay for a couple of
things,'' he said. ``But I knew there were people out there like
us.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, he was the only one who knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those early days, when you called and said, `Hi, we're
calling from ESPN' and asked for some information and press
credentials, they would say, `Could you spell that?' '' said Bob
Rauscher, ESPN's senior coordinating producer. ``And we told them,
`There's no word. It's just ESPN.' So we've come a long way since
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. ESPN is now in 76.2 million homes; ESPN2 is in 65.1
million. But the network's effect can be measured in more than
ratings numbers and advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's influence is so vast that it's almost impossible to watch
a local sportscast anywhere in the country without seeing the
anchors trying _ and failing, miserably _ to emulate the catchy,
witty delivery of the anchors on ESPN's flagship broadcast,
``Sport''s``''``Center.'' Thus, it's almost impossible to watch a
local sportscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people want to get to ESPN, and they do an
ESPN-esque sportscast,'' said Mark Curtis, sports anchor for
Channel 12 (KPNX) in Phoenix. ``You see these guys as kind of like
the demigods of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT ANOTHER BERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Curtis, who said he once was offered a 2:30 a.m.
``Sport''s``''``Center'' spot (he declined), avoids aping the ESPN
anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chris Berman is one of the best guys in the country,''
Curtis said. ``He's funny, he's glib. But you know what? I can't be
Chris Berman. And thank God I found that out a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Many sports anchors still search for that knowledge. Here's
hoping they find it, soon. Because Curtis is right _ Berman is
Berman, just as Kenny Mayne is Kenny Mayne and Dan Patrick is Dan
Patrick. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it's
not something you want to suffer through when you're looking for a
Diamondbacks score at 1 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (anchors) that are `me-first' are real easy to see, and
yes, I do shudder at that,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick was more diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys who do that, but they're young,'' he said.
``I'm 43. They're 25. When I was 25, I would have done the same
thing. So, I try to be fair to what they're doing. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have enthusiasm. That's what I want. I want you
there, I want you enthused. And if you're enthused, and that's the
thing you can take to work every day, I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm, he's got. Patrick was once one of those young
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen seventy-nine, I'm sitting in my off-campus housing at
the University of Dayton, and we didn't pay for heat that winter so
we could pay for cable,'' he said. ``And we used to sit on the
couch and we would huddle in blankets and you could actually see
your breath in the living room. And I was watching the first show I
ever saw _ and I remember to this day, (ESPN anchors) Bob Ley and
George Grande _ and I said, that's where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's where he is. Of course, popularity often brings a
price. In Patrick's case, it's the controversy stirred up by his
appearance in Coors commercials. Other popular
``Sport''s``''``Center'' anchors _ Keith Olbermann and Craig
Kilborn _ weathered their own storms before moving on to other
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger of ESPN's popularity: athletes showboating just
so they can make ``Sport''s``''``Center'' highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerns me,'' Patrick said. ``It concerns me that we value
dunks _ that if you can dunk, you're a great player. And that's not
the way it should be. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I love freedom of expression. I love spontaneity. But you have
to be careful. If you don't, you're just putting these guys onstage
and saying, `Go ahead and perform for you own benefit.' Then I
think we do a disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   TOP SPOT FOR WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   But the network has provided services, as well _ services more
important than just late-night hockey scores. For instance, ESPN
long has been home to what was once that most rare of sightings:
the woman sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with Robin Roberts, and Suzy Kolber is coming back
from Fox,'' Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda Cohn, I look at her like she's just another co-anchor.
She's knowledgeable. You don't look and say, `Oh, for a girl, she's
good.' You can't do that at ESPN. You can't hide your foibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are what you are, because it's live TV, and our women are
great because they know what they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   So do their men. That's why ESPN has lasted 20 years. That's why
it'll last at least 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   For a real sports fan, the local knock-offs and the commercial
tie-ins and the players goofing for the cameras are, in the end, an
easy price to pay for a good solid hour of
``Sport''s``''``Center''.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have the best news and information show in
sports,'' Berman said. ``I mean, we know. We don't feel, we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's talking about sports. But it's hard to argue. &QL;

PROTESTERS LEAVE, KIDS STILL THERE

   PHOENIX - Finally, it's quiet.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week now, grown-ups all over town have been
shouting at one another over a girl.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for adults to argue over children, of course.
This particular dis cussion got ugly because it concerned a
14-year-old who was pregnant and wanted to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who wanted to stop her and those who wanted to
let her go. Those who wanted the courts to handle things, and those
who wanted the govern ment to step in. Those who wanted to use
religious arguments to convince the girl not to have an abortion,
and those who tried to buy her off with cash.
</P>
<P>
   There was a candlelight vigil at the state Capitol and another
protest outside the Juvenile Court Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   There were promises from the Gover nor's Office to find out how
confidential information about the girl was made pub lic in the
first place, and promises from state legislators to tighten
procedures concerning juveniles and abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger spoke about the girl on her nationally
syndicated radio show. Presidential candidate Steve Forbes
condemned the judge involved in the case for granting the girl
permission to leave the state to undergo the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   All the grown-ups involved, however, said again and again,
louder and louder, that their primary concern was the 14-year-old
girl _ a ward of the state since she was 5 _ along with all the
children like her. &QL; 
AFTER THE SPOTLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   But, that was before that the candles were blown out and the TV
cameras started pointing in other directions.
</P>
<P>
   It's peaceful, now.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, I contacted the state De partment of Economic
Security, which handles adoption and foster care. With all the
people protesting and expressing their desire to help children, I
figured after more than a week there'd be no young sters left to
adopt in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are approximately 150 children right now who are legally
free for adop tion,'' said Lorraine Gordon of DES, ``and no one yet
stepping up to adopt.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children have some diffi culties, like the
14-year-old everyone's been talking about. It could be they were
abused. Or maybe their mother used drugs. Or, simply, they're no
longer ba bies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at pictures of some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The DES maintains a Web site _ www.de.state.az.us. Or, you can
call for information at (602) 255-KIDS or 1-877-543-7633.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youngest on the Web site is about 8,'' Gordon said. ``Many
of them are kids with special needs, but we do of fer a lot of
support services and an adop tion subsidy. We do everything we can
to make adoptions work.''
</P>
<P>
   They must.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 150 Arizona kids ready and waiting for
adoption, officials at DES say there are about 7,000 children in
foster care, with more entering the sys tem every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our foster parents are great,'' Gordon said. ``But we always
need more. In the ideal world, the foster homes would num ber five
times 7,000 so we could make sure we're getting the best possible
match between the children and the families.'' &QL; 
SO, WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, Dr. Laura hasn't opened her home to any of
those kids. Neither has Steve Forbes, who probably has many homes.
Nor have Rep. Matt Salmon and the other the fellows who of fered
the 14-year-old scholarship money if she didn't have the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I contacted Salmon's office last week to ask what he planned to
do with the money he pledged to the girl if she de cided to go
through with the abortion. Would he give it to another child? Or
use it to take in one of the 7,000 in foster homes? I never heard
back.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I haven't heard much of anything lately from the
once loud-talking grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   And neither have the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Stories come and go quickly in the news business, and I'd like
to say it's all over but the shouting. But, it turns out shouting
was all there was. &QL;

BIG PLAYS ARE DELIVERED BY UNLIKELY GROUP

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With 12 suspended players, the Bruins were
counting on a slew of inexperienced players to contribute Saturday
night in the season opener against Boise State, and they did not
disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   _Sophomore tight end Bryan Fletcher, who played sparingly and
did not catch a pass last year, set up UCLA's first touchdown with
a spectacular 28-yard diving catch.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Sophomore safety Julius Williams, a converted
cornerback, returned an interception 53 yards for the game-breaking
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   _Senior safety Joey Strycula, whose primary duty until this
season was as the holder, intercepted a pass that set up the
Bruins' final touchdown of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   _Junior tight end Gabe Crecion, who sat out last season because
of a crowded depth chart, caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Cory Paus to give the Bruins a 24-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   _Freshman cornerback Joe Hunter, who redshirted last season,
prevented a Boise State touchdown by intercepting a pass at the 6.
</P>
<P>
   _Receiver-turned-cornerback Paul Nelson, a freshman, recovered a
fumbled punt early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   _Senior tight end Randy Hakes, who had one reception last year,
caught a 65-yard touchdown pass from Drew Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Touching tribute: Before the game, UCLA honored former Boise
State player Paul Reyna, who died last month from injuries suffered
during practice. Reyna's parents, Carolyn Gusman and Art Reyna,
were honorary captains for Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   An old friend: At first glance, UCLA and Boise State might seem
an odd pairing. But the matchup actually makes perfect sense: Boise
State's athletic director, Gene Bleymaier, graduated from UCLA in
1975 and served as an assistant athletic director for five years.
</P>
<P>
   An old friend II: There are no Idahoans on UCLA's roster, but
offensive coordinator Al Borges spent two seasons in that position
at Boise State (1993-94) under the late coach Pokey Allen. In 1994,
Boise State was 13-2, won the Big Sky, and its offense was ranked
19th nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Borges was a finalist for the Broncos' head coaching job in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to hit: Arizona's poor tackling against Penn State last
week resulted from minimal contact during training camp. Were the
Bruins facing the same fate? They scrimmaged three times in spring
practice, but only once in training camp because the disabled
parking-suspensions created depth problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to think you've done enough,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
``We do individual drills in practice, which is isolated tackling
as opposed to 11-on-11.''
</P>
<P>
   No show: Because of technical difficulties, the postgame
fireworks show was postponed until the Sept. 18 game against Fresno
State. Anyone holding a single-game ticket for Boise State can
redeem it for a general admission ticket on Sept. 18.

FRANCIS READY FOR CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Today, former Boston Bruins assistant coach
Bob Francis will slip on his skates and begin coaching the Phoenix
Coyotes when veterans open training camp for the upcoming season at
the Cellular One Ice Den in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Francis, the 40-year-old son of former NHL
goalie great, coach and executive Emile Francis, sat down and
discussed at length his background, his philosophies and his many
views about the Valley's NHL team with Republic beat writer Bob
McManaman.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive, mustachioed rookie head coach, who replaces the
fired Jim Schoenfeld after the Coyotes' second-best regular-season
finish in franchise history, appears to be many things: honest,
forthright, opinionated, provocative, humorous and modest. But more
than anything, perhaps, still unknown in Arizona. Until maybe now:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question: What thoughts run through your mind as you prepare to
step onto the ice with your team for the first time?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: Evaluating what the young guys can do and how many
strides they can take to make us a better team. . . . We're going
to take an approach here where we're going to put people in a lot
of different roles. If we're going to ask these guys to help create
more offense, we have to give them the opportunity to play with
different skill. We're not just going to look at a guy like Juha
Ylonen, for instance, and say, ``You've been on the checking line,
we know you can do that.'' I think Juha Ylonen has the skills and
ability to create more offense, so we've got to give him the
opportunity and the skills to show us what he can do. As well as
other guys, like Shane Doan, Tavis Hansen, Daniel Briere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: So it's safe to assume then you'd have no problem
experimenting with splitting up Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick on
the team's first line?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No. I know we'd be a lot more of a difficult team to play
against if we can have a more balanced attack. If it's the top two
lines, if it has to be the top three, then three. The chemistry of
our team? We don't know yet. We don't know if we're going to have
two high-powered scoring lines. If it means we have three, we're
going to take three if we can create it. I just know a team that
has one scoring line is easy to shut down. If you have two, it's a
little bit more difficult. If you have three, you're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've had a considerable amount of time to study your
roster, analyze video and meet with team personnel since coming
aboard. Do you have a pretty good read on what kind of team and
what kind of players you have?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Tapes can only tell you so much. Tapes have people in
particular positions and you know what the results were. So I think
if you want to try to improve, you have to try something different.
It may work, it may ``not'' work. The Phoenix Coyotes had a pretty
decent year. It didn't work out in the playoffs, but a lot of
things went well for them. They had a good start, then they had
some injuries and things tapered off. You have to ask yourself
``Why?'' Was it injuries? Or was it due to them not playing
conducive as a group?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Actually, some would say it was due to a crappy power play
that finished next to last in the league.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Well, yeah, that's an obvious one. But why ``was'' it so
crappy? That's where you have to find the answers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: On paper, is this team a contender if it stays healthy and
can buy into your system right away? Or is it just a good hockey
team that needs an awful lot of work?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It's a good hockey team that can evolve into a legitimate
contender depending on the growth rate of some people I've already
mentioned. If we can bring along our younger people, help develop
them and get more production and more stock out of them, it's going
to make us a deeper team. Everybody knows what Keith Tkachuk,
Jeremy Roenick, Rick Tocchet, Greg Adams and Dallas Drake are
capable of doing. But we have to improve our second half up front.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: When you were introduced as the Coyotes' fourth coach in
five years, you talked about bringing more creativity and offensive
excitement, pumping more goals into the net. What are your basic
philosophies? What's going to be the Bob Francis coaching system?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: To score more than the opposition. If you ask me what type
of system, how we'd like to play, I can give you the same type of
system that every coach would dream of having. A high offensive
team that has the ability to score and the ability to shut down the
opposition, play tight defensively and the ability to adjust to any
type of game, whether it's physical, whether it's size or speed,
whether it's tight. I think we're open-minded as a coaching staff.
We have an idea of the way we want to play. But I think you have to
be careful. You have to build the system around your players, not
your players around your system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: But every team has its own identity. Buffalo has its own. So
do Dallas and New Jersey and even Anaheim. What's going to be this
team's identity?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I have no idea. But what was Buffalo's identity? Was it the
same at the start of the year as it was at the finish? No. Buffalo
played a very tight game, their defense did not even get involved
with the play, offensively, until they got a bunch of injuries up
front and they had to generate some offense. So then they activated
their D, they started pinching, their injured guys came back, and
they had some success by doing it so they remained with it. Then
they had more skill and depth up front and then they were an
effective hockey team. You go through some trials and errors before
you learn your identity and you establish your system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Systems change all the time. How about coaching in general?
Has the job changed significantly since you first broke in a decade
ago as a head coach with Salt Lake City in the International Hockey
League?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Yeah, in a lot of ways. A ``lot'' of ways. I think nowadays,
you have to really communicate with the players. You can't use
threats, No. 1. Obviously with the salaries and the egos and
everything else that goes along with it, everybody is different and
communication is a priority. Coaching is a lot more involved than
it was years ago. You have the use of video, more scouts and staff.
As a result, you're better prepared for the opposition and I think
that's why you see the goals-against down compared to years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You said communication is key, but isn't ``survival'' really
the toughest aspect of being an NHL head coach these days,
considering the constant firings and hirings?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Survival's pretty tough, yeah. I think there's a reason why
there isn't a lot of longevity as far as coaches are concerned
being in one place. I think the ability to change, be creative, to
keep the players' attention and respect is probably the biggest
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Do soaring salaries undermine a coach's ability to run a
tight ship?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I think if it's done properly, it can be done. But yes, it
is more difficult. You have things to take into consideration that
you aren't even aware of _ bonus structure, incentives _ and that's
something as a coach, I don't want to know. I have the ability to
operate and run the ship the way it should be done in my mind and
not take into consideration somebody's own personal interest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What did you learn about running a team from your father?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: More than anything, probably the morality part of it. You
treat players with honesty and respect, you'll get the same in
return. You don't have to make it complicated. When you start
playing head games and mind games, that's when you really start to
lose their respect.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You earned your spurs on your own, coming up through the
ranks, but did you get a head start over other coaches because of
your dad?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It certainly isn't my height, I'll tell you. I don't know,
maybe. . . . I learned some good things from him, that it's
imperative your team's in shape, to prepare, that you have to have
a system, how to go about it in practices. We discussed a lot over
the years and maybe subconsciously, it did. But I also learned a
lot from when I was player. I wasn't an elite player. I was small,
I was ugly and I had bad breath. I had to survive. It forced me to
read and compensate in other areas and I think it helped me improve
my hockey sense. I had to work pretty hard to stay and by doing
that, I think it gives you the intangibles to do what's necessary
without having it come naturally.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What are your goals and expectations with the Coyotes your
first year?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I think you have to be very careful with goals. I don't want
to discuss the history or the past here. All I'm concerned with is
our future and I think we need to simplify our goals right now and
that's just coming out of training camp strong. We want to set a
precedent. We want to build on it throughout the course of the year
and continue to improve. And if we're doing that, we're going to be
be playing our best at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've mentioned the young players, but how important is it
that your top players carry the weight of the team?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Well, your top guys have to take stock of the situation and
be accountable for it. I think we have the people here who want to
win. They're willing to cooperate and sacrifice to obtain that
goal. The ideal scenario for a coach, and this may sound
potentially scary, is to have a team that's self-governed, that are
accountable for each other and it's not just the coach. And I think
your top players have to initiate that. They have to set the
example. I sat down in training camp years ago and I was thinking,
``In 10 words or less, how would you identify the ideal team
player?'' And I came up with willingness and sacrifice, personal
risk for team success. Now that may have connotations of physical
play, but when you think about it, it covers the whole spectrum of
team play. Whether it means you get some power play time taken away
from you to help develop this guy, you just have to accept it and
not let it affect your play. If your top players can do that, it
just makes it easier for everyone else to follow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Sounds ideal, but can you honestly expect every player to
follow the rules?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No. Some guys are going to buck the system. All this sounds
fine and dandy in the newspaper, but my job is to try and sell it.
That's why you're either going to be clapping or throwing darts at
me.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What do think of Keith Tkachuk as a player and a leader?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I think Keith is obviously one of the top players in the
league. I think the difference what Keith can add to his resume is
being associated with winning. . . . That's when you get the most
exposure. I think the market the team was in and is in now, the
fact we haven't gone a long way, a lot of people in the hockey
world aren't as aware of the skill level of Keith Tkachuk as there
can be. People in the NHL have a ton of respect for him. I think to
go along with that, Keith was put in a difficult role early in his
career by wearing the ``C.'' They give him a lot of responsibility
for a young man and more than most young athletes can handle. But I
think he's matured into the role. I hear from people around him
that he made tremendous strides last year. He's a warrior and his
fellow peers have the utmost respect for him. I think he's ready to
make that next step.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Do you have any concerns at all about this club's financial
situation or the fact Owner Richard Burke is reporting annual
losses of about $7 million? Or, about the uncertainty of getting a
new arena?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No. None whatsoever. It's a deal I tell players a number of
times throughout the year, not about this particular scenario, but
I'm only concerned about things I can control.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Fine. But if a tight budget prevents you from obtaining a
key player at the trading deadline to help push you over the top,
won't you become a little ticked off?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: That'll be something that has to be addressed at the time, I
suppose.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: The book on you, Coach, is that you've always been
ultra-competitive _ with a temper. Your teams back in the minors,
specifically the Golden Eagles, took on your demeanor. Especially
when you played the old Roadrunners.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Well, when you play each other 14 to 16 times a year like we
did, you're not going to like each other. I think we even played
doubleheaders, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: But did you have to tone down your personality and learn to
keep your temper in check?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I've always felt I had to have a lot of intensity to
compensate for a lack of natural skills. But I did have to learn to
control it when I became a coach. . . . The biggest transition I've
had is maybe having a little more control behind the bench because
a team will react to what the coach does.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What's your stance on payback and retribution? Derian
Hatcher's hit on Jeremy Roenick late last season, for instance?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I think it's generally overplayed and created more through
the media than it is through the players themselves. That being
said, we will never get caught unprepared and we won't be naive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Tell us one thing about Bob Francis that nobody knows?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I'm a pretty . . . bad golfer. But no, I'm just a pretty
simple guy. A simple guy who lives by his principles and doesn't
try to cause any trouble.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: The last coach here reportedly had an ultimatum hanging over
his head, that if the team didn't get out of the first round of the
playoffs, he would be history. Would you be bothered if the same
ultimatum was handed down to you, publicly?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Something that comes with this profession is accountability.
I mean, it's no secret that when I chose to get into this position,
I put myself in a bit of predicament. I'm not naive to the fact
that if we don't produce, I'm not going to last. Why should I be
different than any other coach in professional sports? Yes, I'm
aware the Phoenix Coyotes had 90 points last year. Yes, I'm aware
they had home ice and fourth place in the conference. Yes, I'm
aware they got knocked out in the first round again. Yeah, I'm
aware of all that. Would it bother me? No, because the owner's
basically done that by not saying anything. Until I'm told, it's an
unwritten rule. &QL;

THE PARTY'S OVER, WORK BEGINS AGAIN FOR DALLAS STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, what happens when you party like it's 1999?
</P>
<P>
   You get a heck of a hangover, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars celebrated their New Year a little early, taking home
the Stanley Cup in June and rolling through an endless stream of
silverware sleepovers since. But now it's time to take a
bromo-seltzer and get back to work. With training camp starting in
earnest today in Vail, Colo., the Stars face the challenge of
somehow shaking off the past two champagne-drenched months and
moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   And it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it's going to be tough,'' center Mike Modano said.
``After you win the Stanley Cup, it's hard to get excited about
training camp. I mean, it seems like we just finished. But, that's
part of the challenge for us. And once we get back out there, it'll
come back to us pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he realizes that defending any championship creates
new ]challenges. With a six-day training camp leading into a
nine-game exhibition schedule leading into an 82-game
regular-season schedule leading into a four-round playoff, the
Stars have plenty of time to get things together before games start
to get serious. Then again, they've had less time to recover from
injuries, less time to condition and less time to mentally rest
than any team in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in there, a balance must be struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd be hiding your head in the sand if you didn't
think there would be some debris,'' Hitchcock said. ``The thing is,
you can talk about the past and remember the past and even reflect
on the past to help the future. You just can't perform in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to guard against getting too far ahead of ourselves
trying to win a second Stanley Cup in October, and we have to guard
against falling too far behind and living in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he's determined to live in the moment, and
general manager Bob Gainey has given his coach a few tools to help
that cause. Since June, the Stars have traded backup goalie Roman
Turek and let go of five key veterans in Pat Verbeek, Craig Ludwig,
Dave Reid, Tony Hrkac and Brent Severyn. Enough of the roster has
been changed that Hitchcock expects to have a hungry group of
younger players fighting for the vacated jobs. But Gainey also left
intact a roster in which many of the players are in the prime of
their respective careers and a few key veterans are around who can
teach the new kids a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, management is trying to build a roster to win in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Gainey's plan has been to move in young talent when
young talent is ready, and the Stars have a ton of young talent.
They have drafted and trained top prospects such as Jon Sim, Juha
Lind, Richard Jackman, Pavel Patera, Jamie Wright and Marty Turco.
They have made moves to acquire prospects such as Blake Sloan,
Jamie Pushor, Brad Lukowich, Keith Aldridge and Alan Letang.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the cupboard is full. And that full cupboard creates
competition within the team, especially during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players can sense that there are openings, that there is a
chance for them to make the team. And that makes a difference,''
Hitchcock said. ``The hunger they have already is showing, and it
should make a big difference for the other players to see that
hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Hitchcock said he knows he doesn't need to push his
veterans. Particularly not after a grueling playoff run in which
eight of 23 games went into overtime and several players played
hurt. Brett Hull still is rehabilitating a torn medial collateral
ligament in his right knee. Mike Modano's fractured thumb is in
recovery, and Grant Marshall likely will not skate in Vail because
of a torn left groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might keep some of our players off the ice, but we can't be
too cautious, especially with the players who have been
rehabbing,'' Hitchcock said. ``Those players have missed a month of
conditioning, and now that month is sitting right in front of us
and we aim to take advantage of it. If they don't have that
conditioning base, they're going to fade and die in the second half
of the season. So this is a pretty crucial time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with open roster positions, a new chemistry to be built
in the absence of key veterans and the daunting challenge of
shaking off a Stanley Cup hangover, the bleary-eyed Stars might
consider September one of the more important months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know it was a short summer, and that presents a lot of
challenges,'' Hitchcock said. ``But if that's the price you pay for
being good, we're prepared to pay that price every year if we have
to.''

YEAR TWO BEGINS TONIGHT AT TCU AND A LEGION OF DOUBTERS REMAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Confident that they have turned the eternal
college football corner, the TCU Horned Frogs launch a season
abounding in high hopes and fanciful dreams tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if you've read this before.
</P>
<P>
   You know you have. The same opening paragraph, if memory serves,
accompanied TCU season openers in, oh, 1971, 1985, 1992, 1995, and
several other years beginning with ``19'' that have been lost in
the flotsam of three decades of trying.
</P>
<P>
   And what happened? One season the coach died on the sidelines.
Another time, eight star players confessed they were on the take.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a TCU fan, your heart bears the Elmer's Glue lines
from all the times it's been broken. You want to believe ... you
want to be there tonight, when the Frogs host 15th-ranked Arizona
... but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The first summer I was here, an elderly gentleman pulled me
aside after a speaking engagement,'' TCU athletic director Eric
Hyman said. ``And he told me, `Eric, I like what you're saying, but
you've got to earn your stripes to build any credibility around
here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The man explained how for so many years, TCU had built people
up, only to let them down. He told me it was going to take a
minimum of three years to build our credibility again.''
</P>
<P>
   Year Two, for what it's worth, begins tonight, and the silent
legion of local TCU subway alums is apparently, indeed, determined
to wait and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. This could easily turn out to be the winningest TCU
team since the great Dan Jenkins carried a student ID. Under Dennis
Franchione, the Frogs should have a stout, gang-tackling defense
and a depth chart bolstered by its best recruiting class since ...
since ....
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. I forgot that you've heard that song before, too.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 31,000 is expected to greet the Frogs when they
kick off at 6:30 p.m. against Arizona. That would leave empty about
one-third of the seats at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Fox Sports Net Southwest cameras looking on and the
Conference USA presidents possibly watching, won't that look
special?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Hyman and his staff seem neither anguished nor
suicidal about the modest opening-night audience. The gospel at TCU
these days is patience. Hyman points to the fact that season-ticket
sales are up 20 percent (to around 9,400) from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, you wonder. Is the TCU bandwagon that scary of a ride?
</P>
<P>
   If you've driven anywhere around Tarrant County, you have to
have seen the ``Power of Purple'' billboards. There have been TCU
commercials on Channel 5 and on area cable. Radio spots have been
running regularly on WBAP and The Ticket. Our own newspaper,
likewise, is about out of purple ink.
</P>
<P>
   As Hyman has learned, coming to a pro-infested sports area like
this, you have to market your product aggressively. The evidence
shows that he has.
</P>
<P>
   So where are you people? The Frogs-Wildcats encounter has the
makings of one of the weekend's marquee matchups. The Cowboys have
the day off. There is no school tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   At TCU, tailgating is legal and encouraged. Frog Alley again
will entertain early arrivals. And new this year is TCU Village,
the marketing department's version of Colonial's corporate tent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, more than 10,000 empty seats figure to greet the Frogs and
Wildcats tonight. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that TCU doesn't have a dowry of other assets to
display for the C-USA school presidents. But you never know. The
new conference, which will vote soon, doesn't need another Tulane,
where last year's 12-0 Greenies regularly played in front of 50,000
empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Frog fans are everywhere in this town, I'm convinced.
Some are even A&AMP;M and Texas grads, living in Fort Worth, who hold
dual allegiances. They will avidly root for TCU, and maybe even buy
tickets ... as long as the Frogs give them a reason to.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, though, winning a bowl game for the first time in 41
years wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   TCU opens tonight against a formidable Pac-10 foe, and Frog fans
are scared to death. They know what the ride home could be like.
They have read it all and seen it all. The TCU bandwagon, all too
often, has been like that exploding Pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. You're missing a Frogs team that deserves the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   They are quick. Talented. Brimming with a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. I know. You've heard that.

HOLIDAY WEEKEND NO PARTY FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE HAVASU CITY - Saturday was a typical opening to the Labor
Day weekend on Lake Havasu: crowded with young adults and boats,
loud and full of beer. It was hard to tell whether there was more
brew in coolers than water in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   And, naturally, it was hot along the Colorado River, which
passes through Lake Havasu. Why else would anyone want so much
beer?
</P>
<P>
   This community has become known _ especially in California _ as
a place for the young to party during the three big summer
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The community loves the business, but an army of law enforcement
agents isn't particularly happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lake Havasu Water Safety Center, known as Contact Point
to locals, two handcuffed 17-year-olds were being checked in. They
had no shoes so they ran on the short asphalt-covered trip from the
boat landing to the holding office. Both had a blood alcohol levels
near the legal intoxication limit. They were being tagged for
drinking as minors, not intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they could say was that everyone else was doing it, too,''
said one disgusted law enforcement officer. ``Why were we picking
on them? We just don't have enough people to check everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The water safety center is a vast improvement over the old
barracks of Site Six that was the nerve center for law enforcement
in the early 1990s. It's a modern building that bunks officers and
offers office space to various agencies.
</P>
<P>
   There is another building nearer the water that has space for
the Mohave County Sheriff's Department, which is the lead agency in
enforcement on the Arizona side of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   But beer isn't the only problem here. The crush of boats itself
is a major one. On a major summer holiday, the U.S. Coast Guard
believes that more than 10,000 boats are on the water between
Bullhead City and Parker on the Lower Colorado River, said Don
Lindsay, a division captain for the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's designated as one of the most dangerous waterways in the
nation _ a lot because of the partying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the auxiliary's enthusiastic and hard-working
volunteers tried to help set up communications among the 16 or so
agencies involved. That includes rescue, law enforcement, fire
fighting and injury treatment. City, county, state and federal
agencies are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State Parks, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the
Coast Guard and the Mohave County Sheriff's Department all helped
finance the new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officers were leaving on
patrol late Saturday afternoon. They had worked on Friday evening.
Nothing special. They had arrested a DUI boat operator, and some
kids where were running personal watercraft in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   With plenty of light left Saturday, several boats had sunk at
Havasu, and many more had gotten into trouble. Remember that old
statement: ``It's a war out there''? It looked like it. Boats were
coming down and across the lake in every direction, and the
personal watercraft operators were trying to jump their wakes. It's
an unbelievable scene of chaos. Then there was a group of
watercraft users riding up and down the lake. It appeared as if the
Hell's Angels had turned from motorcycles to boats.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Randy Johnson (no, he doesn't have long, stringy hair, a
6-10 frame and a wicked fastball) is in charge of search and rescue
coordination for the Mohave County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very fortunate this summer,'' he said. ``There
hasn't been that much trouble or that many accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay believes that's because coordination has been so much
better than in years before.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson doesn't know, but he's still really concerned about
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we curb that, we can save more lives,'' he said. ``There
are a lot of stressors out there. Water, wind and sun enhance the
effects of alcohol. It can get really rough.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that people seem to have different feelings about cars
and boats when it comes to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a car,'' he said. ``They make their livelihoods
with them. Boating is just a recreation. A drinking boater is just
as dangerous. But we don't have the same laws. That kind of hinders
us. It's more difficult to enforce safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers need more help from the Legislature to fight this
growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing good is that we're seeing more boaters using
designated drivers.'' Johnson said. ``That helps.'' &QL;

`FOX NFL SUNDAY' HOST IS REFEREE ON SET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It might be just a coincidence, but  &UR; James Brown is pumping iron
and getting down to his fighting weight _ just in time, as he tries
once again to control the opinionated and frequently off-the-wall
trio on ``Fox NFL Sunday''.
</P>
<P>
   Brown continually turns in top-flight work as the show's host.
Although he frequently takes a back seat to  &UR; Terry Bradshaw,  &UR; Howie
Long and  &UR; Chris Collinsworth, he's able to keep the program on an
even keel.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox shows usually had the upper hand against the competition
last season, and Brown was a big reason. He is smooth and
intelligent without coming across as patronizing, arrogant or
all-knowing, sins broadcasters have been committing since Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   Does he ever feel like a referee with the trio he faces every
week?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``But it's a good position to be in.
The philosophy of the show is to dispense education and
information, and people will retain more if it's user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, it seems as if Bradshaw, who for years has fostered
the notion that he remains a ``dumb quarterback,'' has had one too
many cups of black coffee without wearing a helmet. It's
entertaining, and it keeps Brown alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradshaw is indeed kind of a class clown,'' the man they call
JB laughed. ``He knows it. My job is to make sure it doesn't go
overboard. You have to understand all the guys to know their
strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Terry when he was at CBS, and we hit it off instantly.
I always tease him that I was never going to try to replace his
previous TV `husband,'  &UR; Greg Gumbel.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the dumb quarterback tales, ``nothing could be further
from the truth,'' Brown said. ``Unfortunately, so much emphasis is
placed on being articulate, and if in fact someone is not up to
perceived standards, he's said to be a stupid person or not bright.
Terry, being a country guy and being very proud of it, is as stupid
as a fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard for Brown not to take a couple of shots at the
old quarterback who led the Steelers to four Super Bowl
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called his own plays, as he is fond of saying, even if he
had only five plays he could call,'' Brown said. ``He says it was
five right and five left, so that's 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who begins his sixth year with Fox, has proven his
versatility, from hosting the ``World's Funniest Videos'' and
boxing to moderating a worldwide discussion on PBS involving  &UR; Yanni
and music students. Currently, he is talking with network personnel
about hosting another type of show.
</P>
<P>
   He has come a long way since his days at CBS, when he and
analyst
 &UR; Dan Jiggetts were handed the fourth or fifth game of the day. ``We
used to laugh and say those games went to the 7-Eleven and the
local pub.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 1985, when Brown and his former Harvard classmate,
Jiggetts, were the first all-Black team to work NFL games for a
network.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ed Goren, the executive producer of Fox Sports, worked with
Brown at CBS, and he made a strong bid to lure him to new
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started putting a team together here, there was some
sensitivity about bringing too many CBS people over, and the line
was we weren't going to become CBS Sports West,'' Goren said. ``At
that time, we already had  &UR; Pat Summerall,  &UR; John Madden, Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end, I was able to convince people that JB didn't
really have strong ties to CBS in the public mind like Greg Gumbel
did. In a certain way, JB has become the face and voice of Fox
Sports,'' Goren said.
</P>
<P>
   Goren said he thought Brown was underused at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sensed that, too, and one incident drove that home.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of two breakthrough opportunities presented to him by
CBS came to fruition regarding college basketball, and that's when
he started to question whether he was in the right career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seriously thought about going back to corporate America, but
thanks to my future wife and brother, I stuck with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the desire to go to Harvard was sparked by  &UR; Bill
Bradley, one of his early heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He impressed me, along with  &UR; Jimmy McMillen, an All-American
at Columbia,'' he said. ``I felt if I could go to Harvard, an Ivy
League school, I could defuse that myth of a dumb jock. I told my
mom that . . . I could be like Bill Bradley.'' &QL;

TAIT TALKS RATED R FOR RANCOROUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All was quiet in  &UR; John Tait's Tempe neighborhood on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs General Manager  &UR; Carl Peterson didn't knock on the front
door of the Tait house and make a peace offering.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs first-year Coach  &UR; Gunther Cunningham didn't call the
Brigham Young offensive tackle a ``jellyfish.''
</P>
<P>
   And a Kansas City TV station finally left the Valley, so that
Tait's dad,  &UR; Alan, could do yard work or go out for pizza without
being followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``John said, `He felt like  &UR; Princess Diana running from the
paparazzi,' '' Alan Tait said.
</P>
<P>
   John Tait's world forever changed Tuesday when he and his
Phoenix-based agents,  &UR; Ethan Lock and  &UR; Vance Malinovic, received
national publicity for walking out of an obscenity-laced meeting
with Peterson in Kansas City. Tait and his agents then flew back to
the Valley, but not before holding a news conference in which they
explained what happened in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lock said Peterson ``lunged across the (negotiating) table and
said, `Sit the (expletive) down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tait, a devout Mormon, said he then told Peterson, ``That's
it,'' and they left.
</P>
<P>
   Tait's camp maintains Peterson used the ``F word'' 12 times
during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson has apologized twice for his use of profanity, but that
hasn't helped get the deal done.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides can't even agree on why Tait, a Tempe McClintock
High School graduate, was in the meeting with Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs said Tait was there because his camp insisted on it.
</P>
<P>
   Tait's representatives said the player attended the meeting at
the Chiefs' request.
</P>
<P>
   The sides agree on one thing: Cunningham's comments have done
nothing but make the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham made several snide remarks about Tait before
referring to him as a jellyfish because he had missed camp.
Cunningham added that he was ``sure those defensive guys are
drooling to take a smack at (Tait).''
</P>
<P>
   Lock was incensed and called Cunningham a ``foot-shuffling
porter,'' intimating that the coach was nothing more than
Peterson's puppet.
</P>
<P>
   By criticizing the player, Cunningham already has flunked Head
Coaching 101, that coaches stay out of negotiations and never rip
an unsigned player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't heard  &UR; Vince Tobin say one bad thing about  &UR; L.J.
 &UR; Shelton,'' a Tait confidante said Saturday of the Cardinals head
coach and unsigned first-round draft pick. ``I'm beginning to
wonder if this is a marriage that can't be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham made things even worse when he said Lock should have
the guts to call him names face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was: `Would I play John Tait?' and I said, `He
would look like a jellyfish,' and that's obvious,'' Cunningham
said. ``Any normal human being could figure out that you can't sign
a contract four weeks after the preseason and go out and try to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all this to happen is beyond me, and the talk shows (in
Kansas City) are having fun with it. That's how they sell their
advertising. Any human being can take so much of a personal attack,
but if you really want to know, I have a hard time with them.'' &QL; 
Three of a kind &QL; 
Cowboys owner  &UR; Jerry Jones, arrested last week and charged with
fleeing the scene of a traffic stop, isn't the first league owner
to have a brush with the law.
</P>
<P>
   But NFL historians, after exhaustive research, have decided that
Jones' arrest gives the team an unprecedented trifecta: first team
to have a star player (wide receiver  &UR; Michael Irvin), head coach
 &UR; (Barry
 &UR; Switzer) and owner arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin went to trial on drug charges and former Coach Switzer was
charged with possession of a gun at an airport security check. &QL; 
Honeymoon is over &QL; 
Even before the Eagles play a regular season game, fans want
first-year Coach  &UR; Andy Reid to dump starting quarterback  &UR; Doug
Pederson for rookie  &UR; Donovan McNabb, the second pick overall in
April's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said Pederson remains his starter for next Sunday's season
opener against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change on that,'' Reid said. ``It's a
subjective decision on my part. I have to have a feel for (when
McNabb is ready).''
</P>
<P>
   Pederson, an off-season free agent acquisition who played for
Reid in Green Bay, failed to lead the Eagles to a touchdown in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, meanwhile, came off the bench to throw for three
touchdowns Thursday night to lead the Eagles past the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I ready?''' McNabb said. ``I'm confident. But there are
still questions I need answered. I'm not exactly where I want to
be.'' &QL; 
Losing streak &QL; 
Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel is not a big fan of the league's new and
improved instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged four calls in the preseason and lost each,
including two in Friday's game against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my luck right now, you might never see another replay out
of me,'' said Fassel, former offensive coordinator of the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking the world &QL; 
Patriots officials apparently saw something in former Arizona State
cornerback  &UR; J'Juan Cherry that no one else in the league did.
</P>
<P>
   They took Cherry, dismissed from this year's ASU team, in the
fourth round of last week's supplemental draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him work out, I immediately thought, `Free agent,
nothing more than that,' '' said an NFC Central scout. ``I didn't
think he'd get taken by anyone, believe me.'' &QL; 
Stump the band &QL; 
Glendale Cactus High School graduate  &UR; Ryan Christopherson, cut by
the Broncos last week, knows he forever will be part of the answer
to a trivia question: Name the 20 running backs drafted ahead of
All-Pro &UR; Terrell Davis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Christopherson, formerly of the Cardinals, was the 169th
selection overall, taken in the fifth round, 27 spots ahead of
Davis, a sixth-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I want to mention that to my grandkids one day
because they'll ask what happened with me,'' Christopherson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about that the other day, that 20 years from
now, we're going to be looking at T.D. like  &UR; O.J. (Simpson), the
best running back ever. And you're sitting right there in the same
room, so it's amazing. And it's amazing because he's such a
down-to-earth guy with all the things he's accomplished.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
 &UR; Charlie Garner, the former Scottsdale Community College running
back, appears to have beaten out  &UR; Lawrence Phillips with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``'' ``Muscle and Fitness Magazine'' lists Colts offensive
tackle  &UR; Tarik Glenn, 6 feet 5, 335 pounds, as having the worst
physique in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta employee, watching the long-awaited arrival of rookie
defensive end  &UR; Demetrius Underwood, at Fort Lauderdale Airport:
``All I've got to say is I hope he doesn't miss tackles like he
misses flights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants rode the train to their preseason game in Baltimore,
the first time they have taken a train to a game in 40 years. It
saved them $75,000, which is why they'll take the train to
Washington later this season.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Panthers Coach  &UR; George Seifert, on why he's considering
keeping four quarterbacks, including former NAU star
 &UR; Jeff Lewis: ``We've got one per quarter. That would foul
(opponents) up. Who knows? Why not be innovative? I mean,  &UR; Knute
Rockne had to start somewhere.'' &QL;

WOMACK STILL ADJUSTING TO OUTFIELD  
 THINGS LOOKING UP FOR D-BACK AFTER EARLY UNCERTAINTIES, INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If the Diamondbacks are fortunate enough to reach the
playoffs and advance to the World Series, perhaps no player will
appreciate it more than Tony Womack.
</P>
<P>
   He has endured as much or more this season than many players do
in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the saga of the trade with the Pittsburgh
Pirates. It was on. It was off. It was on. It was off. His emotions
were caught in the middle. The Pirates were his original and only
organization. He wasn't sure what to think anymore.
</P>
<P>
   When the trade finally went through on Feb. 26, he arrived in
Arizona amid more uncertainty: The Diamondbacks wanted him to move
from second base to the outfield. His wife, Janet, also was
pregnant with their second child.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a little more than a week later, on March 7, Womack was
hit in the right wrist by a pitch from the Chicago White Sox's Jim
Parque and the resulting fracture kept him out until the second
week of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Once the injury healed, Womack was inserted into the leadoff
spot in Manager Buck Showalter's batting order and has become a
permanent fixture.
</P>
<P>
   He also has developed into an above-average outfielder, although
his attention has been diverted again of late by stints at
shortstop and second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's been taking ground balls in the infield since spring
training, so it isn't that difficult for him,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Womack says he would prefer to play one position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked my butt off to be a middle infielder, then I found a
home at second base'' (with the Pirates, with whom he was a
National League All-Star in 1997), Womack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to a new position was a tough time for me. My family
prayed for me. I'm thankful my wife is strong, for the things she
said and did for me during the trade and transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have a choice in the matter. I didn't ask to
come here. That's not meant to say that I don't want to be here,
it's just that you get traded and you don't have any say in the
matter. It was the first time and it was hard to accept and it took
a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still adjusting. I'm not going to say that I'm there (as
an outfielder). I'm working day in, day out.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference in the outfield and infield is the
throws, he says. Outfielders throw more over the top on a
consistent basis, while infielders throw at all sorts of arm
angles. &QL; 
Finders keepers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Womack, who turns 30 on Sept. 26, said he didn't necessarily
choose to play baseball _ ``it may have chosen me.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Gretna, Va., he was a basketball freak. Played
baseball in high school, too, but basketball was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, they (colleges) are looking more for 6-foot-6
guards and I'm not quite that tall,'' said the 5-foot-9, 160-pound
Womack. ``You have to be at the right school in the right situation
just to get a tryout.''
</P>
<P>
   So he went to college (Guilford, N.C.) without a scholarship. He
worked at fast-food restaurants and worked for his father, Thomas,
building mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work for everything I got, school, everything.
Perhaps that's why it meant and means more to me to get where I am
from where I've come,'' Womack said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates drafted him his junior year in the seventh round in
1991. He got his share of money, but he wanted it in the contract
that the main part of what he received to go toward his final years
of school. He went on to finish his degree in sports management at
Guilford and later earned his master's in sports management at
North Carolina-Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   He worked his way through the ranks with the Pirates, playing
parts of the 1993, 1994 and 1996 seasons with the big club. His
first full season was 1997 and he followed that up with another in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks drew a lot of attention for wanting Womack to
switch to the outfield, but the fact is, the Pirates also were
going to move him to the outfield. They had a promising second
baseman in the minor leagues, Warren Morris, who now starts most of
the big club's games at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Tony to play the outfield,'' Pirates Manager Gene
Lamont said. ``I thought we had to be better in the middle
(infield). His agent told us that he didn't want to play the
outfield. Tony had already done everything we had asked, so it was
a tough situation all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for him that he was able to go to a club that has a
chance to be in a pennant race. He's the best at stealing bases. He
knows when to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack renewed acquaintances with the Pirates when the
Diamondbacks played in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago. He still misses
some of his former teammates, but he also had something to prove to
the Pirates' front office. He helped the Diamondbacks win three of
four games. &QL; 
The switch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Murphy, the Diamondbacks' outfield instructor who was a
six-time Gold Glove winner, said Womack ``is capable of playing any
position he wants and playing it well.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the move to right field, Murphy said, ``He's turned into
a quality outfielder. He makes it look easy. His speed is always a
plus, but he gets a good jump on the ball. He has good instincts.
You can have all the speed in the world, but if you don't have the
instincts, you end up getting bad angles on the ball. He charges
the ball well and plays the wall well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think having Steve Finley out there (in center field)
helps him out a lot. They seem to work pretty well together.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Finley: ``It didn't take long for us to feel comfortable. I
think he trusts the decisions I make and I trust him. He's a great
athlete.'' &QL; 
The speed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Womack's on-base percentage was .336 entering this weekend, not
as productive as some leadoff men, yet better than he has been in
his career. In his two full seasons with the Pirates, he was .326
and .319.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting on base is what it's all about,'' he said. ``I know I
need to improve, but I think I ``have'' improved.''
</P>
<P>
   He had 46 walks with a month to go in the season, three more
than in 1997. He had 23 doubles, three off his career best, seven
triples, which put him among the National League leaders, and three
home runs, including an inside-the-park grand slam against Houston
in the Astrodome on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wonder why I don't bunt more than I do,'' he said.
``I bunt when I feel the time is right, when I feel I have the best
chance to make it. I don't really get caught up in what people
write or say. Unless you're in my shoes, you don't know. You can
make a perfect bunt and still get thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to try to hit the ball over the place, get them
(defenders) off me. That way, they aren't sure what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Womack does reach first, something is almost sure to
happen, and that is a stolen base. He led the league with a
career-high 61 entering Friday's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't study pitchers on tape that much,'' he said. ``I pick
up things as I go along and I see things I don't forget. Pitchers
change their demeanor, at least they do around me. You try to pick
up something, anything to give you an advantage. But sometimes you
can do too much thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Butterfield, the Diamondbacks' baserunning instructor,
said Womack's speed is a disruptive influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the best baserunner we have, but he's getting better.
He's still a young player in terms of major league experience,''
Butterfield said. ``He gets the big stolen base for you. Some guys
run just to run, but he knows when and when not to do it. He's more
interested in doing it to get in position to score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most impressive things about Womack, Butterfield
says, is how he works with veteran Jay Bell, the No. 2 hitter in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being disruptive on the bases means Jay will get more
fastballs and therefore get a chance to drive in more runs or put
runners in scoring position,'' Butterfield said. ``Jay is
unselfish, having taken extra strikes to allow Tony to try to steal
second and third. This year, Jay is doing the best job of a
two-hole hitter I've seen, and a lot of that is because of Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield said that the club times how fast a pitcher releases
the ball on his delivery to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   If it's 1.3-1.4 seconds, the runner has a good chance. If it's
1.1-1.2, the odds decrease considerably. And there are some
rarities below 1.1, like 1.07 or 1.09, but Butterfield said Womack
has stolen on those arms a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty amazing,'' Butterfield said. &QL; 
The man &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of Womack's Diamondbacks teammates are more outgoing and
boisterous. He prefers the quiet route most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can fit in anywhere, and I fit in here,'' he said.
``I stay to myself a lot, but I'm not afraid to interact. I'm
quiet, but I can joke around and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, he is all business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, when he was telling my brother and me about playing
and how to act, always said, `Don't do stupid stuff. Don't
embarrass the family,' '' Womack said. ``I'm human, and I'm not
always going to agree (with a call). But yelling, all that stuff,
looks real bad. For the young people learning the game, that's not
cool. There's nothing cool about that. You try not to cuss, because
that's not going to change the call. I prefer to keep it inside. It
doesn't work that way for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to stay on an even keel, never get too high or
too low. That way, you have more of a chance to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, I don't take it home. The trade
and the injury were tough, but I've received great support from my
family. I get everything from my family. They're No. 2, besides the
man upstairs. You need your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack's family includes his wife, daughter, Jessica, who turns
4 on Sept. 12, and son Alsander, born in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how hard I've worked to prove to myself I belong
here,'' he said.``It's going to be interesting the rest of the
season for them and the fans here. I want the fans to see what I'm
all about and what the team is all about. We've done well so far.
We just have to keep it going.'' &QL;

UCLA ROLLS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ From the FBI investigation to the disabled
parking scandal and his son-in-law's successful battle with a brain
tumor, it was a grueling offseason for Bruins coach Bob Toledo. He
was as exhausted when training camp began as he usually is in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo couldn't have scripted a better start to his fourth
regular season _ with or without 12 suspended players and injured
receiver Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bruins' 38-7 victory over Boise State on Saturday night
at the Rose Bowl, the kicking game held, the defense was superb,
and the quarterback quagmire lurched toward a resolution as
second-stringer Cory Paus outplayed starter Drew Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   A redshirt freshman from New Lenox, Ill., Paus completed 7 of 9
passes for 78 yards and directed two touchdown drives in the first
half. The second _ a five-yard pass to tight-end Gabe Crecion _
gave the Bruins a 24-0 lead before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett recovered from a 2-of-9 start and looked sharp in the
second half _ he could start next week's game at Ohio State _ but
it was clearly Paus' night.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate and savvy, his performance was reminiscent of Cade
McNown's uncanny play as a true freshman in 1995. In fact, it was
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade was not ready to play,'' Toledo said. ``He made a lot of
mistakes, but he learned and got better. Cory has been here (a
year). He's learned the system. He's done things Cade couldn't do.
In that sense, he's ahead. Whether he finishes ahead remains to be
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's defense, maligned last season, was equally impressive.
Despite missing five suspended starters, the Bruins held Boise
State to 123 yards in the decisive first half and intercepted
Broncos quarterback Bart Hendricks twice.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Williams' 53-yard interception-return touchdown gave the
Bruins a 17-0 lead, and Joey Strycula's interception on the ensuing
play set up the Paus-to-Crecion touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In attitude and execution, it was a dramatically different UCLA
defense than the inept version of last year. Of course, Boise State
didn't provide much resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA should never be 99th in the nation,'' Toledo said of last
year's defensive ranking. ``There's much less confusion (this
year), and they're better fundamentally. They're playing hard and
confidently. I have a better feeling than I did a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory negated any effects of the two-game disabled
parking-suspensions. Now, the Bruins can do no worse than split
their first two games _ the same fate most expected with a full
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Following Toledo's pregame strategy, Bennett played three series
before Paus entered with 5:18 left in the first quarter. He
completed his first pass, a screen to tight-end Bryan Fletcher,
then hit Brad Melsby for a first down near midfield. The drive
sputtered a few minutes later, but UCLA's defense forced a punt,
and Paus returned to lead the first touchdown drive of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a screen to tailback DeShaun Foster, who scooted
for 23 yards to Boise State's 45. Six plays later, facing
third-and-12, Paus lofted a delicate pass to the 6-foot-5 Fletcher,
who made a fabulous diving catch at the Broncos' 4.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Foster plowed over linebacker Bryan Johnson for
a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense took command on the following series. On
third-and-6, Hendricks tried to hit his tight end, Dave Stachelski,
who was battling Williams for position near midfield. Before the
ball arrived, Stachelski stumbled, giving Williams an uncontested
interception.
</P>
<P>
   A converted cornerback playing his first game at safety,
Williams looked like a tailback as he raced 53 yards down the right
sideline for a touchdown that gave the Bruins a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Boise State's next play _ i.e., Hendricks' next mistake _ broke
the game open. With Kenyon Coleman charging hard, Hendricks threw a
screen pass to Strycula, giving the Bruins possession at Boise
State's 32.
</P>
<P>
   After three tough runs by Jermaine Lewis, Paus rolled right and
connected with Crecion for a touchdown and a 24-0 lead five minutes
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter, Bennett tossed his first career
touchdown, a 65-yard pass to tight end Randy Hakes.

GM JOBS PROVIDE CHANCE TO RIGHT WRONGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Major League Baseball has a dismal record when it
comes to hiring African-Americans and/or Hispanics as general
managers. There are none of either and there haven't been since Bob
Watson, fed up with George Steinbrenner, resigned from the New York
Yankees in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mets assistant general manager Omar Minaya is aware of this, and
there are some in baseball who think he's the right person to
change it. National League president Leonard Coleman is among those
pushing him for the Milwaukee Brewers opening.
</P>
<P>
   But Minaya, who interviewed with the Los Angeles Dodgers last
year, is also wary of becoming the ``official minority candidate''
of general manager searches, somewhat in the same way Davey Lopes
has been unfairly used in manager situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this,'' Minaya said. ``I hope that I would be
considered a good baseball man. I hope my association with the
Texas Rangers and the team that is there now, and my association
with the New York Mets winning this year are my credentials ... not
my race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' job is being watched carefully. Club president
Wendy Selig-Prieb is in a difficult position. Obviously, she wants
to hire the right person for a franchise that is moving into a new
ballpark next year. But her father is Bud Selig, the commissioner
of baseball, who is under pressure to increase the number of
African-Americans and Hispanics in key positions.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya already has interviewed with the Brewers. So has Toronto
Blue Jays assistant Dave Stewart. Reds assistant general manager
Doc Rodgers is another possibility. That's a pretty good pool to
pick from right there, but Selig-Prieb has also interviewed several
white candidates, including White Sox assistant Dan Evans and
former Indians assistant Dan O'Dowd. Former Dodgers general manager
Fred Claire could get an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya said the important thing is for African-Americans and
Hispanics to continue to get opportunities one level below general
manager: scouting director, farm director and assistant general
manager. The more those jobs are filled without regard to race, the
better chance baseball has of correcting a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think baseball has acknowledged they want to do better,''
Minaya said. ``Baseball wants to improve how it goes about the
interview process for jobs that are considered the heads of
departments. There are qualified people in baseball that can do
those jobs and there's been improvement in those hirings the past
couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Minaya, who started with the Rangers as an area scout, got his
break in 1994, when general manager Doug Melvin promoted him to
director of professional scouting. The Rangers were the first to
have such a department, and now half the teams in baseball have
split their professional and amateur scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya is known in baseball as the man who signed Sammy Sosa,
almost like Jimmy Stewart's character was known as the Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance. But he also signed Kevin Elster for the Rangers in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya wants baseball people to take an unbiased look at the
record and the person. If they do that, he said he is confident the
disgraceful past inequalities can be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT on
</P>
<P>
   Henderson providing rare leadership for Mets Rickey Henderson
has been called the greatest leadoff hitter of all-time and there's
little doubt he's the greatest base stealer of all-time. He's also
been called, at various times of his career, an All-Star, most
valuable player, superstar, malingerer, malcontent and royal pain
in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Now the New York Mets are calling him something else in his 21st
season in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Team leader.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have believed it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be the sparkplug,'' Henderson said. ``I'm just trying
to create something out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has always been able to do that when he's healthy. His
career on-base percentage is over .400, he's fifth all-time in runs
scored and he has almost 400 more stolen bases than anybody in
history.
</P>
<P>
   But what impresses the Mets is the way he has conducted himself
in the clubhouse as a mentor to their younger players, especially
right fielder Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been an inspiration,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine.
``I didn't know what to expect from him, but by observing him
across the field, I didn't expect him to be a positive person on
the team. But he has given us positive leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson still has injury problems. He has missed time this
season because of a sprained ankle and a strained thigh, and
there's still some doubt he'll get the 500 plate appearances needed
to automatically kick in a $2 million option for next season.
</P>
<P>
   But he is hitting .337 after three years of .241, .248 and a
career-low .236 last season.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   Among the Kansas City Royals' September callups was shortstop
Felix Martinez. Martinez was the Royals' Opening Day shortstop in
1998 but was involved in a major brawl with the Anaheim Angels on
June 2 and was sent down the next day. When the Royals recalled him
this week, he had to immediately begin serving a five-day
suspension resulting from the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals have made re-signing pitcher Darren
Oliver a priority this off-season. They will also look for a
closer. Rick Croushore, Ricky Bottalico and Juan Acevedo have
flopped in the role.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs were thrilled to dump Rod Beck on the Red Sox.
He's signed for next season at $3.5 million with a club option for
$4.5 million in 2001. The Red Sox were doing fine with Derek Lowe
as closer, but they wanted Beck's experience down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times this season, the Diamondbacks have been shut out or
held to one run in a game Randy Johnson started. He has a 2.38
earned-run average in those games, with 89 strikeouts in 53
innings. In his other 23 starts, Johnson is 14-2.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, as host country for the 2004 Olympics, is required to
field a team in every sport, including baseball. So they've asked
Orioles owner Peter Angelos for his assistance in developing a
national baseball program. Lesson 1: Hire good people (Johnny
Oates, Pat Gillick, Davey Johnson, Frank Wren) tell them how to do
their jobs, then run them off as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees insist Darryl Strawberry will not play left field.
They insist that job has been won by Ricky Ledee. So Strawberry
will pinch-hit and spell Chili Davis at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo had six hits, including
three home runs, in Monday's 17-1 victory. The next day, he showed
up at the Astrodome for early batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' infield, including shortstop Rey Ordonez, showed up on
the cover of ``Sports Illustrated'' with the question being raised,
is this the best defensive infield in history? If it is, the Mets
would still like to break it up by trading for Alex Rodriguez next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies were 6-17 while Curt Schilling was on the disabled
list. The rotation was 3-12 with a 6.35 ERA and the team went from
51/2 games to 151/2 out in the standings. One casualty was Chad
Ogea, who was finally yanked out of the rotation after going 6-12
with a 5.71 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   There are two teams that need general managers: Milwaukee and
Colorado. Baseball people say Milwaukee is the much better
position, even though the Rockies sell out every night. There are
many who believe the Rockies will never be able to assemble a
decent pitching staff, mainly because the top free agents will
never want to pitch there.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's game with the Astros, Mets pitcher Orel
Hershiser went over and shook hands with umpire Bob Davidson, one
of 22 whose resignation was accepted. Said Hershiser: ``He was the
only guy on the field whose last day of work it was. That's a
lonely place to be. Players and umpires are never going to see
eye-to-eye. All you can do is give your best and I thought Bob was
one of those who always did that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta's Bret Boone and Cincinnati's Aaron Boone homered
Wednesday, it marked the first time since Sept. 14, 1974, at Tiger
Stadium (Graig Nettles of the Yankees, Jim Nettles of the Tigers)
that brothers from opposing teams homered in the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Joey Hamilton, who is 7-8 with a 6.52 ERA,
won't pitch again this season and will probably undergo shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Astros second baseman Craig Biggio on the Cincinnati Reds:
``They have a good team. They're strong up the middle, they do
little things right, they have good pitching and an outstanding
bullpen. I don't think anybody is surprised by what they've done.
It's like Barry Larkin said. Nobody is doing more than what they
expected. No one is having a career year. Everybody is just doing
their jobs.''

CARDINALS FACE A DAUNTING FIRST 4 WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Check back in a month.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the Cardinals' won-lost record that reveals whether
they are for real. The measuring stick will be how their young
players, coming off a taste of playoff success, handle the
aftermath of an opening four-game stretch that has the potential to
rock their world.
</P>
<P>
   That's the key to their season.
</P>
<P>
   Take inventory of the splints and soft casts. The holdouts. Walk
past the lockers that have names above them but no corresponding
bodies dressing in front of them. Look at the nasty schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to put a team together when you've got some key
parts missing,'' Coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the league's fourth-toughest schedule and it would be
easy to believe that the Cardinals will not approach their
breakthrough accom plishments of last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will be fortunate to have more than one win coming
out of September after visiting Miami and playing San Francisco at
home. Then they open October by visiting Dallas, the team they
nearly shut out in the first round of the playoffs. The soft spot
is the opener against Philadelphia. But that's on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The players can't let go mentally.
</P>
<P>
   Being in the hole early is not new. The league routinely
front-loads Cardinals' schedules with road games to avoid the
desert heat. The team is accustomed to playing catch up, and almost
always has played it badly.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is this team is better equipped to handle it. The
Cardinals now know the feeling of winning (9-7), of having pulled
out the close ones (NFL-record seven wins by three points or
fewer), and of having nearly shut out a bigtime franchise in the
playoffs (20-7 at Dallas). They have moved past considerable
negativism.
</P>
<P>
   What they aren't accustomed to is playing from the lead, of
performing when expectations are high. This season will be a new
experience.
</P>
<P>
   And it more than likely will begin on a down note, testing their
developing maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Their potentially high-scoring offense will not be in rhythm.
Quarterback Jake Plummer and most of the line are injured, and
first-round pick L.J. Shelton and receiver Rob Moore are unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   The run-stopping ability of the defense will be in question
because tackles Eric Swann (knee surgery) and Mark Smith (unsigned)
aren't on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Several locker room leaders _ Jamir Miller, Lomas Brown, Larry
Centers _ have left as free agents.
</P>
<P>
   If they can weather the storm, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals don't have to win the division, although they
could win the weak NFC East even with a slow start. They need only
make the playoff field. By postseason, they should be at full
strength and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some credibility last year, although we really didn't
until we beat Dallas,'' Plummer said. ``If we had just gotten to
the playoffs and lost, I'm sure people would have said we were 9-7
against a weak schedule and we were not that good. But we beat
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got the (New York) Jets, Miami, San Francisco,
Atlanta, Green Bay _ quality playoff teams from last year. If we
beat them and go 9-7, we will have accomplished something in
everyone's eyes. Then no one can doubt that we have a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The players believe. For every Lomas Brown or Larry Centers that
have departed there is a Plummer or an Adrian Murrell stepping
forward to lead. For every departed Jamir Miller there is an Andre
Wadsworth to encourage the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a big change from when I got here last year in the
way we practice, in the attitude of everyone in here,'' Wadsworth
said. ``Once you have tasted what you want, then you work even
harder to get more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Aaron Graham took it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to learn how to practice in a way that is
required of a playoff team,'' he said. ``We're not out there
wasting time.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been transferring it from the practice field to
the game field.
</P>
<P>
   That Plummer comes from Arizona State, Graham from Nebraska and
Wadsworth from Florida State is typical of the young Cardinals.
They have drafted players from large winning college programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a correlation,'' Wadsworth said. ``If you don't know
how to lose, that's a big key right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Graham: ``We expect to make the playoffs. The thing in the
back of everyone's mind now is what we're going to do when we get
there. We don't take getting there for granted, but now we know how
to get there, we know what is expected of us, and I think we'll be
there. Then when we get that opportunity, it's what we do with it
that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   That starts with Plummer, an instinctive playmaker and leader
who in his first 26 pro appearances has taken the Cardinals to nine
comeback wins. Plummer must improve his tendency to start slowly in
games and make the killer turnover.
</P>
<P>
   He has to show that his technical skills equal his scrambling
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get Jake to an even broader level of perfection,''
said Marc Trestman, the Cardinals' offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in seven seasons that Plummer will be
coached by the same coordinator in sucessive seasons, and Trestman
said that is apparent already.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably 70 percent better than we were a year ago at
this time,'' Trestman said. ``We understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Plummer didn't fully understand the nuances of
Trestman's West Coast offense. During the bye week, it was
simplified. The result: After averaging 15.6 points and 246.1 yards
in the first eight games, the Cardinals improved to 25.0 points and
392.5 yards in the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different ballgame out here this year,'' Plummer
said. ``I know the plays, so I can concentrate on reading the
defenses. . . . That will help our offense keep moving the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So would another 1,000-yard rushing year from Murrell, whose
cutback skills are well suited to a developing line that can create
a crack but won't always blow a foe off the ball.
</P>
<P>
   So would another NFC-leading receiving year from Frank Sanders,
with help from rookie wideout David Boston and Moore _ if the
team's designated frachise player signs.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, a holdout through preseason last year, had four
sacks. He should more than double that, according to Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Andre is going have a breakout year,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   So should end Simeon Rice, who is in the final year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   What happens at the defensive tackles will be critical. Swann
continues to work to rehabilitate his knee. There has been little
progress in Smith's contract talks. The linebacking corps is
average at best.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary has been upgraded with Corey Chavous, Kwamie
Lassiter, Tommy Bennett and Tom Knight improving to complement
Aeneas Williams. It now is a strength of the team.
</P>
<P>
   The return game should be strong with Boston running back punts
and Michael Pittman and Mario Bates splitting kickoffs. Either
kicker _ Joe Nedney or Chris Jacke _ can win. Punter Scott Player
is getting steadily better.
</P>
<P>
   It's a team that by season's end should be a threat, if it
doesn't let the season get away from it early.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a lot more light at the end of the tunnel
going into this year than a year ago, when we were coming off a
4-12 season,'' Tobin said. ``This year we have accomplished
something and the players know they've accomplished something. They
realize they can play at the level they need to play at. That's a
big step for them. That's something you can talk about, but you
have to experience it to truly believe it.'' &QL;

GRIESE WILL FIGHT GHOST, PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER - Green Bay's Bart Starr couldn't do it. Didn't even come
close.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw also failed to three-peat. So did
Joe Montana with San Francisco, Troy Aikman with Dallas and Bob
Griese with Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Griese, Bob's son, wasn't even born when the Dolphins,
trying to win three consecutive Super Bowls, were knocked out in
the first round of the 1974 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's up to Brian Griese to try to take the Denver
Broncos, back-to-back Super Bowl champions, where no other NFL team
has been. Sure, Griese, 24, led a 1997 Michigan team to a share of
its first national championship in 49 years. But he's also the same
guy who has thrown three passes _ one was intercepted _ for a minus
2 yards in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't think Brian could take us all the way, I wouldn't
have made this decision,'' Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan said last
Monday in promoting Griese to be a starter ahead of veteran Bubby
Brister.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Broncos open the regular season Sept. 13 on
``Monday Night'' ``Football,'' Griese won't be lining up across the
line of scrimmage from Indiana. He'll be playing his father's old
team, the Dolphins, considered by many an AFC title contender.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson, a defensive specialist, would like
nothing better than to knock Griese out of his first start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here one year, so I can't pretend to know everything
that's going on,'' Griese said. ``But I have confidence in this
team and the people that run this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Griese is confident because he knows he has All-Pro running back
Terrell Davis playing alongside him. Davis will try to become the
first running back in league history to rush for 2,000 yards in
back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't measure myself in terms of numbers,'' Davis said. ``I
never have. Numbers don't dictate to me whether I've had a good
season or not.''
</P>
<P>
   How far the Broncos go this season could be up to Griese, who
not only will be the first quarterback in NFL history to make his
starting debut with the defending Super Bowl champions, but it will
be on the same night future Hall of Famer John Elway is inducted
into the Broncos' Ring of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, there is a five-year waiting period for Broncos players
to get that honor. A Broncos official said that with Elway, a Rocky
Mountain majesty who also will have his number retired, there was a
``five-second'' waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   The ghost of Elway can be haunting. Brister found that out in
the three months it appeared he was the heir apparent. The same
Denver newspapers that used to report what Elway gave
trick-or-treaters on Halloween thought football-crazed, inquiring
minds would want to know that Brister got his daughter, Madeline, a
Barbie doll and clothes for her third birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After John retired (in May), things changed for me,'' Brister
said. ``My wife has started going to the grocery store a little bit
more. I put the ball cap on when I go. It's not that bad. It's not
like John. I feel bad for John. He can't go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't changed for Elway, even in retirement. It was big
news when Elway took his family last month to the motorcycle rally
in Sturgis, S.D. It was even bigger news when Elway purchased a 50
percent share of a Web site and an 8 percent share of a financial
services company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure to replace a guy like John Elway is tremendous,''
Shanahan said. ``I think the scrutiny by the media is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Griese is about to find out what it's like to be Elway's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Before Shanahan made his quarterback move, promoting Griese,
Denver radio talk shows were split on who should be the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This decision) will be popular as long as Brian's winning
games,'' Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said. ``As soon as he loses a
few, he'll have the same amount of pressure on him that Bubby
did.'' &QL; 
Great supporting cast
</P>
<P>
   Nobody feels worse for Brister than Broncos linebacker Bill
Romanowski, a former teammate of Brister's with the Philadelphia
Eagles who talked Shanahan into signing him two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Romanowski also thinks the Broncos have enough talent to be
successful regardless of the quarterback. They are one of the
deepest teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Brister was 4-0 as Elway's replacement a year ago, mainly
because of Davis, who last season became the fourth player in
league history to rush for more than 2,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel the burden,'' Davis said. ``When I was in games
with Bubby last year, I didn't feel like I had to go out and carry
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last season, the Broncos set team records for touchdowns
(62), touchdown passes (32), points (501), rushing yardage (2,468)
and total offense (6,092).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great football team,'' Romanowski said. ``We have a
much-improved football team. Look at our depth. Look at our
cornerback situation, now that we've added Dale Carter (in free
agency). I don't know if anybody can compare to our secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to play (Carter) in Kansas City, people usually
didn't throw his way. Now, we know why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' defense was already good before Carter was added.
</P>
<P>
   The team's defense allowed 65 points in three playoff games in
1997. Last season, the defense allowed only 32 points in their
three playoff wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know football know the defense was responsible for
us getting to the playoffs and winning it,'' Romanowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos also have one of the NFL's best offensive minds in
Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a step ahead of everyone else in the league,'' tight end
Shannon Sharpe said last month before deciding to no longer talk to
the media. ``We can survive without John (Elway) or me or maybe
even Terrell. But we might not get by without him.''
</P>
<P>
   So if the Broncos have so much confidence they can win it all in
the post-Elway era, how come they still haven't field his official
retirement papers with the NFL office?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the magnitude of the story if Elway makes a comeback
this season to help the Broncos try to three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. He never once showed up at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are confident they can get to Super Bowl XXXIV in
Atlanta without them, which is why they served Southern cuisine at
camp, dishes they might eat the week of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Griese, raised in south Florida, knows all about Cajun food. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE WINS AFTER SLOW START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRAHAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was an uneven performance, sometimes mediocre
and sometimes crisp. Cal State Northridge football surely can't go
on this way.
</P>
<P>
   Cut this team some slack, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, outplayed in the first 30 minutes of their season
opener against an unknown opponent, slowly showed their superiority
and beat Western Oregon 38-19 on Saturday afternoon at North Campus
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory might not have been impressive enough for most of
the 3,142 fans who entered the gate, who knew the Matadors were one
minute away from winning the Big Sky Conference championship last
year.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring a crazy summer that saw Ron Ponciano fired as
head coach, offensive coordinator Rob Phenice forced to resign and
an internal report released detailing the program's numerous NCAA
violations, just playing the game was enough.
</P>
<P>
   That showed in a first half in which the Matadors sputtered and
made mistake after mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things in the summer, people can say they didn't think
about (them) and they had no effect,'' senior running back Jaumal
Bradley said, ``but it was in the back of my mind. We have a whole
new look. I know a lot of people who watched us play (Saturday)
noticed that we seemed a little different in the things we do. Our
attitude ... we came out a little lax and tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just not mentally focused.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (1-0) didn't seem bothered when Western Oregon scored the
first touchdown of the game _ a 26-yard pass from quarterback Erik
Davis to Derrick Miles with three minutes left in the first
quarter. The players didn't look worried when the Division II
Wolves (0-1) took a 13-3 lead on a 51-yard scoring pass from Davis
to Miles six minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Division I-AA Matadors hadn't lost to a Division II team in
four years. The idea, however, crept into CSUN interim head coach
Jeff Kearin's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thought? How about complete panic and fear?'' Kearin quipped
after the game. ``But I believe in these kids. (At halftime) I saw
no fear in their eyes. There was no doubt in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Arnold, who became the school's all-time leading receiver
in the first half, set the tone in opening the second with a
58-yard kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN wore down the Wolves, not only with quick passes but a
newfound running game. The Matadors, who were last in the Big Sky
in rushing yards last year, averaging 84 per game, had 249 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had 90 yards and two touchdowns, and redshirt freshman
Alan Taylor had a team-leading 94 on only 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big improvement,'' Bradley said. ``(Now) we give an imposing
threat to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors might look a little tougher, choosing to run the
ball in short-yardage situations where they once would have thrown.
But CSUN isn't Michigan or Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Marcus Brady had 45 attempts, completing
28 for 321 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Senior wide receiver Aaron Arnold had 12 catches for 138 yards
and set the school record for receptions in a career late in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, Brady completed passes to eight different
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make things happen,'' Brady said. ``I just had
to get into the flow of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the CSUN secondary, which was thrown in the first quarter
when starting safety Hassan Abdul-Malik re-injured his right
hamstring and left the game. Davis's three touchdown passes were
from 26, 51 and 41 yards, and they all came when a receiver was
open in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't really fooling us,'' said safety Rahman Sparks,
``but there were a couple mistakes I made in coverage. (They) were
just blown assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks intercepted Davis with 11 minutes left in the game. CSUN
cornerback Karalus Doyle picked off Davis on Western Oregon's next
possession, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got us a couple times up the middle,'' Kearin said. ``We
were a little bit hurt when Hassan went out.''

BRONCOS FIGHTING OFF-FIELD DISTRACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Cowboys tried to keep their dynasty afloat in the
mid-1990s, they fought through myriad off-field distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos want to join the Cowboys as the only
three-time Super Bowl winners of the decade. And if the past few
weeks count for anything, the Broncos have the Cowboys' mid-1990s
act down pat.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, free-agent defections, injuries, a coaching change,
and too many run-ins with the police ate away at a Cowboys
franchise that won an unprecedented three Super Bowls in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, free-agent defections, a quarterback controversy,
and now a drug charge threaten to eat away at a Broncos franchise
attempting to win an unprecedented three consecutive Super Bowl
titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos chances of making history in 1999 have been slowly
unraveling since they won Super Bowl XXXIII. Quarterback John Elway
retired. Starting defensive backs Steve Atwater and Darrien Gordon
were not re-signed and accepted free-agent contracts from other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan all but promised Bubby Brister the
job Elway had for 16 years. But Brister played so poorly during the
preseason that Shanahan last week replaced him with second-year
quarterback Brian Griese. Brister was so upset that he stormed out
of camp and said he would have left the team if the only person who
mattered was Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, reports surfaced that starting linebacker Bill
Romanowski faces drug charges on account that he used fraud to get
access to the drug Phenetermine, which is usually prescribed for
severely obese people, but also acts as a stimulant to the central
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Broncos walked out of Texas Stadium last week, beaten
handily by the Cowboys, wide receiver Rod Smith said, ``Don't worry
about us, man, we're going to be OK _ I can promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos even have the mid-1990s Cowboys denial down pat,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan's bunch might get over the free-agent defections, but
you don't lose one of the greatest quarterbacks of all-time and not
be affected. The Broncos have looked awful this summer, and Brister
was a big part of the problem, throwing over or under his receiver
or to the wrong jersey altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan was smart to name Griese the starter. He looks so much
more comfortable in the pocket than Brister, and he made better
decisions.But sooner or later, opposing teams will have figured out
how to play Griese, and the second-year player will certainly
struggle. Then what? Shanahan has said he will play Brister. But
will Brister be willing to play for a coach whom he publicly said
``misled,'' him into believing the starting job was his?
</P>
<P>
   Brister met privately with Shanahan four days after his war of
words with the coach and said there will not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I was just mad at him,'' Brister said. ``But
he is still the boss. ... I feel like I earned the right to start,
but that's not the case right now. I have to swallow my pride and
move on and just be bigger than the situation and be ready when
they need me.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Romanowski is concerned, one of attorneys, Jeffrey
Springer, says his client is not guilty. But until the matter is
settled, the Broncos and Romanowski will have to answer questions
from a media with the right to know. That can take some of the edge
off of your mental preparation for games.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT: Packers coach Ray Rhodes
Rhodes `real fortunate' to land in Green Bay
</P>
<P>
   Like a homeless person who wins the lottery, Ray Rhodes is a new
man in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, Rhodes was one of eight NFL head coaches out of
a job, having been fired from Philadelphia after four seasons in
which his club went from a 10-6 playoff team in 1995 to 3-13 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is head coach of a Green Bay Packers team that has
been to two of the past three Super Bowls, and is one of the NFC
favorites to reach Super Bowl XXXIV in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been real fortunate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Holmgren left Green Bay to take the head
coach//general manager job in Seattle, the first thing Packers
general manager Ron Wolf did was call Rhodes, who had been the
Packers' defensive coordinator in 1992-93. Despite Rhodes' 29-34-1
record in Philadelphia, Wolf said Rhodes, ``was my first choice,
the logical guy to hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes led the Eagles to the playoffs in his first two years
there, but ownership's refusal to be a big player in free agency
led to an evaporation in talent. And after the club posted its
worst record in 30 years, Rhodes got the ax. But he refuses to
point fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They \REagles ownership\S gave me my 11, and the other team
had its 11 out there and a lot of times, their 11 beat my 11,''
Rhodes said after a practice last month. ``That's on me. I'm going
to leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' laid back style has been well-received by Packers
players whose careers began under the fiery approach of Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rarely yells at you and that's important when you are at
practice in front of a lot of people, that makes you feel like a
man, like you'd run through a wall for him,'' defensive tackle
Santana Dotson said. ``But I've told the young guys, just because
coach is nice, he won't be too happy with you come Sunday and you
are not doing what you are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:QUICK HITS \Nsubheds:Chargers DB on thin ice San Diego
Chargers safety Rodney Harrison is on thin ice with the NFL.
Harrison, who was fined $15,000 Wednesday for twice using his
helmet as a weapon to hit St. Louis Rams wide receiver Isaac Bruce
in a preseason game on Friday, was told by Gene Washington, the
NFL's behavior policeman, that one more illegal hit could mean
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Pro Bowl strong safety was fined $10,000 in 1997
for an illegal hit on Kansas City wide receiver Andre Rison and
$10,000 for a hit on San Francisco 49ers wide receiver and current
CBS analyst Brent Jones, which was later appealed and rescinded. He
was also fined $5,000 for a forearm to the face of Carolina wide
receiver Michael Bates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been fined for unnecessary roughness, for hitting players
in the head and neck with his forearm and the last two were for
unnecessary roughness and impermissible use of the helmet,''
Washington said. ``The fines don't seem to be changing his
behavior.''

MEDICINE BALL TO BOWLING BALL  
 A LIGHT-HEARTED LOOK AT CARDS' DEPTH CHART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - There are several ways to analyze a two-deep
roster.
</P>
<P>
   One is with statistics, which often are boring and begin to read
like some kind of mathematical computer printout, which only those
who truly know their icons from their bytes own the patience to
slog through.
</P>
<P>
   It can be presented straight! ZZZZzzzzzzzzzz.
</P>
<P>
   Another way is to present it through Cardinals defensive end
Simeon Rice, who has developed his own language, ``Simeon Speak,''
which only he and his closest friends seemingly understand.
</P>
<P>
   However, in our never-ending desire to serve the masses, the
option here is merely to present it in a slightly off-the-wall
manner: &QL; 
Offense &QL; 
 &UR; Wide receiver: Incompatibility could hurt here. The job is Rob
Moore's, but unless his income is increased soon, the Cardinals
won't find him ``pattable.'' Top draft pick David Boston backs him
up, but he'll also be the third receiver and deep threat when the
Cardinals go to three wideouts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Left tackle: Coaches often punish mental mistakes by ordering
offenders to run three laps around Anthony Clement, 6 feet 8, 325
pounds. Opposing players have found it hard to get around him.
All-purpose Matt Joyce also will play here if Clement's balky back
acts up. Say, has anyone heard from or seen rookie L.J. Shelton?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Left guard: He might look like a giant medicine ball, but Chris
Dishman proved he actually does have joints when he missed the last
three weeks of camp after elbow surgery. Joyce will play here when
Dishman doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Center: Aaron Graham, Dishman's teammate at Nebraska, has
beefed up to 301 pounds and now has the weight to go along with his
cerebral approach to the game. Veteran Mike Devlin provides
dependable backup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Right guard: Lester Holmes is the man here, as soon as he
recovers from injuries he received in the one-car rollover with
teammates Ernest Dye and Carl Simpson. Former Arizona Wildcat Yusuf
Scott will be the listed backup, but Joyce, whose legs could be
worn to stubs by the season's end, will start if Holmes isn't
ready.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Right tackle: James Dexter was Mr. Reliable last year and Jon
Clark is his listed backup. But if Dexter goes down, Joyce will
likely fill in. Do you get the feeling that maybe Joyce is
underpaid?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wide receiver: Frank Sanders has 285 career catches for 3,858
yards and 13 touchdowns. He came up big in the playoff drive last
year and has come up even bigger as a role model to younger
players. Backups here could be either Andy McCullough or Tony
Hamler . . . or someone the waiver wire offers up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quarterback: Jake Plummer, the cereal mogul, is this team's
heart and soul. He is somewhat weak at thumb, though. Dave Brown
will be the man if Plummer goes down, which would be your basic
disaster. No. 3 Chris Greisen will have people asking, ``Stoney
who?'' OK, so they were already asking that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Running back: Adrian Murrell was the sixth NFL player in
history to rush for 1,000 yard for different teams in successive
years. He'll be utilized more as a receiver this year, too. Mario
Bates will be the short-yardage man, with the walking muscle called
Michael Pittman used as a third-down back to replace Larry Centers.
Make it in place of Centers, who's tough to replace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fullback: If Dishman is a medicine ball, then rookie
fourth-round pick Joel Makovicka is a bowling ball with arms.
That's what Dish, who obviously doesn't have a mirror, calls him.
His backup will be either Rod Brown or rookie Dennis McKinley,
neither of whom has Makovicka's grasp of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Place kicking: Nedney Jacke, or is it Joe Chris? It's a battle
yet to be decided. Joe Nedney has more range. Chris Jacke probably
is more accurate. Either can do the job. &QL; 
Defense &QL; 
 &UR; Left end: Andre Wadsworth was slowed because of a tender knee in
camp, but at least he was there this year, and will better show his
talents. He'll be backed up by Brad Ottis, who can also play
inside. Ottis missed last season because of a broken foot, and was
missed greatly. Jomo Cousins, captain of the All-NFL Name Team, is
still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Left tackle: Will Eric Swann's arthritic surgically repaired
knee allow him to play? If it doesn't, circle the wagons.
Otherwise, it's life with journeymen Bernard Wilson, Rashod Swinger
and Jerry Drake. Whoa. Mike Moten is on injured reserve for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Right tackle: The Cardinals better back up the armored truck
and sign Mark Smith or . . . well, its life with journeymen
Simpson, Wilson, Swinger and Drake. Also, a life of misery for the
linebacking corps.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Right end: Simeon Rice has looked so good that people are
starting to understand what he says. Rice didn't miss a practice in
his first full camp and looks to be better than his All-Rookie form
three years ago. He's even showing signs of playing the run! Ottis
plays behind him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Left linebacker: Jamir Miller is gone and now hates the world
from Cleveland, so the Cardinals signed Detroit's Rob Fredrickson.
He is better vs. the pass than Miller, but not nearly the run
supporter. Florida rookie Johnny Rutledge will likely back him up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Middle linebacker: Pound for pound, Ron McKinnon is great.
Unfortunately, there aren't that many pounds, and if Swann and
Smith are missing, he could be standing in the middle of a freeway.
Mark Maddox was an adequate backup last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Right linebacker: Starter Patrick Sapp, a standout
special-teams player, is an inflated college quarterback who, in
his fourth season, has better learned the nuances of the position.
Sapp started during the playoff drive last season, after taking the
job from Tony McCombs, who again will provide backup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Left cornerback: Aeneas Williams is All-Pro and the defense's
answer to Plummer on offense. Alas, he doesn't have a cereal to
call his own. Williams was played sparingly in preseason because of
a head and neck injury. Ty Howard, locked in a battle for roster
survival with rookie Coby Rhinehart, is listed as the backup, but
Tommy Knight would move from a right corner backup role to start if
Aeneas goes down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Right cornerback: Corey Chavous, the walking encyclopedia of
football lore, moved from safety to this position last year. Opened
eyes. If he continues to improve, the Cardinals' corners could be
among best in the league. Knight hopefully has put slap lesions and
injuries behind and will see a lot of action in nickel and dime
packages.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Free safety: Kwamie Lassiter took the job late in the season
and finished as the NFC's leader in interceptions. That's
reasonably strong. J.J. McCleskey, who had a few starts at corner
last year, is Lassiter's backup at 5-8 (can you buy elevator
cleats?).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Strong safety: Solid position with Tommy Bennett and Pat
Tillman, who moves from free safety. Bennett, an unrestricted free
agent at year's end, is looking to have a big year for obvious
rea$on$. Tillman enjoys running full tilt into solid objects and is
better suited for this position.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Punter: Scott Player, who showed in preseason that he's no
threat as a running back or quarterback, will be fine when he
learns to take his practice field punting to the arena on Sundays.
No guarantees, however. &QL;

TOUGH SCHEDULE GIVES  ARIZONA FEW BREAKS

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers were
the feel-good stories of 1997 when soft schedules helped propel
them into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, both were out of the playoffs, their fans
questioning whether they were one-year wonders.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals could be in the same boat this year after using a
fifth-place schedule to help them end the league's longest playoff
drought.
</P>
<P>
   They finished the 1998 regular season at 9-7, earning a playoff
berth in a non-strike year for the first time since 1975. Then, the
Cardinals upset NFC East champion Dallas in the first round, their
first playoff victory in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Cardinals will be minus their all-time leading
receiver (Larry Centers), their top tackler of a year ago (Jamir
Miller) and a seven-time Pro Bowl left offensive tackle (Lomas
Brown).
</P>
<P>
   They also play the league's fourth-toughest schedule and the
second-toughest in the NFC, behind only the Buccaneers, whose
opponents were 138-118 last season, a .539 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' opponents were 137-119 last season, a .535
winning percentage, a tougher schedule than even Super Bowl
champion Denver will play.
</P>
<P>
   On the Cardinals' schedule are three division champions _
Atlanta, 14-2 in winning the NFC West; the New York Jets, 12-4 in
winning the AFC East; and Dallas, 10-6 in winning the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, playoff teams Miami, Buffalo, New England, Green
Bay and San Francisco are on the Cardinals' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals even got a bad break in their interconference
games against AFC East foes. They play everyone in the division
except last-place Indianapolis as part of the NFL's rotating
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Other than divisional foes Philadelphia and Washington, the only
team on the Cardinals' schedule that had a losing record year ago
is Detroit, which was 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Cardinals won five games against last-place
teams _ Chicago, St. Louis, San Diego and Philadelphia twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants can relate. They went from worst-to-first in winning
the 1997 NFC East crown. But they lost last season to Tampa Bay,
Atlanta, Green Bay, San Francisco and Dallas, all playoff teams, in
finishing 8-8 and out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, playing a second-place schedule last year, began the
season with two losses and never recovered. The Buccaneers lost
three consecutive games in midseason to Tennessee, Jacksonville and
Detroit to fall out of the playoff race.

DON'T BE TAKEN ABACK, DRAFT ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To draft a winning fantasy football team this year, you'll have
to avoid the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few NFL backfields are overstocked with running backs,
all fighting for starting jobs. Other teams are overflowing with
quarterbacks, meaning starters can turn into backups faster than
you can say  &UR; Scott Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the first priority is running back. The position is
as thin as ever, and  &UR; Barry Sanders' retirement doesn't help
matters. Grab a steady back early in the draft, and stay away from
teams that are leaving voice mail messages for  &UR; Eddie Lee Ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's  &UR; Terrell Davis should be the first pick in any draft.
There's a precipitous drop in talent after that.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most muddled situations is in Miami, where Coach
 &UR; Jimmy
 &UR; Johnson realizes he is two players away from a championship.
Unfortunately, those two players are  &UR; Troy Aikman and  &UR; Emmitt
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's not one to give up easily. He brought three running
backs to camp, all with an equal chance of starting.
</P>
<P>
   There's incumbent  &UR; Karim Abdul- &QL; 
 &UR; Jabbar, Mississippi State rookie  &UR; James Johnson and Louisiana
State/McNeese State rookie  &UR; Cecil (``Fought Law, Law Won'')
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Collins has looked good early, while James Johnson has been
dinged up in camp. I expect Collins to win the starting job, but we
could see big doses of all three, meaning rotten stats for fantasy
owners.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, the Raiders aren't sold on  &UR; Napoleon Kaufman, so
they've brought in a slew of other running backs _ all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe  &UR; Al Davis thinks he's Dr. Frankenstein and can
build a decent back from the likes of  &UR; Zack Crockett, Rashaan
Salaam,
 &UR; Tyrone Wheatley and  &UR; Randy Jordan. Methinks not.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore,  &UR; Errict Rhett will handle the goal-line duties for
 &UR; Priest Holmes, who was inconsistent last year.  &UR; Charles Evans
lurks, and you know how painful that can be.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens also will play the quarterback shuffle, with
fumble-prone  &UR; Tony Banks pressing Mitchell, who at one time was an
actual NFL quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, everybody thought  &UR; Skip Hicks would be the
starting running back. Everybody except Coach  &UR; Norv Turner, who
said  &UR; Stephen
 &UR; Davis might push for the job.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Redskins receiver  &UR; Michael Westbrook says he's
aiming for the Pro Bowl this year. As long as he's not aiming for
Stephen Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Ohio State standout  &UR; David Boston will probably take
some receptions away from  &UR; Frank Sanders and  &UR; Rob Moore.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of  &UR; Jake Plummer's health with the
departure of left tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown. Should Plummer go down, the
Cardinals will turn to the always underwhelming  &UR; Dave Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell remains a middle-round
pick, mostly because he's too small (215 pounds) to handle the ball
at the goal line. This season, he'll again be lifted for  &UR; Mario
Bates or
 &UR; Michael Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Some sleepers and busts for draft day: &QL; 
Sleepers &QL; 
Both the Steelers and the Rams grabbed talented wide receivers in
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh picked Louisiana Tech star  &UR; Troy Edwards, who scored
27 touchdowns his senior year and lit up Nebraska for a record 405
yards and three scores. The Steelers don't have much depth at wide
receiver, so Edwards should play early and often.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams picked  &UR; Torry Holt, a North Carolina State receiver who
looked good in the preseason. He was more valuable, however, before
the season-ending injury to St. Louis quarterback  &UR; Trent Green.
</P>
<P>
   I also like rookie running back  &UR; Kevin Faulk, who may start for
the Patriots, and  &UR; Bill Schroeder, who will play across from
 &UR; Antonio
 &UR; Freeman at wide receiver for the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a late-round pick: receiver  &UR; E.G. Green of
Indianapolis. &QL; 
Potential busts &QL; 
Every year, we hear how New England wide receiver  &UR; Terry Glenn is
poised to burn up the league. Every year, Glenn succumbs to a
series of minor injuries and plays poorly. This time, it's a sore
toe. Draft him at your own risk.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina running back  &UR; Tim Biakabutuka has the starting job, but
it's doubtful he will keep it. Despite off-field problems,  &UR; Fred
 &UR; (``Missed the Plane'') Lane will probably see significant action
for the Panthers. If not him, then  &UR; William Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason Denver quarterback  &UR; Bubby Brister has been a
career backup. After watching Brister flail about in preseason,
Denver will go with  &UR; Brian Griese. Once Bubby, twice shy. &QL; 
Bill Muller's Fantasy Football notebook appears every Friday. He
can be reached at (602) 444-8178 or at bill.muller(at)pni.com via

UCLA DEFENSE IMPROVES ITS IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ And for the role of college football's most
dramatic turnaround, the early 1999 nominee is:
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA defense.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those arm-tackling, yards-giving, season-ruining matadors
of yesteryear, showed up in their opening game of the new season
and made like the Steel Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   So it came Saturday night against that former junior college
power Boise State, it still bordered on impressive.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins opened slowly, leading 3-0 at the end of the
first quarter, it was the UCLA defense that stepped up big.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the defense gave up the big plays. On this night, it
made them.
</P>
<P>
   All those new starters, all those stand-ins and backups to the
backups, put together a marvelous effort and flirted with recording
UCLA's first shutout in three years in the 38-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been looking forward to this since last January,''
said UCLA's new defensive coordinator, Bob Field. ``They have
something to prove. I think they took a step towards that
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling most of last year and ending the season with
two embarrassing losses when a national title was within reach, the
UCLA defense came into the Rose Bowl on Saturday with six new
starters and plenty more questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well last year, and then those last two games
put our season in perspective,'' said sophomore strong safety
Julius Williams. ``We didn't tackle well. We lined up in wrong
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we just wanted to swarm to the ball and show the UCLA
defense is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Their defense started to take control early in the second
quarter. With the Bruins leading 10-0, Williams stepped in front of
a Bart Hendricks pass and returned it 53 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the Broncos' next possession, free safety Joey Strycula _ who
had been the holder for the past three years and one of the new
starters _ read a screen pass and intercepted it at the Boise State
23, returning it 7 yards to set up a short UCLA touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long I was excited,'' Strycula said. ``I couldn't
sleep. I felt like I was going to throw up before the game. But
then after the first snap, it all came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos tried it again, but this time it was freshman
cornerback Joe Hunter who picked off Hendricks. If the team were
not riddled by suspensions over the disabled-parking pass fiasco,
Field said, none of the three who pulled down interceptions
probably would have started.
</P>
<P>
   These new, and seemingly improved, Bruins went in at the half in
command, up 24-0.
</P>
<P>
   It would never get much better for the Broncos. A UCLA team that
allowed more than 28 points per game last season, had opened its
new campaign under Field in impressive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tired of reading all those bad things about
themselves in the papers,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, no one is mistaking the Broncos for some national
powerhouse. This oh-so-young defense could get a glimpse of both
ends of the collegiate spectrum next week when the Bruins travel to
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking anything away from Boise State, they're
tough,'' Strycula said. ``But we know there will be tougher games
ahead.''

`OLD PRO' KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The old pro will awaken in a Philadelphia hotel
room, without the aid of an alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   It is Sunday, 5:30 a.m. In 7{ hours, the Cardinals play the
Eagles in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Time to put on his game face.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Junkin inspects his fingers. He trimmed his nails the night
before, collected the clippings and flushed them down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m., he showers. He stretches.
</P>
<P>
   Then he crawls back in bed and ``pretends'' to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., when Cardinals players receive a wake-up call, the
17-year NFL veteran and oldest player on the team, takes
``another'' hot shower. He splashes on cologne. The brand he wears
only on game day.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is at 9 a.m. The Cardinals' long snapper always
arrives 45 minutes early. He pours a cup of coffee. Reads the
paper. Reviews the special-teams report.
</P>
<P>
   His pre-game meal ``never'' varies. Baked potato, topped with
spaghetti and tomato sauce. A bowl of oatmeal sprinkled with brown
sugar. A protein bar.
</P>
<P>
   At the table, he shakes salt into his palm and tosses the grains
over his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He rides with the trainers to the game. He wants to be the first
player to arrive at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In that quiet hour, he sits on a table in the visiting team's
locker room. Assistant trainer Jeff Herndon tapes his ankles,
always the left one first. Junkin's left knee _ the one scarred
from six surgeries _ the old pro tapes himself.
</P>
<P>
   He smears petroleum jelly on his toes ``to prevent blisters.''
Next, the ritual of dressing for battle begins. Left under-sock,
right under-sock. Left game sock, then the right one. He pulls on
an elastic girdle and his game pants. Left shoe. Right shoe.
Assistant trainer Jim Shearer ``spats'' both with a spool of
adhesive tape.
</P>
<P>
   A linebacker from Louisiana Tech, Junkin broke into the NFL in
1983. He played for the Bills, the Redskins, the Raiders, the
Seahawks. The Cardinals, needing someone who could deliver the ball
on target to the punter, signed him during the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday's opener in Veterans Stadium will mark his 233rd NFL
game. He is 38 years old. He was 17 when rookie David Boston was
born.
</P>
<P>
   He folds two sticks of Big Red gum into his mouth. Two other
pieces (for later) go into his cubicle. Game program in hand, he
enters the nearly empty stadium. Alone, he walks along the chalked
hash marks, goal line to goal line, carefully inspecting the field.
</P>
<P>
   He stretches out in one end zone. He loosens up. Looking around,
he takes it all in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest time for me is Sunday morning when I'm in the
stadium by myself,'' the old pro says. ``I'm lying on the turf.
Smelling the grass. Hopefully, the sun is shining. It's hard to
explain, but for thoses 15 or 20 minutes, it's the best feeling.
It's what I live for. When I finish playing, that's the one thing I
will miss the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He thumbs through the program and tosses it to a fan in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   As teammates begin drifting into the arena, he tosses a football
with punter Scott Player. Standing at the 20-yard line, he turns
and takes aim at the nearest goal post and fires. Five throws. ``If
I hit (the crossbar) the first time,'' he says, ``we're going to
have a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the locker room, on goes the armor, shoulder pads
first. Then the wristbands, left then right. He tapes his fingers
on his left hand, then his right. And both thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Then he sits near the door and waits, alone with his thoughts,
feeling the excitement build. He knows his superstitions seem silly
to others. But there is a rhythm to the reassuring rituals he
performs. The old pro is ``getting ready.'' Each quirky habit, one
built upon the next, tells him, ``This is it. . . this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game begins, he isn't nervous. But he knows what
happens the first time the Cardinals have to punt. As he jogs onto
the field, ``suddenly I can't breathe.'' The distance from the
sideline to the ball isn't far. ``It takes _ what? _ three or four
seconds, but I feel like I'm running underwater. It's the longest
run of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he is over the ball. He hears the count.
</P>
<P>
   From his hands, through his legs, the snap a tight spiral. Then,
the thud as foot meets ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as just a job,'' the old pro says. ``I'm here to
snap the ball.'' He laughs. ``And be the weirdest guy on the
team.'' &QL;

CARDINALS IN A STATE OF GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm sitting in the dugout at Wrigley Field. A face emerges from
the clubhouse, and just like that, Cubs star Mark Grace is standing
in front of me. He has a very serious look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he says, ``what's happening with the Cardinals?''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first week in August, and suddenly, I'm wondering if
Mark McGwire has been traded or if the Gateway Arch has collapsed
on Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is getting impatient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the Cardinals,'' Grace said. ``You know I live in
Arizona, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that I knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know I'm a season ticket holder?'' Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   That I did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Grace said. ``I rarely miss a game.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, you'll find Cardinals fans everywhere. Last year, an
adult-film director named Seymour Butts showed up at training camp,
with one of his starlets in tow. I ran into him in a Flagstaff bar,
and after the chance meeting, I was somewhat curious to discuss his
line of work. Sorry, he only wanted to talk about the Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' Luis Gonzalez is purchasing season tickets.
E-mail from across the country fills my computer every time the
Cardinals are in the news. Jake Plummer is doing national
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that this franchise is hot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only they can remember how to win football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about that,'' Grace said. ``They've got San
Francisco, Green Bay, Atlanta and the AFC East (as non-conference
opponents). They're playing a witch of a schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Cardinals fans across the nation, Grace grew
up in St. Louis. But he left the Midwest before Cardinals owner
Bill Bidwill did, so much of the natural anger is missing from
Grace's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I'm curious what he thinks of Bidwill. After all,
Bidwill never hides his deep disdain for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Bidwill basher by any means,'' Grace said. ``During
the lean years, he could've put a better product out there on the
field. But now he's starting to open his pocketbook a little more
often. I think he realizes the times are changing, football is
changing and, in the end, you get what you pay for. And I'm glad to
see he's doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Grace has never met Mark Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Like any self-respecting millionaire, Grace does not sit on the
aluminum bleachers frying in the desert sun. For the sake of
comfort, he has a loge box. But he is not a dispassionate fan or a
bandwagon type who shows up for the chilled shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he missed only the game against the New Orleans
Saints, and that one he watched at a sports book in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Grace remains largely unnoticed at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much more recognizable in Chicago,'' Grace said. ``When
I'm at Cardinals games, all I ever hear is, `Hey, Travis Lee is
better than you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, that won't happen this season, either.
</P>
<P>
   What ``will'' happen, nobody knows. Grace is somewhat leery,
somewhat apprehensive, somewhat giddy over the swift turnaround the
franchise pulled off in 1998. That combination of emotions makes
him the prototypical Cardinals fan. And like everyone else, his
focus starts with the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Jake (Plummer) when he was at ASU,'' Grace said. ``He's
a good guy, a fun-loving guy, a guy who likes to get out a little
bit. And in that respect, he's a young Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for a guy who is not very big, he's tough. He takes a lot
of hits, he gets the (expletive) beat out of him, he gets back up.
And then he beats you. I love a guy who will go out there every day
and take his lumps.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Cubs, taking your lumps is something Grace
knows a lot about. And as The Sequel gets ready to unfold in the
Valley, Grace only hopes the magic at Sun Devil Stadium lasts a bit
longer than it does at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't I know it,'' he said. ``But I'll be there. I'm the
biggest Cardinals fan around.'' &QL;

BRADY DELIVERS WHEN IT COUNTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As first-game performances go, there were the
typical mistakes, misreads and stretches of uneven play. But every
so often, Cal State Northridge quarterback Marcus Brady converted
one of those magical plays that obliges Matadors coach Jeff Kearin
to proclaim him the one of the best quarterbacks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of play that earned Brady the Big Sky Conference
Newcomer of the Year honor in 1998, and the kind the Matadors must
have this year if they are to challenge for the conference title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get us out of a lot of trouble this year, and
he's going to make us coaches look a lot better and a lot
smarter,'' Kearin said Saturday after CSUN opened 1999 with a 38-19
win over gritty Western Oregon. ``And he's only going to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady was brilliant at times on Saturday, rescuing the Matadors
from a potentially devastating loss against an NCAA Division II
team.
</P>
<P>
   And he was at his best when Northridge absolutely needed him to
be.
</P>
<P>
   With the Matadors trailing 13-10 in the third quarter, he
completed two long passes to preserve a drive that eventually
enabled the Matadors to take a 17-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   First he side-stepped a Western Oregon tackler in the end zone
on third and long at the Matadors five-yard line, then danced a few
steps to his right and threw 26 yards to Aaron Arnold for the first
down. Seven plays later on a fourth-and-3 at the Wolves' 30-yard
line, Brady checked off at the line of scrimmage when he noticed
Western Oregon was about to blitz, then threw 28 yards to Drew
Amerson, his boyhood friend from San Diego, for another first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of the thing he can do,'' Kearin said.
``That's what makes him one of the best NCAA Division I-AA
quarterbacks in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The two plays were vintage Brady, showing off his athletic
ability, resourcefulness and throwing arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the (tackler) at my feet in the end zone, but I knew I
was strong enough to break out of that,'' Brady said. ``Then I just
did what I was supposed to do, make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady threw an interception in the second quarter and finished
with 321 yards and two touchdowns on 28 of 48 passes, but wasn't
satisfied with his performance. Neither was Kearin, who said Brady
seemed tentative at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even said afterward that he wasn't real happy with the way
he played,'' Kearin said. ``But I think it was just first-game
jitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady, who passed for 2,974 yards and 25 touchdowns a year ago,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking too much and I wasn't relaxed,'' he said. ``But
once I got into the flow of the game I started to relax and have
fun. I always play better when I'm having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady was more upset than worried when Western Oregon led 13-10
at halftime. He knew the Matadors were physically superior to the
Wolves, so there was no panic in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't make any adjustments other than mental
ones,'' Brady said. ``We knew that once we calmed down, we'd be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Brady at quarterback, that should be the case all year
for Northridge.

10 THINGS TO WATCH FOR THIS SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; 1. The Broncos, trying to become the first team to win three
consecutive Super Bowl titles, will wrap up the AFC West crown by
Halloween, Thanksgiving or Christmas? &QL; 
 &UR; 2. The NFL's richest owner, Paul Allen of the Seattle Seahawks,
didn't make Mike Holmgren the NFL's wealthiest coach to extend the
league's longest playoff drought. The Seahawks will reach the
playoffs for the first time since 1988. &QL; 
 &UR; 5. The league's best coach, Bill Parcells of the New York Jets, has
one more magic trick up his sleeve before he retires: Find a way to
get the all-time goat of the Fiesta Bowl, quarterback Vinny
Testaverde, to lead the Jets to the Super Bowl. &QL; 
 &UR; 3. Name the team that won't get at least 100 yards rushing against
the Cardinals. Sorry, the Amsterdam Admirals aren't on this year's
schedule. &QL; 
 &UR; 4. The first NFL coach fired will be a) Bruce Coslet, b) Bobby
Ross, c) Pete Carroll, d) Norv Turner? &QL; 
 &UR; 6. Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis will try to move the team back to
Los Angeles before the league puts an expansion team there. &QL; 
 &UR; 7. New Orleans Saints Coach Mike Ditka, who traded most of his
franchise for the rights to Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams,
will blow his top after the rookie running back goes on injured
reserve because of a recurring ankle injury. &QL; 
 &UR; 8. Ditka, upset by a loss to NFC West-rival San Francisco, vows
never, ever, ever to coach again. &QL; 
 &UR; 9. With so many running backs and so few wide receivers, Miami
Coach Jimmy Johnson will consider installing the wishbone offense. &QL; 
 &UR; 10. The crazed fans of the expansion Browns won't care if the team
wins even five games as long as one is against owner Art Modell's
Baltimore Ravens. &QL;

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MONTREAL _ The Montreal Expos did everything possible to give away
Saturday's game. The Astros gave it right back.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then in the 10th inning, plate umpire Tim Timmons handed it back
to the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell scored the go-ahead run on a controversial call at
home plate, the first run in a three-run outburst that allowed the
Astros to steal a 5-2 victory from the Expos before another
smallish crowd (8,471) at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A terrific pitching duel between Shane Reynolds and Javier
Vazquez was overshadowed by an error-infested game by the Expos,
then by the Houston bullpen's inability to hold a two-run lead, and
finally by the questionable call in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit a two-out double off Ugueth Urbina in the 10th
inning. Bagwell stole third on a 3-1 wild pitch to Russ Johnson and
headed for home as the ball got away from catcher Chris Widger.
</P>
<P>
   Widger threw to Urbina (6-6), who juggled the ball in his arms
while he blocked the plate. With his view blocked, Timmons, one of
22 newly hired umpires, made a safe call before Bagwell pushed his
foot between Urbina's legs to touch the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell followed with a two-run homer to right as the Astros
remained 2{ games ahead of Cincinnati in the National League
Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I touched it late, whatever that means,'' Bagwell said. ``I'm
pretty much out there (running the bases) on my own. I was stealing
third, and as I got to third I knew the ball had gotten away. All
of our guys were yelling and screaming, so I said, `Heck, I'll give
it a shot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't plan on getting too many hits off Urbina. He's one
of the best closers in the league. I took a chance, and fortunately
it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros nearly wasted an impressive pitching performance by
Reynolds, who tossed seven shutout innings but was forced to leave
the game in the eighth after hurting his left knee sliding into
second base on a pickoff attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The injury was not believed to be serious, and manager Larry
Dierker said he took Reynolds out of the game as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to get out of here with a win the way things
turned out,'' Dierker said. ``Shane was pitching his best game of
the whole year. I don't think they would have scored off him the
way he was throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has six or seven more starts for us, and I didn't want to
jeopardize the rest of his starts by trying to send him out there
with a sore knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who is without a victory since Aug. 5, gave up four
hits. Vazquez allowed just three and struck out seven in eight
innings, at one point retiring 11 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal made four errors, three in the eighth as the Astros
took a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds opened the eighth with a ground ball that third baseman
Shane Andrews threw past first for a two-base error. After Craig
Biggio sacrificed, second baseman Jose Vidro misplayed Stan
Javier's grounder to allow the game's first run to score.
</P>
<P>
   The ball then got by Vladimir Guerrero _ his 17th error _ and
Bagwell followed with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal leads the major leagues with 138 errors and has
committed six in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2-0 lead lasted just minutes as the Expos rallied for
two runs in the bottom of the eighth off Jay Powell and Billy
Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Powell allowed hits to both batters he faced, and Wagner walked
Geoff Blum to load the bases with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White's sacrifice fly and Wilton Guerrero's RBI single
made it 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's throw from right pulled catcher Tony Eusebio off the
plate, and Orlando Merced slid past the tag for the tying run. It
was only the third blown save for Wagner in 36 chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated it for Shane. I was terrible,'' Powell said. ``I fell
behind both hitters. I had to give them fastballs. I put everybody
in a tough situation. It's my job, and I just didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cabrera (4-0) picked up the win, allowing one hit in two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   With runs scarce, the Astros failed to cash in on their
opportunities early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Ken Caminiti led off with a double to center
field and Bell reached on an error by shortstop Mike Mordecai. Matt
Mieske could not execute the bunt and struck out, and Eusebio flied
to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ricky Gutierrez sent a deep drive to right field but was
robbed when Guerrero made a running, over-the-shoulder catch near
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had two runners on base in the ninth, but Gutierrez
flied out to center and pinch hitter Bill Spiers popped out.

A QUIET ROAR COMES FROM KEARIN'S WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A couple of nights before his Cal State Northridge
head-coaching debut, Jeff Kearin met a few old law-school friends
at a beachfront restaurant. He was the one in a T-shirt, a whistle
hanging out of his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's a football coach and they're attorneys, he was bound
to hear some unsolicited advice.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Davie is a wuss! John Robinson is a wuss!'' a woman, a
Notre Dame fan, told him. ``You've gotta be hard on those guys
(players)!''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, a Robinson protege, could only laugh. He is not and
never will be the drill sergeant some fans like to see on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a real hard-ass, not a real screamer and yeller,'' he
said this week. ``I'm not into the Knute Rockne-Vince Lombardi
stereotype.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kearin's laid-back self-image was tested early and often in
Northridge's 38-19 victory over Western Oregon on a sunny Saturday
afternoon at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors committed 15 penalties, including two for
``unsportsmanlike'' excessive celebrating and one for a late hit.
They were offsides on a kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not about that,'' Kearin said later of the personal
fouls. ``We are not going to be a cheap-shot team. Guys are not
going to play if they do those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors fumbled away a scoring chance on their first
possession, had to settle for a field goal on their second after a
botched pitchout, and threw an interception that led to a Western
Oregon touchdown. The fumble might have been the result of an
official's bad call.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got me a little hot,'' Kearin said, taking his emotional
temperature after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of the frustrations of the season's first 30 minutes,
in which the Matadors trailed 13-3 against a Division II team,
produced the kind of fire-and-brimstone halftime speech that
Kearin's friend from the restaurant would have preferred.
</P>
<P>
   There was no exhortation to win one for the Gipper, or for Ron
Ponciano, or for the neighborly homeowners of the Lindley West
Coalition, or for whomever the young Matadors are playing this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just, `Stop making mistakes,''' Kearin said, relaxing
with a Diet Pepsi later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a grilling or yelling or anything like that,''
running back Jaumal Bradley said. ``It was, `Calm down. Settle
down.'''
</P>
<P>
   That, for better or worse, is the coach Northridge hired six
weeks ago, at least on an interim basis, after the popular Ponciano
was fired because the administration believed he'd violated NCAA
and university rules.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, 39, comes off as a thoroughly nice individual _
self-deprecating (``I'm a little unprepared'') but confident (he
predicts a Big Sky Conference championship), just enough of a
Pollyanna to call this ``the best job in college football'' but
just enough of a realist to add ``for me, not for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone described him as a real person who happens to be a
football coach. If you've met many football coaches, you know
that's saying a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin's refreshingly non-confrontational personality is one
reason he was hired. His knowledge of NCAA athletic-department
rules _ after dealing with compliance and eligibility issues as a
Northridge assistant _ is another.
</P>
<P>
   But removing his ``interim'' label will require a measure of
success on the field after the Matadors' improved, 7-4 season under
Ponciano in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the job in January,'' Kearin said, ``if I don't
win and/or I cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge should win by more than 19 points against a school
like Western Oregon, the softest opponent on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The sloppy first half could be laid at the feet of the
first-time head coach. Maybe a Rockne-style pre-game pep talk would
have helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a couple of series into the game before I thought,
`Hey, the season's started!''' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley blamed himself and other seniors for that, saying if
anybody is responsible for firing up the team, it's them, not the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Can a nice guy find happiness in the head coach's office? The
guess here is while Kearin won't win the Big Sky championship, he
won't finish last either.
</P>
<P>
   The next game on the Matadors' schedule is at Kansas, and if
they had Rockne and Lombardi, that would be too much to overcome.
</P>

rebuilds, starting with the league's worst defense. Seifert didn't
stand pat, making wholesale roster changes immediately. It will
take time to get a franchise that has been a one-hit wonder to a
consistently high level. &QL;

faces. &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PERISH IF: No one steps forward to claim the quarterback spot.
Former Cardinal Steve Beuerlein is challenged by former Northern

MUTINY MAUL REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution's playoff chances should be
fading along with their confidence. But even after a 5-1 loss to
the Tampa Bay Mutiny Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, the Revolution remain in
contention for an Eastern Conference playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Revolution will have to rediscover their mental
edge and also rebuild their defense if they expect success against
Kansas City here Tuesday and at Miami Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This latest loss, the Revolution's eighth home defeat, continued
their nearly pointless second half of the season. They had a
strong, aggressive start of the game but were far too vulnerable
defensively to contend with a Tampa Bay team that has rejuvenated
itself for a playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most lopsided Revolution home defeat since a 5-1
loss to Los Angeles Aug. 22, 1998, the day Walter Zenga agreed to
join them as coach. Zenga initially appeared to have reorganized
the Revolution and kept them in contention for much of this season.
But they have collapsed in the second half, failing to win in
regulation time since July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned in my life to deal with the positive and the
negative,'' Zenga said. ``And the only positive thing now is that
we are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a lot of time to try to understand what happened
since we beat New York July 4. The players are the same and the
practices are the same. This is my first year coaching and I've
made some mistakes. It's my responsibility, my job, and I have to
try to keep the team positive for Tuesday's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga had reorganized the New England defense and appeared to
have transformed the team's mentality during the first half of the
season. But the Revolution have broken down much as they have in
the last three seasons, enduring long losing streaks and seldom
appearing to have the resourcefulness to overcome their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, Tampa Bay began with a defensive mindset, using
Raul Diaz Arce and Manny Lagos as strikers. The Revolution went on
the offensive early, but the Mutiny retained its composure.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Dos Santos, making his first start since May 15, energized
the Revolution midfield while marking Carlos Valderrama. In the
14th minute, Dos Santos made an interception and carried over the
center line before curling a cross that Joe-Max Moore volleyed
right at goalkeeper Scott Garlick.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, a long pass to Valderrama caused a defensive
mixup, and Lagos converted.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Revolution quickly tied the score. Joe-Max Moore
set up the goal by chipping a soft pass for Mario Gori to head
toward Giovanni Savarese, who headed in from 10 yards in the 17th
minute. It was Savarese's seventh goal of the season, his first
since July 4.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 21st minute Tampa Bay went ahead again, as Lagos
capitalized on a Gori mistake and went in alone on Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   That goal seemed to deflate the Revolution. Diaz Arce, who
scored 18 goals for the Revolution last season, had two near misses
in the 34th minute, then scored in the 38th, rolling in a pass from
Mauricio Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution regrouped at halftime, and in the first 10
seconds of the second half Ivan McKinley volleyed a long John
Harkes pass just wide of the far post after colliding with Dominic
Kinnear, who was injured and replaced by Steve Trittschuh.
</P>
<P>
   In the third minute, the Mutiny sealed the victory as Lagos
outpaced Mike Burns and Brian Dunseth and crossed to Valderrama,
who scored for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga soon brought in several substitutes, including Jeff Causey
in goal.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos set up Ramos for Tampa Bay's final goal in the 74th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga was philosophical, saying, ``That was symptomatic of our
situation: We have a great ball and miss by inches on a shot that
would have made the score 3-2, and they score on their first action
of the half.''

270-pounder who can run sideline to sideline. &QL;

Philadelphia. &QL; 
 &UR; TEST OF WILL: Will six games against the lowly Bengals and Ravens
and expansion Browns leave the Steelers bored? &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PREVAIL IF: QB Kordell Stewart doesn't self-destruct again. It
will be up to Gilbride to help Stewart grow up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL PERISH IF: Stewart and Cowher go jaw-to-jaw on the
sideline again this season. It was great entertainment but didn't
help the Steelers win. &QL;

 &UR; 3. Tennessee Titans &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 1998 ISSUE: 8-8, second. &QL; 
 &UR; FEARLESS LEADER: Jeff Fisher (32-38). &QL; 
 &UR; HALL OF JUSTICE: Adelphia Coliseum (67,000). &QL; 
 &UR; THE NEW AVENGERS: There will be a whole new defensive line. Free
agents Jason Fisk (formerly of Vikings) and Mike Jones (formerly of
Rams) and first-round pick Jevon Kearse are expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STILL A GOOD  &UR; GUY: Eddie George is considered one of the best
backs in the league after three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. &QL; 
 &UR; GONE TO EVIL FORCES: C Mark Stepnoski never felt comfortable in
Tennessee and has returned to Dallas. &QL; 
 &UR; TEST OF WILL: There will be big changes if the Titans don't make
the playoffs, which could be determined by the final three games _
Atlanta (Dec. 19), Jacksonville (Dec. 26) and at Pittsburgh (Jan.
2).  &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PREVAIL IF: QB Steve McNair finally lives up to his potential.
He made few mistakes last season but also not many big plays. He
completed only two passes of more than 40 yards and averaged only
6.56 yards per attempt. &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PERISH IF: The coaches don't take the shackles off McNair and
let him use his athletic ability. He has been hurt by a
conservative offensive philosophy. &QL;

 &UR; 4. Baltimore Ravens &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 1998 ISSUE: 6-10, fourth. &QL; 
 &UR; FEARLESS LEADER: Brian Billick (first year as NFL head coach). &QL; 
 &UR; HALL OF JUSTICE: PSI Net Stadium (69,354). &QL; 
 &UR; THE NEW AVENGERS: Billick might have rebuilt Randall Cunningham's
career a year ago, but he will be tested this time with this motley
crew of QBs _ Scott Mitchell, Tony Banks and Stoney Case. &QL; 
 &UR; STILL A GOOD  &UR; GUY: The Cardinals bypassed Jonathan Ogden in the
draft three years ago and he has become one of the best OTs in the
league. &QL; 
 &UR; GONE TO EVIL FORCES: How did the Ravens let free-agent offensive
linemen Willie Williams (Saints) and Orlando Brown (Browns) get
away? &QL; 
 &UR; TEST OF WILL: The Ravens were given one of those dreaded
back-to-back-to-back trips. Midway through November, they play at
Cleveland, Jacksonville and Cincinnati. &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PREVAIL IF: Billick truly is an offensive genius. He has
little talent at quarterback and running back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL PERISH IF: Mitchell is the starting QB. He couldn't even
win in Detroit playing alongside RB Barry Sanders and WR Herman
Moore. &QL; 
 &UR; CYBERSPACE HOME: baltimoreravens.com. &QL; 
 &UR; 5. Cincinnati Bengals &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 1998 ISSUE: 3-13, last. &QL; 
 &UR; FEARLESS LEADER: Bruce Coslet (43-63). &QL; 
 &UR; HALL OF JUSTICE: Cinergy Field (60,389). &QL; 
 &UR; THE NEW AVENGERS: Nobody wants to play in Cincinnati. All you need
to know is that former Pittsburgh Steelers NT Oliver Gibson was the
prize of their free-agent class. &QL; 
 &UR; STILL A GOOD  &UR; GUY: RB Corey Dillon has helped the Bengals make up
for the Ki-Jana Carter disaster. &QL; 
 &UR; GONE TO EVIL FORCES: CB Ashley Ambrose got tired of losing. So, why
then did he pick New Orleans? &QL; 
 &UR; TEST OF WILL: A brutal four-game stretch in October and November
likely will end the Bengals' chances of making the playoffs. They
play Pittsburgh (Oct. 17), at Indianapolis (Oct. 24), Jacksonville
(Oct. 31) and at Seattle (Nov. 7). &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PREVAIL IF: Rookie quarterback Akili Smith is the real deal.
But because of a training camp holdout, he isn't expected to start
until midseason. &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PERISH IF: The Bengals' 3-4 defense still can't stop the run.
They were last a year ago, allowing 163.3 yards per game. &QL; 
 &UR; CYBERSPACE HOME: www.nfl.com/bengals. &QL; 
 &UR; 6. Cleveland Browns &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 1998 ISSUE: Didn't play. &QL; 
 &UR; FEARLESS LEADER: Chris Palmer (first year as NFL head coach). &QL; 
 &UR; HALL OF JUSTICE: Cleveland Browns Stadium (72,000). &QL; 
 &UR; THE NEW AVENGERS: Everybody. This is an expansion team. &QL; 
 &UR; STILL A GOOD  &UR; GUY: Former Cardinals LB Jamir Miller has been the
team's best player in camp. &QL; 
 &UR; GONE TO EVIL FORCES: The only reason the expansion Browns are in
existence is because owner Art Modell moved the old Browns to
Baltimore. &QL; 
 &UR; TEST OF WILL:The Browns likely will be favored in one game this
year _ the Jan. 2 open date. &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PREVAIL IF: They can find a running back to play behind their
experienced offensive line. &QL; 
 &UR; WILL PERISH IF: They have to pass or kick a field goal. So far, the
Browns have been unable to do either. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The quarterback stood at the top of the
staircase, waiting for his close-up. In his junior year, the
cameras finally rolled for him. He stepped into the bright lights,
blinked ... and was bowled over by the fabulous freshman waiting in
the wings.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about Jim Bonds having his star turn pre-empted by
Tommy Maddox in 1990. If UCLA's season opener against Boise State
was a preview of its Pacific-10 season, the final year of the
decade could end up following the same script as the first.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bonds? It might be Drew Bennett, a marvelous athlete
many believe is miscast as a quarterback. He made his starting
debut behind center Saturday evening at the Rose Bowl, but it's not
a stretch to imagine him lining up at receiver before his college
career is done, catching passes thrown by Cory Paus.
</P>
<P>
   As far as debuts go, Bennett's in the Bruins' 38-7 victory over
Boise State fell somewhere between this summer's ``The Sixth
Sense'' and ``Wild Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   He fell off the proverbial horse early on. His first pass was
one only John Wooden could love, the redshirt junior bouncing the
football to Brad Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's third throw was swatted at the line of scrimmage and
his fourth was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly how Bennett pictured himself coming out of the
gate after cooling his spurs behind Cade McNown for three years and
35 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a very good first series,'' Bennett said. ``I
came off the field and I was kind of (ticked) off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, splitting time with Paus, misfired on four of his five
passes in the opening half. His confidence at the intermission had
to have been a little black-and-blue but Bennett knew what he had
to do.
</P>
<P>
   He dusted himself off, climbed back in the saddle and threw a
rope to Randy Hakes in UCLA's second series of the third quarter
that Hakes high-tailed in for a 65-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth of six consecutive passes Bennett completed in
the quarter. ``I was a little upset with my first-half
performance,'' Bennett said. ``I was kind of embarrassed, actually.
I came out in the second half with the attitude that I'm going to
just put the ball in there where it goes. I wanted to prove that I
may start slow but I'll get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bennett was forcing his passes instead of letting his
mechanics flow, there was a reason. It's no trifling thing,
replacing a four-year starter and a first-round NFL pick. Bennett
could be forgiven his opening-night jitters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bennett's numbers _ 8 of 16 for 120 yards _ were
respectable if not redoubtable. It's a good thing he steadied his
nerves in the second half because the setting will be none too
serene come Saturday when the Bruins travel to Columbus to take on
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes have a couple of bulls in linebacker Na'il Diggs
and Brent Johnson who'll look at Bennett's jersey and see red.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to change a thing,'' fourth-year head coach
Bob Toledo said of his quarterbacks. ``We'll start Drew and we'll
play Cory.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Carson Palmer across town. The best-kept secret in
the Pac-10 may have the initials CP, all right, as in Cory Paus.
</P>
<P>
   Paus connected on the first pass he tried, to tight end Bryan
Fletcher, and finished with 12 completions in 18 attempts for 128
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter Paus threw a 5-yard scoring
pass to tight end Gabe Crecion to become the first Bruin
quarterback in 11 years to throw a touchdown in his first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what it was going to feel like,'' Paus said. ``I
was just winging it. I'm sure it'll be a lot different next week.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as he brings to the task the same presence and pinpoint
passing, Paus should be fine. He has a more charismatic personality
than the quieter Bennett and on this night he definitely was seeing
dead people. They were called defensive backs. With that kind of
clairvoyance, Paus makes it easy for Bruins fans everywhere to
divine the future.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Fifty-two feet and one tick of the scoreboard clock separated the
Comets from their third WNBA championship Saturday afternoon at
Compaq Center.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty-two feet Teresa Weatherspoon covered with one long and
improbable shot that caromed off the backboard and into the basket
after time expired to give the Liberty an improbable 68-67 victory
that crushed the hearts of the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most disappointing loss I've had in all the years
I've been coaching,'' Comets coach Van Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good when it left my hands,'' said Weatherspoon, who
was 3-of-5 from the field. ``I was just praying it would go in to
get us to Game 3.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a rubber game at 2:30 p.m. today at Compaq Center
to decide who walks away with the 1999 WNBA title.
</P>
<P>
   But what transpires might be anticlimactic to one of the most
dramatic moments in all of professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, the Comets never had lost a playoff game at
Compaq Center (6-0). They had a WNBA-record 14-game home winning
streak that included two playoff victories over the Los Angeles
Sparks in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon destroyed the perfect game, no-hitter and shutout
with one Hail Mary toss that spoiled the three-peat celebration for
the sellout crowd of 16,285.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather put it on my shoulders (to win a last-second game)
than to leave it to another of our players,'' Weatherspoon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets led 62-58 when Janeth Arcain, off an assist from
Cynthia Cooper, converted a reverse layup with 2:41 left.
</P>
<P>
   The lead alternated over the next 2:38 before a turnaround shot
by Tina Thompson with 2.4 seconds left gave the Comets a 67-65 lead
and appeared to put them in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Kym Hampton, who plans to retire at the end of the season,
tossed the inbounds pass to Weatherspoon, who dribbled up near
midcourt and launched the shot that killed the Comets' party.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shot, Weatherspoon said, several Liberty players try each
day at the end of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us just flip it up and see what we can do,''
Weatherspoon said. ``Each one of us gets only three shots. If you
don't make it in three, you're out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets looked like they were on the way to victory in the
first half after taking a 37-23 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They had been excellent from the free-throw line (16-for-21,
including 13 straight), good on offense after a slow start and
tenacious enough on defense for the champagne to be iced in
anticipation of a three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   New York missed 13 of its first 14 shots and 21 of 30 through
the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Robinson (21 points) couldn't find the basket, and until
midway of the opening period, the Liberty had scored only two
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on two for a long, long time and couldn't get anything
going,'' said coach Richie Adubato.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a dramatic reversal of form once play resumed in
the second half. The Comets' intensity was replaced by a cavalier
attitude toward playing offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come out like a championship team in the second
half,'' Cooper said. ``We didn't come out like we were ready to win
a championship. We came out like we were going to cruise through
the second half and New York had other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a veteran team; they got aggressive on defense; they
got the job done on the offensive end; they knocked down some
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was all she wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson got out of her first-half shooting slump by scoring 11
points during a 14-2 New York run that cut the lead to 39-37.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, meanwhile, were in full retreat in the face of a
half-court trap and rapidly switching defense employed by the
Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets didn't score a field goal in the first 8:19 of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Arcain got that first basket for a tie at 42. She was fouled on
the play by Weatherspoon and completed the three-point play to give
the lead to the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hard to get the momentum back once you've lost it,''
said Cooper, who was 1-for-10 from the floor and finished with 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   What the Comets lost, the Liberty found, perhaps because of the
halftime speech of Adubato.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I told them that right near the end of the first half I
thought we were playing better basketball,'' said the former coach
of the Dallas Mavericks and Orlando Magic. ``I said we couldn't
play any worse than we did in the first 10 minutes, and if we
executed our offense and went to simplify our offense we'd be
better off.''
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of luck didn't hurt. Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   With 28.4 seconds left, Thompson missed one of two free throws
and the Comets led 65-63. Robinson tied it at 65 on a bucket with
16.3 seconds left. Thompson's shot with 2.4 seconds left put the
Comets back on top, and the Liberty was out of timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing we didn't have a timeout,'' Adubato said,
``or I would have called it and set up a play that wouldn't have
worked. We have a play designed for any time there's under three
seconds left, when we throw the ball the length of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty didn't need that play. It had Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   And she delivered a little redemption for Adubato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost games like that, and I've been coaching a long
time,'' he said. ``This is the first game I've ever won on a lucky
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was due me after all these years.'' &QL;

HOW do you count it? You can't. No way. She didn't call glass.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I didn't call anything,'' Teresa Weatherspoon said. ``I just
let it go. When it left my hand, I knew it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, those of us courtside right behind her did, too. You
could see it all the way, flying straight and true, then smacking
off the middle of the backboard square like a smart bomb and
swishing through the net, a latter-day 52-foot shot heard 'round
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Bobby Thomson, and, yes, start spreading the news.
New York ain't leavin' today. The WNBA's third season isn't over,
and the Comets aren't yet 3-for-3 champions, a little bit of
prematurely spewed confetti notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   But you can hardly blame the poor people charged with pulling
those switches. With 2.4 seconds left Saturday, Tina Thompson had
kissed a nifty turnaround jumper off the glass from just to the
right of the paint _ a pretty cool shot in its own right, by the
way, under the tense circumstances _ to give the Comets an
apparently signed, sealed, delivered 67-65 victory for their
much-coveted three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   Even with 0.0 seconds left, it was still the Comets' game
because Weatherspoon's running, tryin'-one Hail Mary from beyond
midcourt was airborne and the sellout Compaq Center crowd was
starting to whoop its collective fool head off. The WNBA's
championship trophy was being carried to the court as the ball
slapped the glass and careened in.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon dropped to her knees and fell backward. Within
seconds, her Liberty teammates were all over her, creating a giant
pile of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets? They didn't know what to do. Neither did the fans.
Other than the sound of jaws dropping and the muffled shrieks
coming from the Liberty's human anthill, the building was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe she made that shot,'' the Comets' Cynthia
Cooper said afterward. ``I can't believe she made that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds earlier she had encountered Weatherspoon in the
interview area, and, after giving her longtime rival a bearhug,
Coop shrieked, ``I can't believe you made that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Coop was laughing, though, and why not? Honestly, how do you cry
over such a crazy thing, after everything she has had to cry about
these last few weeks? Sudden death might be a tough prospect, but
it's not like real life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Probably never has the outcome of any game of such import, of
such magnitude, been so suddenly and outrageously and miraculously
reversed. One second the Comets are again on top of the world; the
next second they are wiping the blood from their noses and trying
to clear their heads.
</P>
<P>
   It might well have been the most important bucket in the history
of women's basketball in the United States, but that will be of
little consolation to coach Van Chancellor and his stunned charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely the most heartbreaking defeat I've ever been
associated with,'' Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   So Game 3 is today. Everybody returns with backs to the wall,
save for the Peacock network. Lots of curious folks, most of them
in the monster New York market, will hear about the ending of Game
2 and turn on their TVs. A seminal moment for women's hoops in
America? It could be.
</P>
<P>
   Great for the sport, bad for the Comets. But Cooper, the Comet
most desperate to win No. 3 for No. 10 _ the late Kim Perrot, her
best friend _ found a way to be philosophical in defeat. She didn't
blame Weatherspoon's silver spoon of a trey. She blamed herself and
her teammates for lacking the intensity to finish what they
started.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes, the Comets led 17-2. Hence, Coop was of the
opinion it probably shouldn't have come down to any 52-foot banker
at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   She's right, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terribly played game,'' Cooper said, winning points
for brutal honesty. ``Especially in the second half. And especially
for the Houston Comets. If we're going to win a third championship,
we've got to play better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that we get a second chance to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Coop realizes her role in same. Liberty coach Richie Adubato had
a suffocating defensive plan for the WNBA's most prolific scorer,
and his players worked it to perfection. Her every step dogged by a
rotating core of Libertarians, Coop made just one basket and
managed but 10 shots, although she did go to the free-throw line
often enough to sink 10 of 12.
</P>
<P>
   If Coop doesn't fly the coop today and find some daylight, the
Comets are in trouble. No, they aren't. This is still their series
to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Cynthia more looks, and better looks, at the
basket,'' Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, he looked as though he had been run over by a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   An impossibly hard season just got harder. But maybe this was
Kim's fault. Ever the hoops junkie, perhaps she wanted to see
another game. And, these days, she has connections.
</P>
<P>
   We hope.

MADDON RE-DECORATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ One change in the Anaheim Angels' clubhouse
that was immediately noticeable Saturday morning was the absence of
the two 60-inch television screens that sat in the middle of the
clubhouse and faced opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Interim manager Joe Maddon said the removal of the TVs wasn't a
punishment for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed it and determined (removing the televisions) adds
an airy attitude to the clubhouse,'' Maddon said. ``It was
cluttered before.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Saturday's game, instead of watching other baseball
games or football games on TV, they talked to each other and
listened to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consulted with several interior designers,'' Maddon joked.
``And they determined the TVs weren't suitable.''
</P>
<P>
   A visit: Maddon and the other Angels coaches were paid a visit
by former manager Terry Collins Saturday after the game. Collins
did not go into the clubhouse, instead going into equipment manager
Ken Higdon's office to chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday when I came down (to the clubhouse) I tried to talk
to him but I couldn't do it,'' Maddon said before his visit with
Collins. ``I tend to get really emotional. I gave him a hug and
said I'd like to talk to you in about two days when I could talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to totally verbalize how much I appreciate what he did
for me. I know he knows that, but I want him to hear it come from
my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   No big changes: Maddon doesn't plan any drastic changes in the
final month of the season, other than what he does himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest differences is what I do,'' he said.
``Nobody here knows how to run the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the other Angels coaches are computer illiterate,
it's that Maddon is a computer whiz and has all his programs --
consisting of stats and trends on opposing players -- set up in a
way that is familiar to him.
</P>
<P>
   Maddon regularly prints out the day's lineup sheet on his
computer, but Saturday's was hand-written because Maddon was too
busy to get on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   This is Maddon's third tour of duty as the Angels' interim
manager. He was 8-14 in 1996 after taking over for Marcel
Lachemann, who resigned. Last season, he was 6-2 when Collins was
suspended for eight games after the club's fight in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy, especially under these circumstances,'' Maddon
said. ``The routine itself is not difficult because I've done it
before, it's not like I don't know what to do. But the
circumstances surrounding the situation make it difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Transaction: The Angels purchased the contract of pitcher Brian
Cooper from Triple-A Edmonton. Cooper, a 1992 graduate of Glendora
High School, was 2-1 with a 3.77 ERA in five starts for Edmonton
this year. Before that, he was 10-5 with a 3.30 ERA in 22 starts
for double-A Erie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved and excited,'' said Cooper, who is expected to
start Tuesday's game against the White Sox at Edison Field. ``I had
been getting calls from friends and family who were reading in the
papers that they were planning on calling me up. It's a big
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he didn't expect to reach the big leagues this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I heard I was going to stay at double-A the whole
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina did not play Saturday because he
was stiff and sore after sliding awkwardly into third base with a
triple Friday night. ... Mad-don said the Angels will bring in
coaching help sometime next week. It isn't related to the departure
of Collins, Maddon said. Teams usually bring in coaches from the
minor league system after the minor league season is complete. ...
Lost in all the news Friday was the presentation of the Rawlings
Gold Glove award to center fielder Jim Edmonds for the 1998 season.
It was Edmonds' second Gold Glove. ... The Angels and Yankees play
the third game of their four-game series today at 5:05. Chuck
Finley (8-11, 4.74 ERA) will start for Anaheim against New York's
Ed Yarnall (0-0,0.00).

PAUS LIFTS UCLA TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ From the FBI investigation to the disabled
parking scandal and his son-in-law's successful battle with a brain
tumor, it was a grueling offseason for Bruins coach Bob Toledo. He
was as exhausted when training camp began as he usually is in
November.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo couldn't have scripted a better start to his fourth
regular season _ with or without 12 suspended players and injured
receiver Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   In UCLA's 38-7 victory over Boise State on Saturday night before
46,752 at the Rose Bowl, the kicking game held, the defense was
superb and the quarterback quagmire lurched toward a resolution as
second-stringer Cory Paus outplayed starter Drew Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   A redshirt freshman from New Lenox, Ill., Paus completed 7 of 9
passes for 78 yards and directed two touchdown drives in the
decisive first half. The second touchdown _ a 5-yard pass to
tight-end Gabe Crecion _ gave the Bruins a 24-0 advantage five
minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate and savvy, Paus completed 12 of 18 passes for 128 yards
in a performance reminiscent of Cade McNown's uncanny play as a
true freshman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what it was going to feel like,'' Paus said. ``I
was just winging it. I'm sure it'll be a lot different next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett recovered from a 2-of-9 start _ ``I was kind of
embarrassed,'' _ and looked sharp in the second half. Afterward,
Toledo said Bennett will start Saturday at Ohio State, with Paus
playing early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not changing a thing,'' Toledo said. ``We'll do exactly
like we did this week.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's defense, maligned last season, was organized and
effective in its first game under new defensive coordinator Bob
Field. Despite missing five suspended starters, the Bruins held
Boise State scoreless for 57 minutes, until a coverage breakdown
foiled their first shutout in three years.
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for role reversal? While the offense struggled in
the first half, the defense broke the game open with interceptions
on consecutive plays in the second quarter. First, safety Julius
Williams scored on a 53-yard-interception return, then safety Joey
Strycula plucked a screen pass to set up the Paus-to-Crecion
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In attitude and execution, it was a starkly different defense
than last year's version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to prove a point,'' Williams said. ``We had to show the
defense isn't like last year. We had things to prove. We're not
soft. We don't surf. We made some mistakes last year, but this is a
new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Toledo bemoaned the sloppiness (eight combined
turnovers) and UCLA's sporadic running game (3.7-yards per carry),
the victory nevertheless negated the two-game disabled
parking-suspensions. The No.17 Bruins can do no worse than split
their first two games, the same fate most expected with a full
roster.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next week _ whether they execute in Ohio Stadium
like they executed against a Big West team _ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know a lot more Saturday,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   About the defense and about the quarterbacks. True to Toledo's
pregame strategy, Bennett played three series, then Paus entered
with 5:18 left in the first quarter. He completed his first pass, a
screen to tight-end Bryan Fletcher, then hit Brad Melsby for a
first down near midfield. The drive sputtered, but UCLA's defense
quickly forced a punt and Paus returned to lead the first touchdown
drive of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a screen to tailback DeShaun Foster, who scooted
for 23 yards to Boise State's 45. Six plays later, facing
third-and-12, Paus lofted a delicate pass to Fletcher, who made a
fabulous diving catch at the Broncos' 4. Foster plowed over
linebacker Bryan Johnson for a 10-0 lead with 11 minutes left in
the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense took command on the following series. On
third-and-6, Boise State quarterback Bart Hendricks passed to
tight-end Dave Stachelski, who was battling Williams for position
near midfield. Before the ball arrived, Stachelski stumbled, giving
Williams an uncontested interception.
</P>
<P>
   A converted cornerback playing his first game at safety,
Williams looked like a tailback as he raced 53 yards down the right
sideline for a touchdown that gave the Bruins a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were jockeying for position, he slipped, and I stepped in
front,'' Williams said. ``I saw some space to the right and took
off. I didn't know I was going to the house (end zone).''
</P>
<P>
   Boise State's next play _ i.e., Hendricks' next mistake _ broke
the game open. With defensive end Kenyon Coleman charging hard,
Hendricks panicked and threw a screen pass to Strycula, giving the
Bruins possession at Boise State's 32.
</P>
<P>
   After three tough runs by Jermaine Lewis, Paus rolled right and
connected with Crecion for a touchdown and a 24-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter, Bennett tossed his first career
touchdown, a 65-yard pass to tight-end Randy Hakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with my performance, but I think I did fine for
the first time,'' said Bennett, who completed 8 of 16 passes for
120 yards. ``I was a little upset at my first-half performance. I
was tentative.''

TIGHT ENDS LEND A HAND TO YOUNG QUARTERBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ UCLA's receivers are among the best in the
nation, and its tailback tandem of DeShaun Foster and Jermaine
Lewis is the focus of every opposing defense. But Saturday night,
the Bruins unleashed their talented tight ends on unsuspecting
Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   The result was five catches for 105 yards and two touchdowns _
and some very relieved rookie quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't something that was in the game plan, it just worked
out that way,'' said sophomore tight end Bryan Fletcher, whose
diving catch set up UCLA's first touchdown in a 38-7 victory.
``Cory (Paus) and Drew (Bennett) were a little nervous, and the
tight ends are one of the safest throws on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fletcher's catch established the tight ends' presence, then
Randy Hakes and Gabe Crecion substantiated it. Hakes, who had one
reception last year, caught a 65-yard touchdown pass from Bennett,
and Crecion, who sat out last season, caught a 5-yard touchdown
pass from Paus that gave the Bruins a 24-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Helping hands: With 12 suspended players, the Bruins were
counting on a slew of inexperienced players to contribute, and they
did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   _Sophomore safety Julius Williams, a converted cornerback,
returned an interception 53 yards for the game-breaking touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   _Senior safety Joey Strycula, whose primary duty until this
season was holding on place-kicks, intercepted a pass that set up
the Bruins' final touchdown of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   _Freshman cornerback Joe Hunter, who redshirted last season,
prevented a Boise State touchdown by intercepting a pass at the 6.
</P>
<P>
   _Receiver-turned-cornerback Paul Nelson, a freshman, recovered a
fumbled punt early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Touching tribute: Before the game, UCLA honored former Boise
State player and Covina resident Paul Reyna, who died last month
from injuries suffered during practice. Reyna's parents, Carolyn
Gusman and Art Reyna, were honorary captains for Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Defensive end Travor Turner's sprained right knee
was UCLA's most serious injury of the night. He'll be evaluated
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No show: Because of technical difficulties, the postgame
fireworks show was rescheduled for the Sept. 18 game against Fresno
State. Anyone holding a single-game ticket for Boise State can
redeem it for a general admission ticket on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Saturday's game at Ohio State starts at 5 p.m.

   AIRPARTICLES _ Scientists from around the world are wrapping up
a month-long study in Atlanta to determine the best ways of
measuring and anaylzing ultrafine particles that pollute the air in
large urban areas, and which may be killing thousands of Americans
per year. The $1.4 million study is a prelude to other intensive
studies that will be kicked off around the nation to determine the
best ways of reducing levels of pollution known as particulate
matter. Researchers say exceedingly tiny particles of dust, soot,
sulfates, metals and other pollutants spewed out by car exhausts,
smokestacks and construction and farming may be even more dangerous
than ozone. Some studies say that particulate matter may be
responsible for up to 950 deaths per year in metro Atlanta alone.

WHEN THE DREAM FACTORY TAKES A HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The summer movie season typically ends with
something approaching a sigh, a little breather between the
summertime crowd pleasers and the somewhat more adult-oriented
autumn fare.
</P>
<P>
   And this one, which started with the ear-shattering cymbal clash
of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' and has produced
an unprecedented number of $100-million-plus box-office hits, ended
with just two relatively small-scale releases to attract audiences
over the three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What does Hollywood have against Labor Day?
</P>
<P>
   For virtually every other important holiday weekend _ even
relative newcomers like Presidents' Day _ Hollywood cranks up the
hype machine, and the studios jostle for space and attention. But
Labor Day is the orphan of American holidays, the ugly cousin that
no one wants to play with.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years Miramax Films has been one of the few
production companies regularly to release films nationally over the
Labor Day weekend, including ``Outside Providence'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our films don't have ambitions to be $100 million movies,''
said Mark Gill, president of Miramax's Los Angeles division. ``We
do nicely if they make $20 million to $30 million. But if you're at
a studio, your costs are so much higher. If you're a studio, you're
trying to make $60 million to $100 million, and it's a lot harder
to do that with an opening in early September.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los
Angeles-based company that monitors movie releases and box-office
trends, said, ``Very rarely do the studios bring out the big-event
pictures'' for Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking goes like this: A holiday weekend is a good time to
open big films because people are off work and out of school and
more likely to have pleasure on their minds. The best holiday
weekends (Memorial Day, Independence Day, Christmas) come at the
beginning of extended vacation periods, when a movie can not only
get a good opening blast but a solid bounce into the subsequent
weekends that will decide whether it transmutes into a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   But Labor Day comes at an end, not a beginning. Vacations are
drawing to a close, eyes are turning back to school books, noses to
grindstones. And even if a movie does manage a box-office burst on
the holiday weekend, it has little to look forward to in the first
weekend or two of September when there is historically a
significant drop-off in movie attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, many of the parents use the Labor Day weekend as the last
chance to do shopping, the last chance to get away to the cottage
before the summer is over,'' said Chuck Viane, head of distribution
for Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Often the drop-off in the number of releases over Labor Day is
particularly striking because it comes after a few solid weeks
jammed with new movies. This year, it was especially marked.
</P>
<P>
   Six films opened on Aug. 27 in wide release around the country:
Albert Brooks and Sharon Stone in ``The Muse,'' Antonio Banderas in
``The 13th Warrior,'' Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron in ``The
Astronaut's Wife,'' Omar Epps in ``In Too Deep,'' Brendan Fraser in
``Dudley Do-Right'' and Jon Voight in ``A Dog of Flanders.''
</P>
<P>
   But only two _ ``The Chill Factor,'' an action-adventure about
frozen toxins starring Cuba Gooding Jr., and ``Outside
Providence,'' a smaller-scale coming-of-age film about a
working-class Rhode Island boy who is thrust into a fancy prep
school _ were offered for the longer and potentially more lucrative
Labor Day weekend. As is customary with holiday releases, both
opened on Wednesday, in advance of the holiday, to give them a
five-day box-office sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``A producer, by launching a movie the last weekend in August,
has a feeling that if it gets strong word of mouth, he can use that
the second weekend to hold up the size of his gross, perhaps
getting stories about how strong his hold is,'' said Viane. A film
that opens on Labor Day weekend, on the other hand, has only the
second weekend in September to look forward to, a weekend that is
traditionally among the slowest on the box-office calendar. ``Labor
Day can potentially be a nice launch pad, but then the second week
is low-grossing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if a movie opens well in the last weekend of
August, and the people who see it like it and tell their friends,
the movie can then approach the Labor Day weekend with expectations
of selling almost as many tickets, or perhaps even more, than it
did in its opening weekend. Since films in Hollywood are viewed as
strong, and therefore kept in theaters longer and written about
more frequently, when the amount of money that they earn in
successive weekends goes down only slightly _ or, very rarely, goes
up _ an otherwise modest film might generate some attention and the
illusion of box-office strength by using Labor Day as its second
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem to be happening this summer. The unexpected
and overpowering success of the Bruce Willis psychological thriller
``The Sixth Sense'' has steamrollered over most of the August
releases, holding onto first place at the box office throughout the
month and probably into Labor Day, a paradoxical turn of events for
producers who schemed to move their films later in the summer to
get away from the ``Stars Wars'' and ``Austin Powers'' juggernauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor Day is typically not the biggest holiday weekend of the
summer for moviegoing,'' Dergarabedian said. ``But with `Sixth
Sense' out there doing so well, I think we're going to see another
big weekend this Labor Day. It could even be a record Labor Day
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that Labor Days have traditionally performed
so poorly at the box office is that studios and producers have
shunned them, perhaps creating a self-fulfilling prophesy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Labor Days slow because the big pictures aren't released
then or because the audience wouldn't be there for them?''
Dergarabedian said. ``I think it's a little of both.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Viane acknowledged that like most Hollywood truisms, an
exception can be found for the Labor Day jinx as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, historically the week after Labor Day is one of the
slowest of the year,'' he said. But he pointed back to 1992, when a
caper-thriller with Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier called
``Sneakers'' was released in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did a ton of business,'' Viane said. ``It's really
indicative of the movie. If you've got the right movie, you can
open it anytime.''

(Karal Ann Marling is the author of ``Norman Rockwell'' and
``Designing Disney's Theme Parks: The Architecture of
Reassurance.'') 
 By KARAL ANN MARLING    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celebration, Fla. (ZIP code 34747), is an easy target for
mouse-hating intellectuals, smug co-op-dwelling Manhattanites and
architects who still cling to the quaint notion that International
Style-minimalism will save the world, despite itself. Celebration
began with a gaudy made-for-television spectacle in November 1995,
when Walt Disney Co. held a public lottery on the swampy site for
the right to buy a house in a town that then existed only in an old
Disney film, set in picket-fence America, some time back before
things took a wrong turn in the national life.
</P>
<P>
   Because the folks who brought us the theme parks were selling
the lots, Disneyphiles everywhere assumed that Celebration would
soon materialize in a cloud of pixie dust, perfect in every
respect, clean, tidy and wholesome. On the other side of the
plastic fencing, Disneyphobes were sure that this corporate
excursion into the New Urbanism would end in artificiality,
mindless nostalgia and a rigid social order imposed from above by
bureaucrats wearing Mouseketeer hats. But, as things turned out,
everybody was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The story of building and sustaining Celebration has been nicely
told by Douglas Frantz, a national correspondent for The New York
Times, and his wife, Catherine Collins, a freelance writer. Their
book, ``Celebration, U.S.A.,'' amounts to a firsthand investigative
report on life in this Central Florida community where Disney World
tourists tend to view the inhabitants as so much clever robotic
scenery (domesticated ``pirates of the Caribbean,'' perhaps, minus
the eye patches and peg legs).
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997 the authors and their two younger children moved
into a midprice home in Celebration and spent the next 16 months as
pioneers, caught up in the struggle to make friends, get a
neighbor's porch moved out of their side yard, find a place to buy
a hammer and nails, and generally reconcile dreams with realities.
The result is an intimate chronicle, full of real people facing
debt, family hardship and disappointment in pursuit of a sense of
community, harmony and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   This strong feeling of being there is the element missing from
Andrew Ross' recently published book ``The Celebration Chronicles:
Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Property Value in Disney's New
Town.'' Like Frantz and Ms. Collins, Ross moved to Celebration and
did his research, but he lived alone, in a pricey rental
overlooking the downtown shopping district, without a real stake in
Celebration (a mortgage, for example), and his tone is detached,
oracular. And given the importance of the architecture _ the layout
and the building style that made the place so appealing _ his
disinterest in the physical reality of the town cripples his
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Celebration was planned as a New Urbanist town. The movement
called New Urbanism posits that the car is the root cause of
personal isolation and malaise: automobility creates urban sprawl
and breeds, in the cul de sacs of sidewalkless suburbia, a
terrible, destructive loneliness. By building houses close
together, within walking distance of a sociable community center;
by suppressing individualism in favor of a harmonious exterior
finish for the town as a whole; by designing houses with big front
porches to promote interaction with the street, planners hope to
provide conditions favorable to the growth of genuine community.
</P>
<P>
   But ``good architecture couldn't make the town work,'' Frantz
and Ms. Collins argue, despite the residents' fierce attachment to
their brand-new, old-fashioned, porch-girdled houses.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   From their front porches neighbors can keep watch over one
another. The official Disney-designed seal for Celebration shows a
little girl on a bicycle zipping along a pretty tree-lined street
in blessed safety, her ponytail streaming out behind her in the
Florida sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   The typical ``Disneyville'' house comes in six styles, labeled
Classical, Coastal, Colonial Revival, French Normandy,
Mediterranean or Victorian. And within each style there are a
variety of plans and prices and details. The overall effect,
however, is consistent, cute and kind of gingerbready, as though
all the houses on an ordinary street had dressed up for a
masquerade.

   Everything matches, thanks to a plan book that amounts to a
Celebration bible, setting forth the permissible range of colors
and curtains, plantings and porch furniture. This visual
consistency is a strong selling point for the upscale houses, of
course, but it is also an irritant: the ``porch police'' are apt to
visit those with an un-communal taste for purple polka dots on
their draperies. Because the look of Celebration cries out for
dormers, the builders supplied them, but because dormer spaces
don't fit into the plan of a contemporary American home, they are
fake ones, with the windowpanes painted black.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The houses turned out not to be the issue in Celebration,
although they were too expensive and often poorly constructed, and
families stretched to the limit by monthly payments wondered if
they would ever get their money out of what amounted to a risky
investment. This concern was prompted by the highly publicized
failure of other key parts of the Celebration master plan. Advance
publicity had promised a school incorporating the best thinking of
America's best educators, and an electronic infrastructure linking
residents to one another and to the world.
</P>
<P>
   As parents of school-age children, the authors were in an ideal
position to chronicle the fierce and disruptive battles that broke
out in the largely bookless model school, and the inability of the
computer system to do much more than collect data on participating
households. There was, from the outset, an odd disjunction among
advanced educational theory, cutting-edge technology and cozy
houses with porches and (ersatz) dormers.
</P>
<P>
   Moms and dads who moved to Celebration in search of a
half-remembered, utopian small town _ and the values attached to it
_ were apt to be flummoxed by open classrooms that contained
several age groups, teachers who looked like students and report
cards without conventional grades.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the best thing about Celebration was its frontier
spirit: the determination of people who came there in search of
community to create one, against all odds. Nothing stopped them,
not leaky roofs; not a Potemkin-village downtown without a
supermarket, a hairdresser or a video store; not bad press or
carloads of tourists who believed that Celebration was a leftover
set for ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of this excellent book is that middle-class Americans
want something different from the gated communities and the
anonymous suburbs the contractors usually supply. They are hungry
for Lake Wobegon with nice front porches, big kitchens and a decent
hardware store within walking distance. Oh, and A's and B's on the
children's report cards.

<P>
   When an international team of researchers demonstrated recently
that they could break the standard lock that protects financial
transactions over the Internet, they sent a clear message to the
e-commerce community: Now is the time to get stronger locks.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' demonstration showed only that locks of a
certain strength, known as RSA 512-bit encryption codes, could be
broken. But it is precisely that code strength that is used for a
number of the financial transactions with e-commerce sites on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, part of a challenge sponsored by the company
that invented the RSA system, required computing resources
typically available only to governments or big corporations. But
the computing power was insignificant compared with other
code-cracking efforts, said Arjen Lenstra, one of the main
researchers for the seven-month effort.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law, which says that computing power roughly doubles
every 18 months, suggests that such power may someday be available
to individuals. Even more important, improvements in the techniques
used for factoring large numbers _ a process that enables RSA codes
to be cracked _ may dramatically reduce the computational resources
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you break something, then within a relatively short
time, many people will be able to break it,'' said Lenstra, a
computer scientist at Citicorp. ``I have no doubt that within a few
years it will be more or less a triviality.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has long restricted the export of strong
encryption, citing concerns that it might be used to conceal
messages or transactions by terrorists or drug traffickers. Over
the last year, because of market pressures, it has relaxed those
standards somewhat for encryption products related to e-commerce,
but the 512-bit standard remains prevalent among Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of security has been 512 for so long that it's still
a part of the infrastructure,'' said David Wagner, a computer
security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley.
``It will be several years before this changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The current export-control policy, which requires companies
seeking to export encryption products to go through a one-time
review, is so complex that many encryption experts, secure-software
manufacturers and government officials interviewed for this article
could not say how it applies to RSA products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the encryption policy is that the devil is in
the details,'' said Roszel Thomsen, a lawyer specializing in export
controls at Thomsen &AMP; Burke, a law firm in Washington. ``The policy
has been drafted with a degree of ambiguity that is calculated to
allow the regulators to make up their minds case by case.''
</P>
<P>
   From the government's perspective, ``complicated is in the eye
of the beholder,'' said William Reinsch, the under secretary of
commerce for export administration. ``We're trying to pursue a
balanced policy. I believe that the critics of our policy are those
who do not believe that national security and law enforcement
concerns are as important as we believe they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Many security experts believe that encryption export standards
have been tied to levels decipherable by the National Security
Agency, whose think tanks _staffed with mathematicians _ devote
enormous resources to code cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations could already be breaking e-commerce keys
regularly, and just not telling anyone,'' said Bruce Schneier,
chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet Security Inc., a
consulting company based in San Jose, Calif. ``I think there's a
100 percent chance the NSA does this already They would be remiss
in their charter if they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' actual feat was to factor a 155-digit number
into its two component prime factors. The inherent hardness of
factoring, an immensely difficult and time-consuming task for even
the most powerful computers, provides the security for RSA.
Factoring a certain large number associated with an RSA key enables
that key to be cracked.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Named for its founders _ Ronald Rivest of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute of
Science in Rehovoth, Israel, and Leonard Adleman of the University
of Southern California _ RSA is an example of what is known as an
asymmetric or public-key system.
</P>
<P>
   Each merchant on the Web possesses a public RSA key, which is
listed in a public record, and a private key, which is known only
to that merchant. When a message has been locked with a public key,
only the private key can unlock it.
</P>
<P>
   This asymmetry of keys is essential for Internet transactions
because unlike faster ``symmetric key'' methods of encryption, RSA
does not require that the sender and the receiver of an encrypted
message meet to transfer a secret key.
</P>
<P>
   A secure Internet transaction, like a credit card purchase,
typically takes place in a protected tunnel temporarily established
between a computer user's Web browser and an e-commerce site. This
protected tunnel, designed by Netscape but now an Internet
standard, is known as SSL, or Secure Socket Layer.
</P>
<P>
   Since RSA encryption is very slow for long messages, the browser
establishes the tunnel with a faster, symmetric key technique. But
then the symmetric key must be securely transported to the
e-commerce site. This transport depends on RSA.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction uses the strongest encryption that both the Web
browser and the site support. To comply with the export controls,
browsers come in both domestic and exportable versions. The
exportable version, frequently shipped even with computers
purchased in the United States, is limited to 512-bit RSA
transactions except with certain authorized sites _ typically large
banks or brokerage firms _ that have paid extra for stronger
encryption capability.
</P>
<P>
   Government controls have been eased since January, enabling a
larger class of sites to use 1,024-bit RSA encryption _ considered
secure by most experts _ in transactions with exportable browsers.
But many restrictions still apply.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem, however, is that many Web sites are using
512-bit encryption for all their Web transactions, regardless of
the type of browser.
</P>
<P>
   While new symmetric keys are generated for each individual
transaction, the RSA key for each individual site typically stays
fixed for one year. This means that a time-consuming code-breaking
effort has a huge payoff: Cracking a single RSA key can potentially
unlock a year's worth of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no legal reason that American companies should
persist in using low-level encryption for their sites,'' Thomsen
said, adding, ``No one in their right minds should be using 512
today.'' And yet many major e-commerce sites, like Microsoft's and
Gateway's online stores, are still using 512-bit encryption for
their Web transactions.
</P>
<P>
   While security software can be designed to allow easy upgrades
to higher levels of encryption, the government does not allow
manufacturers to build this capability into their software, said
Scott Schnell, senior vice president for marketing for RSA Data
Security and its parent, Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. Thus,
upgrading can be a costly process.
</P>
<P>
   Security Dynamics had $39 million in revenues from encryption
software last year, accounting for 42 percent of the worldwide
market, in addition to licensing the RSA encryption algorithms to
more than 500 other software makers. But Schnell said federal
export regulations had hurt RSA severely in its sales abroad
because ``no one wants to buy weak encryption products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a clear base line that makes 1,024 the
standard for public key cryptography,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the pace at which cryptography standards will be
broken may only increase. ``In another 10 years, we can expect to
make another jump of difficulty level,'' said Lenstra, the Citicorp
computer scientist. ``It's always going to be a race.''

 (Eds: Repeating for all needed)  
 BRADLEY NEARS GORE IN N.H; BUSH STILL LEADING THE GOP
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bill Bradley has vaulted into a virtual tie with Al
Gore in the Democratic race for president in New Hampshire,
according to a Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll that found many voters in
the first-primary state voicing eagerness for political change
despite the region's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, meanwhile, is maintaining a large lead over his
GOP rivals in that presidential race. Elizabeth Dole was in second
place, just ahead of John McCain, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Among likely voters, Vice President Gore leads Bradley, the
former New Jersey senator, by 40 percent to 36 percent. That
amounts to a statistical tie because that spread falls within the
poll's margin of error of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls by other news organizations have found Gore to hold
a larger, though shrinking, lead. Gore had been seen as a shoo-in
for the nomination, a perception that may have been a factor
prompting Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, among others, to
stay out of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic primary race really appears to be a race that
could go either way,'' said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC
Communications Research, which conducted the survey of 800 likely
voters for the Globe and WBZ-TV from Aug. 27 to 31. ``Gore has an
unfavorable rating that is higher than one would expect. It is
partly due to the fact that people simply want a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is broadly popular among likely Democratic primary voters,
with 65 percent viewing him favorably or very favorably. But he is
viewed unfavorably by 19 percent of Democrats, and by 32 percent of
the crucial constituency of independents who say they expect to
vote in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley draws a favorable rating of 66 percent. But the poll
found that only 11 percent of Democrats _ and none of those
independent voters surveyed _ had rated him unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found several factors eroding Gore's standing, among
them his stalwart support of President Clinton throughout the
impeachment scandal and the lingering concerns about allegations of
his role in the campaign fund-raising excesses of the 1996
Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most worrisome for the vice president is that New
Hampshire Democratic primary voters, while admiring President
Clinton and believing that the nation is generally headed in the
right direction, are somewhat restless with the present political
leadership. The poll found only 21 percent of Democrats saying they
wanted to keep current government officials, while 39 percent said
it was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the poll found that Bush, the Texas
governor, continues to maintain his dominance over the field,
supported by 44 percent of those surveyed, followed by Dole, the
former transportation secretary and Red Cross director, with 14
percent, and McCain, an Arizona senator, with 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dole appears to have benefited from her third-place showing in
last month's Iowa straw poll, which McCain bypassed, and her
support for some gun-control measures. The poll found considerable
support in New Hampshire, among Republicans and Democrats, for
certain gun-control measures, including registration of all
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that Dole is not drawing support based on
status as the first woman to mount a major party campaign for the
presidency; there is no appreciable difference in Dole's support
among men or women.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who has spent millions of dollars from his fortune
to pay for early television advertisements, was in fourth place
with 7 percent, while the commentator Patrick J. Buchanan and
former Vice President Dan Quayle each had 4 percent, and a former
Reagan aide, Gary Bauer, had 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates drew negligible support in the Globe/WBZ-TV
poll.
</P>
<P>
   While the survey is an early indicator of political trends, the
history of recent campaigns makes it clear that such results can
turn around. For example, in a February 1995 survey done by KRC,
Bob Dole led Buchanan 42 percent to 9 percent, but Buchanan wound
up winning the New Hampshire primary. Dole went on to capture the
nomination, although he lost the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is clearly benefiting from his family name and from the
legacy of former President Bush. Twenty-four percent of likely
Republican voters cited Bush's name and family history when asked
why they supported the Texas governor, while another 24 percent
cited his stand on the issues, and 25 percent mentioned his record
as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made an extraordinary impression in a short period. He
is viewed favorably by 73 percent of Republicans; only 14 percent
have an unfavorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one controversy involving the Bush campaign appears
unlikely to have much impact. The vast majority of voters in both
parties _ 73 percent _ said their views of a presidential candidate
would not be affected if it turned out that he used cocaine 25
years ago. Bush has declined to say whether he used cocaine at that
time, although he has said he would have passed a 15-year
background for drug use required in his father's administration,
which began in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if a candidate used illegal drugs five years
ago, 29 percent of Republicans said they would not vote for such a
candidate and 42 percent said they would consider withholding
support.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were generally satisfied with Bush's
answers to questions about whether he has ever used drugs, while
Democrats were split on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to some elections, when the economy or foreign affairs
was driving the campaign, there appears to be no single issue
dominating this race. Among Democrats, 21 percent said the top
issue was health care, 17 percent said it was education, and 9
percent said it was crime. Among Republicans, 17 percent said the
top concern was education, 11 percent saw it as health care, and 8
percent said their first issue was the bureaucracy, politicians,
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   While New Hampshire is enjoying record prosperity, with a 2.5
percent unemployment rate, signs of concern spring up throughout
the poll. Among Democratic voters, 45 percent said the country has
changed for the better in the past eight years, while 25 percent
said things were worse, and 27 percent said there was no change.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took an even dimmer view, with 19 percent saying
things were better, 45 percent saying worse, and 30 percent finding
no change.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the usual focus on New Hampshire as an antitax state,
the issue did not seem to rise to the forefront of the campaign.
Taxes were viewed as a top issue by only 8 percent of Democrats and
7 percent of Republicans. The majority of voters in both parties
said it was more important to secure Social Security and pay off
the national debt than to return the budget surplus to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   There does not appear to be a particular issue driving a wedge
between Bradley and Gore, but the poll found some Bradley strengths
that could become crucial factors during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, Bradley is far ahead among
Independents who said they would vote in the Democratic primary,
enjoying a 51-31 ratio. Independents can vote in the New Hampshire
primary by switching their affiliation at the polling place. In the
Globe/WBZ-TV poll, Independents made up one-fifth of those who said
they would vote in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   The race also features an emerging gender gap, with Gore
enjoying more support among women; Bradley more from men.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains popular in New Hampshire, where the president's
second-place finish in the 1992 primary earned him the nickname of
the ``comeback kid.'' Seventy-four percent of Democrats voiced
approval of the job Clinton is doing as president, while 16 percent
expressed disapproval. Among Republicans, the figures were 34
percent approval, 58 percent disapproval.

 By ERIC V. COPAGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Puck is gliding on roller skates through a rather
misty haze that fills the dance floor, making mischief, as Puck
does, with the passions of Tytania, Sander and Dimitri. This isn't
fairyland, but rather theater, and it's done to the pounding beat
of such '70s dance hits as ``Disco Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The Donkey Show,'' an hourlong adaptation of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream,'' which opened on Aug. 18 for a six-week
run at a real club, El Flamingo in Chelsea, where the audience can
stand around the ``stage'' and even dance on it to the disco hits
of 20 years ago before the play even begins.
</P>
<P>
   It is through the music, rather than any traditional form of
theater, that Shakespeare's comedy about the vagaries of love is
told. Is this new production merely a cabaret curiosity or the
beginnings of a more or less new sort of theater emerging from
below Houston Street? Peter Marks, in his review in The New York
Times, called the show ``a lark, an exuberant and witty splicing of
disparate sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Paulus and her husband, Randy Weiner, who started the
Project 400 Theater Group and who are creators and directors of the
show, say their theatrical contrivance is literate fun. They say
they believe the show is an indication of things to come in the
theater, at least downtown.
</P>
<P>
   There are other downtown theater groups and individuals _ The
Faux Real Theater Company, Expanded Arts, Dead Mecca and the
Present Company, for instance _ trying to find new ways to make
theater relevant to younger audiences. To Ms. Paulus and Weiner,
theater has become the flying wedge of a downtown sensibility
expressed most consistently in the previous decade through music
and especially the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   John Clancy, artistic director of the Present Company and a
founder of the Fringe Festival, a showcase for the last three
summers of experimental theater, said that Project 400 was among
the smartest groups working downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never just throw something on stage because it looks
cool,'' he said. ``They are always asking: `What does it mean? How
does it add to the story?' That is how they can take something that
seems like it will be campy _ Shakespeare retold through disco
songs _ and make it work. Because these songs really do tell the
story, they are not just grafted to the plot line. Project 400
shows a commitment to populist theater that isn't diluted or
watered down.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Donkey Show'' had run on Thursdays from January to June at
the Pyramid Club in the East Village and weekends last summer and
fall at the Piano Store on the Lower East Side. Project 400 seeks
to be part of the long tradition of twisting the confines of
theater that probably started even before women began portraying
women on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Generally every theatrical innovator has his own agenda. In the
'60s Julian Beck, a founder of the Living Theater with his wife,
Judith Malina, ``would walk up to you and practically assault
you,'' said Bill Talon, an actor, director and writer who performs
a great deal downtown. ``His attitude was, `I'm right, and this is
what I'm going to teach you,' '' he continued. ``Today I don't
think there is generally the luxury or even the desire to be
didactic. To be a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But David Finkelstein, a 38-year-old writer and director, says
that even in experimental theater the downtown focus is on money
and on fame, and that this may be a fatal flaw. While emphasizing
that he has not seen the work of Project 400, he said he was
familiar with the Lower East Side theater scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of listening to people talking, there was a
tremendous amount of creativity going into the question of survival
and how to make theater in this climate when no funding is
available,'' said Finkelstein, artistic director of Lake Ivan
Performance Group, which specializes in improvisational theater.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, Finkelstein said, he found downtown theater people
dedicated to ``marketing to create a sense that there is an
exciting scene going on the Lower East Side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't hear a lot of conversations in which people
talked with excitement about performance technique or directorial
technique or playwriting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paulus denies sacrificing content for marketing hype. She
and Weiner have their own sense of their antecedents and what
Project 400 is trying to add to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Believing in Antonin Artaud's concept that all theater should be
ritual, transformative rather than merely entertaining, Weiner
said: ``We are asking the audience to go on a journey that is
experiential, literally. We are asking them to partake in a very
active way, in being shoulder to shoulder in the action.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was taking ritual theater and placing it in a modern
pop context, the rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ritual has to mean something in your life,'' Weiner said.
``We are incorporating things that are not necessarily part of the
solipsistic theater world but are part of culture.''
</P>
<P>
   They are much affected by hip-hop because ``it is tapping into
what is cutting edge in the culture today,'' Ms. Paulus said.
``Hip-hop's pounding beat makes it visceral, and it is about
putting things in a different context,'' she said about sampling,
the practice of taking a snippet of a song and combining it with
other snippets to create something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reach people who don't go to the theater, because
they are the ones who want to be enthralled, challenged,'' she
said. ``I feel music is what people care about in a loyal,
passionate way, and I want that audience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Paulus has directed the off-off-Broadway play ``Running
Man.'' She and Weiner's first production was a rock musical
adaptation of ``The Tempest.'' Both are Harvard graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Project 400 was founded in 1993 in New York, but the idea for it
came a year or so earlier in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with the hottest local band in the county and asked
them to work on the score of what we were doing, and that was how
we learned to create populist theater,'' Ms. Paulus said. ``People
were coming because of the band.''
</P>
<P>
   She said they began doing ``bar sets'': a group of six to seven
songs from the show in local taverns to lure the audience to the
local theater.
</P>
<P>
   Since then they have staged productions in New York and
Cambridge, Mass. Among them: a production of ``Phaedra'' using
instrumental tracks released by Stax-Volt, the popular '60s-era
rhythm-and-blues record company, and an adaptation of
``Frankenstein,'' using melodies from the piano music of Bartok,
Beethoven and Dvorak, coupled with lyrics by Weiner. Their next
project will be a hip-hop ``Lohengrin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see all art forms as being intimately connected,'' said
Weiner.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stacks of glossy publications compete for attention
in the pane-glass vitrines of Universal News, a sprawling magazine
emporium in Soho favored by the downtown intelligentsia. Wired and
Vogue sit side by side in the front windows, sharing space with a
new title: Sony Style, a quarterly that sells for $5.95 in the
United States and $8.95 in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Style? It is just one of a growing number of ``custom
published'' magazines. While advertisers like Philip Morris,
Mercedes-Benz and Starbucks used to push magazines to mention their
products in the editorial pages, they have now adopted a more
sophisticated approach, creating magazines in which they control
the mix of feature articles and product placement.
</P>
<P>
   Flip through the pages of Sony Style and the editorial feeling
is that of a technology lover's version of People magazine. There
is a loving profile of the actress Jennifer Lopez, an interview
with an up-and-coming Danish filmmaker, a page about the designer
Diane von Furstenberg and her newest fashion accessory _a vest
designed to hold Sony electronic equipment. And what woman can go
without a vest with a special pocket for her Memory Stick?
</P>
<P>
   A few pages further into the magazine, there is an article about
a Sony computer called the Vaio, which begins: ``Sony designers
express a product's power and potential through its form and
detailing. Each product looks and feels unique, yet all share a
family resemblance that says `Sony' wherever they go.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, saying Sony _ make that trumpeting Sony _ is what the
magazine is all about. Call it custom publishing, relationship
marketing or naked self-promotion, it all boils down to the same
principle: A publisher like Time Warner's Time Inc. produces a
magazine for a customer like Sony or Starbucks to use in its
marketing program.
</P>
<P>
   Custom-published magazines are either sold on newsstands, given
out as freebies at stores or sent to a list of customers. The
magazine publisher is almost without exception guaranteed a profit,
because to the corporate sponsor, the magazine is a marketing tool
intended for one purpose alone _ to reach the consumer _ and losses
are counted as marketing expenses. In the words of one custom
publisher, ``the companies marketing the products lose money and
the magazine publishers make money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we like it,'' the publishing executive said.
</P>
<P>
   And it has grown into big business for publishers. Custom
publications generate $650 million in revenue for the magazine
industry, according to a survey to be released this month by the
Magazine Publishers of America. David Wilkofsky, chairman of
Wilkofsky Gruen Associates, the consulting firm that conducted the
survey, said the business had grown exponentially in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relatively new industry that's arrived on the radar
screen in the last five years,'' Wilkofsky said, adding that the
economics of custom publishing are a welcome balm to magazine
publishers. ``When someone as big as Time Inc. goes into the
business, it's another stream of revenue to add to the dozens of
streams of revenue that company already has. The issue is not `does
this make money?' The issue is how major a profit center custom
publishing is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And every major publisher is doing it, with varying degrees of
editorial glasnost. For example, Hachette Filipacchi Magazines,
part of Lagardere Group and the publishers of George and Elle,
produces Momentum, which is underwritten by Mercedes-Benz, owned by
DaimlerChrysler AG. ``As the miles flew by,'' reads one travel
article in the current issue, ``I felt myself slipping into the
first phase of our hedonists' holiday. Mercedes offers three
special seat options on the S500, and our car has them all!''
</P>
<P>
   But Hachette also publishes Unlimited, a seeming men's outdoor
adventure magazine _ complete with articles about sports gear,
surfing and mountain climbing _ that is paid for by Philip Morris
Cos. and distributed to 2 million consumers on the Philip Morris
database. The only clue that Unlimited is produced by the cigarette
maker is two tiny lines of type on the magazine's masthead that
identify it as a Philip Morris publication.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc.'s custom publishing division produces Sony Style and
Joe, a joint venture with Starbucks, a lavishly produced
quasi-literary magazine that is sold for $2.95. A Time executive
said Joe will actually lose money for the company this year. And
its coffee connection is not readily visible, because there are, in
fact, no articles about coffee. Instead, the second issue featured
articles by James Salter (on flying), Frederick and Steven
Barthelme (on gambling) and Dusko Doder (on Yugoslavia).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Time has been in the custom publishing business for the last
four years, and the company policy is ``to keep a very low
profile,'' said Tim Hildebrand, president of Time Inc. Custom
Publishing. The division publishes magazines for about 18 clients,
Hildebrand said, but he declined to name them. ``There is no upside
to telling my competition what we're doing, and how we are doing
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Time produces other custom publications for Ford Motor Co.'s
Jaguar division and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target chain of discount
stores, as well as one called S that is distributed in 200 shopping
malls owned by Simon Debartolo Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Corp. publishes dozens of custom titles, from Mature
Outlook (with Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.) and You &AMP; Your Dog (with Iams
Co.) to Bond, a publication of the Lutheran Brotherhood distributed
to 3 million households. Christopher Little, the president of the
Meredith Publishing Group, said all the magazines are profitable.
``The advertiser or marketing company has a very clear idea of who
they are trying to reach and what sort of message they want to
deliver and they are not thinking in terms of a true consumer
magazine that they would charge people for,'' Little said. ``They
are trying to get their message to a targeted audience, and that's
the value.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for Sony Style, Howard Stringer, president of Sony Corp. of
America, said he expected his new quarterly to sell as well as any
consumer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony is not just about hardware anymore,'' Stringer said.
``It's about life and culture. What better way to let consumers
know that than through a magazine?''

seems far from sated. In fact, in New York, Conde Nast recently
acknowledged the sector's potential by recruiting Mark Golin from
the American version of the British laddie book Maxim to inject
some extra sex and bathroom humor into Details, its American men's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to emulate the success of Dennis Publishing, which
produces Maxim in both Britain and the United States, other
publishers are eyeing the American possibilities for their
testosterone-driven journals. Among them is EMAP Petersen Inc., a
unit of Britain's EMAP PLC, which is preparing for the American
debut of FHM (formerly called For Him), Britain's largest laddie
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever the staying power of this British invasion in the
United States, here in the laddie book's native land, after almost
five years of double-digit circulation growth, demand seems to be
flagging. Circulation figures reported by the Audit Bureau of
Circulations in Britain for FHM declined 9.6 percent from June 1998
to June 1999, a sharp turnaround from growth of 53.6 percent in the
prior 12 months. The most recent circulation figure reported was
701,089.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded magazine, published by IPC Magazines Ltd., was down even
more, dropping 15.8 percent, to 384,351, compared with a rise of 20
percent in the previous year. And Maxim, despite its burgeoning
circulation in the United States, grew here by only 3.1 percent _
to 310,096 _ from June to June, compared with 63 percent growth in
circulation in the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   Arena and Face, two of the oldest of the group, fell by 26.2
percent and 28 percent, respectively, to 46,777 and 57,703.
</P>
<P>
   All this has left editors and publishers on both sides of the
pond asking: Is the boom over? Is it possible that sex no longer
sells?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of sex and hedonistic bad behavior goes a long
way, but after a while that's all it was,'' said Mike Soutar, whom
Dennis Publishing recently hired away from EMAP's FHM to become
editor of the American edition of Maxim. Soutar said he was working
to keep Maxim from lapsing into laddie-book formula. But he would
provide no specific examples, saying simply that the British
circulation decline was ``a timely reminder that we have to keep
evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the laddie formula involves a couple of photo
spreads of women, often in lingerie, interviews with and
photographs of scantily clad models and actresses, some barroom
jokes and a twist of how-to-get-the-girl advice for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, British magazine publishers have
rushed a bevy of imitators to market, hoping to cash in on the
sector's phenomenal growth. EMAP introduced a spinoff of its
successful FHM, called FHM Collections. Cabal Communications Ltd.
joined the fray with a magazine called Front, which is risque
enough that some retailers display it on the top shelf with the
likes of Playboy and Penthouse. And IPC introduced Later, a spinoff
of Loaded aimed at older readers.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors worry that the market is now too crowded and that
some of the newcomers are dragging standards down by focusing so
narrowly on sex. Moreover, men's lifestyle magazines now sell more
than 2 million copies a month in Britain, reaching close to 60
percent of their target market of 18- to 34-year-old men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is saturated,'' Soutar said. ``It's a
relatively small country. Once your core gets bored, it's like a
souffle _ the whole thing collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Thomas, managing director of FHM in Britain, is not
ready to declare the feast at an end. Despite their circulation
drops, all of the magazines have said that ad pages are actually
up. ``The men's lifestyle market is still immature,'' Thomas said.
``There are still only seven men's magazines in the U.K., compared
with 17 women's magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas contends that the market is actually not in a decline
because several of the new titles are not yet included in the
industry's audited figures, and he said that the July issue of FHM
sold a million copies _ a figure the June-to-June circulation
report does not reflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is just settling down for the time being,'' Thomas
said. He noted that even in a weak month, FHM still reaches more
than 700,000 readers, a number he said was ``way beyond our
imaginations'' when the magazine was reintroduced in its current
form in 1994 after it was acquired by EMAP.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pundits say the bubble has burst, but it has no relation
to anything,'' he insisted. ``It's all hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that readers and even some former editors are
starting to think that the laddie book's heyday may be over. The
market ``is starting to show signs of fatigue, especially if, like
me, you are old enough to remember a time when magazines like Arena
were something to genuinely look forward to,'' Barbara Ellen, a
former staff member for Loaded, wrote in an article in The
Observer, a weekly newspaper here. ``After a while, digging for
gold beneath the pile of filth, innuendo, and glamour model bikini
bottoms gets so exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any implications the circulation drop in Britain may have
for the U.S. market, editors and publishers say it would take much
longer for an American downturn _ if only because the market is so
much larger that it will take longer to become saturated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the men's magazines in the U.S. can ever have
the same scale of success that was had in the U.K.,'' Soutar said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, as he settles in at Maxim in New York, he says he
will welcome the stateside arrival of his old employer, FHM.
``Competition always helps the sector,'' he said. ``We need it or
we'll become fat and lazy and complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's something no laddie wants to be.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after an entire week of tropical storm warnings and
hurricane watches, the North Carolina Coast will be dry and
tranquil Monday, though low clouds may persist along the Outer
Banks. A tropical depression, the remnants of Dennis, will move
north along the western slopes of the Appalachians from near
Charleston, W.Va., early Monday to Bradford, Pa., Monday night.
This will cause the steadiest rain to fall into the upper Ohio
River Basin. Up to four inches may accumulate in northern West
Virginia and western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   An air flow from the southeast at the surface to 30,000 feet
will draw moist, tropical air from the western Atlantic into the
Middle Atlantic and New England states. Showers and scattered
thunderstorms will drench some sections with more than an inch of
rain and miss others as they move toward the northwest. Maine
should be quite warm with increasing clouds.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the Middle West will promote very warm but
dry conditions from the Upper Plains to the Gulf states. The
merging of a weak tropical wave from the western Gulf of Mexico
with a jet stream disturbance in the Red River Valley will bring
numerous thunderstorms to eastern Texas, Oklahoma and sections of
Louisiana and Arkansas. Sea breezes will cause a few storms near
the eastern Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will surge into the Northwest behind a front in the
northern Rockies. Offshore winds will keep Oregon and the northern
California coast on the sunny side. Fog will be stubborn to leave
coastal valleys of southern California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Tropical Environs
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of last week, there was serious discussion that
Dennis had lost its tropical characteristics as record cool air was
swept into its circulation even as it stalled off the coast. But
when Dennis finally made landfall, there was little question that
it had stayed a tropical storm. Indeed, readings in Kentucky, west
of the storm, and in Vermont, well to the north, reached the lower
90s. Burlington rose to 93 degrees, just shy of its all-time
September record. Certainly, Dennis had brought part of the tropics
to those on the periphery of its circulation.

ONLINE RETAILERS DISCOVER THAT CUSTOMER REVIEWS CAN BUILD LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-commerce companies fill their sites with reviews of products
they sell, generally taken from marketers or magazines, but they
know that consumers frequently give much more credence to the
opinions of ``real people'' _ friends or peers who buy similar
products.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Internet retailers is how to harness the
opinions of those real people without letting the negative comments
chase prospective buyers away. The solution, some e-commerce
companies are finding, is to allow customers to have their say, and
hope that it ultimately builds sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a role for this kind of voice on the Net,'' said
Barry Parr, an analyst with the International Data Corp., a
research firm. ``You need to wear your filters when you read them,
but you can glean some really useful information.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend of posting customer reviews started, predictably
enough, at Amazon.com, which launched its reader reviews when it
started its online bookstore in July 1995. In addition to including
excerpts from published reviews, the site allowed readers to rate
books based on a five-star scale, and to post comments of their
own. At the time, such reviews were a novelty because online stores
generally relied on authoritative third parties, like professional
book reviewers, to help readers decide what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we introduced it, people asked, `If your goal is to sell
products, how can you allow it?''' said Paul Capelli, an Amazon
spokesman. ``But it's been a very effective tool to get attention
and move product.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a recent novel, ``Lip Service'' by M.J.
Rose, failed to attract a publisher, but Ms. Rose published the
book on her own and offered it for sale on Amazon. It was reviewed
so favorably by Amazon users that it entered the site's Top 100
list. The author was then signed by Pocket Books, and when the book
was re-released, it was among Amazon's top five best sellers during
a recent week. ``The customer reviews were driving her sales,''
Capelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The book's success is no longer limited to Amazon; it is now
moving well on Barnesandnoble.com, where it ranks in the current
top 100 sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Following Amazon's lead, other online retailers have instituted
programs that allow buyers to rate products. For sellers of
computers and other high-priced goods, posting customer reviews is
an even greater departure from the traditional retail norm,
analysts and executives said, because there are many established
sources for advice on buying these products. Indeed, an entire
publishing industry has been built on giving computer buyers
authoritative advice.
</P>
<P>
   NECX Direct, an Internet computer and electronics retailer that
began posting customer reviews of products two years ago, says such
reviews augment buying guides from publishers. ``This is a very
potent motivator for helping people decide what to buy,'' said
Keith Halloran, the company's director of marketing. ``In the end,
sales are made by the testimony of real users, not rebate offers or
what PC Magazine says.''
</P>
<P>
   Halloran said the site could afford to risk turning customers
away from certain products because, like many other Internet
retailers, NECX does not carry its own inventory. Rather, when a
customer places an order, NECX has the product delivered directly
from a distributor. So even if the customer is turned away from one
product, he said, the company offers enough products in each
category to make sales likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the customers say, `It's a bad product; you shouldn't buy
it,' we don't lose because we don't hold anything in stock,'' he
said. ``So we print everything _ the good, the bad and the ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Provided it's not too ugly. Halloran said NECX edited customer
reviews for profanity ``or transparent efforts to discredit
manufacturers,'' and also watched for obvious boosterism from
manufacturers. ``I'm sure that happens,'' he said, ``but most
reputable manufacturers refrain from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr, of the International Data Corp., said that even if such
reviews failed to help sales, they could still serve an important
purpose: increasing the reviewer's loyalty to the site. ``People
who are big contributors to reviews tend to have a sense of
ownership,'' he said. ``It gives them a sense of status in a place
that really matters to them, and it's pretty hard to place a price
tag on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the trend toward using customer reviews is also being
embraced by publishers who have built their businesses on offering
objective, often lab-tested, reviews. For instance, Consumer
Reports, which is published by Consumers Union, recently announced
that it would publish reviews of e-commerce Web sites from
Bizrate.com, a company that aggregates customer feedback. In
addition, Cnet, an Internet company that publishes reviews of
computer products, recently began posting readers' comments about
products, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Hill, editorial director for Cnet, said that decision was
not easy. ``It took some letting go of that attitude that you're
the editor, saying, `This is all you need to know,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill said the service, which allows readers to submit a
``thumbs up'' or ``thumbs down'' review alongside their comments,
has even helped the site's professional reviewers, who test
products in a laboratory environment. For instance, she said, Cnet
editors recently confirmed a flaw in a digital camera's lens cover
after a flurry of customers pointed out the problem. ``So this
gives us a volume approach as well as a lab approach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of sites that offer customer reviews is
growing, analysts said one important online category _
manufacturers who sell directly to consumers _ would not follow the
trend anytime soon. ``Companies are so protective of their brands
and image, it would be hard to imagine any of them taking that kind
of risk,'' Parr said, referring to companies like Nike and Compaq
Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Among manufacturers that sell directly to consumers, Dell
Computer comes the closest to offering customer reviews. In the
Talk Forum section of its Web site, Dell allows readers to post
questions or speak their minds about products they have bought.
Manish Mehta, senior manager for online support, said the company
edited only offensive, profane remarks. ``The fact that you can
absolutely slam Dell frees up people to be open,'' Mehta said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would be reluctant to post reviews in areas
of the site where buyers are poised to purchase, like the Dell
Shop. ``Conversion is so critical in e-commerce,'' he said. ``When
you finally get customers to select a product, to introduce
something that might cause them to abandon a purchase would not be
a good thing.''

<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ It was time for the money shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pacing the 18th tee at Firestone Country Club's south course
here on Aug. 29, surrounded by thousands of fans, Tiger Woods stood
464 yards from the $1 million payday for the winner of the World
Golf Championships NEC Invitational golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards behind Woods, in the CBS television
compound, the sense of anticipation and tension ran just as high.
In one end of a darkened production trailer, a half-dozen producers
and technicians sat 15 minutes away from completing four days of
live television and a 21-event season of professional golf coverage
that had taken them from one end of the country to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Playing safe, Woods hit a 2-iron instead of a driver off the
tee. And playing safe in his choice among nine cameras around the
18th hole, Steve Milton, the CBS director, picked the all-seeing
Metlife blimp that hovered at 1,200 feet to track the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Both golfer and director were disappointed. The ball veered
right into the rough and the blimp camera lost it behind a tree.
Woods was a long way from the green, and the 4.8 million U.S.
households watching the tournament had no immediate view of the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both golfer and network got what they wanted. Woods
won the event, his fifth tournament of the year; CBS captured
ratings for the final round on Aug. 29 that were more than 50
percent higher than those for the previous year. But the episode on
the 18th hole was just one sign that golf can be at least as
frustrating for television producers as it is for golfers
themselves, with the capriciousness of the game extending from the
lush fairways to the crowded production trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of many broadcast professionals, golf is the most
challenging sport to televise. True, the action itself may seem
leisurely. But spread across hundreds of acres and having no
timeouts, a big-name golf tournament requires more cameras, more
cables, more advanced wireless technology and more ingenuity than
perhaps any event short of the World Series or the Super Bowl. And
for that matter, when was the last time a tree got in the way of
televising a John Elway touchdown pass or a Scott Brosius home run?
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is probably the most difficult sport on TV for a network
to cover just because you can have anywhere from five to 20
different people in different locations all of whom can very
quickly influence the outcome of a tournament,'' said Sean McManus,
president of CBS Sports. ``Basically, in football if you follow the
ball, or in baseball if you follow the runner and the ball, or in
basketball if you follow the ball, you're not going to get in
trouble. In golf, you have up to 20 balls in play at one time, all
of which have to be covered well.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the simple fact that a golf tournament is distributed
across an entire course rather than concentrated on a single field
or court may make it the sport best suited to television. Though
fans of most sports would usually prefer to attend an event in
person rather than watch from home, those in the gallery of a golf
tournament usually miss most of the action.
</P>
<P>
   And even when a fan happens to be in the right place at the
right time, it can be all too easy to lose sight of a small white
ball against a background of blue sky and white clouds. Network
television cameras, however, have the uncanny ability to track most
shots throughout their flight and roll _ leading many viewers to
assume that golf cameramen must use sophisticated tracking
technology to lock onto a ball in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago I got a call from a guy at a big military
contractor,'' Robert G. Mikkelson, who handles blimp cameras for
CBS and other networks, recalled on the ground Thursday morning of
the NEC Invitational, while waiting for a storm system to clear the
Akron area. ``And he goes, `We've been hearing about this special
tracking system you've got. We've been working on a tracking system
of our own with a predictive function and we're working on the
algorithms for auto-track, so what are you using?'''
</P>
<P>
   When Mikkelson explained to the munitions mathematician that
golf cameramen do it by practiced eye and steady hand, ``he could
hardly believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the ball is one thing. Keeping it visible on the video
screen is a different proposition, and that's where technology _
and old-fashioned teamwork _ comes into play. In a tower by the
green of the par-3 15th hole, Skip Shackleford, a freelance camera
operator, gave a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This camera acts just like your eyeball,'' Shackleford said.
``If there's a lot of light, your iris shuts down. So the secret is
to have a darn good video operator on the other end of this
camera.'' He was referring to the video engineer back in one of the
production trucks, whose job it was to make sure the output of
Shackleford's camera would be of broadcast quality.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the clinic, Shackleford trained the camera on the
15th tee, more than 200 yards away. ``Now here you'll have a white
ball with a dark background,'' he said. ``It's pretty easy to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he smoothly tilted the big Sony camera toward the sky as if
tracking a flying ball. ``Now all of a sudden, boom! If your video
operator isn't on the case, it's gone against the bright sky.''
</P>
<P>
   As a ball comes off the tee and soars skyward, the video
technician in the truck must remotely adjust the lens iris just as
the camera operator tilts the camera up, so that both the operator
and the audience can continue to see the ball. Though Shackleford
himself could adjust the lens iris, it is next to impossible to do
so while also tracking the ball and keeping it centered on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, technology that can automatically adjust a
camera's iris as the image changes. But such automation does not
appear to have many fans in the world of golf broadcasting, which
is as much an art as a science.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an automatic, it takes a second or two to adjust,
and the cameraman's lost the ball,'' said Paul Halsey, one of the
CBS video engineers. ``We try to anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation is also a big priority for Lance Barrow, CBS's
coordinating producer for golf. He sits beside Milton, the
director, in the main production truck and oversees the entire
broadcast. Barking into a headset and facing a bank of at least 100
small television monitors showing feeds from the 21 cameras CBS
used here _ as well as from a myriad of replay and graphics
machines with nicknames like Elvis, Moxie and Viper _ Barrow seems
an only slightly gentler version of Vince Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``In golf, from the minute you go on the air until you go off
the air, you're in television,'' said Barrow, who compares the
intensity of covering golf tournaments to that of covering car
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have timeouts to catch your breath. You don't have
halftime. In other sports, when we go to commercial, hopefully they
stop playing. But when we go to commercial in golf, nobody stops
playing. So you have to figure out how to work commercials in
without missing too many golf shots. It's like chess.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, golf television's original grand master was Frank
Chirkinian, who spent decades as a producer-director for CBS after
beginning his career in golf TV in 1958. Chirkinian, now a
consultant to CBS Sports, ceded his post atop the network's golf
operation to Barrow in 1996, but is still an object of respect in
the production truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught us all,'' Milton said. ``We were all his proteges
and you can still see his work in our shows.''
</P>
<P>
   One way that Chirkinian's legacy may show through is in CBS's
emphasis on actual golf shots as part of a golf telecast. In the
golf world, General Electric's NBC and Disney's ABC are often cited
as putting more emphasis on storytelling, while CBS is sometimes
thought of as simply concentrating on golf. As one Professional
Golf Association official put it, ``If a golfer is about to putt
and then steps back for another look, CBS is more likely to cut to
another shot and then come back, while NBC might stay and have the
announcer tell a little story or anecdote about the player.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the major networks, CBS has dominated men's golf coverage
for at least a decade. In the current PGA-tour season, which ends
in November, CBS will have covered 16 tour events, plus the PGA
Championship and the Masters tournament and several other events
that are not part of the PGA tour. ABC televised 11 PGA tour events
and the British Open, while NBC covered five tour events and the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   For CBS, the technical mastermind here and at almost all of its
golf events is Robert G. Brown, the field technical manager. By the
morning of Aug. 30, just hours after the NEC tournament finished,
Brown was on his way to Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga.
There, he would supervise the laying of underground fiber optic
cables in anticipation of next spring's Masters, a tournament CBS
has televised for 44 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   But Augusta National, where the course is often redesigned in
the off-season and where cables are not permitted to run above
ground, is a special case. For most tournaments, advances in
wireless and optical communications technology allow Brown to set
up a course in days, rather than weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with even a decade ago, ``it's really much easier
now,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can set up much faster and cut down our man-hours. What we
have been able to do with a regular tournament is bring the stuff
and people in Tuesday morning. We can effectively set up in two
days,'' he said, alluding to the Thursday start for most golf
tournaments. ``In the old days you would start setting up the
previous Saturday morning because you had so much cable to run.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And, in the old days the cable was triaxial, a type of wire
similar in some ways to the coaxial cable that brings cable
television into millions of homes. Each tower set up for cameras
and announcers would require multiple triaxial lines, for monitors,
cameras and sound.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Brown simply runs a single optical fiber to
each tower, a strand that can carry up to four channels of
broadcast-quality video. The catch is that optical fibers cannot
carry electric power to the camera towers, as triaxial cable can,
so small, relatively quiet diesel generators provide electricity
for the towers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the most important technical innovation in televised golf in
recent years has been the use of mobile wireless cameras _ also
called R.F. cameras because they transmit using radio frequencies.

   ``In the old days when I worked in golf, all you'd ever see was
the last four holes,'' said Ken Aagaard, senior vice president of
CBS Sports for operations and production services. ``Imagine
someone saying, `Tiger Woods just eagled the eighth hole' and that
would be it. They'd just say it. Now with the R.F. cameras we can
go just about anywhere.''

   The eight R.F. cameras that CBS used here allowed the network to
transport viewers around the course and into nooks and hollows
invisible to stationary, or ``hard,'' cameras. To maintain
broadcast-quality pictures, each mobile camera crew needed to keep
a clear line of sight to one of four antennas around the course _
two of which were mounted on 200-foot-high cranes.

   With all of the changes in technology have come changes in the

<P>
   ``We used to own a lot of equipment, but the problem is that the
technology changes so quickly it doesn't make sense with all the
capital costs,'' said Terry Ewert, executive producer of CBS
Sports. ``So we want to work with vendors who can get the latest
technology and they can assume the depreciation.'' As is, CBS may
spend $1 million or more covering a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The outside vendors _ who rent equipment including trucks and
wireless gear _ may assume the depreciation, but for CBS Sports, as
for duffers around the country, golf has become a preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has become almost a yearlong sport for me,'' said Barrow,
even though he also works on other sports for CBS. ``There's not a
day that goes by that I don't talk to someone about golf.''

EASING TELEPHONE-LINE CONGESTION  
 COMMUNING DIGITALLY WITH THE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For the last few years, phone companies throughout the country
have been busy adding new area codes to metropolitan regions to
accommodate the rising demand for new phone numbers. In Seattle,
where for decades one area code covered the area, there are now
three. Callers in the two new areas must dial 10 digits for every
call, and so must people in the city who phone the suburbs. Many of
these new area-code calls are now billed as long-distance calls.
 &HT;    It is a cumbersome solution to the threat of running out of
phone numbers altogether, as more people demand separate lines for
their telephones, faxes and modems. After all, you cannot receive
calls if your line is tied up on the Internet.
 &HT;    Now, three Swedish inventors have won a patent for an invention
that aims to ease such congestion and perhaps eliminate the need
for costly multiple lines. Their invention routes conventional
phone calls to a World Wide Web site that then notifies a user of
an incoming phone call in much the same way that e-mail systems
report that a person has new mail.
 &HT;    The three _ Anders Danne, Goran Bangge and Hans Hall _ have
designed a system in which a window pops up on a computer screen to
notify a user that a call is coming in over the telephone line, and
the window comes with buttons that the user can click on to answer
the phone, ignore the call, put the caller on hold, take a message
or redirect the call elsewhere.
 &HT;    But first, potential users must subscribe to the system. Then,
incoming calls are routed through a phone network where information
about the person calling is deciphered from their phone number.
That information might include the caller's name, a company name or
an address. The network then determines whether the person being
called is a paid-up subscriber. If so, software in the system
activates a connection with a Web site and sends an alert message
to the subscriber's personal computer.
 &HT;    The window would also incorporate caller ID technology to
include information about the caller so that anyone using a phone
line to surf the Internet could decide whether or not to take the
call without first logging off.
 &HT;    The invention won patent number 5,946,381.

   Death Is Transitory, But Software Is Eternal
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Ouija board. Making contact with the afterlife has
gone digital. Lynn Svevad, an inventor in Holland, Mich., has
patented a computer program called ``Forever By My Side,'' and with
it, anyone can hold a conversation with dead relatives or friends _
as long as they don't mind that the responses are prerecorded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Svevad has written software that lets the living call up
images of the deceased, complete with voice and motion, using
material that would have been collected while the person was still
alive. Details like personality and mannerisms can be added. After
that is complete, Ms. Svevad allows the living to choose from three
levels of communication with the dead: basic, intermediate and
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to speak with your late great-grandma? First click on her
downloaded image, then say ``hi'' into the computer microphone. The
greeting is digitized, and the computer takes over, ``relating said
spoken electronic format to an appropriate response by said
selected deceased relative or friend,'' Ms. Svevad explains in her
patent.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the computer picks great-grandma's response and
the mannerism that it deems likely of her. Repeat Steps 1 through 4
over and over, and voila, you're talking to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Ms. Svevad's software can also be programmed to
remember special occasions. So even if great-grandma passed away
years ago, she can still greet you on your birthday with cheery
best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Svevad received patent number 5,946,657.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ New York. It's a state of mind or a matter of
perspective, depending on how you look at it. The undecided can
journey to the New-York Historical Society to check out how four
generations of native sons saw things. ``Putting It on Paper,''
through Jan. 2, features a sampling of the more than 5,000 rarities
housed by one of the nation's pre-eminent collections. Many, like
William Rickarby Miller's watercolor of New York Harbor as seen
from a farm-riddled Jersey City, depict a metropolis in the throes
of change. Others simply pay tribute to New Yorkers' favorite
heroes, like Charles Balthazar Julien Fevret de Saint-Memin's
portrait of a foppish Capt. Meriwether Lewis. Information: (212)
873-3400.

   APT PUPILS

   NEW YORK _ They have heralded the budding talent of no less than
Andy Warhol, Robert Redford, Truman Capote, Sylvia Plath and
Richard Avedon. Only time will tell what young genius might be
lurking among the winners of the 1999 Scholastic Art and Writing
Awards. Viewers can decide for themselves when 75 of the top works
are displayed from Tuesday through Friday at Artists Space, 38
Greene St., in SoHo. Sponsored by The Scholastic magazine, the
awards were founded in 1923 to encourage early achievement in the
creative arts and foster its development. This year's competition
invested in the futures of 1,100 students, who cashed in on
$170,000 in scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   CONCERTO TIME
</P>
<P>
   They're not for the fainthearted or the technically feeble. So
to do justice to ``the consummate concertos,'' the National
Symphony Orchestra has called on the consummate pros. Under Leonard
Slatkin, the orchestra will present all of Beethoven's concertos in
its annual festival devoted to the composer's oeuvre. There will be
four concerts, on Thursday, Saturday and Sept. 17 and 18, at the
Kennedy Center Concert Hall in Washington. Among those on hand to
tackle the powerhouse program: the violinist Hilary Hahn, the
Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio and the pianists Andre Watts,
Garrick Ohlsson, and Jonathan Biss. Information: (202) 467-4600.

   CHANGE OF PLACE
</P>
<P>
   Canary Wharf, the real-estate behemoth that transformed London's
East End in the early 1990s, is on a mission to polish its image.
Starting Monday, 80 works by major British sculptors will grace its
vast public spaces. ``The Shape of the Century'' traces the art
form in the last 100 years and juxtaposes it with the country's
social evolution. But that's not all. The works were originally
exhibited in the reverent spaces of Salisbury Cathedral. Installed
in this modern environment through Oct. 24, they will assume
``entirely different resonances,'' says the show's curator, and
become a sounding board for future Wharf art commissions.  &QL;

REVISIONS COLUMN: TELEVISION AS STORYTELLER, SHAPING HISTORY INTO
LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching ``Strange Justice,'' the terrific Showtime film based
on the bizarre encounters among Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas and the
Senate Judiciary Committee that resulted in the confirmation of
Thomas' Supreme Court nomination, makes one think that television
may still be the single strangest piece of technology in our daily
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions have memories as formidable as any computer's.
Editing makes them more selective and, in that way, less
democratic. But a single television show can retrieve layers of
visual, historical and emotional information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice,'' which will be rebroadcast throughout
September, instantly brings back the the experience of watching the
real hearings. And it summons up other hearings too, from the
recent Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr doings to the Watergate investigation
of a quarter-century ago. Add the televising of court trials, from
the high and mighty O.J. Simpson's to the militantly humdrum
defendants who crowd into Judge Judy's courtroom, and you have a
medium that belongs as much to oral history as to written and
visual traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people sit in front of their television sets all the
time, watching the same mesmerizing events. Then these events get
reshaped, not only through editing but also through storytelling,
just as ancient chronicles of war and conquest once did. And thus
they become part legend and part history as they are passed down.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what keeps old tales alive is all the different
versions. How do heroes and villains change as time passes and
beliefs shift? How are events interpreted as new facts and
once-submerged feelings show themselves? One hundred years from
now, when viewers compare the televised Thomas-Hill hearings to
``Strange Justice,'' will they view the first as we view texts like
Holinshed's Chronicles and treat the second as we treat the plays
that Renaissance writers made from them?
</P>
<P>
   The script for ``Strange Justice'' is based on the impressively
reported and documented book of the same title by Jane Mayer and
Jill Abramson, as well as on the hearing transcripts. The top-notch
actors add their own inflections. Which lets us compare the Anita
Hill and the Clarence Thomas we see here to the ones we saw in the
Senate eight years ago as if they were on a split screen.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Taylor does look, sound and carry herself very much as
Anita Hill did, but she reveals what Ms. Hill could not permit
herself to: the assault on what she most prized in herself,
rectitude and the ability to make decisions that were both
practical and ethical. Delroy Lindo is a less exact physical match
for Thomas, but he gets exactly what the hearings allowed us to
see, then subtly heightens it: a man taut with self-restraint who
denies all details and seizes on pieties with increasing bitterness
and rage.
</P>
<P>
   And here's one of the scariest things about all those
behind-the-scenes politicos led by Mandy Patinkin as Kenneth
Duberstein, the lobbyist who was Thomas' most jaunty, Machiavellian
handler. We knew little or nothing about these men when they were
part of a story that was being written as history, not rewritten as
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But television isn't just a repository for history, memory and
myth making. It's a repository for genres and styles, too, that
have run their course elsewhere but still meet a real need in us.
Physical comedy faltered when vaudeville floundered and silent
movies died, but it was revived in television variety shows and by
comics like Lucille Ball, Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca and Carol
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice'' turns melodrama ultramodern. The dialogue is
naturalistic (daytime soaps are more rhetorically high-pitched) but
preserves the required moral clashes: good versus evil, cynicism
versus innocence, lies versus truth, the sacred versus the
blasphemous. (``You're God's warrior,'' Thomas' wife tells him,
meaning that he must defend his reputation. You don't mess around
with prime time, Duberstein tells him with a brisk obscenity,
meaning exactly the same thing).
</P>
<P>
   The language of melodrama shortcuts ambiguity and irony. In the
old days it risked the banality of exaggeration. Today it risks the
banality of banality. But it works here because the plot is racked
with ironies and ambiguities alongside moral absolutes, both as we
see them and as the participants see them.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Strange Justice,'' Ernest Dickerson, uses a
wonderfully flamboyant but condensed style. The camera supplies all
of melodrama's trusty, thrilling stage effects. Those freezes at
moments of decision or revelation are like the tableaux of
19th-century plays. (My favorite stage direction, a French one,
calls for a tableau of ``general stupefaction.'') A white light
floods the screen during the testimony of Ms. Hill and Thomas, when
we are supposedly made privy to their private thoughts and emotions
(denied us in the actual hearings).
</P>
<P>
   And when the television lights recreated by Dickerson's lighting
first shine on Thomas they strike his glasses and give back only
glare. This works because after so much subterfuge and so many
conflicting tales, we at last have the illusion that all is being
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   No old form looking for a new home is interesting unless it
redesigns itself. Television has plenty of tired melodrama; the
major networks specialize in it. ``Strange Justice'' is fresh and
powerful because it uses television to intensify but also to
abstract the melodrama. The camera pulls back again and again
during the hearings, and periodically the actors are spliced into
film clips of the real events (Lindo next to President George Bush
the day he nominated Thomas). All to remind us that we are watching
a film of a film of something that really happened, and that all
three experiences have an equal claim on us.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from ``Strange Justice'' than ``The
Sopranos,'' that sensational HBO series about the professional and
domestic travails of a New Jersey Mafia family. But with its own
inimitable mix of tones (grisly, rueful, desperate, savvy) and
forms (crime thriller, domestic drama, absurdist comedy), it also
uses resources only television provides.
</P>
<P>
   We've had brilliant movies about Mafia life. What we haven't had
is a serial _ not a soap opera rushing headlong toward a dramatic
apotheosis each week _ but a serial attuned as much to the ordinary
as to the extreme. How can the extreme flourish in any kind of
family without careful maintenance of the ordinary?
</P>
<P>
   For all its inventiveness ``The Sopranos'' has the look and feel
of a beautifully crafted documentary. The camera lets itself be
drawn to minor characters, peering into people's homes, recording
their private little rituals, making its way back to the center
where momentum is gathering. The director's ego is cunningly
disguised in this way.
</P>
<P>
   We are seeing how a particular world operates when murder,
shakedowns and the FBI have to share space with all the things we
know from our own lives and the lives of countless other television
families: Do you fight with your teen-age daughter or shut your
mouth? How do you keep your employees in line? How do you tell your
psychiatrist you hate your mother and she hates you, too?
</P>
<P>
   And on top of everything else they have a name like ``The
Sopranos.'' We all know that nothing is too low for television at
its worst. It turns out that under the right circumstances, more
can be done than most of us thought possible.

   Big Advertisers Turning to Their Own Magazines
</P>
<P>
   While advertisers like Sony, Philip Morris, Mercedes-Benz and
Starbucks used to press magazines to mention their products in the
editorial pages, they have now adopted a more sophisticated
approach, creating magazines in which they control the mix of
feature articles and product placement.
</P>
<P>
   Custom-published magazines are either sold on newsstands, given
out free at stores or sent to a list of customers. The magazine
publisher is almost always guaranteed a profit because, to the
corporate sponsor, the magazine is a marketing tool intended for
one purpose alone _ to reach the consumer _ and losses are counted
as marketing expenses.

   Michael Gartner, a longtime newspaper editor and a former head

newspaper in Ames, Iowa, that he has edited for six years and owned
for 13 _ to become part-owner of the Iowa Cubs, the AAA
minor-league franchise of the Chicago Cubs. Gartner said the death
of a partner, David Belin, and the tax consequences for Belin's
family ``made it clear we were going to have to sell.''

   Review Sought for Retail Merger
</P>

   Paper Turns Tables on Amazon.com
</P>
<P>
   When Amazon.com came under fire recently for publishing lists of
books and CDs popular with employees at major corporations, a
writer for Seattle Weekly, an alternative newspaper, decided to
find out which pages on the paper's Web site were most popular with

   Letting Customers Do the Selling
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce companies fill their sites with reviews of
products they sell, reviews that are generally taken from marketers
or magazines. But they know that consumers often give more credence
to the opinions of friends or peers who buy similar products. The
problem is how to harness the opinions of those real people without
letting the negative comments chase prospective buyers away. The
solution, some e-commerce companies are finding, is to allow
customers to have their say and hope that it ultimately builds
sales.

NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC THAT MITCHELL CAN REVIVE ULSTER PEACE
ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Saying that failure would be
``unforgivable,'' former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell prepared on
Sunday to begin a rescue effort to halt the disintegration of the
Northern Ireland peace agreement he helped broker.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Protestant and Catholic sides in the
conflict have deteriorated to their worst level since the accord
was signed in April 1998, making only a memory of the atmosphere of
hope and euphoria that had tentatively emerged in this beleaguered
British province.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, the largest
Protestant party, said Sunday that he was ``not optimistic'' about
the outcome of the mission by Mitchell to kick-start the peace
effort. He said that while his party members would take part in a
formal review of the accord, they would refuse to speak directly to
members of Sinn Fein, the political ally of the Irish Republican
Army.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sinn Fein replied that his party's members had a
``cynical view'' of the Ulster Unionists' desire for peace. The
Unionists' decision to end communication with the Catholic
delegation, he said, ``will make attempts to achieve a breakthrough
in the crisis all the more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mitchell said in remarks televised Sunday from
London: ``It is unthinkable to me that after having reached
agreement, the parties who support the agreement will permit it to
fail. That would be a terrible tragedy, an irony, and I think it
would be unforgivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the April accord into effect ground to a halt in July,
when the Ulster Unionists refused to allow a start-up of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly without greater assurances that the IRA
would give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It was after that breakdown that the British and Irish
governments, the sponsors of the overall peace move, turned to
Mitchell, the only person in the long insult-ridden process to have
maintained the trust of all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of any initial progress Mitchell can make, tensions
will almost certainly rise further this week with the publication
on Thursday of a long-awaited report on Northern Ireland's police
force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   How the overwhelmingly Protestant force should be reformed,
perhaps the most single divisive issue in shaping Northern
Ireland's future, has been studied by a commission headed by Chris
Patten, the former governor general of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of trust is fueled by Protestant doubts that the
largely Catholic republican movement has given up violence in
pursuit of its goal to forge closer links with Ireland, and by
republican doubts that the unionists, who want to keep Ulster in
the United Kingdom, are sincere about sharing political power with
the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting attitudes have been reinforced by events of
recent weeks. The unionists are furious with Mo Mowlam, Britain's
Northern Ireland Secretary, for her formal finding last month that
the IRA had not broken its cease-fire even though the guerrilla
organization was involved in the killing of a man suspected of
having been an informer and in a gun running plot uncovered in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mowlam is thought to have based her admittedly delicate
decision on a wish to keep Sinn Fein engaged in the peace search,
but the unionists termed her ruling naive and unprincipled, and
they called for her removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate surge in IRA punishment beatings and expulsions
from Northern Ireland of teen-age troublemakers, a process known as
``exiling,'' further convinced the unionists that Sinn Fein could
not be trusted with positions in the province's public life. They
assailed Ms. Mowlam and Prime Minister Tony Blair for refusing to
punish Sinn Fein by stopping the early releases of paramilitary
prisoners that continue under the peace agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Britain's Conservative Party reacted to the developments by
signaling that it was abandoning the bipartisan approach to policy
in Northern Ireland that has been the tradition in British
politics.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, its leader, William Hague, accused Blair of
``betraying'' the people of Northern Ireland and said the
government's refusal to confirm that the IRA had violated its
cease-fire called Blair's ``own integrity'' into question.
</P>
<P>
   Blair responded angrily the next day, protesting the ``impugning
of his motives'' and noting that he had supported Hague's
predecessor, John Major, ``through thick and thin'' when Major was
keeping contact with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Hague made his charges in a signed article in The Daily
Telegraph, the leading Conservative voice in the British press. A
day earlier the paper had escalated its criticism of Blair's policy
with a long editorial calling the peace settlement a ``calamity''
and saying the prime minister's tolerance of IRA abuses was equal
to Neville Chamberlain's ``appeasement'' of Hitler in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Trimble assigned the term an accepted spot in the
accusatory rhetoric of Northern Ireland politics. Asked to comment
on Blair's decision to press ahead with the formal review of the
peace agreement without disqualifying Sinn Fein, he said the prime
minister ``was engaged in a process of appeasing evil.''

FAITH AND SOUTHERN HERITAGE SUSTAIN LABOR SECRETARY

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serving in Washington in the 1990s has sorely taxed
the faith of Alexis Herman, the labor secretary and one of the few
remaining survivors of every blessed day of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   She has endured a nasty confirmation battle, the embarrassment
of President Clinton's dalliance with an intern, and a
little-noticed but ongoing investigation by an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Congress has nickel-and-dimed her agency's
requests for increases in spending for job-training programs and
other labor initiatives. And she is tempted at times to despair of
politics in an age of cynicism and the poisoning of public
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her faith abides, rooted in the teachings of her father, a
courageous early advocate of black voting rights in her native
Alabama who once was dragged from his car and beaten by a gang of
Ku Klux Klansmen as his 5-year-old daughter looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said she still remembers the heft of the pearl-handled
pistol her father handed her before the attack with instructions to
use it if any of the Klansmen threatened her.
</P>
<P>
   But Herman, in a conversation over a pre-Labor Day lunch late
last week, did not want to dwell on that day 47 years ago. It was
part of the upbringing that launched her lifelong devotion to
Democratic politics and minority rights and that landed her in the
24-by-36-foot corner office at the Labor Department with a
commanding view of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Her devotion has been shaken in recent years, but never to the
point of apostasy. ``It does cause me to go back and remember the
early days and the path I took to get here,'' she said over a plate
of cold sliced turkey and lifeless green beans in the private study
off her huge ceremonial office. ``I try not to be distracted by the
cynicism and the negative climate in politics today.''
</P>
<P>
   An observant Catholic since childhood, Herman begins every meal
with grace (``Bless us, O Lord, for all of our gifts and for these
we are about to receive'') and fluently recites her favorite
biblical passage, from the Book of Proverbs (``Lean not unto thine
own understanding but in all ways acknowledge Him and He shall
direct thy paths'').
</P>
<P>
   Prominently displayed on a side table is a picture of the labor
secretary with her pastoral and political shepherds, Pope John Paul
II and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Steeped in Southern gentility _ she takes four bites to finish a
single cherry _ she is enduringly gracious and reluctant to talk
about her personal life. She has never been married, except to her
work, and finds relaxation in hiking, biking and reading. She
entertains her friends and her large extended family with
``old-style Southern cuisine,'' including about a half-dozen
versions of her signature dish, red beans and rice.
</P>
<P>
   Herman is at once earnest and glib (one friend once called her
``the queen of schmooze''). But she did not want to talk about the
inquiry by an independent counsel ordered in May 1998 by Attorney
General Janet Reno to try to resolve accusations of
influence-peddling and conflict of interest against her.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are looking into her role in a series of White
House fund-raising coffees in 1995 and 1996, as well as her private
business dealings in the 1980s when she was a consultant on
affirmative action and minority business contracts.
</P>
<P>
   She would discuss the investigation only off the record, and
only then to express bewilderment at the charges and to profess
ignorance on the progress of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Neil Eggleston, would say only, ``It's not taking
up too much of my time, and almost none of the secretary's.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Herman nor Eggleston would estimate how much the
investigation has cost her in legal fees, but the final bill will
almost certainly be in six figures.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the office of the independent counsel, Ralph Lancaster
Jr., a semiretired lawyer from Maine, went unreturned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Herman has spent virtually her entire working life engaged in
the struggles of working women and minorities. Her first job after
graduating from Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans was
with Catholic Charities in Pascagoula, Miss., lobbying the local
shipyard to give apprenticeships to unskilled black workers.
</P>
<P>
   She lent her good dresses to black women applying for office
jobs in the 1970s. She served as director of the Labor Department's
women's bureau in the Carter administration. And she worked on the
presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson before joining the
Democratic Party in 1989 as deputy director under Ron Brown.
</P>
<P>
   She was involved in the presidential transition in 1992 and
worked in the White House as director of the office of public
liaison through Clinton's first term. She was nominated for the
Labor post in January 1997 and confirmed four months later after a
bitter struggle with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The position of labor secretary _ she is the first black woman
to hold the job _ has given her an enviable platform to address
issues that have animated her all her life: the rights of workers
in the United States and abroad, the difficulty of balancing work
and family, job programs for disadvantaged youth, the transition to
an information economy.
</P>
<P>
   She listed as her priorities for her remaining months in office
an expansion of the administration's welfare-to-work programs,
additional help for unskilled workers and passage of the
president's health-care bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   On l'affaire Lewinsky, Herman toed the company line: She was
``disappointed'' in the president's behavior but never doubted his
ability to lead the nation or the sincerity of his contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president made a mistake and he told us he made a
mistake,'' Herman said, the smooth smile never fading from her
perfect-oval face. ``I was raised in a faith and a tradition of a
forgiving gospel.''

AS `BIRTHDAY' GIFT, CHINA ANNOUNCES PAY INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese government on Sunday night announced
sweeping increases in salaries, pensions and welfare payments for
84 million people, describing the move as a birthday gift as the
country prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Officials clearly hope the raises will help their attack, as yet
futile, on a stubborn case of deflation that is holding down
economic growth. Insecure about their financial prospects,
consumers are saving rather than spending and the retail price
index has declined for some 22 months.
</P>
<P>
   The pay increases, which are generally in the range of 15
percent to 30 percent and are retroactive to July 1, will go to
workers and retirees in government offices, schools and other
state-funded facilities. In addition, monthly subsidies to millions
of unemployed workers and urban poor people will increase by an
average of 30 percent, according to the announcement on national
television news Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   As for beleaguered state-owned enterprises, the announcement
said they must decide on wages ``according to their efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was not a surprise because officials have
publicly said in recent weeks that a raise was in store.
</P>
<P>
   The raise will cost the government more than $6 billion for the
second half of this year, said the finance minister, Xiang
Huicheng, in a television interview Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The average increase for public workers will be only $15 a
month, officials said. Many senior bureaucrats and college
professors earn little more than $100 a month in cash salary, plus
bonuses and other benefits. At the same time, many workers face
rising rents as the government tries to reduce housing subsidies
and create a commercial housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the first half of this year is said to be 7.6 percent,
just under last year's annual rate, but many experts say these
figures are significantly overstated. Slowed growth and rising
unemployment in the last two years have contributed to social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to goad people into spending more, the
government said last week that it would begin taxing the interest
earned on personal savings accounts. Many Chinese are not
accustomed to paying income tax and that measure was greeted by
much grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also continuing to issue bonds for
infrastructure projects, but as it runs out of options it may also
have to consider devaluation of the yuan in the coming year to get
the needed economic jolt, some foreign economists say.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Sunday night, Xiang, the finance minister, said
he hoped that the raises would stimulate consumption and help to
reduce the growing ``irregularities'' in salaries _ a reference to
the huge gulf in compensation between middle- and upper-level civil
servants and people in the growing private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the raises had been timed with the Oct. 1
anniversary in mind, Xiang replied, ``Yes, of course. The 50th
anniversary is a time when all of China is celebrating.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two stories above Broadway, in the MTV studio that
looks out on Times Square, the cameras are rolling, flitting across
an audience of girls in braces and ponytails, tank tops and shorts,
and panning on the scene below, on the mass of people who have been
gathering on the street for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty seconds ... 10 seconds ... two seconds .... And here
she is! Christina Aguilera!'' Applause, big applause, and from the
street giddy screams rise from the throng of fans herded with their
homemade posters and banners behind police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Whirling and waving in front of the window looking out on the
crowd, Christina Aguilera, in low-hip leather pants, 3-inch-heel
boots and bare midriff, leaps, her slight frame twisting, her arms
raised, ready to take flight. For a second or two, she looks all of
13.
</P>
<P>
   But she is 18, and for five weeks has had the No. 1 pop single
in the nation, ``Genie in a Bottle.'' Her first album, named after
herself, is now making its debut, not with a single-day splash but
with a weeks-long schedule of signings, television appearances and
interviews in New York and Los Angeles, all intended to make her
not just this summer's pop sensation but a major star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a feeling that's different from any other feeling
in the world,'' she said of her fans' clamoring. ``When I see all
these people screaming and chanting and holding those signs that
they made just for me, my eyes light up, and my whole body just
lifts, and I just feel in another state. I feel like I'm floating
on air. It's the most incredible feeling, and I've always wanted
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago Ms. Aguilera was an obscurity, one of the
lesser-known singers in a new crop of teen-age performers. She had
cut her teeth on the Disney Channel's ``Mickey Mouse Club,'' along
with Britney Spears and members of 'N Sync, and she had drawn some
attention with her rendition of ``Reflection'' on the ``Mulan''
soundtrack. But she had released no songs or videos and had made no
major national television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 22, her single came out, and she seemed to spring
out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   It was not so simple, of course. Since teen-age artists are
often one-hit wonders, RCA Records, which gave her a seven-album
contract in June 1998, worked especially hard to create a
packaging, producing and promotion campaign for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an incredible voice and presence,'' Bob Jamieson, the
president of RCA Records, said in an interview. ``You know
immediately that she's a star. She has that X factor.'' But that
was not enough. ``We worked on her clothes, her makeup, her hair.
The main thing, we helped her find the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Top pop songwriters were signed up, and an album was put
together mostly for the teen-age market but skewed smartly with
bluesy cuts toward an older audience also. ``I think we've done
Christina fairly uniquely in that we knew that she would appeal to
teens, but we also knew that she was much more than just a teen
artist,'' said Nick Cucci, RCA's marketing vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Christina team at RCA wishfully likens her to Mariah Carey
or Whitney Houston or Celine Dion. Ron Fair, her record producer at
RCA, calls her, in the hyperinflation of the business, ``our
Streisand.'' And MTV has booked Ms. Aguilera on several
high-profile shows like ``Total Request Live,'' where she appeared
on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics reviewing her album have run from hot to
lukewarm. In Time magazine, David Thigpen called her ``one of the
most strikingly gifted singers'' since Mariah Carey. In The New
York Times, Ann Powers said, ``This album hints at a real singer's
emergence.'' But Rolling Stone gave it only two and a half stars
out of five and scoffed at the choice of songs on the album as
``the empress' old clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending four hours in and out of the wardrobe and makeup
rooms and taping segments for MTV, Ms. Aguilera led her entourage _
manager, publicist and bodyguards _ out of the building, her red
cell phone planted on her ear. A black limousine waited to take her
around the block to the RCA offices. She is, her handlers believe,
too precious a commodity to simply cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later she was ready for a photo shoot in the RCA
conference room, 35 floors above Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   In carefully honed sentences that seemed rehearsed, she said:
``Actually being 18 does put even more pressure on you if you want
to be taken seriously as an artist, because you have to be on top
of what you want to say, how you want to say it, what you want your
points to be and how to get them across. You have to be way sharper
than anybody else because people expect you to be this bubble-gum
airhead, like a dipsy young girl who doesn't know what she's
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``I plan to take this to its absolute fullest,
venturing off into all sorts of different areas of this business,
all aspects of creativity,'' like movies, television, Broadway,
record-producing. ``I look up to people like Madonna, who has been
able to just completely reinvent herself over and over and over
again.''

</P>
<P>
   A life of limousines and people catering to every whim can be
intoxicating at any age, but this singer shows little of the
flighty teen-ager, except for nervous giggles that come when she
lapses into what can seem like studied seriousness, the
Mousketeer-trained smile deserting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very spiritual person, and I have a very strong belief
in God and he's completely led me to this point,'' she said.
``There were days years ago when I wanted this more than anything
in this entire world, and I would pray so hard. It was a complete
need I had to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I tend to be a control freak, and I have to be a
perfectionist. I think that's what drives me, because it gives me
control over a situation. I hate feeling vulnerable to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue eyes looked away. She went on: ``A lot of people don't
get to see my personal side, because right now my whole persona is
that of a pop star, and since I am 18 years old, I think that if I
became this serious, appeared to be this deep thinker all the time,
people would almost be scared. They want to see the very bubbly,
perky, outgoing personality.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is ``fearless,'' she said. ``I'm more afraid of the
little things than of the bigger things,'' like ``wanting to
conquer something, to make an impact on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aguilera was born in New York, the daughter of an Army
sergeant. She spent her early years in Texas, New Jersey and Japan.
Her parents separated when she was 7, and she and her mother,
Shelly, moved in with her grandmother in a suburb of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   At age 9 she made her national television debut on ``Star
Search,'' a talent competition that she lost. She auditioned for
``The Mickey Mouse Club,'' was signed when she was 12 and traveled
to Orlando, Fla., to tape the show in the summer. She was
successful but became an outcast at school, the object of snubs and
ridicule, so she left after the eighth grade, her mother and an
occasional math tutor taking over.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in one of those scenes from a teen-age movie, she
went back to her high school for its prom, saying she wanted ``to
do a normal thing for once,'' just another pop star at the school
dance. But there was no applause, only cold glares.
</P>
<P>
   These days she has no real home. She rents an apartment in New
York and, with bookings through the end of the year, can hardly
think of settling down. She sees little of her mother, with whom
she says she is close, and has lost track of her father, Fausto.
</P>
<P>
   But she wants to go to Ecuador, her father's homeland, and she
plans, besides writing songs for her next album and going to the
Far East and Latin America on tour, to release one record in
Spanish. ``I want to be part of that,'' she said, ``and let people
know I'm part of that, that I have Latin roots as well.''
</P>
<P>
   She also wants to use her popularity, if it lasts, to take up
the cause of battered children and women. ``That's what I meant
when I said I wanted to make an impact on the world.''

 &HT;    PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AWAIT FREEDOM WHILE ISRAELIS ARE DIVIDED
OVER THEIR RELEASE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank The dream of a Palestinian mother, Raba Abu
Radaha, may be a nightmare for many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   One of her sons was convicted of killing a Palestinian who
collaborated with Israel. The other hit a Jewish woman settler in
the head with a bar. Today they sit in an Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new agreement signed over the weekend, the pair
may be able to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Israelis want to make peace, they can only make it with
families and people themselves, not with governments,'' said the
mens' brother Samiya Hassan Abu Radaha. ``To do that, you must
release the prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   A committee of Palestinians and Israelis was gathering names
Sunday night to decide who will be among the 350 prisoners released
under this weekend's revision of the Wye River Memorandum. It was
one of the last items worked out in the weekend's negotiations and
the most emotional issue for Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, only prisoners arrested for crimes before
the 1993 beginning of the Oslo peace process would be released. The
Oslo process is aimed at ending hostilities by giving autonomy to
the Palestinians in land Israel captured in 1967. According to
reports, approximately half of the 2,000 palestinians held for
anti-Israeli crimes would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But even among the pre-Oslo group, not all will go free. Israeli
officials say they will not release any prisoners who killed
Israelis. They also balk at releasing anyone who belongs to groups
still opposed to peace. Thus, fundamentalists of Hamas or Islamic
Jihad would not be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But the sons of Raba Abu Radaha do not fall into any of thes
categories. They were activists in Yasser Arafat's Fateh movement
and were both arrested in the early 1990s, before Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   When she visited them in jail Sunday, she said they were ``happy
and optimistic'' this weekend's peace agreement between
Palestinians and Israeli leaders would allow them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, there is near unanimity that all the political
prisoners should be released.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis know the prisoners as terrorists and their
opinions are divided.
</P>
<P>
   Dov Kalmonovitz said he disagrees with the release of prisoners
who only wounded their Israeli targets. A 44-year-old Israeli
accountant, he was burned over 75 percent of his body when a
Palestinian set his moving car ablaze with a Molotov cocktail in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who threw the Molotov cocktail wanted to kill me.
Just because I survived and am still standing does not mean he
should be released,'' Kalmonovitz said. ``The people who did these
terrible things must stay in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   His attacker was never caught, but he has campaigned against the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Chava Stern, 70, takes a different view. Her 64-year-old
husband, Menachem Stern, was a prominent professor at Hebrew
University when he was stabbed to death in 1989 by three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stand in the way of peace. Menachem will not return
and we cannot change that, but we have to go forward,'' Chava Stern
said. ``We have to do everything we can to make sure that more
families will not join the cycle of sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   (Optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In Palestinian communities, almost every family has a relative
who is or was in Israeli jails. It's considered an honor in the old
struggle against an Israeli occupation to which they lost land,
homes and their political rights. Most prisoners' families receive
small subsidies from the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her two sons now in jail, another son, Hani,
spent four years in prison for throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails
at Israeli troops. He was released in an earlier Oslo-related
amnesty in 1994. He is now in the Palestinian National Authority
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation of struggle,'' said Amin Abu Radaha, 27.
``A fight for freedom.''

 &HT;    Dems, GOP spar over Waco
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As partisanship escalated Sunday over belated
revelations about the 1993 tragedy in Waco, Republican lawmakers
demanded a congressional investigation and the ouster of Attorney
General Janet Reno while Democrats blamed the FBI and said Congress
should hold off on hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who denied for the past six years that the government used
incendiary tear gas grenades in their assault on the Branch
Davidian compound, announced last month that she was mistaken.
Claiming that she only learned recently that the devices had been
used, Reno has called for an outside investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas was among the Republicans calling for
Reno to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point where not knowing is not an excuse,'' said
Gramm on ``This Week'' on ABC-TV. ``When you have a high position
of public trust, I think part of your job is knowing and when you
don't know you're not doing your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., said his House Government Reform
Committee will look into all aspects of the April 19, 1993, FBI
assault that ended with the deaths of Branch Davidian leader David
Koresh and 75 of his followers, including 21 children. Burton said
he is disturbed by new reports that Army Special Operations forces
were at Waco throughout the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of this needs to be investigated,'' said Burton on
``Face the Nation'' on CBS-TV. ``We thought we had all the answers
six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents ``were in my opinion incompetent in doing the
investigation or there was a cover-up, one or the other,'' said
Burton. ``But (Reno) should be held responsible, because she was
the attorney general and it was on her watch.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Democrats defended Reno and blamed FBI Director Louis
Freeh because his agency conducted the Waco operation and
subsequent investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an incident here in which Janet Reno is now being
blamed for what the FBI didn't do,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mi.,
on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as blaming (Reno) for the investigation, we should
remember that she used primarily the FBI to do the investigation,''
said Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In their appearances on Sunday TV talk shows, Democratic
congressmen appeared to be following the White House line. On
Saturday, President Clinton pointedly supported Reno but not Freeh
in answering questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Freeh, he said he said there wasn't ``any purpose to assign
blame until the investigation is concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, a
Republican presidential hopeful, said he would fire Reno while
calling Freeh the ``single best'' FBI director he has seen during
his years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress is returning from its summer recess this week,
Democrats said this is not the time for committee hearings on Waco.
Wait until an independent investigator is appointed and has
completed the outside probe, they urged.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry is that congressional investigations will bring up a
lot of heat and not very much light. Each party will play its
preordained role, there will be lots of fighting, and the
conspiracy theorists will be given even more feelings against the
facts,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans -- who control both the House and Senate --
predicted there would be hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have the country misled for six years by the Justice
Department and the FBI and not have Congress do something about
it,'' said Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a number of questions that have to be answered as to
the role of the Delta Force, as to the use of the incendiary
devices, and at what level up the chain the approval was given,''
said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``And so Janet Reno accepted
responsibility, and we have to ask what does that mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., also said there is much for Congress to do
on the Waco investigation. Appearing on CNN's ``Late Edition, Barr
also suggested Atlanta attorney Griffin Bell as a competent and
credible outside investigator. Bell served as attorney general in
the Carter administration.

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Voters in two German states handed a sharp rebuff to
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Sunday, ousting his long-dominant
Social Democratic Party in the western Saarland and ushering a
far-right party into the state Parliament for the first time in
Brandenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The results amounted to a humiliating setback for the
chancellor, who has been unable to exploit the wave of enthusiasm
that brought him to office a year ago. He has seen his support
dwindle steadily as unemployment in Europe's largest economy has
remained high, with disgruntlement widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised statement, Schroeder said that he was
``disappointed and sad'' about the results, but that they would in
no way affect ``my readiness to fight on.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saarland, where the Social Democrats have been in power for
15 years, projections by leading television networks showed the
Christian Democrats edging out Schroeder's party by 45.3 percent to
44.3 percent _ a remarkable result in what amounts to a heartland
of German labor.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Brandenburg, a former East German state surrounding
Berlin, turned away from the Social Democrats in droves, bringing
the party's share of the vote down to about 39.5 percent from 54.1
percent in 1994. The Social Democrats will now be obliged to form a
coalition government in the state.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main beneficiaries of the disillusionment with
Schroeder was the far-right Deutsche Volksunion, which spent
heavily in recent weeks to ram home a xenophobic message that
unemployment of about 20 percent in Brandenburg was attributable to
the presence of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The Volksunion took about 5.3 percent of the vote, projections
showed, just over the 5 percent needed in Germany to qualify for
parliamentary representation. The result clearly reflected anger
among youths in the eastern states who have been unable to find
jobs and have chosen to vent their frustration through skinhead
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outstanding achievement and I am highly
satisfied,'' said Gerhard Frey, the wealthy Bavarian publisher who
is the Volksunion's main backer. After its success last year in
another eastern state, Saxony Anhalt, where the party took 13
percent of the vote, the result Sunday suggested that the east
remains fertile ground for neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's outcome indicated that the coming months will not be
easy for Schroeder. After a long spell of policy zigzags, he has
been trying to project a more decisive air, particularly over
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he now seems ready to gamble that unpopular measures
_ including freezing pensions in real terms and huge budget cuts _
will over the medium term help revitalize a state-heavy economy and
so create the jobs that Schroeder promised to deliver when he came
to power under the banner of the ``New Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamble is a considerable one and, with three more state
elections approaching in the coming weeks, the chancellor's
authority may be further undermined. But for now, his own party and
his coalition partners, the Greens, are trying to present a united
face despite evident tensions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The results Sunday will erode Schroeder's support in the upper
house of Parliament where the Social Democrats had a clear majority
until a defeat in the state of Hesse in February. The 69-seat upper
house consists of delegations from the 16 state governments, with
Saarland holding three seats and Brandenburg four.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder will be obliged, more than ever, to compromise with
the Christian Democrats on major legislation because the upper
house can amend or reject bills from the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Pending legislation includes the budget offered by Hans Eichel,
the finance minister, which amounts to the cornerstone of
Schroeder's domestic policy. It proposes a $16-billion cut in
federal spending next year _ a step the government regards as
essential to bring down spiraling federal debt and eventually open
the way for tax cuts seen as vital to spurring the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel's draft budget has not proved popular, especially his
proposal to end the longstanding German practice that pensions rise
at the same rate as wages. The pension proposal provided a great
deal of ammunition for the Christian Democrats in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It has also divided the Social Democrats. Reinhard Klimmt, the
party's candidate in Saarland, has in recent weeks been a sharp
critic of what he has portrayed as Schroeder's rightward turn away
from the party roots in organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   The message went down well with labor unions in Saarland. But
high unemployment and anger over the departure from government and
party leadership earlier this year of Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine, the former Social Democratic Saarland state premier,
evidently undermined the Klimmt campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Klimmt will now hand the state premiership, which he inherited
from Lafontaine, to Peter Mueller, a young Christian Democrat who
appealed to voters with a vision of a new Saarland economy based in
the service, software and telecommunications industries of the
future. Mueller has said the heavily subsidized regional coal
industry will have to close.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of Klimmt, after the departure from politics of
Lafontaine, leaves the left wing of the Social Democrats without
any obvious representative. This may help Schroeder as he tries to
push through his program, but may also cause anger and frustration
among Germany's powerful unions.
</P>
<P>
   In Brandenburg, the Christian Democrats and the Party of
Democratic Socialism _ the former East German Communist Party _
each benefited from the collapse of the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats took about 26 percent of the vote,
projections showed, compared with 18.7 percent in 1994, and the
Party of Democratic Socialism took about 25 percent, 7 percent more
than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear which party Manfred Stolpe, the
Social Democratic state premier, would invite to form a coalition.
But it is already clear that the eastern states, a bulwark of
Schroeder's electoral victory a year ago, have quickly shifted
their allegiance and still amount to turbulent, unpredictable
political turf a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Less than 24 hours after a new Israeli-Palestinian
agreement was signed, two cars packed with explosives blew up
almost simultaneously in two northern Israeli cities Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Tiberias and Haifa, the cars' occupants, presumed to be
failed car bombers, were killed and several passersby were injured,
one seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions offered a jolting reminder of the terrorist
threats that had hovered over recent negotiations. And they forced
a very quick test of what the newly restored Israeli-Palestinian
relationship could weather, since terrorism has interrupted the
peace process many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday night, Ehud Barak, the prime minister of Israel,
issued a terse statement saying that Israel would not tolerate
``violence or terrorism against innocent civilians.'' But he did
not make any indication that he would halt the peace process he had
just revived.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the attempted attacks did not even derail his evening
plans. The prime minister spent most of the night locked in heated
debate over his budget cuts with the Israeli Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The two cars, both Fiat Unos, detonated almost simultaneously,
just after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee, debris from the
blast injured several passers-by, one woman seriously. The two
presumed bombers went up in flames in a car left badly mangled.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mediterranean port town of Haifa, the police labeled the
explosion a work accident, indicating that the man who was killed
was presumed to have been rigging his car bomb. The blast took
place in a nearly deserted parking lot in a mixed, Israeli and
Arab, commercial area. Surrounding cars, which were empty, burst
into flames, and the lot lay strewn with the Fiat driver's body
parts Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The car bombers were presumed to be acting in coordination.
Israeli police said the explosions bore the hallmarks of Islamic
militant terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   No group immediately took responsibility for the bombings. The
police were also allegedly investigating a possible coordination
between Israeli Arabs and Palestinian terrorist groups, television
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions came minutes after the Israeli Cabinet
overwhelmingly approved Barak's new deal with the Palestinians. The
deal, signed early Sunday morning in Egypt, modifies a previous
agreement, creating a timeline for Israeli withdrawals from the
West Bank and for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the timing, I think this clarifies that there is a
war going on between the peace process and terror,'' said Yaron
Ezrhahi, a leading political scientist. ``The paradox is that when
there is no terror, it is usually the victory of terror over the
peace process. Now, they are fighting the peace process because
they know it promises to kill terror once and for all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the General Security Services investigated the two scenes,
the Israeli police set up road blocks at the entrances to every
city in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours before the attempted attacks, Jibril Rajoub, a senior
Palestinian security official, had told Israel Radio that
Palestinian security had evidence that both Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, two fundamentalist groups, were planning terror incidents to
disrupt the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rajoub said his officers had arrested 50 Hamas members in the
last few weeks in an effort to foil their plans to commit terrorist
acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we don't know the full story, I would like to
express here the Palestinian Authority's firm policy of zero
tolerance for terror,'' Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian
negotiator, told CNN Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions Sunday followed a string of seemingly incompetent
terrorist attempts last fall. At the time, security experts
questioned whether the incompetence was a sign that terrorist
groups had been disabled by Palestinian-Israel security cooperation
and by a series of assassinations of key operatives.
</P>
<P>
   But, as was pointed out then, even a bumbling car bomber can
wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators condemned the attacks
and their implications for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said that he had hoped ``the enemies of peace'' would not
resume their terrorism. ``I hope that nothing will stop the peace
process,'' he said. ``If this proves to be a terror attack, we
totally condemn it. It's time for reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   But his counterpart, Gilad Sher, the senior Israeli negotiator,
said that continued terrorism could indeed derail the joint effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``No peace process will prevail over the personal security of
the people of Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted attacks provided ammunition for critics of Barak's
peace efforts, who had failed to capture much public attention
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, they called on him either to suspend the new
agreement or to put the Palestinians on alert that another attempt
or attack would freeze the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an appropriate moment for Barak to stop unless the
Palestinians fight terror,'' said Limor Livnat, a Likud Party
member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise I think the public will not let him return to those
days of blood-soaked streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Likud members blamed the Palestinian security forces for
making half-hearted efforts to clamp down the Islamic opposition
parties. But Ephraim Sneeh, Israel's deputy defense minister,
defended the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence the Palestinian Authority has reduced its
battle against terror in the last few days,'' Sneeh said. ``On the
contrary, we have opposite indications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot dance to the tune of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,'' he
continued. ``They want to the peace process to stop. We want it to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the attacks were aborted, life in Israel did not stop in
its tracks Sunday. After Israeli television halted its regular
programming to make the initial reports, they returned to coverage
of an Israel-Cyprus soccer match. (Israel lost).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Israeli Cabinet, after taking a break to
investigate the situation, plunged back into tense budget
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Returning Sunday morning from the midnight signing ceremony in
Egypt, Barak faced mounds of fetid garbage in the streets of
Jerusalem, evidence of a nationwide municipal workers' strike.
</P>
<P>
   Then he plunged into meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Barak enjoyed the overwhelming support of his Cabinet for his
peace initiative earlier Sunday; only Natan Sharansky, the Russian
immigrant leader, and Yitzhak Levy, the National Religious Party
leader, voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   But he faced open rebellion over his planned budget cuts, with
opposition from at least 11 populist-minded ministers, including
several of his key allies in the peace effort.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a painful setback for the Russian military, Islamic
militants mounted a ferocious assault in Dagestan, and a powerful
bomb demolished an apartment building housing Russian officers and
their families in that Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, who had all but declared victory against the
rebels nearly two weeks ago, said at least 30 people had been
killed and about 110 wounded in the blast, which occurred late
Saturday night when a car bomb exploded in Buinaksk, Dagestan's
second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed the ruins of the five-story apartment
complex: a heap of collapsed walls, twisted metal and debris beside
a 10-foot-deep bomb crater.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing coincided with a separate rebel offensive in western
Dagestan, as the militants _ estimated to number several hundred to
more than a thousand _ streamed across the border from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed fighting was an unwelcome political test for
Vladimir Putin, the former intelligence official who was elevated
to the post of prime minister last month by President Boris Yeltsin
and touted as a presidential successor.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in an interview on the ORT Russian television network,
Putin sought to assure a jittery public, still haunted by Russia's
humiliating defeat in Chechnya, that the Russian army's campaign
against the militants would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation in the Caucasus is going according to plan, not
slowly and not too fast,'' Putin said in the interview, which was
taped Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But his calm demeanor contrasted with the frantic efforts in
Dagestan to repulse the rebels. Russian air force SS-25s and
Russian artillery pounded rebel positions Sunday as the local
authorities in Dagestan, stung by the surge in the fighting,
announced a mobilization of all able-bodied men.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic clashes, a column of Russian forces
sought to break the rebel attack on a garrison of 50 policemen that
had found itself outnumbered and surrounded by the militants in the
village of Novolakskoye in western Dagestan. Russian news reports
said the garrison had been involved in a vicious fire fight for
more than seven hours and was running out of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's troubles in Dagestan began last month when several
thousand Islamic rebels crossed into the Botlikh region of the
Russian republic from Chechnya, vowing to evict Russians from the
northern Caucasus and create an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   They were led by Shamil Basayev, a Chechen commander, and
Khattab, a Jordanian-born Chechen. The assault, however, was not
supported by the Chechen government of President Aslan Maskhadov,
which has been unable to exert its will over rival warlords.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rebel incursion sparked Russian fears of a brutal
Chechnya-style conflict. Certainly the rebels have some advantages.
They know the terrain and operate with relative impunity from bases
across the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has bombed bases in Chechnya, but has been
reluctant to invade the disputed province, fearing that that would
draw more Chechens into the fighting and involve the Russian
military in a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians have some factors in their favor, too. Much of
the Dagestani population is against the rebels. The Russians also
have enormous firepower, including bombers, helicopters and
artillery, which have been used extensively in an effort to hold
down Russian losses.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial two weeks of heavy fighting near the border,
the Russian military appeared to have chased many of the Islamic
fighters back to Chechnya. The Russian forces declared victory,
though the military warned that the militants might still engage in
hit-and-run tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened this weekend was clearly much more than the
Russians had expected. On Sunday night the war was being carried
out on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the bombing of the apartment complex at
Buinaksk, where the Russian military's 156th brigade is stationed.
</P>
<P>
   Situated southwest of the Dagestani capital of Makhachkaka,
Buinaksk is near two villages _ Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi _ that
have been the scene of clashes between Russian troops and Islamic
militants and their supporters among the Wahhabi sect. The sect has
enforced Islamic law and until recently has enjoyed relative
autonomy in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The car bomb in Buinaksk went off at 9:45 p.m. Saturday, as
soldiers, their families and ordinary civilians were watching a
soccer match on television between France and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children were reported to be among the dead and
wounded, and on Sunday rescue crews dug through the rubble
searching for survivors. Other explosives were reportedly found and
defused near another apartment complex occupied by Russian troops
and a military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A second rebel attack took place in the Novolakskoye region in
western Dagestan as the militants attacked from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the rebels, Russian officials said, was to secure
this region of Dagestan and declare an Islamic republic, which
would be centered in the nearby town of Khasavyurt.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Smirnov, a senior Russian intelligence official in
Dagestan, said the separate attacks were part of a carefully
coordinated plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are links in the same chain,'' he said.

FOCUS ON SCORES ADDS NEW BURDEN IN THE CLASSROOM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   No more fun and games: As children across the nation head back
to school this fall, many are encountering a harsher atmosphere in
which states set specific academic standards and impose real
penalties on those who do not meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are clearly moving into the phase of the standards-based
school reform movement where the rubber hits the road,'' said
Robert Schwartz, president of Achieve Inc., a nonprofit
school-reform group in Cambridge, Mass., that is made up of
governors and corporate executives. ``Kids and schools know there
are consequences looming on the horizon if they don't do well, and
that gives this school season a different kind of edge in New York,
Massachusetts, Virginia and a bunch of states where this is just
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the no-nonsense, no-excuses mood springs from an
intensifying emphasis on the results of high-stakes assessment
tests, whose results determine whether students will be held back a
grade, stopped from graduating or sent to tutoring, Saturday
classes or summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week in New York City, the schools chancellor
announced that the city would hold back more than 21,000 third-,
sixth- and eighth-graders who, because they did badly on
standardized tests in the spring, were assigned to summer school
and either failed or did not take the summer school tests.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, when the results of last spring's Standards of
Living tests were announced, parents and teachers unhappily found
that fewer than 7 percent of the state's schools had achieved a 70
percent pass rate _ the level they will need to keep their
accreditation starting in 2006 _ in all four core subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In many other states, administrators and teachers are struggling
to make sure that what will be on assessment tests will be in the
curriculum without skewing the classroom day into a test
preparation session or making children feel that test scores are
all the school cares about.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, teachers and students also fear that the focus on
tests thwarts creativity and character development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a right way and a wrong way to do it,'' said Robert M.
Hauser, a University of Wisconsin professor who co-wrote a National
Research Council report last fall about the risks of high-stakes
tests. ``If you start with standards and link them to curriculum
and teacher training and introduce them over a period of time in
ways that permit kids to meet the standards, that may be great. But
it won't be if you go for the quick political fix and start by
flunking a lot of kids on tests that are educationally damaging and
increase the dropout rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin may be the only place to turn back the testing trend.
The state originally adopted Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's proposal for
making high school graduation contingent on passing an assessment
test. But after parents and legislators saw the sample questions _
interpret a quotation from Robert M. LaFollette, describe how laser
technology had changed industry and decipher a diagram of a
chemical reaction equation _ they balked, and the Wisconsin test
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents saw the test, and said they didn't care if their
children learned these things before they graduated,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost every state is moving toward standards-based
programs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Every state except Iowa has, or will soon have, specific
learning standards for English, math and science, and all except
Iowa and Montana have or are working on statewide tests to
determine which schools and students are meeting those standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-six states publish annual report cards on individual
schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty-seven states require or plan to require students to
pass a state test to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourteen states _ and far more individual school districts _
offer financial bonuses for schools, teachers and superintendents
who meet their targets for test results, attendance and dropout
rates.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than a dozen states have the power to take over failing
schools, and many are adopting tougher standards for teacher
certification and development.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the standards movement has prodded many
schools to dream up innovative ways to help lagging students. In
Charlotte, N.C., officials decided that summer school offered too
little, too late, for failing students and instead developed an
ambitious array of after-school and Saturday programs that have
attracted thousands of students and improved test results
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 230 of the 1,100 students at Northridge Middle
School in Charlotte showed up every Saturday morning from October
to May. For the first time, the school exceeded its state target,
with 65 percent of students reading on grade level, an achievement
that carries a $1,500 reward for every teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you set a standard, people rise to the occasion,'' said Don
Turner, the assistant principal who runs Northridge's Saturday
Academy. ``Some kids came because their parents made them, some
because they wanted to, but I really believe it made the
difference. We're starting again the first Saturday in October, and
we're expecting just as many kids. Of course, the enrollment goes
up right after the first marking period.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In some districts, it is not just the students who are held
accountable for results. Top officials in the Philadelphia school
district, for example, can have their pay increased or decreased
depending on whether students meet their targets. Teachers rated
unsatisfactory are denied raises, and those whose schools do well
earn extra money for the school.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, in a year when education is a top priority,
Democrats and Republicans are falling over themselves to endorse
higher educational standards. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
considered the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, is getting substantial attention for his state's record
on improving student performance. On Thursday, in a back-to-school
address, Bush proposed requirements to test disadvantaged children
each year and strip federal money from the lowest-scoring schools.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and North Carolina are often singled out as the exemplars
of standards-based programs. In both states, student achievement is
rising even while per-pupil spending remains below the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you used to have in public education was a belief system
that the educators were not responsible for results, that they were
responsible for teaching and not learning,'' said Darvin Winnick, a
retired management consultant who helped push through the Texas
program. Under the program, schools are responsible for improving
test scores not only overall, but also within specific groups like
Hispanic, black and low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, we'd hear disheartening comments that if you
were teaching and some kids didn't learn it, well, those kids can't
learn,'' Winnick said. ``This has been a major shift in belief,
that educators share the responsibility for results, that we're
responsible for seeing that every child learns.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Texas teachers have been won over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the tests,'' said Debra K. Thompson, a fifth-grade
reading teacher at Briargrove Elementary School in Houston. ``A lot
of people say it's ridiculous to test kids too much, but you need
to know if they are meeting minimal requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the education accountability movement echoes the
restructuring process American businesses went through in the late
1970s to address lagging productivity. Educators prefer the term
``result oriented'' to ``bottom-line oriented,'' and in schools,
the bottom line is learning, not profit. But the strategies are the
same: setting specific targets but giving workers great latitude in
deciding how to meet them and rewarding those who achieve their
goals but taking quick action against those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   In education, though, the accountability movement is still new,
and many parents, teachers and students argue that it forces
teachers to spend too much time teaching to the test, which crowds
out creative thinking, arts education and character development and
puts excessive weight on the regurgitation of facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test changed the whole school around,'' said Alex
Sommerfield, a junior at Danvers High School in Massachusetts who
was one of seven students suspended in the spring for refusing to
take the 10th-grade test. ``It was everywhere, teachers teaching
the test instead of the regular curriculum. In 10th grade, I took a
philosophy course, but now they're only going to let juniors and
seniors take the course because they want all the 10th-graders to
take American history because it's on the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made everything worse. And when I said I wouldn't take
it, they said the realty people were relying on our test results to
sell houses. I don't think that's what school should be about.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A group of students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin, a top-ranked
school in Massachusetts, also refused to take the exams, saying no
single test can gauge how much a student has learned. They argued
that the tests took too much classroom time and altered the way
they were taught. And in Chicago, several juniors at the
high-performing Whitney Young High School boycotted the state test,
sending the principal a letter saying that they would not ``feed
into this test-taking frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on test results poses special dangers for students
who are non-native speakers of English, have learning disabilities
or are in bad schools. Next month, when the Mexican American Legal
Defense Fund's case against the state of Texas goes to trial, the
group will try to show that the requirement that high school
students pass the state test to graduate works unfairly against
Hispanic and black students, who make up 85 percent of those who
fail the test.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, another legal advocacy group, Disability Rights
Advocates, has filed a lawsuit challenging the new assessment tests
on behalf of learning-disabled students for whom the test's focus
on spelling presents a serious obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   There are other concerns about the tests, too. Many quirky small
schools experimenting with new teaching methods worry that the
focus on test results will imperil their ability to try the
innovations that give them their energy and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)

   Even the strongest supporters of standards-based programs are
quick to acknowledge that the movement is still in an early phase
with many questions remaining to be resolved.

   ``These are uncharted waters, and a lot of states are flying
kind of blind, so it's inevitable that there will need to be
midcourse corrections,'' said Schwartz, the president of Achieve,
the school-reform group. ``We don't yet know whether it's better to
take the Texas path of raising the bar incrementally and risking
that the tests will be too basic at the start, or taking the New
York path of setting the bar high and risking that a lot of kids
won't make it at the start. And inside the profession, there are
still plenty of people who have been through various waves of
reform, and think this too shall pass.''

COOL CHICKEN SALAD CAN BE HORNET FREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind what you read in the travel brochures _ you don't
even have to leave the state of Washington to experience the best
saltwater cruise value in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in Anacortes, the ship winds its way through the
picturesque San Juan Islands and terminates in Friday Harbor, an
almost too-cute community spilling from the forested hills down to
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Total price is $5.30, or $2.70 for seniors or juniors. That
includes port taxes, gratuities, and excursions to the sun deck,
the drinking fountain or the rest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that is the walk-on fare for the state ferry ride. But
you don't bring your Subaru onto the Sun Princess, do you?
</P>
<P>
   Once in Friday Harbor you can rent a bike or a scooter, take a
shuttle bus across the island or tour the community's art
galleries, shops and numerous cafes.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I recently spent 30 minutes trying to decide which
tree-shaded outdoor table we would select at lunchtime. When we
informed the hostess of our choice she shook her head and
suggested: ``I think you'd rather eat indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bees!''
</P>
<P>
   Yup, there are thorns in the Garden of Eden. Flying thorns. A
tourist wandering down the street with an ice cream cone quickly
becomes the object of dive-bomber assaults. If the tourist begins
to slap at the buzzing intruders, everybody within a 30-yard radius
considers a swan dive into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're not bees. They are hornets, or yellow jackets.
And they perform a lot of helpful services to the flora of San Juan
Island, since they reduce the population of aphids, caterpillars
and other insect pests.
</P>
<P>
   Guess it takes a pest to recognize another one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the yellow jackets have spoiled more than one recent
barbecue and picnic, on and off San Juan Island. Even so, they are
more to be pitied than censured.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know why the yellow jackets wait until August or
September before deciding to hand-wrestle your maiden aunt for a
chicken wing at your annual family hoorah?
</P>
<P>
   Just like your maiden aunt, they're hungry. They are also
motivated by a hidden urge to fill the skies with more yellow
jackets. The hornets lack an enzyme needed to digest the food they
gather. So they deliver the food to larvae, who do have the needed
enzyme. When the kids have eaten, the adult hornets get the
leftovers, which have now been provided by the larvae with the
needed enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   However, by August or September the larvae have hatched, or
whatever, the enzymes are gone and the adult hornets are on their
own and literally starving. That's why they develop waspish
dispositions. And that's why you'd better eat indoors at Friday
Harbor, where the food is just as good ... and bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   You might find salads as good as these.
</P>
<P>
   San Juan Salad
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds cooked chicken or turkey meat
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces water chestnuts, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound seedless green grapes
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup toasted almonds
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Crisp lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   Cut the poultry into bite-size pieces and plunk into a large
bowl with the water chestnuts, grapes, celery and almonds. Chill in
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to eat, mix the mayonnaise with the curry, soy and
lemon juice. Mix with the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Put a lettuce leaf on each plate and top with portions of the
salad. This should serve six to eight.
</P>
<P>
   American Camp Salad
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound small penne pasta
</P>
<P>
   3 red peppers, seeded and cubed
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch broccoli
</P>
<P>
   12 black olives, halved
</P>
<P>
   2 7-ounce cans solid white tuna
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons drained capers
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dry oregano leaves, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 small clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Peel broccoli stems and cut diagonally { inch thick. Divide
florets into 1-inch pieces. Steam the broccoli until crisp but
tender and cool under running water. (If you can't abide hornets or
broccoli, substitute an equal amount of Chinese pea pods.)
</P>
<P>
   Cook the pasta according to package instructions or until it is
tender to the bite. Drain and dump into a tub of cold water.
</P>
<P>
   In a jar combine the olive oil, vinegar, capers, oregano, salt,
garlic and pepper. Shake to combine.
</P>
<P>
   Use paper towels to pat dry the pasta and broccoli. Lay out in a
bowl with the red pepper hunks and olives. Toss with some dressing.
Add the tuna. Add more dressing if needed and toss again, lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Chill until ready to serve and this should suffice as main dish
for four, with French or garlic bread.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, you can have an ice cream bar on the ferry boat
ride home.

TWO CAR BOMBS EXPLODE HOURS AFTER ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DEAL SIGNED 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Less than 24 hours after a new Israeli-Palestinian
agreement was signed, two cars packed with explosives blew up
almost simultaneously in two northern Israeli cities Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Tiberias and Haifa, the cars' occupants, presumed to be the
unsuccessful bombers, were killed and several passers-by were
injured, one seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions were a jolting reminder of the terrorist threats
that had hovered over recent negotiations. And they forced a quick
test of what the newly restored Israeli-Palestinian relationship
could weather, since terrorism has interrupted the peace process
many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a
terse statement saying that Israel would not tolerate ``violence or
terrorism against innocent civilians.'' But he did not make any
indication that he would halt the process he had just revived.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the attempted attacks did not even derail his evening
plans. The prime minister spent most of the night locked in heated
debate over his budget cuts with the Israeli Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police said the explosions bore the hallmarks of Islamic
militant terror attacks. No group immediately took responsibility
for the bombings. The police were also investigating possible
coordination between Israeli Arabs and Palestinian terrorist
groups, television reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions occurred minutes after the Israeli Cabinet
overwhelmingly approved Barak's new deal with the Palestinians. The
deal, signed early Sunday morning in Egypt, modifies a previous
agreement, creating a timeline for Israeli withdrawals from the
West Bank and for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted attacks provided ammunition for critics of Barak's
peace efforts, who called on him either to suspend the new
agreement or to put the Palestinians on alert that another attempt
or attack would freeze the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Ephraim Sneeh, Israel's deputy defense minister, defended
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence the Palestinian Authority has reduced its
battle against terror in the last few days,'' Sneeh said. ``On the
contrary, we have opposite indications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot dance to the tune of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,'' he
continued. ``They want to the peace process to stop. We want it to
continue.''

   JERUSALEM The Israeli Cabinet Sunday gave its approval to the
Sharm El-Sheikh agreement signed with the Palestinians hours
earlier on restarting the Wye River Memorandum peace process. The
process will start within days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why was this agreement signed now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The peace process had been stalled since January, meaning the
Israelis had stopped turning over land to the Palestinians in the
so-called ``land-for-peace'' arrangement outlined in the Oslo
accords of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, had promised to
restart the process when he was elected in May, but he wanted to
renegotiate the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the peace process work?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the 1967 war, Israel captured the Arab areas of the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank. It occupied them until Oslo, despite the
often violent protests of the 2.5 million Palestinians there. The
Oslo process requires Israel to give back some of the land and the
Palestinians to drop their opposition to the existence of a Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the process come the tough ``permanent status''
issues. They determine whether Israel will share Jerusalem with the
Palestinians, allow Palestinian refugees back to their land or let
the Palestinians establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do they keep signing agreements if they signed the Oslo
pact in 1993?
</P>
<P>
   A: Including the original Oslo accords, seven agreements have
been signed and more are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo was just an outline, not a detailed plan. It was always
expected that more agreements would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the process has broken down frequently. Its original
signatory, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated in 1995.
In 1996, Israelis elected Benjamin Netanyahu, who had opposed Oslo,
pact. Despite signing two agreement he effectively shut the process
down by January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is Sunday's agreement different from the Wye agreement
just signed in October?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are very similar. But, the Wye accord was not carried
out. The new agreement includes specific dates for when Israel is
supposed to fulfill its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, Israel has to let the Palestinians begin
construction of a port in Gaza and create a route through Israel
for Palestinians to travel between Palestinian territories items
promised in Wye but not delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has to give back the same amount of land as in the Wye
agreement another 11 percent of the West Bank but gets a longer
time to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement also sets a Sept. 2000 deadline for settling
all disputes between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, what did Barak get out of the deal?
</P>
<P>
   A: He got to renegotiate a deal his country had already signed
and ended up with almost everything he wanted. He got to stretch
out the land transfers until Jan. 20. By that time, at Barak's
insistence, the two sides will be forming the outline for the
``permanent status'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has been concerned that Israel should not be giving away
land until it knows roughly how the final issues will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are most Palestinians so skeptical of the process?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many items now being discussed were supposed to be resolved
long ago. Israel holds the land and the power to shut the process
down when it wants. Just as Palestinians did not want to
renegotiate Wye but did in the face of ultimatums from Barak, they
fear he can give them just take-it-or-leave offers on all the
remaining issues.

 &HT;    PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AWAIT FREEDOM WHILE ISRAELIS ARE DIVIDED
OVER THEIR RELEASE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank The dream of a Palestinian mother, Raba Abu
Radaha, may be a nightmare for many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   One of her sons was convicted of killing a Palestinian who
collaborated with Israel. The other hit a Jewish woman settler in
the head with a bar. Today they sit in an Israeli jail.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new agreement signed over the weekend, the pair
may be able to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Israelis want to make peace, they can only make it with
families and people themselves, not with governments,'' said the
mens' brother Samiya Hassan Abu Radaha. ``To do that, you must
release the prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   A committee of Palestinians and Israelis was gathering names
Sunday night to decide who will be among the 350 prisoners released
under this weekend's revision of the Wye River Memorandum. It was
one of the last items worked out in the weekend's negotiations and
the most emotional issue for Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, only prisoners arrested for crimes before
the 1993 beginning of the Oslo peace process would be released. The
Oslo process is aimed at ending hostilities by giving autonomy to
the Palestinians in land Israel captured in 1967. According to
reports, approximately half of the 2,000 palestinians held for
anti-Israeli crimes would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But even among the pre-Oslo group, not all will go free. Israeli
officials say they will not release any prisoners who killed
Israelis. They also balk at releasing anyone who belongs to groups
still opposed to peace. Thus, fundamentalists of Hamas or Islamic
Jihad would not be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But the sons of Raba Abu Radaha do not fall into any of thes
categories. They were activists in Yasser Arafat's Fateh movement
and were both arrested in the early 1990s, before Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   When she visited them in jail Sunday, she said they were ``happy
and optimistic'' this weekend's peace agreement between
Palestinians and Israeli leaders would allow them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, there is near unanimity that all the political
prisoners should be released.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis know the prisoners as terrorists and their
opinions are divided.
</P>
<P>
   Dov Kalmonovitz said he disagrees with the release of prisoners
who only wounded their Israeli targets. A 44-year-old Israeli
accountant, he was burned over 75 percent of his body when a
Palestinian set his moving car ablaze with a Molotov cocktail in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who threw the Molotov cocktail wanted to kill me.
Just because I survived and am still standing does not mean he
should be released,'' Kalmonovitz said. ``The people who did these
terrible things must stay in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   His attacker was never caught, but he has campaigned against the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Chava Stern, 70, takes a different view. Her 64-year-old
husband, Menachem Stern, was a prominent professor at Hebrew
University when he was stabbed to death in 1989 by three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stand in the way of peace. Menachem will not return
and we cannot change that, but we have to go forward,'' Chava Stern
said. ``We have to do everything we can to make sure that more
families will not join the cycle of sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   (Optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In Palestinian communities, almost every family has a relative
who is or was in Israeli jails. It's considered an honor in the old
struggle against an Israeli occupation to which they lost land,
homes and their political rights. Most prisoners' families receive
small subsidies from the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her two sons now in jail, another son, Hani,
spent four years in prison for throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails
at Israeli troops. He was released in an earlier Oslo-related
amnesty in 1994. He is now in the Palestinian National Authority
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation of struggle,'' said Amin Abu Radaha, 27.
``A fight for freedom.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERWYN, Ill. _ The old soldiers talked about the days, not so
long ago, when they skated across the dance floor at the Veterans
of Foreign Wars Post 2378, swinging as if the songs would never
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would get so packed the walls would bulge,'' said George
Alexander, a World War II veteran, standing near a row of empty bar
stools at the veterans' lodge in this old blue-collar Chicago
suburb. ``Now we go to a lot of funerals.''
</P>
<P>
   As time conquers the heroes of World War II, and the nation
loses more than 1,000 veterans a day, VFW posts around the United
States are struggling to survive. With membership falling, nearly
300 of the nation's 10,000 VFW posts have folded in the last few
years, unable to shoulder property taxes on the halls.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to save these halls, lawmakers in Illinois have
enacted a bill that reduces taxes on property owned by veterans'
groups by 85 percent, and freezes them at that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generation that saved Private Ryan is leaving us,
unfortunately,'' said Dennis Culloton, a spokesman for Gov. George
Ryan of Illinois, who signed the tax-relief measure. ``They were
there for us when it counted. Now it's our turn to be there for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 550,000 veterans died in 1998, the majority of them World
War II soldiers. The number of deaths yearly is projected to grow
to 620,000 in 2008, according to Ken McKinnon, a spokesman for the
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and then start to decline.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million Americans alive today have served in the
military. Of these, 19 million are over 50. The survivors of World
War II are in their mid-70s and older, with most Korean War
veterans at least 70. The average age of the Vietnam War veteran is
51. There are believed to be about 3,500 veterans of World War I,
all of them at least 95, McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 16 million Americans served in World War II, eight times
the number of troops now active in all branches of the military.
Six million of the World War II soldiers are still alive, and about
4 million Korean War veterans are still living.
</P>
<P>
   But the deaths of veterans are coming in such large numbers that
military bases are having a difficult time sending honor guards to
the funerals of all those who served in the military. Unable to
send a bugler to play at every funeral, the Defense Department now
uses a tape-recorded version of taps for the memorial services of
some veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect a lot from life, our generation,'' said
Andrew Stevenson, 70, a veteran of the Korean War who still
remembers the cold winds like a razor blade ripping over the
mountain. ``We wanted to get out of high school, get a car, get a
girl, get a house, have some kids and just sit out on the front
steps and talk. Kids today, they don't look at things that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a lodge for veterans, the VFW hall, a fixture of
the old neighborhood, has long served as a sort of working-class
country club, a place for wedding receptions, anniversary parties,
class reunions.
</P>
<P>
   The Berwyn post, a yellow brick building with a green cannon out
front, was a place where veterans could ``have a home away from
home,'' as Bill Lincoln, a 71-year-old World War II veteran, put
it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the veterans' organizations that are having a
hard time recruiting members. All of the fraternal clubs, like the
Elks and the Moose, have had difficulty attracting new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today just aren't joiners,'' said Tom Kissell, the
membership director for the national VFW. ``The lodge mentality is
no longer there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kissell acknowledged that the membership problems went
deeper and were a legacy of the generation gap between the World
War II and Vietnam veterans, a chasm that never quite closed.
</P>
<P>
   On bingo night at the Berwyn post on a recent Tuesday night, the
World War II and Korean veterans would shake their heads about the
Vietnam generation, who never joined the VFW in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnam guys, they want to be off by themselves,'' said
Lloyd Hyatt, a 70-year-old Korean War veteran, scarcely able to
contain his displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the Vietnam men say they never felt welcome in the
veterans' clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Kissell, the VFW official and himself a Vietnam veteran, said
the young men returning from Southeast Asia were often given short
shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of hard-nosed old-time veterans who
think the only war this country ever fought was World War II,''
Kissell said.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the older veterans in the Berwyn hall talk about the
pot-smoking by men in Vietnam. For their part, some of the Vietnam
men say they rankled the older veterans by speaking frankly about
politics and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel our government was wrong in Vietnam,'' Kissell said,
but he acknowledged that many older veterans consider it wrong to
dissent when a country is at war. ``We sacrificed 58,000 kids who
never got the chance to grow up. And if I saw another Vietnam
developing, I would do everything in my power to keep my sons out
of it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To young veterans like Matthew Claussen, 30, who served as a
Marine in the Persian Gulf war, the Vietnam group seems like the
older generation.
</P>
<P>
   Claussen, who was recently elected commander of the Berwyn post,
said veterans' organizations needed to be more open to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every meeting we'll have an argument, and someone will say,
`We've always done it this way,''' Claussen said. ``And I'll say:
`Well, the old way is not working anymore. Times are changing.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bar once served as a center of gravity at veterans' clubs, a
place where people would meet to drink a beer, or several, and tell
some jokes. But the bar is no longer considered an attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Kissell, who said he joined the veterans' club 25 years ago
``because it had a good softball team and the coldest beer in
town,'' said younger veterans typically preferred a post without a
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a bar is a liability today, not a help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beer was for sale at the Berwyn post, but iced tea and ginger
ale were the big sellers. Meatloaf sandwiches were selling for
$1.75, and apple slices were 80 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the best thing about being here is also the
hardest,'' Alexander said. ``You get to have such good friends. And
then you lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   On this bingo night, members of the women's auxiliary had come
to the hall to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to harass you,'' said Virginia Cerks with a wink, as
she traded a $20 bill for change from Tony Scafa, an 85-year-old
World War II veteran, one of the cashiers for the evening. ``Where
have you been, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   He raised an arm wearily and swatted the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I had a heart attack,'' he said. ``And now they say I've
got these leaky valves.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman took her change, but did not move for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?'' Scafa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said. ``I'm glad that you're here.''

don't lock up children,'' Hutchison thought. Within days Hutchison,

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Employees at American Century Cos. can
receive as much as $10,000 in bonus money for a successful referral
in certain high-tech positions.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in information technology at the Kansas City mutual fund
company also can earn an extra year's salary over a four-year
period for meeting performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers in the Kansas City area this Labor Day are enjoying
life in a tight labor market. Mobility has never been better for
job hoppers, and many are being showered with high salaries and
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonuses aren't just for football players anymore,'' said Don
Feltham, a principal with Burgess and Associates, a Lenexa, Kan.,
human resources consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where you work, most likely your company is
hiring. Although wages have not skyrocketed for everyone in the
trenches, employers have had to come up with creative ways to
retain employees and lure new workers. In some cases, companies
have bent or broken laws to bolster their work force, government
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The area unemployment rate hit a record low for the month of
July, and demand for labor is pervasive here and in many parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that a lot of employers are looking at
what they can do to deal with a tight labor market,'' Feltham said.
``Even if you're only seeing base wages and salaries increase 3 or
4 percent annually, a lot of these employers are having to come up
with variable pay or incentive packages that create additional
income for their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gear for Sports, a Lenexa sports apparel
manufacturer, changed its bonus program in 1996. Hourly employees _
including office, production and customer service workers _ can
receive bonus payments up to six times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it seems to be working,'' said Jim Keaton, Gear's
vice president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   People who work in information technology are highly sought in
many industries, particularly with so many resources being poured
into fixing potential year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   American Century's retention program started in January 1998,
and the first bonus payment was made last summer, said spokeswoman
Julie Bartels Smith. So far, the program has reduced the turnover
rate of information technology employees from 16 percent to 5
percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial incentives aren't the only way businesses are trying
to keep their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys at Station Casino Kansas City revealed that its 2,400
full- and part-time employees wanted a child-care facility. The
casino opened one in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 perk or benefit going back two years was child
care,'' said John Finamore, the casino's president and general
manager. ``The child-care facility was not so much to attract new
team members but to help existing team members.''
</P>
<P>
   Finamore said 305 children from the 225 employee families were
registered at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore sees the facility, which operates 24 hours a day, as an
advantage for the company in the gambling and services industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're also starting to see it's helping as a recruitment
tool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a company gets bigger, camaraderie among employees can lessen
because of the lack of contact among some workers. Barkley
Evergreen &AMP; Partners has taken an unusual approach to combat that
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, workers at the Kansas City advertising
agency were treated to what's called a ``kidnap,'' in which
virtually all employees were hustled onto a bus and taken to an
undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   They were treated to an afternoon at the Incred-A-Bowl in
Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had a ball,'' said Kay Moore, the agency's vice
president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the firm began the practice last year. It also serves
as a way to bring together employees who don't run into one another
in the course of a workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we grow, the biggest complaint we get is people don't get
to know each other,'' said Moore, whose firm now employs about 185
people.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a dark side to the worker shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrants are being paid substandard wages, labor
officials said. Earlier this year, for example, an area nursing
home company agreed to pay a fine to federal regulators after being
accused of hiring Filipino women as nurses' aides and paying them
less than half the wages they were promised.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses also have run into difficulties when hiring
children. In some cases, the problems involve the number of hours
worked, as well as children working beyond a certain time. Another
problem involves adults hiring youths to illegally peddle wares
door to door by using deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Baker, director of the Missouri Division of Labor
Standards, said between 3 million and 4 million children 16 and
younger were working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tight labor market definitely has led to more kids
working,'' she said. ``There's been more abuse of wage-and-hour
laws, and there's more potential for abuse in the youth-peddling
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said her division was investigating youth-peddling
activities that could be illegal in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Labor Standards has issued guidelines for youths
who want to participate in legitimate door-to-door sales, as well
as questions for residents to ask children who are selling in their
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking more information or who want to identify an
illegal youth-peddling operation can call the Division of Labor
Standards at (800) 475-2130.

NOT ALL AMERICANS ARE CASHING IN ON BOOMING ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The economy is chugging along at
unprecedented levels. Productivity is up, unemployment is down, and
real wages have finally begun to rise.
</P>
<P>
   These seem like the best of times for workers. But are all
workers doing better as a result of the economy's staggering
growth?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, job opportunities abound and some people are striking
pay dirt. But it's clear the earnings gains of recent years also
depend on your line of work and the financial condition of your
company.
</P>
<P>
   Employees in the mutual fund industry, for example, most likely
are doing better than most right now. On the other hand, employees
at financially weak Trans World Airlines Inc. received their first
substantial raise last month since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our nation's booming economy and overall prosperity,
over 4 million Americans work full time but remain poor,'' the
Machinists union, which represents TWA workers, said in its Labor
Day message. ``Just having a job doesn't guarantee a worker a piece
of the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   And many who are employed are working longer hours to keep up or
get ahead, said Judy Ancel, director of the Institute for Labor
Studies, a program of Longview Community College in Lee's Summit,
Mo., and the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an excessive use of overtime by employers,'' Ancel
said.
</P>
<P>
   But working longer hours doesn't necessarily mean those workers
are getting wealthy, according to a study released today by the
Economic Policy Institute, a pro-labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that despite a 12 percent growth in productivity
from 1989 to 1998, wages for all middle-income men were 1.8 percent
lower over the same period when adjusted for inflation. Pay for all
middle-income women was 3.4 percent higher than the 1989 level.

ANTI-FEDERALISM MEASURES HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Conn., Tenn., Ind., Utah)  (js) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to shift political power back to the states,
a broad bipartisan coalition in the Senate and House of
Representatives is preparing legislation that would make it harder
for Congress and the executive branch to adopt laws and rules that
pre-empt the states on a wide range of issues, from drugs and the
environment to health and worker safety.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would provide local authorities with broad new
power to go to court to challenge federal laws and regulations that
fail to explicitly mention what state statutes and regulations are
pre-empted. Lawmakers say the House and Senate measures follow the
overall political philosophy embodied in three opinions handed down
by the Supreme Court in June, on the last day of its term. The
decisions imposed sharp new curbs on the ability of Congress to
make federal law binding on the states.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the measure is called the Federalism
Accountability Act. Sponsored by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and
supported by Democrats including Carl Levin of Ohio and Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut (both former local officials), it sailed
through the Governmental Affairs Committee last month, 12-to-2,
with little public notice. In the House, a similar bill, the
Federalism Act, is sponsored by Rep. David M. McIntosh, a
Republican who last week began his campaign to become the next
governor of Indiana. The measure recently passed a House
subcommittee and is expected to be considered by the House
Committee on Governmental Reform and Oversight later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been written at the urging of seven
organizations representing state and local lawmakers, including the
National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State
Legislatures and the National League of Cities.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the groups have maintained that Washington officials,
supported by the courts, have ignored the impact of federal
decisions on the authority of the states. Even when Congress and
the agencies have not explicitly overridden the states, judges have
found many instances in recent years of ``implied pre-emption''
when, as the Supreme Court has said, ``state law stands as an
obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes
and objectives of Congress.'' Among other things, the legislation
would largely abolish the legal doctrine of implied pre-emption.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years or so we saw Congress employing the unfunded
mandate to deal with the states, compelling us to do things without
providing adequate funding,'' said Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah,
the chairman of the National Governors' Association. ``The new tool
of Congress is pre-emption, which prohibits states from doing
things. The problem is that states and local authorities are often
left unable to protect citizens because the national government,
which moves into these wide areas, doesn't have the tools to
enforce its actions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed legislation has prompted opposition from an
unusual coalition of big business, environmental, labor and
consumer advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce has waged a major campaign to kill or
substantially weaken the measures. Although officials at the
chamber reported late last week that they were close to negotiating
important changes in the House legislation, Thomas J. Donohue,
president of the chamber, has been deeply critical of both the
House and Senate measures. He has said they would result in the
elimination of a national standard for many issues that affect
commerce and lead to a balkanization of rules on everything from
auto standards to worker safety, making it far more expensive to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups opposing the measures say they fear that any
weakening of the ability of the federal government to impose
uniform national standards could lead to a substantial weakening of
environmental and consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the framework of attempting to provide flexibility for
state and local governments, this legislation undermines public
health, safety and environmental protections by requiring
burdensome analytical requirements, imposing unrealistic and unfair
requirements to favor states and local governments and creating a
mountain of litigation that would delay or stop federal government
activities,'' said Gary D. Bass, executive director of OMB Watch, a
nonpartisan regulatory watchdog organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bass, who is leading a coalition of 300 environmental, labor,
consumer and other groups against the legislation, said it would
enable a mayor in any town in the nation to use the courts to delay
or block any regulation that failed to fully assess the federalism
consequences of the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, said that critics were wildly distorting the
consequences of the legislation, which he said was not much more
than ``truth in government and truth in legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two most fundamental questions in government are, number
one, what should the government be doing and, number two, at what
level should it be doing it,'' he said. ``This fits with my
longstanding concern I have had that every time there is a news
story, we run to the floor and we want to federalize something.
This legislation says that we will not be willy-nilly pre-empting
state and local governments without explicitly saying that is what
we intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to slow down the legislation's momentum, President
Clinton last month issued an executive order on federalism that
falls far short of the bills, particularly since it does not give
local officials any new authority to go to court to challenge
regulations. Rather, the order requires all agencies to appoint a
federalism assessment officer to review the consequences of major
regulations and to consult with state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have been more critical of the House bill,
which gives judges less flexibility in striking down federal
legislation and regulations and are closer to reaching an accord in
which they said they would be able to support the Senate measure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   In letters sent to Congress in recent weeks, officials from a
number of executive agencies, including the Treasury, the
Department of Education, the Environmental Protection Agency and
the Department of Health and Human Services, complained that the
legislation could have sweepingly devastating effects on the
ability of the federal government to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human Services, wrote
that the proposed legislation in the House would ``hamper the
effectiveness of important health and social service programs for
which we are responsible.'' She said such actions as the Food and
Drug Administration's 1982 requirement of tamper-resistant
packaging following the cyanide-poisonings of Tylenol products, and
the 1998 regulation requiring warning labels on apple juices
following a pathogen scare ``would have been impossible had the FDA
been required to consult with officials of every potentially
affected state and local government before issuing these rules.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month Linda Robertson, an assistant treasury secretary,
wrote to Congress that the proposed legislation would preclude the
Internal Revenue Service from making wage adjustments for tax
withholding rates on employee wages because states and local
governments would be affected as employers subject to withholding
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But local officials have said that decisions made by Washington
have led to many unintended and harsh consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislation tends to be so voluminous that congressional
delegations don't always understand the full impact of what they
are doing until long after the fact,'' said Mayor Alex Fekete of
Pembroke Pines, Fla., a Democrat. ``No assessment is every really
done on the cost to municipalities.''

   NEW YORK _ Puck is gliding on roller skates through a rather
misty haze that fills the dance floor, making mischief, as Puck
does, with the passions of Tytania, Sander and Dimitri. This isn't
fairyland, but rather theater, and it's done to the pounding beat
of such '70s dance hits as ``Disco Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The Donkey Show,'' an hourlong adaptation of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream,'' which opened on Aug. 18 for a six-week
run at a real club, El Flamingo in Chelsea, where the audience can
stand around the ``stage'' and even dance on it to the disco hits
of 20 years ago before the play even begins.
</P>
<P>
   It is through the music, rather than any traditional form of
theater, that Shakespeare's comedy about the vagaries of love is
told. Is this new production merely a cabaret curiosity or the
beginnings of a more or less new sort of theater emerging from
below Houston Street? Peter Marks, in his review in The New York
Times, called the show ``a lark, an exuberant and witty splicing of
disparate sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Paulus and her husband, Randy Weiner, who started the
Project 400 Theater Group and who are creators and directors of the
show, say their theatrical contrivance is literate fun. They say
they believe the show is an indication of things to come in the
theater, at least downtown.
</P>
<P>
   There are other downtown theater groups and individuals _ The
Faux Real Theater Company, Expanded Arts, Dead Mecca and the
Present Company, for instance _ trying to find new ways to make
theater relevant to younger audiences. To Ms. Paulus and Weiner,
theater has become the flying wedge of a downtown sensibility
expressed most consistently in the previous decade through music
and especially the visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   John Clancy, artistic director of the Present Company and a
founder of the Fringe Festival, a showcase for the last three
summers of experimental theater, said that Project 400 was among
the smartest groups working downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never just throw something on stage because it looks
cool,'' he said. ``They are always asking: `What does it mean? How
does it add to the story?' That is how they can take something that
seems like it will be campy _ Shakespeare retold through disco
songs _ and make it work. Because these songs really do tell the
story, they are not just grafted to the plot line. Project 400
shows a commitment to populist theater that isn't diluted or
watered down.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Donkey Show'' had run on Thursdays from January to June at
the Pyramid Club in the East Village and weekends last summer and
fall at the Piano Store on the Lower East Side. Project 400 seeks
to be part of the long tradition of twisting the confines of
theater that probably started even before women began portraying
women on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Generally every theatrical innovator has his own agenda. In the
'60s Julian Beck, a founder of the Living Theater with his wife,
Judith Malina, ``would walk up to you and practically assault
you,'' said Bill Talon, an actor, director and writer who performs
a great deal downtown. ``His attitude was, `I'm right, and this is
what I'm going to teach you,' '' he continued. ``Today I don't
think there is generally the luxury or even the desire to be
didactic. To be a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But David Finkelstein, a 38-year-old writer and director, says
that even in experimental theater the downtown focus is on money
and on fame, and that this may be a fatal flaw. While emphasizing
that he has not seen the work of Project 400, he said he was
familiar with the Lower East Side theater scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of listening to people talking, there was a
tremendous amount of creativity going into the question of survival
and how to make theater in this climate when no funding is
available,'' said Finkelstein, artistic director of Lake Ivan
Performance Group, which specializes in improvisational theater.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, Finkelstein said, he found downtown theater people
dedicated to ``marketing to create a sense that there is an
exciting scene going on the Lower East Side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't hear a lot of conversations in which people
talked with excitement about performance technique or directorial
technique or playwriting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paulus denies sacrificing content for marketing hype. She
and Weiner have their own sense of their antecedents and what
Project 400 is trying to add to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Believing in Antonin Artaud's concept that all theater should be
ritual, transformative rather than merely entertaining, Weiner
said: ``We are asking the audience to go on a journey that is
experiential, literally. We are asking them to partake in a very
active way, in being shoulder to shoulder in the action.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was taking ritual theater and placing it in a modern
pop context, the rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ritual has to mean something in your life,'' Weiner said.
``We are incorporating things that are not necessarily part of the
solipsistic theater world but are part of culture.''
</P>
<P>
   They are much affected by hip-hop because ``it is tapping into
what is cutting edge in the culture today,'' Ms. Paulus said.
``Hip-hop's pounding beat makes it visceral, and it is about
putting things in a different context,'' she said about sampling,
the practice of taking a snippet of a song and combining it with
other snippets to create something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reach people who don't go to the theater, because
they are the ones who want to be enthralled, challenged,'' she
said. ``I feel music is what people care about in a loyal,
passionate way, and I want that audience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Paulus has directed the off-off-Broadway play ``Running
Man.'' She and Weiner's first production was a rock musical
adaptation of ``The Tempest.'' Both are Harvard graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Project 400 was founded in 1993 in New York, but the idea for it
came a year or so earlier in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with the hottest local band in the county and asked
them to work on the score of what we were doing, and that was how
we learned to create populist theater,'' Ms. Paulus said. ``People
were coming because of the band.''
</P>
<P>
   She said they began doing ``bar sets'': a group of six to seven
songs from the show in local taverns to lure the audience to the
local theater.
</P>
<P>
   Since then they have staged productions in New York and
Cambridge, Mass. Among them: a production of ``Phaedra'' using
instrumental tracks released by Stax-Volt, the popular '60s-era
rhythm-and-blues record company, and an adaptation of
``Frankenstein,'' using melodies from the piano music of Bartok,
Beethoven and Dvorak, coupled with lyrics by Weiner. Their next
project will be a hip-hop ``Lohengrin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see all art forms as being intimately connected,'' said
Weiner.

ANALYSTS EXPECT PRODUCER PRICE INDEX TO RISE A MODERATE 0.3
PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   If the expert consensus is valid, the latest report on inflation
is likely to be greeted as good news on Wall Street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated economic report of this holiday-abbreviated
week will be Friday's release of the {Producer Price Index} numbers
for August, which are expected to show wholesale inflation is tame.
The weekly survey of leading economists by Thomson Global Markets
shows most expecting a rise of 0.3 percent. Though that would be an
increase from July's 0.2 percent gain, it still would be viewed by
economists as benign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a reading in the forecast neighborhood would be seen
by investors as a sign that should help convince Federal Reserve
policy-makers that interest rates need not be raised further to
keep inflation at bay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy
components of the index, is expected to be up 0.1 percent after
remaining unchanged in July. &QL; 
Today &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although summer's end is still officially a couple of weeks
away, the traditional windup to the summer season comes today with
observance of the {Labor Day holiday.} As a result, most markets,
financial institutions, and business and government offices will be
closed. &QL; 
Wednesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A substantial surge in {consumer installment credit outstanding}
is expected to be reported for July. The consensus call from expert
observers expects an expansion of more than $6 billion, which would
more than double June's rise. An increase of this magnitude would
be seen as good news because it would reflect the sort of continued
consumer confidence the economy depends on for growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - The rate of accumulation of {wholesale inventories} is
expected to have continued at its recent moderate pace during July.
Most analysts are forecasting an expansion of 0.3 percent, which
would match June's gain. This trend is good news because it means
there's no danger of an inventory overhang developing. Excessive
inventories cause manufacturers to cut back on production, and thus
often result in worker layoffs. &QL; 
Thursday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures on {export and import prices} are scheduled
for release, which probably will provide an early indication of
what the next monthly trade deficit will be. If the forecasts are
near target, they portend continued large trade deficits.
Economists at Merrill Lynch predict that import prices rose 0.6
percent in August, after a 0.9 percent jump in July, while export
prices remained flat after dipping 0.2 percent the previous month. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   All-America Billy Bean burst into his 20s consumed by two
driving dreams: to play center field in the major leagues and to
deny his homosexuality. Eventually he would have to choose between
his personal and professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nine years,'' Bean said recently, ``I felt as though I had
one foot in the major leagues and one on a banana peel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean's story of isolation and subterfuge may be familiar to
millions of gay men and lesbians, and his passion to play big
league ball, which he did for parts of six seasons with the Detroit
Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, is shared by
thousands of high school and college baseball stars. But the
combination of those two struggles offers a rare window into the
fiercely competitive and hyper-masculinized arena of major team
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Because he did not want to ``embarrass what I hold sacred _ my
family and baseball,'' it took the unexpected deaths, over an
eight-year period, of his father, his first partner and a college
teammate for him to address his sexuality, leave the game and
accelerate the process of coming out. He is the first major league
baseball player to so publicly discuss his homosexuality and the
first athlete in a major American team sport to do so since the
football player Dave Kopay, who came out in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Burke, the former Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder,
acknowledged his homosexuality in 1994, the year before he died of
AIDS. In recent years, a number of celebrated athletes in
individual sports, including Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova
and Greg Louganis, have come out. But the homophobic environment of
most male team sports, particularly professional football and
baseball, have deterred many gay athletes from pursuing their
talents, and driven those who persisted deep into the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Kopay, a running back who was out to some members of his team,
the Washington Redskins, was protected from at least one gay basher
by a powerful locker-room leader who would allow no bullying of any
player so long as he was producing for the team. Kopay came out
publicly after his nine-year career was over and went on to success
as a businessman. Burke, who played for the Dodgers and the Oakland
A's, was dogged by rumors of his homosexuality, which drove him out
of the game after four years and into a spiral of drugs and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   At least one well-known sports counselor, Dr. Bruce Ogilivie,
has advised major league athletes to stay closeted during their
playing careers. Although one former manager of Bean's thinks that
his sunny personality would have protected him on the club, a
former teammate thinks the reaction would have been ``brutal.''
Bean believes he would have been ostracized if he came out while
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dated another major leaguer and I have no idea whether
or not there are other gay ballplayers,'' Bean said. ``One would
think so, but if they were as deeply closeted as I was, who would
know?
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Hooters, laughed at the jokes, lied about dates
because I loved baseball. I still do. I'd go back in a minute. I
only wish I hadn't felt so alone, that I could have told someone,
and that I hadn't always felt God was going to strike me dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean, 35, is now a restaurant owner in the trendy South Beach
section of Miami Beach. While he lives openly with his business
partner and confides in his family, he had withdrawn until recently
from his college and professional baseball friends. He did not want
to continue lying to them about his life or to risk their
rejection. Then in late June, Tim Layana, a former Cincinnati Reds
pitcher and Bean's college teammate at Loyola Marymount, was killed
in a car accident. No one from their circle of old buddies had
Bean's telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the funeral of my college roommate, one of my best
friends,'' Bean said. ``Tim would have understood if I had told
him. I began to think, I'm not living some horrible existence, I'm
proud of my life. Where do I finally draw the line and just say,
`Accept me or don't'?''
</P>
<P>
   Intense, upbeat, quick to laugh, Bean was sitting in the living
room of the elegantly furnished, art-filled terra-cotta palazzo on
Biscayne Bay that he shares with Efrain Veiga and their three dogs,
a Jack Russell terrier, a whippet and a weimaraner. Their second
restaurant, Mayya, is scheduled to open early next month. Unusual
in the home of a former athlete, there is little memorabilia
besides the jerseys of his three major league teams _ the Tigers,
the Dodgers and the Padres. In a painting commissioned by Veiga
that hangs over the mantel in the dining room, two baseball-card
Billy Beans are swinging from the heels, but a strand of barbed
wire beneath home plate signifies that they are not truly free.
</P>
<P>
   Bean cannot remember when he has felt as free as he says he is
beginning to feel now. High school quarterback, point guard and
valedictorian, college baseball all-American, handsome, thoughtful
and a celebrated ``babe magnet,'' Billy Bean was the golden child
of a tough cop's blended family. Yet he was nagged by the feeling
that something was missing, that there was an emotional hole at the
center of his life. His mother would later describe it as ``a
sadness in him I couldn't reach.'' Bean long suspected that he was
homosexual despite being heterosexually active since high school.
He was married for three years. He had his first homosexual
experience at 28.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the pattern of his baseball career was set. In
nine years of bouncing among major, minor, winter and Japanese
league rosters, Bean logged less than four years of major league
pension time. Six-feet tall and 200 pounds, Bean was not considered
fast enough to be an everyday center fielder. Left-handed, he was a
sound defensive player in the outfield and at first base but he did
not have enough power to start i at those positions. His career big
league batting average was .226 in 272 games. He hit only five home
runs. He rarely played three major league games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as one of those ``scrappy scrubs who will
do anything to stick in the show'' _ running extra wind sprints,
cheerleading from the bench, even giving teammates free clubhouse
haircuts ('60s-style astronaut cuts called ``Beanies'') to boost
camaraderie and morale.
</P>
<P>
   His debut, however, on April 24, 1987, in Detroit, was a Hall of
Fame day. Bean relishes replaying the game from a video in his
head. Not quite 23, he had been rushed up from Toledo so abruptly
he did not have time to take batting practice before leading off
for the Tigers against the Kansas City Royals. He lashed his second
big league pitch against the right-field fence for a double. He hit
line-drive singles his next two at-bats and basked in a standing
ovation before his fourth appearance. He struck out looking at
pitches he says were balls. (His opinion of umpires, as bullies to
end-of-the-bench players and toadies to stars, is standard.) On his
fifth and last at-bat, he hit another double and ended his first
big league day with two runs batted in, three runs scored and an
.800 batting average. He lowered it to .667 the next day, getting
two hits off the great Bret Sabrehagen in four appearances.

 UNDATED: four appearances. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most major leaguers, he had been a star since boyhood. He
was born in Santa Ana, in California's conservative Orange County,
to 18-year-old Linda Robertson. Her high school classmate, Bill
Bean, married her after she became pregnant, but left when Billy
was about six months old; his Mormon family disapproved of the
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always little Billy Bean, small but bighearted, a gamer,
play hurt, stick it out,'' he said. ``My mom worked two jobs and I
started a new elementary school every year. Because it was mostly
the two of us, I always felt grown-up, responsible. I was precise
and methodical like her. And very emotional. I wanted to please
people, make them proud of me. When she married for the third time,
I was 9 and gave her away in a tux.''
</P>
<P>
   That marriage, to Ed Kovac, a police officer, has lasted more
than 25 years. Billy became the oldest of six and the most
accomplished in school and in sports. He was quickly a star of the
Northeast Santa Ana Little League. Nevertheless, his stepfather
made Billy do chores with everyone else and shoot free throws with
him to see who washed the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have to learn responsibility, dedication, concentration,
and it should be fun,'' said Kovac, a former Marine who retired as
a homicide investigator. ``Billy was always responsible and a
leader. He did his chores and practiced those free throws. It
wasn't long before I was doing the dishes.'' At 13, Billy won the
state free-throw shooting championship and a family trip to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Billy led Santa Ana High School to a state baseball championship
and won a full athletic scholarship to Loyola Marymount, a Jesuit
college in Los Angeles. The Yankees drafted him in his junior year
and offered a $55,000 bonus, which was raised after Bean did well
in a summer league. But Kovac reminded Billy that he had promised
his college coach, Dave Snow, that he would return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A handshake is binding in our house,'' Kovac said. ``And
that's Billy. Always been a credit to the family, the game, and
it's not for me to say, of course, but probably to the gay
community as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year, Bean, Layana and Jim Bruske, an outfielder
who later pitched for the Yankees, led Loyola Marymount into the
early rounds of the College World Series. Bean signed for $12,500
as Detroit's third draft pick, in the fourth round. He did well
enough that summer in the minors, and during spring training in
1987, for Detroit manager Sparky Anderson to bring him up to the
big club in April for his auspicious debut. Bean started his first
10 games for the Tigers and was hitting .268 in July when he was
sent back down for further seasoning at bat. By then, the Tigers
had played in Anaheim, and Bean's old Little League canceled its
games and showed up in a block waving signs that read Beantown.
</P>
<P>
   Dark fears surfaced, too. Bean remembers standing at the batting
cage with tough veterans like Kirk Gibson, Alan Trammell, Lou
Whitaker and Darrell Evans, wondering, ``Is Little Billy Bean
strong and tough enough to compete with these real men? Male
enough?'' He knew that Anderson liked him, Bean said, but felt that
if the manager knew the truth he would slam the door.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who is now the coach at Long Beach State, says he never
thought Bean was gay, but does remember Anderson telling him at the
time that ``this guy is not overly gifted but he is ready to come
in and play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow agreed with that assessment: ``Billy maximized his
potential. If you broke down his game, every tool was average at
best, not much speed, size or power, but he was just so good
all-around. He could play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That winter, playing in Venezuela at the Tigers' strong
recommendation, he was runner-up to Cecil Fielder for the batting
title. In the exotic locale, he said, he felt disturbing sexual
stirrings that he sublimated with longer and harder workouts. By
this time, he was dating ``the beautiful wild bird'' he had first
spotted at Loyola as she whizzed past on a skateboard. Three
hundred guests came to their wedding at the campus chapel.
</P>
<P>
   His baseball life yo-yoed on. He was called back up to the
Tigers in August 1988, after leading his minor league club in
hitting, but he never played enough to develop a batting rhythm. He
got to the plate 11 times in 10 games and hit .182. In nine games
for the Tigers the following year, he was hitless. He was sent down
to the minors, then traded to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger experience overwhelmed him. With most of his friends
and family in southern California, he was barraged with requests
for tickets, inside baseball gossip, a few minutes of his time. His
parents remember him trying to please everyone. He was thrilled
when the Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully acknowledged his existence
by dubbing him ``Guillermo Frijoles'' on air, then crushed by the
avalanche of phone messages he felt he had to answer.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The chilly Dodger culture was particularly tough on a backup
player with a secret fear. Manager Tommy Lasorda was not the warm
father figure of his publicity. Bean was told that young players
had to knock on the manager's door, and then only when it was open.
Bean regarded the nameplates over each locker as symbolic _ they
were erasable chalkboards. He batted .197 in 51 games, and the
Dodgers sent him back down.
</P>
<P>
   When Bean's biological father died of a heart attack in 1991, at
44, Bean says he felt a sense of mortality that motivated him to
deal with his sexual feelings. Within a year, he had left his wife
and had his first homosexual experience. He says he still regrets
not having told her the truth at the time, although she has since
learned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was just drawing me to that other side,'' he said.
``I've had good sex with women and good relationships, but
something was missing, even with my wife. I wasn't fulfilled, I had
a fear of not being understood, not being totally accepted. I was
looking for a soul mate, someone I could let my guard down with. I
only found that with men.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year playing for the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Osaka, Japan,
in 1992, his baseball life came alive again in 1993, on a San Diego
team that was selling off its stars and giving subs a chance.
``Until I got to the Padres, I always felt as though I was renting
the uniform,'' he said. ``Then suddenly I felt I had a place. I
lockered next to Tony Gwynn. One of my biggest thrills was hitting
a home run in the game in which he got his 2,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great, I'd get to the yard early, sit in my locker
feeling the adrenaline kick in, and then walk out into that
beautiful setting, feeling this is the day I'll get some knocks,
maybe hit a bomb. There was a great manager there, Jim Riggleman,
who gave me a lot of encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman, now the manager of the Chicago Cubs, remembers Bean
fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Class act, everybody loved Billy on the club,'' Riggleman
said. ``It surprised me that he's gay, but it doesn't diminish my
feelings. He was one of the most pleasurable guys to manage. He was
such a good guy that I think it would have been all right on the
club. The news crews, that might have made it tough.''

 UNDATED: it tough.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bean's best year was 1993. He appeared in 88 games, batted .260,
tied the Padres record of five pinch-hits in a row and broke up a
no-hitter with two outs in the ninth. And he got to shake hands
with his boyhood hero, Steve Garvey, now a teammate, and tell him
he had been too shy to introduce himself when both were Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also midnight walks on road trips to get away
from his tomcatting teammates, to work off the stress of being a
spy in his own life. There were anonymous sexual encounters after
which Bean, who was raised Roman Catholic, would come back hoping
God would forgive him. There was a great deal of guilt and
self-hate, he said, until he began living with Sam, an Iranian he
met at a health club. But he kept the relationship a secret, even
refusing to let his brothers stay at his Del Mar house. Sam hid in
the car when teammates dropped by.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, even though he batted only .215 in 84 games, he felt he
was contributing to the team before the season was cut short by a
players strike. Then, for the second time, sudden death became a
catalyst. On April 23, 1995, Bean returned from an exhibition night
game to find Sam feverish and semiconscious. He died of cardiac
arrest in the emergency room the next morning, eight years to the
day after Bean's major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Bean remembers calling his mother, crying, ``Not fair, not
fair,'' and her urging him to take a shower and go to the ballpark.
She had no idea that Sam was more than just a pal. He felt
confused. How could he explain to the club he needed a day off to
grieve? Riggleman was no longer the manager. Bean got a hit that
day. After the game, he was called in for an announcement he knew
too well: He was being sent back down to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore to myself I would never again let baseball take
precedence over my life,'' Bean said. ``If I ever fell in love
again, that relationship would come ahead of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that season, in Florida to play the Marlins, he met Veiga,
owner of the popular restaurant Yuca in Miami Beach. In town again
four months later, he called Veiga. An urbane, 47-year-old
Cuban-born graduate of Georgetown University who had never seen a
major league game, Veiga told him: ``There is only one flight, life
is one way. Lighten up. Be yourself.'' At Thanksgiving, Bean went
home and told his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he was trying to get the words out, I said it: `You're
gay,''' Mrs. Kovac said. ``We left the house and drank coffee in
the car and we both cried. I wondered what it would mean to him.''
</P>
<P>
   With dread, Bean went back inside to wake up his stepfather, the
tough old homicide cop. Kovac opened his eyes, listened, nodded,
hugged and kissed his son and said, ``OK, now it's official. Can I
go back to sleep?''
</P>
<P>
   Kovac says he had suspected for a long time, and had no problem.
One of his longtime law enforcement partners had been gay.
</P>
<P>
   Bean did not return to baseball in 1996. He assumes he would
have been assigned to a minor league team. He knew he could no
longer live so furtively. To come out while still playing, he
thought, would mean lurid headlines and talk shows, and then
baseball would find a way ``to kick me out.'' He moved to Miami
Beach and worked in radio and television as his relationship with
Veiga became professional as well as personal. Precise and
methodical, a leader, he began taking over more and more
operational duties at Yuca as he learned the business. He was sent
to intern at Charlie Trotter's restaurant in Chicago. Yuca was sold
and he became a partner in the new restaurant, Mayya.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third sudden death, Layana's on June 26, that pushed
Bean out to a more public platform. In late July, Bean allowed a
persistent writer for The Miami Herald, Lydia Martin, who is gay,
to profile him in her Sunday column and quote him on his major
league experiences.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He called his old college teammate, Jim Bruske.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of suspected,'' said Bruske, home in Phoenix recovering
from elbow surgery. ``I wouldn't say anything till he did, no one
knew for sure, but he kept shying away from us. I'd come to Miami
to play the Marlins and he always had some reason we couldn't get
together and he'd be short and change the subject when it got
personal. That wasn't like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right to keep it a secret. The guys would have been
brutal. Billy could have been a great player, but he tried too hard
to make everyone happy, he wanted everyone to like him and he put
too much pressure on himself. I'm glad it's out. I told him it
would have no impact on our friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   But Bean's mother is fearful. ``I feel he's happy now, he's
resolved it,'' she said. ``Maybe I'm being too protective, but I
wonder if he can be hurt. And I know he'd like to be in baseball,
and we would like him to be, too. Billy in baseball always gave the
family such joy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Emboldened by the generally positive, though muted, response to
the article in The Herald, Bean agreed to extend the platform. He
seems both elated and anxious. He likes to think there is a young
gay athlete who will feel less alone. He is afraid it will damage
his chance to someday be a baseball executive, perhaps a general
manager. (Bean is sometimes confused with the general manager of
the Oakland A's, Billy Beane, especially since their playing
careers coincided. Beane is two years older.)
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Bean wishes he could have brought himself to tell
his family sooner so he would have had their support earlier. He
wishes that his partner, Veiga, could have seen him play. He enjoys
talking baseball and has kept himself in shape, working out,
playing tennis and basketball. Some corner of his mind seems to be
expecting an emergency call for a backup outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   One of his greatest pleasures is running his daily six miles in
the midday heat of Miami Beach while listening to baseball on a
headset. As he sweats, he imagines he is in the game. The fantasy
includes a dialogue more permanent than any erasable chalkboard
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Billy Bean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy on second base. He just hit a double.''

   ``A STAR CALLED HENRY'' &QL; 
By Roddy Doyle (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll forgive us if we cut to the chase: This is one of the
best novels we've read all year, and better than Doyle's previous
books, although they were fine indeed. It's broader, richer than
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' and less introspective than the somber
``The Woman Who Walked into Doors.'' Doyle's narrator is Henry
Smart, who tells us the story of the first 20 years of his life. He
begins just before the turn of the century with the meeting of his
parents, a teenage maker of rosary beads and a one-legged bouncer
who turns lowlifes away from a Dublin brothel. They are doomed, and
we know it _ babies arrive sick and die, poverty closes in, and we
see their love fade into the dirt and disease of the Dublin slums.
But before it does, Henry Smart is born, handsome, inexplicably
healthy and full of a promise that is too bright for such a dark
place. By the time he is 5, he is living on the streets, smart but
illiterate, and aware of his own gritty charm. When he is 14, he
takes part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and later becomes a
terrorist for the Irish Republican Army. Through it all, Henry's
savvy, rock-confident voice gathers us in. We know he is telling us
a true story, and yet at the same time spinning a tale _ he
survived childhood, after all, by dazzling and conning the adults
around him. In the end, ``A Star Called Henry'' is not just a novel
about one man but about Ireland itself, from a gifted writer who
knows that misery and laughter are not strangers to one another,
and that even the most rancorous place is not a hell if dreams are
still alive there. This is the first volume of a trilogy that will
take readers through modern Irish history by way of the life of
Henry Smart _ and won't we be glad to see him again. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOOTBALL'S GREATEST PLAYERS'' &QL; 
(Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers
how much it hurts,' '' John Mackey said. ``He lived by that
philosophy and I always followed that advice.'' Mackey was talking
about Jim Brown, the Cleveland Browns' offensive powerhouse from
1957 to 1965 and the man this book calls ``the greatest pure runner
in the history of the NFL.'' Brown is top dog on the list of the
100 best football players of all time, compiled by editors of the
``Sporting News.'' Unlike its counterpart, last year's ``Baseball's
100 Greatest Players,'' this volume doesn't dabble much in the
early days, although the list has Jim Thorpe (at No. 88), Bronko
Nagurski (35), Don Hutson (6) and Otto Graham (7). Among the top 10
are Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Johnny Unitas, Lawrence Taylor and
Dick Butkus. There are photos and a brief overview of each player's
career, and it's all football _ there's only a mention of the
acting career for which Brown left the game at 29, and no notice at
all of O.J. Simpson's retirement activities. Best of all are ``Top
10'' lists (they range from ``Best Players I've Ever Seen'' to
``Defensive Linemen I Admire'' and ``Smartest Quarterbacks'')
solicited from some of the great players themselves, including
Merlin Olsen, Deacon Jones, Charley Taylor, Lance Alworth, Jack Ham
and Troy Aikman. Clear some time before you pick this one up,
because you won't put it down any time soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RIGHT SET'' &QL; 
Edited by Caryl Phillips (Vintage, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We began to enjoy this anthology of writings on tennis round
about Page 45, when James Thurber suddenly appeared and described,
delightfully, the 1926 match between France's Suzanne Lenglen and
American Helen Wills, which caught the world's attention at the
time (Thurber's piece is followed by an essay from Wills herself,
which is also great fun). Earlier essays on the history of the game
have interesting titles (``Lawn Tennis: The Sturdy Bastard'') but
are for tennis zealots. For a more general audience, Phillips
includes excerpts from books by John McPhee, Arthur Ashe, Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Althea Gibson, and writings on
Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker and Andre Agassi. There's
a section on tennis etiquette, with a preponderance of attention
paid to the nasty demeanor of the young John McEnroe, although
there's a short essay by Martin Amis in which those other bad boys,
Connors and Ilie Nastase, are mentioned. It ends with a few pages
from Alistair Cooke, titled ``My Life with Gabriela Sabatini,''
which are blissfully free of bad manners _ just what tennis should
be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WORDS FAIL ME: WHAT EVERYONE WHO WRITES SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
WRITING''By Patricia T. O'Conner (Harcourt Brace, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The best writer may not follow every rule every time,''
O'Conner says, ``but they follow most of them most of the time. And
even if you're a Tolstoy or a Balzac, a Thurber or a McPhee, it
doesn't hurt to learn the rules before you break them.'' O'Conner
was an editor at the ``New York Times Book Review'' before she
wrote her first book, the very popular ``Woe Is I: The
Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English.'' Now,
she's a self-described ``grammar maven'' (she's kidding) who
sometimes writes the ``Times' ''``On Language'' column when William
Safire is on vacation. She's obviously following her own advice _
know your audience _ because her approach to words and writing is
as engaging as it is authoritative, and she quotes lots of her
(and, presumably, your) favorite writers. Her justification for
writing this book, oddly enough, is the Internet _ we're all
writing more now that we have laptops and send e-mail, so we need
to brush up our skills. But truly, no hook was necessary. O'Conner
can be our grammar maven any day. &QL;

VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN EAST TIMOR AND MANY ARE KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As the outside world looked on in horror
and the Indonesian government promised East Timor protection but
evaded fulfilling those pledges, armed thugs systematically took
over the island territory on Sunday, killing and terrorizing
residents and trapping U.N. workers in their compound.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, there were many reports of large numbers of
killings, with an overall death toll reaching perhaps into the
hundreds. In New York the U.N. Security Council held an emergency
evening session to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, the territory's capital, armed men were said to have
fired into crowds of refugees at the port and at a school beside
the U.N. compound and to have set fire to a building adjacent to
the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese, where refugees had
taken shelter. The gunmen were reported to be massacring residents
in the pro-independence neighborhood of Becora.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of killings and terror in other towns,
including an unconfirmed report that 100 people had been killed in
the town of Same and 20 in the town of Atsabe.
</P>
<P>
   The reports could not be confirmed, because foreigners have been
evacuated from most rural areas and roads are blocked by militia
gangs. But Ana Gomes, Portugal's envoy to Jakarta, told a
Portuguese radio station that ``over 100 dead would be a
conservative estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Several top Indonesian officials, including the armed forces
chief and the foreign minister, flew to Dili for a brief visit and
promised to restore order. But they did not venture beyond the tiny
airport as the irregular militias _ created and armed by the
military _ fired their weapons and burned houses in the streets
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials estimated that in Dili some 25,000 people had
taken shelter where they could, and witnesses reported thousands
huddled in police headquarters, the U.N. compound and the few other
sanctuaries available. Terrified parents tried to pass their
children over coils of razor wire outside the besieged U.N.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Security worsened, rather than improved, after the visit of the
Indonesian dignitaries, said Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of
Portugal. His country abandoned East Timor as a colony in 1975,
opening the way for Indonesia to invade and declare the island
territory its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for Indonesia itself and the international
community to understand that Indonesia is no longer able to keep
law and order,'' Guterres told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   In a referendum last Monday, 78.5 percent of the East Timorese
who voted favored breaking free as a separate nation. But that
vote, administered by the United Nations, does not take effect
until it is ratified by the Indonesian Parliament later this year,
leaving the territory of 800,000 people in a dangerous limbo after
decades of virtual civil war between pro-independence forces and
the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem this weekend spurred increasing calls for the United
Nations or individual countries _ like nearby Australia, which has
volunteered its armed forces _ to send in peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Minister Ali Alatas asserted Indonesia's
responsibility for East Timor and said no foreign forces would be
allowed into the territory. Other officials insisted that they
would maintain order on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, said, ``I call on those
people causing the deteriorating situation to stop their actions.''
But as of Sunday evening, residents reached by telephone said the
shooting and burning continued.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's apparent yearlong policy of issuing statements but
taking little action to curb militia violence drew expressions of
exasperation from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about the continuing violence,'' President
Clinton said, ``and the people who lost the election should
recognize that they lost it fair and square and should now find a
way to go forward peacefully. The Indonesians should do all they
can to keep the peace and prevent the bloodshed. They have the
capacity, I think, that would enable them to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gomes, the Portuguese diplomat, placed the responsibility
for the violence directly on the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an uncontrolled chaos,'' she said. ``It is a
provoked, planned and orchestrated chaos by military forces. They
want to scare the international community _ the observers and the
journalists _ to get them out and massacre the East Timorese.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents said Sunday evening that part of the Mahkota Hotel,
where most journalists stayed until they were evacuated Sunday, had
been burned. They said the territory's main human rights
organization, Yayasan Hak, had been attacked with stones and
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Given the serious damage that is being done to Indonesia's
international standing, with the eyes of the United Nations and the
foreign press focused on East Timor, a number of Indonesian and
foreign analysts said they found the government's motives difficult
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything more damning to the image of
Indonesia than this sort of thing,'' said James Fox, director of
Pacific and Asian studies at the Australian National University,
who was in East Timor for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't take much to provide law and order,'' he said.
``There is obviously an unwillingness to do it. Either they don't
realize the cost that this will entail or they have decided they'll
pay that cost.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military has a long and intense attachment to
East Timor, where thousands of its men have died and others have
made their careers. The military recruited and armed the militia
groups early this year after President B.J. Habibie suddenly
announced that he would let East Timor go free if it voted down his
offer of more autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   With some members of the military viewing the possibility of
independence as a defeat, their aim in creating the militias
appeared to be to influence or derail the vote through a campaign
of intimidation and terror.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also say that the military, which traditionally
has helped keep together the diverse 13,000 islands that make up
Indonesia, fears that if East Timor gains independence, other parts
of the nation will seek to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the two days since the result of the vote was announced early
Saturday, the militias have run wild. ``To what end?'' Fox said.
``This is so counterproductive and self-defeating. It has to be
stubbornness and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos drove some 5,000 East Timorese to flee Sunday aboard
inter-island ferries, according to reports from Dili, although
militia thugs reportedly prevented some people from departing.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,000 people took shelter at the compound of the
territory's Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop Carlos Belo, who in 1996
shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the pro-independence activist
Jose Ramos Horta.
</P>
<P>
   The police said as many as 15,000 people were crowded into the
grounds of the main police headquarters. More than 1,000 broke
their way into the U.N. compound, where most of the remaining U.N.
workers and a handful of journalists also took shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more journalists, aid workers and U.N. officials who
had completed their electoral work fled Sunday aboard chartered
aircraft. As their planes took off, they could see flames and smoke
rising from fires burning within and around the outskirts of the
tiny seaside capital.
</P>
<P>
   But David Wimhurst, the chief spokesman for the United Nations
in East Timor, said no U.N. staff were leaving before their time
was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to stay put,'' he said by telephone from within the
besieged compound. ``All this violence is clearly an attempt to
intimidate us out of here, and we have resisted this
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The United Nations is obviously doing everything it
can to put pressure on the Indonesian government to maintain law
and order, but it is increasingly apparent that these appeals are
falling on deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those calling for quick intervention by the United Nations
was Ramos Horta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing an imminent, extraordinary humanitarian
catastrophe right under the eyes of the Security Council, and they
are not acting promptly to stop the killings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whole villages have fled for safety into the barren hills, and
Ramos Horta said that in the coming days ``thousands will be
starving and dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Belo echoed his call for help. ``This is the time that we badly
need some peacekeeping troops in this region to protect ordinary
people who have no weapons, such as children, women and the
elderly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials said they had prepared an intervention
force, but Prime Minister John Howard said Sunday, ``You can't go
into the territory of another country without that country's
approval, and East Timor remains a part of Indonesia until a formal
act of separation takes place.''

   LA-LABOR-TOWN (Los Angeles) _ Los Angeles has never been known
as a labor city like New York, Chicago or San Francisco. In fact,
its history is marked with anti-labor sentiment. Yet, as the nation
commemorates Labor Day on Monday, nowhere else will the celebration
be louder than in Los Angeles, where recent gains have made it one
of the most active union cities in the country. By Rick Orlov and
Beth Barrett. (Will move in the ``a'' national and ``n'' California
news files.)

   MOVIES-BOX-OFFICE (Los Angeles) _ ``The Sixth Sense'' continued
its supernatural late-summer performance at the nation's
multiplexes, easily posting its fifth consecutive victory with an
impressive $21 million at 2,775 theaters for Friday-Sunday amid a
moderate Labor Day weekend overall at the box office, studio
sources said Sunday. By Dave McNary. (Will move in the ``a''

COMMENTARY: THE BAKER'S SLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you listen too long to the rhetoric you could begin to think
we've stepped into some kind of economic nirvana. Things are going
well, and maybe it is nirvana for the lucky ones at the top. But
the economic reality for middle-class American families is somewhat
more modest.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington shows
that middle-class workers are only slightly better off now than
they were 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, these are good times. Tight labor markets,
increases in the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit have
helped low-wage workers. Unemployment over all is very low. And the
CEOs and others at the very top have more money than they know what
to do with.
</P>
<P>
   But at $44,468, the annual income for the median American family
(using the latest available data, adjusted for inflation) is less
than $300 above where it was in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The men in that group are actually doing a bit worse than 10
years ago. The institute noted that ``despite gains over the past
2{ years, the inflation-adjusted hourly wages of middle-wage men
were 1.8 percent lower in 1999 than in 1989, the previous business
cycle peak.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana that ain't. What we are seeing is that the families
right in the middle are struggling, as always, to make ends meet.
``Though middle-wage women workers have fared better than their
male counterparts, by the middle of 1999 the median female worker's
wage was only 3.4 percent above its 1989 level,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   That is not much of a raise over 10 years. The families faced
with constant worries about mortgages and the costs of education
and health care may well be wondering what all the celebrating is
about.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the report said: ``The booming economy has thus
far failed to lift the economic prospects of middle-class workers
beyond where they were before the last recession. Despite their
substantial contribution to the growing economy, wages for these
workers have been stagnant or declining, manufacturing jobs are
disappearing at an accelerating rate, and the share of non-college
educated workers with employer-provided health coverage has
declined.''
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, middle-income wage earners, men and women,
have been working more and more. The report found that ``the
typical married-couple family with children put in 256 more hours
of work _ six additional full-time weeks _ than it did in 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet even as the number of hours on the job has increased,
the benefits _ particularly health benefits _ have declined.
Sixty-two percent of the work force in the United States are
individuals with a high school diploma, and perhaps some college,
but not a college degree. The report found that ``the share of high
school educated workers with employer-sponsored health insurance
coverage fell from 72.1 percent in 1989 to 69.5 percent in 1997.
For those working full time, year-round, the share with health
insurance through their own employer fell by 5.3 percentage points
between 1989 and 1997, from 66 to 60.7 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jared Bernstein is a labor economist with the Economic Policy
Institute and one of the authors of the report. In an interview, he
said: ``We, as much as anyone, have made positive noises about the
last few years. But if you look at the business cycle over the last
10 years, you will see that despite some positive results in the
most recent years, folks are just about back where they started.
And that's not the most impressive economic result I can think
of.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened is that the wages of middle-class workers have
trailed the growth in labor productivity in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bernstein: ``When productivity is increasing on average,
and workers at the middle of the wage scale _ who certainly make a
non-trivial contribution to that growth _ when their wages are not
keeping up with it, that's evidence of an unfair distribution of
economic growth. And if it's not going to the middle, we know it's
been going disproportionately to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to look at it this way: If the pie is growing faster,
then the bakers of the pie ought to get a bigger slice.''
</P>
<P>
   For the folks in the middle to really get beyond where they were
in the late '80s, the economic recovery will have to continue at
approximately the same pace for another few years. You might
mention that to Alan Greenspan if you see him.

<P>
   Judging by commentaries in the Western media, many observers
seem to be equating the hostilities between Russian armed forces
and Muslim separatists in Dagestan with the 1974-'76 war between
Russia and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But despite some superficial similarities, lumping together the
two fights is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton went so far as to liken the Russian
president, Boris Yeltsin, to Abraham Lincoln, a defender of his
nation's integrity, when Yeltsin sent Russian troops into Chechnya
five years ago on a misguided adventure that only made all the
problems in Northern Caucasus far worse than before.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the relatively free Russian media are not even asking
obvious questions that might clarify what's behind the escalating
crisis in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, how is it that Russia's elite special services and
intelligence organizations failed to foresee or even to monitor the
onslaught of hundreds of armed Chechen fighters led by the warlord
Shamil Basayev into Dagestan? Some Russian troops actually were
withdrawn from Dagestan a few months prior to the rebels' attack.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Russia's integrity is hanging in the balance.
During Yeltsin's debacle in Chechnya, the prestige of Russian
troops was badly damaged, but also very significantly, the fighting
fueled the rise of militant Islam there.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are important questions to be asked: Will people in
Dagestan be lured by the siren song of Islamic unity sounded from
Chechnya? Will the call for a free Islamic state win over more than
just a few villages?
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin said, just a few hours
before he was fired by Yeltsin: ``We may well lose Dagestan'' _ not
exactly the sort of news the Kremlin wished to hear.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened in Dagestan? And why so much ignorance now
about what's really at stake?
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the world's attention span is short, and this part
of the world has not been on everybody's mind. Since 1976, when its
war with Russia ended, victorious Chechnya has turned into a
humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The population in Chechnya has dropped from about 1 million to
perhaps 300,000. Its economy has become virtually non-existent.
Theft of oil from the Russian pipeline, robberies, kidnapping,
ambushes and ransom seem to be the only viable industries.
Officially, unemployment in Dagestan amounts to 20 percent;
unofficial figures put it as high as 80 percent. Youth unemployment
stands at about 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost the war, but the Chechnyans cannot win the peace. No
wonder the example of Chechnya has not proved attractive to the
majority of Dagestanis. While the benefits of independence from
Russia remain dubious, the chaos, dislocation and rampant crime in
Chechnya are there for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Stepashin, the current prime minister, Vladimir
Putin, on Aug. 7, confidently stated that the separatists in
Dagestan would be crushed in two weeks. Moscow did claim victory
over the rebels a little more than two weeks later. As of Aug. 31,
however, the air strikes and artillery raids were raging, with
eight Russian soldiers killed and 31 wounded _ and, by Russia's
count, about 80 rebels dead.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that no government can afford to stand idly by as
bands of armed terrorists try to foist the banner of Islamic
fundamentalism on a population that, for the most part, wants no
part of it. A strong military response is needed, but in Dagestan
it is a disaster to think that will cure the problem.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Chechnya, many Dagestanis volunteered to fight
the rebels alongside Russian troops. The battle now being fought in
Dagestan is not merely military, and its outcome is by no means
clear.
</P>
<P>
   If Dagestan is vulnerable to fundamentalism, it is not out of
religious ideology. The government needs help in building a better
life for its 2 million people. Its population is a patchwork of 34
ethnic groups. In some villages, the people speak two or three
languages. Stability in such places depends on deft political
footwork but also _ and perhaps most of all _ on economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   All of the republics of Russia's Northern Caucasus are in dire
straits. It is here that the Russian government has been failing in
the most miserable way. About 87 percent of Dagestan's budget comes
from Moscow, making the republic virtually dependent. Given the
state of Russia's economy, however, those transfers do not amount
to much.
</P>
<P>
   What is Russia to do? So far as these republics are concerned,
there can be no benign neglect. In fact, neglecting them could have
explosive consequences. Islamic extremism characteristically gains
strength in areas of massive poverty and powerlessness. Moscow
needs to act fast to develop and implement a workable economic
strategy. Yet the government in Moscow can barely take care of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this battle, Russia deserves at least moral support
and understanding. In Chechnya the issue was secession; in Dagestan
it is invasion. All of Russia's political parties and leaders,
including critics of the war in Chechnya, have spoken in support of
the efforts to eject the invaders, who include foreign mercenaries,
from Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, even if Russia can come up with a program to
ensure stability and economic control, it is by no means clear that
the people of Dagestan will respond gratefully and reject the call
for Islamic unity.

FOUR-MONTH MANHUNT ENDS IN QUIET ARREST OF U.S. MONEY MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Although he was the target of a four-month
trans-Atlantic manhunt, Martin Frankel lived for eight weeks at one
of the finest hotels in the German city of Hamburg before he was
arrested on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, 44, a secretive Connecticut money manager whom U.S.
authorities suspect of embezzling more than $200 million from
insurance companies, played a cat-and-mouse game with the FBI that
took him through Italy and maybe other countries before it ended in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburg police officials, who arrested Frankel after getting a
request from the FBI, said the fugitive millionaire checked into
the luxurious 53-room Prem Hotel about eight weeks ago. His
unusually long stay in Room 5 on the third floor apparently excited
little curiosity among hotel employees, who were reluctant to
discuss it on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior FBI official in Washington said Sunday that tips from
friends and disgruntled former associates who had been in contact
with Frankel, along with a winding trail of bank account and credit
card charges, had led federal authorities to the fugitive
financier.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent from the agency's legal attache office in Berlin
and the German police staked out the Hotel Prem beginning on
Thursday after learning of Frankel's whereabouts, said Thomas
Pickard, assistant director of the FBI Criminal Investigative
Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting more and more into Germany in the last couple
of weeks and intensified our search when we got a couple of tips
that matched with information from tracking the movement of his
funds and his credit cards,'' Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   He said authorities seized a substantial sum of cash, diamonds
and potentially significant financial records and two or more
laptop computers. The records and computers are likely to yield
important clues to unraveling what is left of Frankel's fallen
financial empire, Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Frankel was arrested, he was sharing his double room
at the waterfront hotel with Cynthia Allison, 35, one of his many
female associates. She was living under the name Susan Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Hans-Juergen Petersen, a spokesman for the Hamburg police, said
Ms. Allison had been detained for questioning but was later
released.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department has begun preparing papers to have
Frankel extradited from Germany to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburg police are holding Frankel in the Holstenglacis jail, a
detention center filled mainly with suspected drug dealers and
users. He was expected to be brought before a judge for arraignment
on Monday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen said Frankel seemed ``clearly surprised'' when police
officers entered his room at the Prem, an elegant old hotel
overlooking the Alster lake in one of Hamburg's best neighborhoods.
He said Frankel had put up no resistance and showed no signs of
weariness from his four months as a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest on Saturday night was pedestrian compared to the
surreal drama of Frankel's abrupt disappearance and subsequent
reports of his lifestyle _ which included his repeated use of false
names, his ever-present coterie of attractive young women and his
penchant for traveling first-class even when he was on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal German police arrived at the Prem hotel
shortly after 9 p.m. on Saturday and entered his room with a
passkey. Frankel reportedly admitted his identity immediately and
gave himself up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Agents matched an earlier set of Frankel's fingerprints with a
set taken from him shortly after his arrest to confirm his
identity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials cautioned that the extradition might take several
months, though German officials said it could proceed much more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said Sunday that a key issue was whether
Frankel needed to be investigated for any crimes here. At the
moment, he is not a target of any allegations in Germany, although
there may be questions about his use of false names. Officials
declined to say which alias he used at the Hamburg hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel probably had no trouble travelling between Italy and
Germany. He was carrying at least two passports and both countries
are part of a group within the European Union that allows people to
travel between member countries without showing their passports.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, insurance regulators have accused Frankel
of embezzling at least $218 million from insurance companies that
had invested money with the brokerage firm, Liberty National
Securities, which he ran from his mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount of missing money could be much higher. A
lawsuit filed by some of the insurance companies puts the loss at
$915 million. Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St.
Francis of Assisi Foundation, a charitable foundation that law
enforcement officials say Frankel established in the British Virgin
Islands last August.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel disappeared in May, shortly before his mansion caught
fire. Responding to a fire alarm at the mansion, fire fighters
found a file cabinet in flames and piles of documents stuffed into
the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Police issued a warrant for Frankel's arrest and came close to
catching up with him in July in Rome, where he had been staying in
some of the city's best hotels. But he fled before the FBI obtained
an arrest warrant from Italian authorities.

<P>
   With health costs spiraling again, employers are taking a closer
look at their workers' waistlines, tackling a complicated and
sensitive issue that affects not just medical costs but morale and
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   While companies typically tread softly to avoid giving offense
or violating discrimination laws, many are trying harder to promote
exercise and nutrition regimens to reduce the health risks of being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   With the population getting older and more sedentary by the day,
excess weight is a growing national issue for everyone from
children to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have tackled this issue before, but their efforts have
taken on a new urgency as revamped statistics have shown a sharp
rise in both the number of overweight Americans and the enormous
costs associated with excess weight. While few employers have come
up with new tactics to attack the problem, more of them are joining
the crusade.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, 46 percent of adults were overweight,
according to new guidelines introduced last year, but by 1991, that
had soared to 54 percent _ 97 million people, by the latest
estimate. Adults classified as being acutely overweight, or obese,
went from 15 percent to 23 percent in the same period. ``It is
clearly an epidemic,'' said Nancy Chockley, president of the
National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation, a
research and lobbying group financed by health plans and government
grants.
</P>
<P>
   And business is paying a good part of the bill, with much of the
rest adding to taxpayers' costs for Medicare and Medicaid. Obesity
cost the nation $99.2 billion in 1995, about half for medical care
and $39 billion in productivity losses, according to an estimate
last year by Anne Wolf of the University of Virginia and Graham
Colditz of the Harvard School of Public Health. That statistic
combines the costs of doctor visits, lost productivity, absenteeism
and hospital stays. It does not include $33 billion in annual
spending for weight-loss products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in loss of productivity was phenomenal,'' Ms.
Wolf said. ``People were sicker, missing more days of work. It
looks like people who are overweight became more obese, and those
who were obese became more so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Foster, clinical director of the weight and eating
disorders program at the University of Pennsylvania, adds that
obesity is also often associated with morale problems and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   According to David Thompson of Policy Analysis Inc., a
consulting firm in Brookline, Mass., the direct cost to employer
health plans was $12.7 billion in 1994, which he said was the first
year such costs were tallied.
</P>
<P>
   But companies are not taking it sitting down. Last year, 93
percent of employers had programs that fostered employee health, up
from 76 percent in 1992, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits
consulting firm outside Chicago. Such ``wellness'' programs
typically offer help in stopping smoking, managing stress, prenatal
care and nutrition and fitness. Programs are also offered by some
insurers, like Highmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which runs 17
wellness centers in western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The programs vary widely. Many big companies have on-site
fitness centers with aerobic exercise classes, machines and
coaches. Some employers have indoor or outdoor running tracks,
while others subsidize memberships in health clubs. Companies often
display nutrition information in their lunchrooms and subsidize
nutrition classes with lectures and menus and recipes to take home.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, at least, the programs are paying off. Xerox said
that savings in medical costs were five times the cost of its
health promotion programs. Progressive, a Cleveland auto insurer,
said that having fitness centers helped it attract desirable
employees in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of studies underscore the problem. One involving
17,118 members of Kaiser Permanente, the health maintenance
organization, reported that annual costs of hospital care,
laboratory tests, radiology and drugs were 25 percent higher among
obese members.
</P>
<P>
   And Shell Oil, reviewing its own costs for nine years, found
that as obese women grew older, their sick leaves increased at
twice the rate of those who were not obese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a toxic environment with regard to obesity,'' said
Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of obesity research at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York. ``Food is very
palatable, very cheap, very easy to get. Labor-saving devices are
everywhere. Everybody is working at desks, expending a lot less
energy and eating a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have attached dollar price tags to employee
weight problems. University of Michigan researchers reported last
year that health care costs for obese male employees of a Chicago
bank averaged $4,047, spread over three years, or $718 higher than
for all men. Costs for obese women were $10,926, or $4,182 higher
than the average for women employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Burton, corporate medical director of Bank One Corp.
and the chief author of the Michigan obesity survey, said that
especially for women, weight seemed to be associated with heart,
lung, joint and digestive diseases as well as mental health
problems and some types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on the survey, he said, the bank is expanding its
network of fitness centers from four to six. At one center in
Chicago, Carla Crnkovic, 43, a computer programmer and exercise
enthusiast, has attended a lunch-hour nutrition program since early
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost 110 pounds, my blood pressure came down to normal and
my cholesterol level dropped 40 points,'' she said. ``It's
wonderful. My tennis game is much improved.'' Her current weight,
175 pounds, is considered appropriate for her 6-foot height, but
she recently added a bank-sponsored walking program to her routine.
</P>
<P>
   Company programs get more attention, not surprisingly, when top
executives are sympathetic. Michael Critelli, chairman of Pitney
Bowes, the office-machine company based in Stamford, Conn., noticed
last year that a fat-laden bacon, egg and cheese croissant was
cheaper than a serving of fruit in the company cafeteria. The
prices were soon readjusted to push fruit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With similar attention to detail, Pitney Bowes encourages
employees to leave their cars in the most remote spot in the
company lot and walk in.
</P>
<P>
   Retired employees were recently invited to use a company fitness
center in Stamford. David Hom, executive director of corporate
benefits at Pitney Bowes, said it planned to extend fitness and
nutrition counseling to retirees around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In another case of heightened corporate attention, the drug
maker SmithKline Beecham recently hired an outside firm, Health
Decisions Inc., based in Golden, Colo., to create a national
wellness program for 1,600 SmithKline employees who reported weight
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Without waiting for the new program, Regina McCairns, 47, a
SmithKline quality control investigator in Upper Providence, Pa.,
gave up her lunch hour to lift weights and use a treadmill in the
company gym. ``I keep my clothes for the fitness center in my file
drawer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCairns would not give her weight but said she had taken
off 38 pounds. Once a week, she consults with a personal trainer at
the fitness center and checks on her diet with an outside doctor.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, the extent of the problem became much clearer
last year when a federal panel of scientists, after studying
illnesses like diabetes and heart disease, lowered the threshold
defining overweight to a height-to-weight relationship, or body
mass index, of 25 or higher. For a woman of average height, 5 foot
5, that works out to 150 pounds; or the average man, 5-foot-10,
it's 174 pounds. Obesity starts at a body mass index of 30.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although some scientists say obesity is a chronic illness, not
all overweight people are destined to become sick. Pi-Sunyer, who
headed the federal study, estimates that 10 percent to 20 percent
of overweight people are not disease prone.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Dietz, director of the nutrition and physical
activity division at the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, said, ``People who are overfat and have a negative family
history for all the obesity-associated'' diseases ``will live to
over 85 and not have any'' of these diseases. He added, ``We don't
know a lot about those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most employers have shied away from rewarding weight loss or
trying to force workers to slim down. For one thing, ``researchers
don't understand obesity all that well, and we don't have a
permanent cure for it,'' said Carol Johnson, a sociologist who is
president of Largely Positive, an advocacy group that she said
``promotes self-esteem and health among larger people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Edington, director of the University of Michigan health
management research center, said being overweight in itself was not
dangerous. But obesity combined with other risk factors like
smoking and lack of exercise _ ``that is dangerous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some employer health plans will pay for diet drugs when
a doctor declares them a medical necessity, Morgan Downey,
executive director of the American Obesity Association, said that
for the most part, the drugs were poorly covered.
</P>
<P>
   His organization, which is financed by drug makers and Weight
Watchers International, has petitioned the IRS to allow a tax
deduction for obesity treatment under employer-sponsored medical
savings accounts. The IRS recently announced a limited tax break
for smoking cessation programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynn McAfee, director of medical advocacy for the Council on
Size and Weight Discrimination, an advocacy group, questions the
long-range effectiveness of weight-loss drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at 5 to 10 percent weight losses,'' she said.
``Whether they can be maintained is an open question.'' She also
questioned whether a relatively small weight loss would make a
difference in diseases like diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   What is not disputed is the importance of exercise and nutrition
in heading off many major diseases, whether or not a person is
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a person exercising more and improving their diet,
their health problems may clear up, even if they don't lose
weight,'' said Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at
the University of Virginia.

NOT A GREAT BEGINNING FOR RANGERS' HOTSHOT ROOKIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Pavel Brendl said he had worked on both his
skating and his conditioning in Western Canada this summer. The way
he looked Sunday morning, however, the highly-touted 18-year-old
should have worked much harder.
</P>
<P>
   A weary Brendl later said he had a touch of the flu. But after
he had barely made it through his first National Hockey League
practice on the opening day of Rangers' training camp, Brendl's ego
had to hurt as much as his legs did from cramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have to hope he does have the flu,'' Neil Smith, the
Rangers' president and general manager, said after watching the
inauspicious debut of this summer's fourth overall draft choice.
``You have to write it off, or you'll drive yourself crazy. As in,
`Oh, my God. I gave up Sundstrom, Cloutier and a first-round pick
for him. What if he's not sick?'''
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Muckler had never seen Brendl play before Sunday. He
joked about it afterward, quickly answering ``Brendl'' when he was
asked who had impressed him most in the intrasquad scrimmages. But
Muckler also said that he was totally writing off what he had just
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ill,'' Muckler said. ``He didn't show any enthusiasm.
But I think he has an excuse for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendl, who scored 73 goals in 68 regular-season games and then
21 more in 20 playoff games playing junior league hockey for
Calgary of the Western Hockey League last season, said that he
thinks he can play much better. ``But it was the first day and I
was a little bit sick,'' he said. ``I'll get better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendl's new bosses hope so. Brendl and the Rangers are nearing
an agreement on a three-year deal that could eventually be worth
about $9 million with bonuses factored in, one that could be made
final as soon as Monday. But after Sunday's performance, Smith
might want to pull the offer off the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had all but penciled the 6-foot, 204-pound Brendl
onto their opening day roster, based on his performance last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, you have to calculate a guy with his record and all
the opinions there were on him that he will probably make the
team,'' Smith said. ``Then he comes in and you find out if there
are some reasons why that was not a calculation to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the year does not revolve around whether Pavel Brendl
stays in the NHL or not. I think our next decade does. But I'd
still bet at this point he'd be on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he's not? Brendl said he isn't worrying about that right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anything can happen,'' Brendl said. ``You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendl is just trying to adjust to his new surroundings. Even
though the coaching staff has the Czech native rooming with veteran
leader Adam Graves, Brendl appears lost. And not just on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But the ice is what matters most to the Rangers. And while
Brendl's 22-year-old countryman Jan Hlavac (two goals, one assist
skating with the team's Czech leader Petr Nedved) was one of the
more impressive players Sunday, Brendl looked rusty, slow,
uncoordinated and out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   He sat alone on a bench between periods instead of returning to
the dressing room, prompting a visit from team captain Brian
Leetch, who was told that it was too stuffy in the dressing room
for Brendl to breathe. After some post-scrimmage skating drills,
Brendl dropped to all fours on the ice. And then, after he had gone
through circuit-training drills, Brendl dropped as if he had been
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it really was the flu. Nedved insisted that Brendl has
great hands. ``He's got all the potential,'' Nedved said. ``We'll
see how quickly he adjusts.''
</P>
<P>
   But another player said privately that he and some other
veterans were left wondering how the Rangers could have traded
their top two prospects for Brendl. And this was after they had
seen him on the ice at the Rangers' training facility in Rye, N.Y.,
earlier this summer, not Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brendl, meanwhile, said he thought his conditioning could have
been a little better coming into camp, but he also added that he
needed some rest after the longest season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring one of his longest days, Brendl was asked
something by Nedved in Czech. Brendl just responded with a moan.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting response to his first day.

 &HT;    Braves throw one away in 9th
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few minutes after recording the day's 27th and
presumably final out, the Atlanta Braves lost a game Sunday. If
Atlanta and Arizona are to meet again next month, the Diamondbacks
administered a departing karate chop to remember them by.
</P>
<P>
   After coming back from a three-run deficit against Randy
Johnson, a one-run Atlanta lead was washed out on three unearned
runs in the ninth after John Rocker had fanned pinch hitter Kelly
Stinnett to apparently end the game. In a mind-numbing sequence,
rookie Randall Simon failed to cover first base on a dropped third
strike, catcher Eddie Perez threw over Simon's head, and Tony
Womack and Luis Gonzalez drove in three runs with singles to end
the game a second time, 7-5 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it's over and we lose,'' said starter Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my worst game ever,'' said Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played an unbelievable ballgame and then took
something for... granted and got ... beat,'' said manager Bobby
Cox. ``It amounts to that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Braves' NL East lead dropped to 2 1/2 games after a Mets
win, despite their comeback against Johnson. Down 4-1 after five
innings, the Braves scored twice in the sixth, including Chipper
Jones' second solo home run of the game, and Gerald Williams'
two-run, two-out double in the seventh gave Atlanta a 5-4 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had all but pocketed his 32nd save with two outs and none
on in the ninth, when Perez bobbled the third strike to Stinnett.
He lunged and missed a tag, and when he looked to first base, Simon
wasn't covering.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he struck him out, I kind of turned around, thinking that
we won the game right there,'' said Simon. ``I didn't see the ball
when Eddie threw it at first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going over to second base to start giving guys
high-fives,'' right fielder Brian Jordan said, ``and the next thing
I know, I'm chasing the ball down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the clubhouse had ever seen anything like it, hardly
in the crucible of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope,'' said Glavine, ``you don't make the same mistake
again.

 &HT;    Defeat drives Vikings
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is with great sadness that I walk out to my car this morning
to scrape the Vikings sticker off my bumper. When that is
accomplished, I will go inside to turn on my computer, go to the
favorite files and delete all of my Vikings links. I have been a
Vikings fan for as long as there have been Vikings, through grade
school, high school, college and all of my adult life. I have stuck
by them while living in three other states, through four Super Bowl
losses and all of the ``rebuilding'' years. But a time has to come
when a player, a team or a fan says enough is enough. ... It hurts
to lose, but the pain would be a lot less if, in my heart, I did
not have the suspicion the Lombardi trophy never will wear purple.
</P>
<P>
   _ Letter from Minnesota Vikings fan Vince Reed, of Murphysboro,
Ill., published in the St. Paul Pioneer Press on Jan. 24, a week
after Minnesota's 30-27 overtime loss to Atlanta in the NFC
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ As Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson lined up for a
38-yard field goal with 2:07 left in regulation in January's NFC
Championship game, hats proclaiming the Vikings ``NFC Champions''
were being passed out in owner Red McCombs' private suite. Outside
the Metrodome, local newspapers were hawking commemorative Super
Bowl sections, with one headline blaring, ``On To Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding a 27-20 lead over the underdog Atlanta Falcons,
Anderson's field goal would have given the Vikings an
insurmountable lead. Surely, Anderson wouldn't miss. Not after he
became the first perfect kicker in NFL regular-season history,
making all 94 of his attempts _ 35 field goals and 59 extra points.
Surely, this game was in the bag. Minnesota was going to Miami and
back to the Super Bowl, where it hadn't been since losing for an
NFL-record fourth time in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson missed.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's offense took over and scored a game-tying touchdown
with only 49 seconds remaining, sending the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made it hurt so badly was that I, along with my entire
family and I think the Vikings fans and players, just knew that we
had the game won,'' McCombs said. ``It was a great lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, a short-lived one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that we had the game won, even in overtime,''
McCombs said. ``I turned to my family and said, 'Don't worry. We
won the coin toss and we'll score on the first possession.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's defense shut down Minnesota's high-octane offense,
which set an NFL record with 556 points last season, and the
Vikings didn't score on their two possessions in overtime. With
8:28 left, the Falcons took over at their own 9-yard line and drove
to the Vikings' 29, where kicker Morten Andersen nailed a 38-yard
field goal with 3:08 remaining for a shocking 30-27 upset.
</P>
<P>
   There was no joy in Slushville. The Mighty Norsemen struck out.
</P>
<P>
   When the teams meet again Sunday in the Georgia Dome in the 1999
opener, Minnesota hopes to take the first step in erasing the
memories of that fateful afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge, huge loss,'' McCombs said. ``I've got three
young grandchildren and I realized, just as that game ended, that
we never had explained losing to them. They really didn't
understand losing. It was a difficult situation. I turned to my
wife and said, 'You've got to explain to these grandkids that we
lost and we're not going to Miami. It's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, McCombs gathered his family at home. They had
dinner _ and wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big crying session,'' he said. ``We'd all made plans
to go to Miami, but everybody just decided that they weren't going.
I really couldn't handle football at the time. It was a very, very
unusual situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesotans are used to losing. And they've learned it's a lot
like lutefish _ hard to swallow. The Vikings lost the first of four
Super Bowls under coach Bud Grant in 1970, just two years after
Hubert Humprey lost the presidential election to Richard Nixon.
Seven years after Minnesota was pounded by Oakland in their last
Super Bowl appearance, native son Walter ``Fritz'' Mondale lost to
Ronald Regan in the 1984 election.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps none of those defeats stung as much as Minnesota's
loss to Atlanta. The Vikings were supposed to win and few believed
they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't close the gate or do it like we should have last
year,'' offensive lineman Randall McDaniel said. ``We should have
closed the gate and we didn't. To get that close and not make it,
after doing everything we did last year, it makes you want to get
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be lying if we said we didn't think about it,'' running
back Robert Smith said, ``but (this week) is just another game.
It's our first game and that's most important.''
</P>
<P>
   Those memories undoubtedly will be motivation this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so obvious, it's not even talked about,'' McCombs said.

 &HT;    Fraser says Buchberger already 'perfect example'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ A franchise turned the key Sunday, and it seemed
Kelly Buchberger was there to make sure the engine turned over. He
was the first one on the ice for the first practice in the first
training camp. He was first in line for drills in the morning,
first to be singled out later by the coach for compliments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to see guys who jump out to get in front of the
line,'' Thrashers coach Curt Fraser said Sunday, when the team
began on-ice workouts. ``He's the perfect example we want here for
the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider them nice set-up comments, assuming the 32-year-old is
named team captain soon. Buchberger says that's not on his mind.
His actions were not an orchestrated effort to gain the attention
of others and assume control of this fledgling hockey team. His
actions merely were borne out of habits he formed as a youth, a
work ethic instilled in him by his parents and a near-tragedy that
gave him an appreciation for life out of a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 7, I was burned in a fire and I had to battle to
overcome that,'' said Buchberger, who was acquired from Edmonton in
the expansion draft. ``I couldn't play hockey that year. It was an
uphill battle. I knew it would take me giving 100 percent to
succeed every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire, Buchberger said, was his fault. ``I was young and
foolish, playing with gas.'' He doesn't give specifics, saying,
``It's a long story and I'd rather not talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the burns on his left leg were so bad that he had to spend
two-and-a-half months in the hospital. Before every practice, he
must wrap his left leg in gauze for extra protection. Otherwise,
sweat and material rubbing against the scar tissue can cause layers
of skin to peel off.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the difficulties he's had in life, he's had to overcome a
lot just to play,'' said teammate Ray Ferraro. ``It's made him more
resilient than most of us have had to be. He'll get hurt but he'll
come back and play the same way he did before. That's the key.
After being burned, it's not that big a deal to break a bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, he has done: a broken ankle; a dislocated shoulder; other
shoulder and knee ailments; a fractured forearm last year that
limited him to 52 games and, he admits, affected his play when he
returned late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 seasons with the Oilers, Buchberger was known more for his
leadership and physical play than his scoring, although he did have
a 20-goal season in 1991-92. He was popular with teammates and
fans, making it a difficult situation when general manager Glen
Sather left him unprotected in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger admits it was ``difficult'' to learn Sather had put
him out there, but stopped short of saying he was bitter. ``I'm
excited about being here now,'' he said. ``I want to be part of
building a winning team, hopefully early.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers made a commitment to the right winger, giving him
a three-year, $2.85-million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger was born in Langenburg, Saskatchewan, the son of a
potash miner and a mother who's a cook at the only restaurant in
town. His brother runs oil rigs in Dubai. One sister is a pro
volleyball player, the other a police officer. ``Everybody works
hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he recalled the first day of his first training camp
with Edmonton in 1985, when he took a run at veteran Lee Fogolin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize who it was,'' Buchberger said, still
embarrassed. ``All of a sudden, I feel this stick go across my
legs. He was saying, `You hit me one more time, you're going
down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger said he was just as nervous Sunday as he was 14 years
ago. ``You can't get comfortable,'' he said. ``If you're in a
comfort zone, you won't be as hungry.

RUSSIA IS COOPERATING IN CORRUPTION PROBE, BUT PREMIER DISCOUNTS
SIGNIFICANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in a television
interview aired Sunday evening that Russian law enforcement
authorities are cooperating in an investigation of a suspected
money laundering scheme involving Russian money at the Bank of New
York, but he said that the sums involved were far less than the
billions of dollars reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope described in the press _ huge billions _ obviously
doesn't correspond to reality, but I repeat, the problem exists and
we will work on it, without dramatizing it but without ignoring
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has been accused of playing down the
significance of an investigation into at least $4.2 billion
transferred over the last 18 months to accounts at the Bank of New
York in what U.S. investigators have called a scheme involving
money illegally taken out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on a news show on ORT, the largest television station,
Putin, a former chief of Russia's domestic intelligence service,
acknowledged that illegal capital flight out of the depleted
economy is a serious problem. But he echoed the view of several top
officials that the ongoing investigation involving Bank of New York
has become a `'campaign'' fueled by election year politics in both
the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin appeared on one television program Sunday night,
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appeared on a rival show on
NTV, an independent television station, where for the first time he
accused members of President Boris Yeltsin's inner circle of
conspiring to remove him from office in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cause was that some people in the circle close to
the president supplied him with wrong information about me and the
government,'' said Primakov, who has returned to politics as head
of a coalition that could mount a presidential campaign next year.
</P>
<P>
   As attacks against Yeltsin's small group of advisers gathered
steam, Putin dodged and interviewer's question about a scandal that
has reached into the Kremlin itself, touching one of Yeltsin's
longest-serving aides and members of his own family.
</P>
<P>
   According to several investigators, an ongoing probe into
alleged kickbacks paid to Kremlin officials by Mabatex, a
Swiss-based company that landed a lucrative Kremlin reconstruction
contract, is focusing on suspects including members of the Yeltsin
family, in particular the president's two daughters, Yelena Okulova
and Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   An article published in an Italian newspaper on Saturday
reported that Pavel Borodin, head of the Kremlin's property
management office since 1993, was one of three signatories on a
Swiss bank account opened by Mabatex in March 1995. The newspaper
also said that Russian investigators believe that two other bank
accounts, opened in the names of two of Borodin's deputies,
codenamed ``Cinderella'' and ``Tsarina,'' were put at the disposal
of the two Yeltsin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin last week denied that any members of the Yeltsin
family held bank accounts abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But these charges have already entered Russia's highly charged
political arena, where Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a Yeltsin foe
and, with Primakov, a leader of the newly formed political
coalition, openly challenged Yeltsin and his family to come forward
with a full accounting of credit card and bank accounts held
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of corruption are expected to fly fast and furious as
the struggle for power intensifies with parliamentary elections in
December, and presidential elections next summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report in Corriere della Sera, Italy's leading newspaper,
largely corroborated a report published in July in Vestiya, a
Russian investigative newspaper, that Borodin was one of three
names listed on an account at the Gotthard Bank, which showed about
$3 million in separate transactions. The other signatories were
Borodin's daughter, Yekaterina Siletskaya, and Behgjet Pacolli,
president of Mabatex.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Borodin family were among the 24 names of Russian
officials _ many of them connected to Borodin's Kremlin department
_ which Swiss prosecutors, at the behest of Russian prosecutors,
have circulated among Swiss banks this summer seeking information
on secret bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has repeatedly denied having his own Swiss bank account,
although he has said that Mabatex paid his expenses for trips to
Europe connected to the Kremlin renovation. Pacolli has said that
his firm opened a bank account to pay those expenses but that other
money _ including $1 million transferred to a Budapest bank in 1995
_ had been sent through the account by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said on Sunday that the case was still under investigation
but suggested that evidence in the press could have been
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``An account can be opened in your name very easily, and then it
is possible to say that you have it,'' he said. ``Then this account
may be made bigger and you will be asked: `Where did you get the
money?' These are technologies that are well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Some newspapers have reported that credit card bills showing
charges made by Yeltsin and his family were found in January during
a search of Mabatex offices by Swiss authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Yeltsin might have ever used a credit card,
Putin said with a half-smile, ``Not likely.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya _ Moammar Gadhafi's Libya turned 30 last week,
and a spree of congratulations here has been intensified by a
conviction, at least in some quarters, that the leader may finally
have outgrown his bad-boy past.
</P>
<P>
   From all across Africa, where Gadhafi's regime once meddled so
famously, other heads of state are on their way to Tripoli for an
extraordinary meeting of the Organization of African Unity that is
to begin Monday, timed in his honor to coincide with the
anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have already paid tribute was King Abdullah of
Jordan, whose father, King Hussein, could never abide the Libyan
leader. King Abdullah's visit last Wednesday came on the
anniversary of the date that King Idris I of Libya was toppled _
Sept. 1, 1969 _ in a coup led by a 27-year-old Gadhafi, who
replaced him as Libya's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The annual ceremonies to commemorate that revolution have always
been triumphal, with the capital covered in the trademark Libyan
green, on pennants and posters and innumerable tiny lights. But
even compared with a year ago, the backdrop this time is not at all
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a deal struck in July, Libya enjoys full diplomatic
relations with Britain _ a country that suffered from Libyan
terrorism _ for the first time in 15 years. Thanks to another deal
struck in April, it has been freed from the bind of U.N. sanctions
that, among other things, had since 1992 rendered its
``international airport'' international only in name.
</P>
<P>
   And the fresh flow of potential investors now arriving on direct
flights from European capitals is seen by the hopeful here and
outside Libya as a tangible symbol that an end to Libya's isolation
is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi is best known in the West as a serial troublemaker, with
the defiance and unreality of a perpetual youth. But lately he has
tried to project a fresh look, with acts and comments that some
believe reflect additional maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has grown up,'' said a Tripoli-based Arab diplomat.
``He tried everything when he was young, but he's 57 now, and he's
made up his mind. In the next millennium, he wants to present a new
Libya.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for example, Gadhafi told African journalists that
he in fact shared an aspiration, voiced by President Olusegun
Obasanjo of Nigeria, who said that people were eager to see
something new from the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world knows Moammar Gadhafi as the leader of the world
revolution, which is contributing to the liberation of peoples,''
the Libyan leader said that Obasanjo had told him. ``And now that
the liberation stage has ended, the world wants to know Moammar
Gadhafi as the leader of peace and development in Africa and other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I hope that Moammar Gadhafi meets this description,''
the Libyan leader added.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi remains eccentric; at most international gatherings, he
usually stays apart, in a tent. But many African leaders _ like
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and President Idriss Deby of
Chad, who were helped greatly by Gadhafi in their own revolutionary
days _ now seem to see him as a force for stability.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gadhafi is hardly a picture of youth. He hobbles on
an aluminum cane that he acquired last summer after he broke a
thigh under circumstances that have not been fully explained. His
skin looks puffy and wrinkled. Still, most observers say his firm
grip on power remains undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   And, with his flowing dark hair and striking features, he
retains his rugged glamour. For public appearances last week, his
outfits included a double-breasted white blazer, traditional Arab
robes, and a dashing white linen suit that he wore for a speech to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he tries to promote a new image, he sometimes
reverts to old patterns. In front of the gathering of investors, he
accused the United States of promoting ``a satanic policy'' by
using economic sanctions for political purposes. He then went on to
claim that the International Monetary Fund was ``controlled by the
Zionists,'' and complained that if Libya wanted to obtain a World
Bank loan, it would be necessary to ``go first to Tel Aviv.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such lapses, most foreign observers here say they are
nevertheless convinced that Gadhafi is fully committed to better
behavior. And while it is not easy to gauge public opinion, the
changes of the last few months have clearly made many Libyans more
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the most important change, which came with the
suspension of U.N. sanctions, is the fact that Libyans can once
again travel abroad without enduring an arduous journey by car or
ship. And, as they recognize, foreigners have begun to visit Libya
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is that it will allow tourists and businessmen
to come, and that means more jobs,'' said Latif Abdelsaid, a
24-year-old computer technician who works in a government ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gadhafi's long record of political and economic
mismanagement means that many skeptics remain. In Libya, which is
Africa's richest country on a per capita basis, many people remain
poor, and some grumble over what they say has been Gadhafi's
longstanding disinclination to pay attention to problems at home.
The boldest among them say they are waiting now to see results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the excuse for the bad economic situation is over,'' said
a 40-year-old accountant who would give only his first name,
Abdelsalem. ``We can't blame the sanctions anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Among foreign countries, the main skeptic, of course, is still
the United States, and its grounds are Libya's long record of
support for terrorism, particularly as practiced by radical
Palestinian groups. Together with Britain, the United States
supported the plan to suspend U.N. sanctions against Libya after a
deal was struck to try the suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Clinton administration stands as the main obstacle
to a Security Council decision to lift those sanctions altogether.
Beyond that, the administration has left in place tough unilateral
sanctions against Libya, some of which date back to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   These include a comprehensive trade embargo imposed in April
1986, at a time when U.S. outrage over Libya's sponsorship of
terrorism led to bombing raids which hit Gadhafi's house, among
other targets, and were said by Libyans to have killed one of his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said those sanctions will not be lifted
until Libya can demonstrate that it has renounced terror ``in word
and deed.'' For now, Libya still appears on the State Department's
list of international sponsors of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   European countries, struck by the new softening in Libya's old
intransigence, have proved far more willing than the United States
to give Gadhafi the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   A general consensus among observers here holds that after seven
years of U.N. sanctions, Gadhafi decided that defiance was no
longer sustainable. Not only did the sanctions cut off air links to
Libya but they also banned the import of aircraft parts, weapons,
and equipment needed for oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Although Libya has succeeded in maintaining oil production at
undiminished levels, the cost to the Libyan economy has been
estimated at $24 billion, and the incalculable cost to popular
morale may have been greater.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably Gadhafi himself recognizes that he might have
made some mistakes,'' said a Western ambassador here. ``But the
past is the past, and now they want to move quickly into a
different future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Lockerbie case, the Libyan leader agreed to surrender the
two suspects only after the United States and Britain first bent to
his demand that the trial of the two men, said by Western officials
to be Libyan intelligence officers, take place in a third country.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is now expected to begin next year in the Netherlands,
and Gadhafi's government is obligated under the Security Council
resolution that suspended the sanctions to cooperate with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In two other notorious cases, Gadhafi has quietly moved closer
to accepting some responsibility. In one, involving the 1989
bombing of a French UTA airliner over Africa, the Libyan government
in July transferred $31 million to France to compensate relatives
of 170 people killed in the attack. But Gadhafi specified in a
recent interview that the move should not be construed as an
admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   It came after Libya cooperated in a French investigation that
led to the conviction of six Libyans for their role in the attack,
including Abduallah Senoussi, Gadhafi's brother-in-law and top
security aide.
</P>
<P>
   Libya always refused to surrender the defendants to the French
court, so the trial was held in their absence. All of the men were
sentenced to life in prison, but French officials have little
expectation that any will spend even a day behind bars. Even so,
President Jacques Chirac of France proclaimed at a conference of
French diplomats last month that France and Libya had turned past
``a dark page.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, Libya has now explicitly accepted
responsibility for the 1984 killing of a British policewoman,
Yvonne Fletcher, by shots fired from the Libyan Embassy in London's
St. James Square. That step, also taken in July, was the one that
prompted Britain to restore diplomatic relations with Libya, which
had been severed since the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for first time in 15 years, there is officially a British
Embassy in Tripoli, although the old quarters have not yet been
restored, and diplomats are working from lower-profile quarters
established previously on the grounds of the Italian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of all these moves, taken together, is that rarely a
week goes by in which Gadhafi is not visited by a foreign head of
state trying to make up for lost time after the long ban on
international air flights. Another can be measured in the crush of
foreign delegations that have descended on Tripoli. Some 30 have
visited from Italy alone; others have come from Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, the United Arab Emirates and countless private firms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few here expect any investment boom soon. Gadhafi's
government has issued scores of new contracts, but it has not
signed any of them yet; it is not known for swift decision-making.
Investors remain wary too, particularly of the fact that the U.N.
sanctions could technically be renewed at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has held talks with British Aerospace on a multibillion
dollar deal to acquire new aircraft for its debilitated commercial
fleet and rebuild the country's crumbling airports. But some
observers say that Libya would prefer to persuade the United States
to join in the new embrace.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of some Libyans, it would also mark a true end to
the bad old days. ``Things have been going downward for a long
time,'' said a storekeeper who would give his name only as
Mohammed. ``The politics are too complicated for me to understand,
but things were better when the Americans were around.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shiny flecks of silvery foil drifted down from the
third mezzanine at Radio City Music Hall, the 67-year-old icon of
Art Deco glamour. They floated past two 30-foot tubular glass
chandeliers, gold mirrors, Pompeian-red velvet-covered walls and
marble wainscoting to settle in small mounds on the bare concrete
floor of the Grand Foyer.
</P>
<P>
   From his ladder, Ed Kaplan, his eyebrows and mutton-chop
sideburns crusted with sparkling bits, pulled another roll of
gossamer-thin foil from his pocket, tore off a piece and pressed it
into the ceiling with a squeegee. ``I'm looking forward to bringing
my grandchildren here,'' said Kaplan, 28, a gilder. ``And I'm going
to show them the parts I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan is one of 29 artisans who have spent the last eight weeks
hand-rubbing aluminum leaf into a vast expanse of ceilings,
balconies and walls. The surfaces will soon be shellacked to a
golden sheen _ one of the richest details in an ambitious
restoration which has kept the hall closed since February and sent
costs spiraling from an early estimate of $25 million to $70
million. And there seem to be acres more to go.
</P>
<P>
   Only one month before the scheduled reopening of Radio City
Music Hall on Oct. 4, more than 500 workers _ masons, electricians,
plumbers, plasterers, steamfitters, metalworkers, carpet installers
and more _ are bent to the task of both preserving and modernizing
this architectural treasure for the HDTV generation. Much still
needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the 112-foot-wide shimmery gold silk curtain,
newly woven in Queens, was hoisted on 13 motorized cables up to the
famous sunrise rings of the proscenium arch. ``There's no place on
earth like this,'' said Dave Checketts, president of Madison Square
Garden, which manages Radio City Music Hall for Cablevision
Systems, as he watched two tons of silk cloth swaying. ``Our goal
is to give it back to New York just as it was,'' he added, ``with
all the problems solved.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood amid hundreds of boxes containing the new plush
salmon-pink seats, which are still unpacked. Carpets are yet to be
laid in the 450,000-square-foot space, light sconces and doorknobs
must be installed, the famed Donald Deskey furniture is out being
reupholstered and new red, blue and gold neon has yet to be added
to the marquees.
</P>
<P>
   When visitors enter the refurbished Radio City Music Hall, they
should expect to be awed or shocked by the brightness of colors,
the complexity of rug and wall patterns and the vast reflective
ceilings, now that the tarnishing effects of smoke and time have
been swept away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very closely watched renovation,'' said Laurie
Beckelman, vice president of the World Monuments Fund. ``After all,
we have no other space comparable to it at this scale but for Grand
Central. And we're going to be living with what's done now for a
long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to destroy it to rebuild it,'' said Hugh Hardy of Hardy
Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, the architect in charge of the
project, as he picked his way around python-thick coils of cables
spitting from gaping holes in the walls. Every stick of furniture,
wall fabric, lighting fixture and rug was cleaned, reupholstered or
entirely remade. Most significantly, the infrastructure was
completely overhauled. ``It was grotesque,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   The electrical wiring had fused with the insulation, the
acoustics were miserable and the light dimmers still relied on
old-fashioned vacuum tubes. The stage where Sinatra once sang was
notorious for microphone feedback.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken $30 million and 175 electricians just to rewire the
building and to add high-definition television and 32 new camera
positions for live-wire feeds. Starting after the first of the
year, expect to see frequent events and concerts broadcast ``live
from Radio City.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the premier-event ``Grand Reopening'' will be sold
starting Sept. 12. No one is saying yet who will be on the program
_ count on the 36 Rockettes kicking in two new dance numbers _ but
Dan Schoenberg, the director of publicity at Radio City
Entertainment, said management was talking to 10 to 12 ``A-list
celebrities.'' He tossed out the names Rosie O'Donnell, the
Eurythmics, Liza Minnelli and the kiddie-pop group 98 Degrees _
perhaps not everyone's idea of megawattage entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever they choose will enjoy new lighting that is three times
brighter than it used to be. The renovation now under way, the
music hall's third, is the most ambitious by far since Radio City
opened in 1932 as a vaudeville and movie theater _ an antidote to
the Depression.

   LOS GATOS, Calif. _ It was a work day, but not the usual kind
spent hunched in cubicles, 12 hours at a time, cooking up the next
big thing to change the world and send the stock soaring.
</P>
<P>
   This was a workday play day, or, in Silicon Valley terms,
off-site team-building time, and the 100 engineers from 3Com
Corp.'s Palm Computing division looked ready for it. They stepped
lightly off chartered buses from their corporate campus, 10 miles
away in Santa Clara, squinting into the sun. Most wore navy blue
company polo shirts, like summer campers on a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   Their hosts here at Campo di Bocce _ eight bocce courts, four
indoors and four outdoors, located at a former lumberyard _ were
well prepared. They had already set out tubs of soda and bottled
water, nestled in ice. The pomodoro and penne bolognese were ready
for the buffet table. And for the group's first lesson, Joe
Morelli, Campo di Bocce's general manager, knew just what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bocce,'' Morelli said, scanning the group, ``is a sport you
don't have to be an athlete to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that explains it. Or maybe not. Whatever the reason,
bocce, a 7,000-year-old cousin of lawn bowling best known as the
sport of old men from the old country (if that country happens to
be Italy), is becoming one of the hottest ways to team-build in the
team-charged atmosphere that rules Silicon Valley. This day, bocce
was team-building for 3Com. The next, Hewlett-Packard. The next,
Sun Microsystems. The next, Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been booked with tech companies almost every day
this summer,'' said Tom Albanese, a local cement contractor who
opened the courts two years ago. Campo di Bocce was a labor of
love, a homage to his ancestral home, Campo Basso, Italy, which
happens to be a mecca for the sport. ``I knew we'd get groups,''
Albanese said. ``I didn't know it would take off like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The things that charmed Albanese about bocce are the same things
that seem to charm computer geeks: it's easy to learn and both
competitive and social. Bocce is played with two teams of up to
four players each. A small ball (the pallino) is rolled down a 12-
by 90-foot (or sometimes 12- by 60-foot) court of packed dirt
topped by oyster shells (or gravel). Then each team takes turns
rolling its colored resin (or wooden) balls toward the small ball.
The team with the most balls closest to the small ball wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw whole families, three generations, playing in Italy,''
Albanese said. ``It was a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3Com crowd didn't take long to settle into the game. After
15 minutes, people were hooting and hollering, as if someone had
slam-dunked a basketball. And even when it was time to eat, two
teams opted to finish their games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is so great,'' said Sheryl McGrath, a Palm
Computing secretary who had set up the event. Last year, she said,
the group had spent a day at an indoor ``beach'' _ a warehouse set
up to feel like a beach, complete with beach sports _ and people
wanted another outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were asking, `Are we going to do something fun
again?''' Ms. McGrath said, ``and I had read about other companies
coming as a team-building activity.''
</P>
<P>
   As a social event, the day looked like an unqualified success.
Players who might have felt self-conscious about others watching
them as they tossed or slammed their balls into the netherworld,
instead of rolling them deftly down the court, had nothing to fret
about.
</P>
<P>
   Bocce is not the most scintillating game to watch, at least as
beginners play it. In fact, it's a lot like watching a clock. Those
not playing spent their time standing around the cool, cavernous
building or sitting outside at the patio tables, merrily chatting
away, oblivious of their clumsier comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Morelli spent his time gently handing out pointers. ``It's a lot
like putting,'' he would say, when someone tried pitching a ball
like Pedro Martinez. Or: ``Think of it as miniature golf. You have
to work in small strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   A few in the group had lost a little interest. Sasha Golovin, a
software engineer, was more absorbed with Palm Computing's newest
hand-held computer, the Palm VII.
</P>
<P>
   Golovin smirked a bit as someone who had obviously just scored
shouted a ``Yes!'' loud enough to echo across the floor. Bocce was
perfectly nice, he said, as he demonstrated how to get on the
Internet wirelessly with the Palm VII, ``but I think I prefer a
more physical sport.''

SOME COACHES CAN'T DECIDE ON A STARTING QB _ YET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michigan coach Lloyd Carr sounds as if he is singing the chorus
of a country song when he warbles that he is a one-quarterback guy.
Penn State's Joe Paterno gives the refrain a doo-wop flavor with
his Brooklyn accent. Nebraska's Frank Solich hums the harmony with
Midwest roots rock.
</P>
<P>
   But each has begun this college football season with a cheatin'
heart and a pair of passers they so far are reluctant to choose
between.
</P>
<P>
   Against Notre Dame on Saturday, Tom Brady led Michigan to two
first-quarter field goals, sat out the second quarter as backup
Drew Henson led another 3-point drive, then rallied the Wolverines
for 17 points and a 26-22 victory as the sole quarterback in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Carr said, the Wolverines, ranked seventh going into the
game by the Associated Press poll of writers and broadcasters, will
continue some type of rotation for at least their next two games,
against Rice and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to change what we're doing,'' he said. ``I've
always said I was a one-quarterback guy, but sometimes it's time to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 72-year-old Paterno is willing to throttle the
instincts that have won him 309 games, two national championships
and four undefeated but uncrowned teams.
</P>
<P>
   Before his 50th season at Penn State (and 34th as head coach),
before he unleashed an offense that has put up 111 points in two
games, Paterno acknowledged that he had a quandary in deciding
between Kevin Thompson, the senior captain, and the junior Rashard
Casey, a scrambler. But Paterno gave little indication how he would
solve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things aren't logical and as precise as some of you
folks might think,'' said Paterno, who has never played two
quarterbacks for a full season. ``A lot of this is by the seat of
the pants.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not any more definitive after Thompson and Casey rotated
series in the No. 2 Nittany Lions' 70-24 thrashing of Akron on
Saturday. Thompson started and was 5 of 8 passing for 188 yards and
two touchdowns; Casey finished 2 of 2 for 29 yards and a touchdown
and ran for another score.
</P>
<P>
   How long will they share time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Paterno said. ``They were both pretty good
today. I'm not trying to create any problems for myself by trying
to establish one guy as quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich was grateful he had two good quarterbacks when his
fifth-ranked Cornhuskers struggled to a 7-0 halftime lead against
Iowa. Bobby Newcombe had three first-half turnovers before
rebounding with a passing touchdown and two running scores in the
second half. He finished 7 of 10 for 128 yards and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   While Newcombe struggled early, his backup, Eric Crouch, ran for
Nebraska's first score, added two running touchdowns in the fourth
quarter and clicked off 92 yards on the ground and 68 in the air.
The result: Nebraska 42, Iowa 7.
</P>
<P>
   There are other tandems, too, early this season. Arizona is one
of the few teams committed to rotating quarterbacks _ Keith Smith
and Ortege Jenkins _ as it did last year. Ohio State coach John
Cooper said both of his young quarterbacks, Austin Moherman and
Steve Bellisari, would see time, as they did in the 23-12 loss on
Aug. 29 against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is startling to see so many top teams wrestling with
the most important position on the field, especially following a
season in which Tim Couch, Akili Smith, Donovan McNabb, Daunte
Culpepper and Cade McNown were selected in the first round of the
National Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of excellent quarterbacks leading teams _ the
best is perhaps Tennessee's Tee Martin, who threw for two
touchdowns and 159 yards to lead the defending national champion
Volunteers to a 42-17 victory over Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Heisman Trophy hopefuls Chris Redman and Drew
Brees. Louisville's Redman passed for 324 yards and five touchdowns
to beat Kentucky, 56-28, and Purdue's Brees was 26 of 43 for 273
yards and four touchdowns in a 47-13 victory over Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not in a quarterback rotation, there is a
perception that the coach does not believe either candidate can
play _ or at least that neither can be entrusted alone to drive a
team to a national championship. In the case of Michigan, Penn
State and Nebraska, each coach insists, however, that the summer
quarterback competition was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel it was fair to start one and not play the other
at all,'' Carr said. ``They competed well and hard against each
other.'' Against Notre Dame, ``I think they were both extremely
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carr might have indicated which way he was leaning when he
stuck with Brady in the second half against Notre Dame. Brady, a
senior, finished 17 for 24 for 197 yards; Henson, a sophomore, was
3 of 8 for 40 yards in his second-quarter appearance. Tight games
tend to make coaches abandon enlightenment for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, once Michigan, Penn State and Nebraska play their
toughest opponents, watch Carr, Paterno and Solich change their
tunes. It's a good bet there will be only one voice in the huddle.
And from the sideline, the coaches will revert to their favorite
song: ``Stand by Your Man.''

ADOPTIVE FATHER'S LOVE SUPPORTS A 15-YEAR FIGHT FOR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIM KOZLOWSKI and DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Tiffany was born with her umbilical cord
wrapped around her neck. The cord starved her brain of oxygen, with
devastating results.
</P>
<P>
   She had cerebral palsy. She couldn't see. She couldn't hear.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors predicted the baby girl would live only a few months.
She was headed to a group home because her mentally disabled mother
couldn't take care of her.
</P>
<P>
   That fate didn't sound fair to Roy Hutchison, a paramedic who
heard talk of Tiffany at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lock up prisoners _ you don't lock up children,'' he
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Within days Hutchison and his wife and son gave the baby a home.
</P>
<P>
   That was the fall of 1984. Hutchison has gotten divorced since
then. He's lost his son in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   But he's held on tight to Tiffany. The two live in a ranch home
in Oak Grove, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany, who will turn 15 next week, has the mind of an infant.
She can't walk or talk.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, 51, is a 6-foot-2-inch Harley biker with a ponytail
and 10 tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   And though Tiffany can't see, she knows his touch. She often
cries when others try to help her, but she calms quickly when she
feels his gentle strokes on her arm or cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's blindness doesn't stop her dad from wrapping her new
clothes in colorful gift paper.
</P>
<P>
   He gave her a home. She taught him about life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was _ a big, tough Harley rider, ridden thousands of
miles and taken bugs in the face at 65 miles per hour. Then calling
in sick because my foot hurt after a three-day ride,'' Hutchison
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know the pain she lives every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning when I leave for work, I give her a kiss and
tell her to have a good day. And each day, I know I may never see
her again. She's taught me how precious life is and how important
love is.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors marveled over the years as Tiffany survived her original
medical problems plus heart disease, a curved spine and severe
respiratory problems. She requires round-the-clock care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised her as long as she fights, I'll fight for her,''
Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when her little body gets tired of fighting, I'll
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that time is near.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of 1983, Tiffany's mother, 18, conceived a child.
</P>
<P>
   But she never knew she was pregnant. Her mind functioned at the
level of a 6-year-old's, and her pregnancy didn't show. On Sept.
16, 1984, Tiffany's mother was taken to Truman Medical Center with
pains thought to be appendicitis.
</P>
<P>
   She gave birth to a baby girl while she sat in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   One minute passed. No oxygen for the newborn. Another minute.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after four minutes, doctors unwrapped the umbilical
cord that had snaked around Tiffany's neck. They performed CPR.
</P>
<P>
   But the brain damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's mother didn't understand what had happened. To her,
the baby was like a doll she could play with when she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This was the story that state social workers told Hutchison when
he first learned about Tiffany at Truman Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison had just taken a patient there. His wife also happened
to be at Truman, doing some work for the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After talking it over with their son, they decided to become the
girl's foster parents, for however long she lived.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison remembers the first time he saw her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in a little basket. I thought she was beautiful,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Tiffany clung to life that winter, the bond between her and
the Hutchisons grew.
</P>
<P>
   They adopted her in 1986, just after her second birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple's marriage began to unravel. They divorced and
agreed to joint custody, with Tiffany living with Hutchison's
ex-wife. She corroborated his account but did not wish her comments
to be included in this story.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Hutchison's ex-wife wanted to put Tiffany in a home for
children with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   But just as when she was born, Roy Hutchison wouldn't stand for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People raise children,'' Hutchison said. ``You don't put them
in homes.''
</P>
<P>
   They battled in court, and Hutchison prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   He brought Tiffany home to live with him and his son, Chad.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Hutchison was asleep on the living room couch
when someone knocked on the door. He thought Chad, then 18, had
forgotten his keys.
</P>
<P>
   But a sheriff's deputy and a minister stood at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Chad had been killed in a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   He soon made a promise to Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my son died, that was a car accident, and he couldn't
call and say, `I'm in a car accident, can you be here?' ''
Hutchison said. ``I told Tiffany I would always be there for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for work, he seldom leaves her side. One of Tiffany's
lungs has failed, and doctors have told him that her heart is
working too hard.
</P>
<P>
   And the smiles that come when he strokes her arm are rarer now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her little heart will probably just quit some night,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes, though, that she survives until his Oct. 10 wedding,
at which he's expecting more than 1,000 biker friends who know him
as ``Hutch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to die with a mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, Hutchison dresses Tiffany, changes her diaper,
combs her long brown hair and brushes her teeth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she will start back to school at the Blue Springs
(Mo.) Special Services Center, a public school for severely
disabled students.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison works eight hours a day installing lights and fans for
The Fixture Gallery, a home fixture business in Blue Springs.
</P>
<P>
   A pager will alert him if Tiffany develops breathing problems,
seizures or coughing fits. Sometimes he leaves work early to meet
her at Children's Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes he doesn't match up to some people's perception of a
biker.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't smoke or drink. His choice of music is not
Steppenwolf, but George Jones. He dresses up like Santa Claus and
visits children with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   And he would take Tiffany along when he went on dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to know right up front that we're a package
deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he finds plenty of time for his motorcycle. He and Tiffany
are regulars at meetings of Harley owners.
</P>
<P>
   When Tiffany underwent surgery recently, Hutchison said, more
than 250 of the group's members donated blood.
</P>
<P>
   But she's never ridden on a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McKee, an assistant area director of the Missouri Division
of Family Services, commended Hutchison for what she called an
extraordinary dedication to a special child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a father who has a child born naturally that
would do the things he's done for her,'' McKee said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's worsening condition has tempered the joy of planning a
wedding for Hutchison and his fiancee, Eilene Brown. The two were
introduced by her sister, who worked next door to the place that
cared for Tiffany outside school hours.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knows Hutchison feels his daughter's pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffany has outlived all expectations because of his love,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison has been asked why he does it. What keeps him going
after years of doctor visits, seizures, hospital stays and
sleepless nights when he feared she would die?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hardship,'' Hutchison said. ``It's love. Tiffany
doesn't wake up in the morning and say she loves her dad. But when
I pick her up and carry her to the truck, it's like she hugs me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like she says, `Thanks, Dad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was 5 p.m. on a typical day during the school year that ended
last spring. Hutchison had just arrived at Caudell Specialized Care
in Independence, Mo., where Tiffany had spent time after school.
</P>
<P>
   A boy in a wheelchair stopped him to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how are you doing today?'' Hutchison said, reaching down
to touch the boy's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked over to Tiffany, who was lying on a recliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffany,'' Hutchison said, bending to hold her hands. ``How
was your day today?''
</P>
<P>
   She turned her head and lifted her upper body toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Hutchison carried Tiffany into their little house on a
cul-de-sac. He placed her on the living room couch and they began
their night together.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a sweat shirt and Joe Boxer pants, Tiffany sat with her
arms bent at the elbow and her fists clutched to her chest. A
pillow propped her head, which her spinal curvature has cocked to
the right.
</P>
<P>
   Her hazel eyes appeared to be gazing at a corner of the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison tended to chores. The home was filled with portraits
of him, Tiffany, his son and his motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Around 7 p.m., Hutchison carried Tiffany to bed. He adjusted the
pillow under her head and propped another underneath her knees.
</P>
<P>
   He stroked her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tiffany can't chew food, her father inserted a feeding
tube into her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany broke into a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a good mood tonight,'' Hutchison said, as he grabbed
Tiffany's hand. ``Do you want to play?''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany grinned, but soon began to cry. Hutchison cradled her
head in his hands, adjusted her pillow, massaged her legs.
</P>
<P>
   When Tiffany continued to fidget, he fetched a handheld massager
to use on her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany calmed. He waited a few minutes, then pulled a blanket
over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about if I let you rest for a while and then I'll come
back in and check on you?'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holler if you need anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutch, the tough, old biker, is never far away from his little
girl.

PRESBOOK (undated) _ On Tuesday, Arizona Sen. John McCain will make
some New York book-tour appearances that strongly resemble campaign
opportunities to boost him in the race for the GOP presidential
nomination. It's not an uncommon event. But to some observers, it
also raises questions about whether the mix of book publicizing and
political preening has gone too far, whether publishers are
improperly, even illegally, helping underwrite campaigns. McCain is
not the only candidate who has piggybacked a book on his campaign.
The Federal Election Commission advises campaigns that if
publishers pay for a book tour closely tied to a campaign, it could
could be considered a corporate contribution to the campaign.
Corporate contributions to presidential campaigns are illegal. By

   ``A STAR CALLED HENRY'' &QL; 
By Roddy Doyle (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll forgive us if we cut to the chase: This is one of the
best novels we've read all year, and better than Doyle's previous
books, although they were fine indeed. It's broader, richer than
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' and less introspective than the somber
``The Woman Who Walked into Doors.'' Doyle's narrator is Henry
Smart, who tells us the story of the first 20 years of his life. He
begins just before the turn of the century with the meeting of his
parents, a teenage maker of rosary beads and a one-legged bouncer
who turns lowlifes away from a Dublin brothel. They are doomed, and
we know it _ babies arrive sick and die, poverty closes in, and we
see their love fade into the dirt and disease of the Dublin slums.
But before it does, Henry Smart is born, handsome, inexplicably
healthy and full of a promise that is too bright for such a dark
place. By the time he is 5, he is living on the streets, smart but
illiterate, and aware of his own gritty charm. When he is 14, he
takes part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and later becomes a
terrorist for the Irish Republican Army. Through it all, Henry's
savvy, rock-confident voice gathers us in. We know he is telling us
a true story, and yet at the same time spinning a tale _ he
survived childhood, after all, by dazzling and conning the adults
around him. In the end, ``A Star Called Henry'' is not just a novel
about one man but about Ireland itself, from a gifted writer who
knows that misery and laughter are not strangers to one another,
and that even the most rancorous place is not a hell if dreams are
still alive there. This is the first volume of a trilogy that will
take readers through modern Irish history by way of the life of
Henry Smart _ and won't we be glad to see him again. &QL;

   ``He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers
how much it hurts,' '' John Mackey said. ``He lived by that
philosophy and I always followed that advice.'' Mackey was talking
about Jim Brown, the Cleveland Browns' offensive powerhouse from
1957 to 1965 and the man this book calls ``the greatest pure runner
in the history of the NFL.'' Brown is top dog on the list of the
100 best football players of all time, compiled by editors of the
``Sporting News.'' Unlike its counterpart, last year's ``Baseball's
100 Greatest Players,'' this volume doesn't dabble much in the
early days, although the list has Jim Thorpe (at No. 88), Bronko
Nagurski (35), Don Hutson (6) and Otto Graham (7). Among the top 10
are Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Johnny Unitas, Lawrence Taylor and
Dick Butkus. There are photos and a brief overview of each player's
career, and it's all football _ there's only a mention of the
acting career for which Brown left the game at 29, and no notice at
all of O.J. Simpson's retirement activities. Best of all are ``Top
10'' lists (they range from ``Best Players I've Ever Seen'' to
``Defensive Linemen I Admire'' and ``Smartest Quarterbacks'')
solicited from some of the great players themselves, including
Merlin Olsen, Deacon Jones, Charley Taylor, Lance Alworth, Jack Ham
and Troy Aikman. Clear some time before you pick this one up,
because you won't put it down any time soon. &QL;

   ``THE RIGHT SET'' &QL; 
Edited by Caryl Phillips (Vintage, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We began to enjoy this anthology of writings on tennis round
about Page 45, when James Thurber suddenly appeared and described,
delightfully, the 1926 match between France's Suzanne Lenglen and
American Helen Wills, which caught the world's attention at the
time (Thurber's piece is followed by an essay from Wills herself,
which is also great fun). Earlier essays on the history of the game
have interesting titles (``Lawn Tennis: The Sturdy Bastard'') but
are for tennis zealots. For a more general audience, Phillips
includes excerpts from books by John McPhee, Arthur Ashe, Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Althea Gibson, and writings on
Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker and Andre Agassi. There's
a section on tennis etiquette, with a preponderance of attention
paid to the nasty demeanor of the young John McEnroe, although
there's a short essay by Martin Amis in which those other bad boys,
Connors and Ilie Nastase, are mentioned. It ends with a few pages
from Alistair Cooke, titled ``My Life with Gabriela Sabatini,''
which are blissfully free of bad manners _ just what tennis should
be. &QL;

   ``The best writer may not follow every rule every time,''
O'Conner says, ``but they follow most of them most of the time. And
even if you're a Tolstoy or a Balzac, a Thurber or a McPhee, it
doesn't hurt to learn the rules before you break them.'' O'Conner
was an editor at the ``New York Times Book Review'' before she
wrote her first book, the very popular ``Woe Is I: The
Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English.'' Now,
she's a self-described ``grammar maven'' (she's kidding) who
sometimes writes the ``Times' ''``On Language'' column when William
Safire is on vacation. She's obviously following her own advice _
know your audience _ because her approach to words and writing is
as engaging as it is authoritative, and she quotes lots of her
(and, presumably, your) favorite writers. Her justification for
writing this book, oddly enough, is the Internet _ we're all
writing more now that we have laptops and send e-mail, so we need
to brush up our skills. But truly, no hook was necessary. O'Conner
can be our grammar maven any day. &QL;

HERITAGE OF GOLD PROVES HER CUP FUTURE IS ON THE GRASS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ She is a 4-year-old filly named
Heritage of Gold, and she has been knocking on the door of
Breeders' Cup opportunity all year. Sunday, the door opened.
</P>
<P>
   One month after her five-race winning streak was broken by last
year's 3-year-old champion filly, Banshee Breeze, Heritage of Gold
resumed her run of success Sunday when she won the $300,000 Diana
Handicap at Saratoga by one length over Irish filly Khumba Mela.
And if the Diana was a prelude to the Breeders' Cup race for
fillies and mares on the turf, which will be run for the first time
in November, then Heritage of Gold positioned herself for a shot at
even greater success.
</P>
<P>
   She not only won a scramble down the homestretch but also outran
Mossflower, the speed demon who is making a comeback from a year's
absence forced by arthritic ankles and who finished third. And for
a real coup, Heritage of Gold buried Soaring Softly, who came into
the race with a winning streak of five but left it as the beaten
favorite in fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant thing for Heritage of Gold may be her
versatility. She has won five races on grass, five on dirt. And her
jockey, Shane Sellers, saw a strategic edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``On dirt, she may be just a notch below Banshee Breeze,'' he
said. ``But on grass, she's a different mare. And on grass, you
don't run into the likes of Banshee Breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Amoss, who took over Heritage of Gold's training from Steve
Asmussen this summer, agreed that he had one goal in mind for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make sure she's healthy tomorrow,'' he said,
``and then sit down and map out a plan that leads to the Breeders'
Cup.'' He hopes to have the plan by midweek.
</P>
<P>
   Amoss made no bones about avoiding Banshee Breeze and Beautiful
Pleasure, who outran Heritage of Gold in the Go For Wand Stakes one
month ago. ``I didn't want to face the two fillies we ran against
last time,'' he said. ``I learned a lot from her last race. We
decided in the paddock that we were just going to let her be
comfortable wherever she might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Heritage of Gold ran the 1 1/8 miles in a speedy 1:45 4/5, only
two-fifths of a second off the track record, in defeating Khumba
Mela, who saved second place by a head over Mossflower. The winner
paid $13.80 for a $2 bet to win and earned $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mossflower, who stalked the fast early pace before closing with
a burst, drew praise from her trainer, Rich Schosberg. Since
starting her comeback two months ago, she has run second, fourth
and third. ``She never gave up, and it was a superb effort,''
Schosberg said. ``She really came on again in the last few yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Schosberg said he would run Mossflower in the $500,000 Flower
Bowl at Belmont Park on Oct. 2. And Christophe Clement, who trains
Khumba Mela, said that ``she ran a great race to be second,'' but
that he was not sure where he would place her for an encore.

   NEW YORK _ With sentiments ranging from exasperation to
bewilderment, several New York Hispanic political leaders sharply
criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton Sunday for calling on her husband
to withdraw his offer of clemency to 16 imprisoned members of a
Puerto Rican terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   The most outspoken reaction was from U.S. Rep. Jose E. Serrano,
a Bronx Democrat who is one of three Puerto Rican members of
Congress. Serrano said he felt ``grave disappointment and anger''
at what he called her ``intervention'' in the issue, and said he
was withdrawing his support for Mrs. Clinton's all-but-announced
candidacy for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In his criticism, Serrano echoed the concerns of several other
Puerto Rican politicians in the city who chastised Mrs. Clinton not
only for taking a position contrary to one they hold passionately
but also for doing so without consulting any of the state's
Hispanic political leaders, who are expected to be a bulwark of her
campaign for the Senate..
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rescinding my encouragement of her candidacy,'' Serrano
said in an interview. ``Because to me, this is as important as
Ireland is to the Irish, Israel to the Jews. The first lady did not
take one minute to try to understand the pain. This is an action
that will make people go out and make sure that she's not our next
senator. Maybe it's time to go out and find out who else is
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr., a Bronx Democrat, did not go so far
as to reject a Clinton Senate bid, but he, too, expressed
disappointment. ``It's disheartening to see her take this
position,'' he said. ``I hope, at the very least, that the support
of the Puerto Rican leadership is not being taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that they don't think that Puerto Ricans are
automatically going to come out for her just because she is a
Democrat. I think there needs to be some dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a point made forcefully by Serrano. ``I am the
longest-serving Puerto Rican official in the history of the state
of New York,'' he said. ``That merits a call to say, `This is what
I was planning to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton called on the president to
immediately withdraw his offer of clemency for 16 members of a
Puerto Rican organization, the Armed Forces of National Liberation,
commonly known as the FALN, the initials for the Spanish rendering
of its name. Last month Clinton offered to reduce their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The organization was involved in more than 100 bombings in the
United States during the 1970s and 1980s. But the 16 members at
issue were themselves never linked to crimes involving death or
injury, and the White House has said that the president considers
their sentences, some of them prison terms of more than 50 years,
to be out of proportion to their offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it had set a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday for
the prisoners to meet the conditions set by the president. But Mrs.
Clinton said that those conditions were too generous.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate
exploratory committee, said that the first lady ``has great respect
for Congressman Serrano, but she believes that three weeks is more
than enough time for the prisoners to accept the terms of the
clemency and to renounce violence.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was widespread dissatisfaction among Hispanic politicians
to Mrs. Clinton's position. Many said they were bewildered by her
willingness to engage in a public disagreement with the president
and to enter the thorny topic of Puerto Rican politics.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton said she had no involvement in or prior
knowledge of her husband's decision to offer clemency, several
Hispanic politicians nonetheless criticized her for taking what
they called a political position aimed at courting more
conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   Several criticized the first lady for taking her stance several
weeks after the clemency offer and further criticized her for
belatedly espousing a view similar to that of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who is expected to be her Republican opponent in next
year's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton following Rudy Giuliani's lead,'' said city
Councilman Jose Rivera, a Bronx Democrat, in a telephone interview
from Puerto Rico. ``If she is doing that, she might want to
consider _ when she does move in to the state and registers to vote
_ voting for Giuliani for senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Some criticism of Mrs. Clinton was more measured. A spokesman
for Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president said that Ferrer
``believes that Mrs. Clinton has acted prematurely.'' The
spokesman, Clint Roswell, said that Ferrer's position was that the
prisoners ``should be given an opportunity to respond formally to
the president's offer of clemency. Once they respond, then we'll
see what will happen.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An unemployed woman who donated a kidney to a young
boy but was left homeless when she was evicted from a public
housing project in Alexandria, Va., has been offered her own place
to live.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Marian Neal, has been staying in a homeless shelter
since she was kicked out of the housing project, where she had been
staying in a friend's apartment. Managers of the project said Ms.
Neal's presence violated the friend's lease, and a complaint had
been filed.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, after Ms. Neal's ordeal had been widely
publicized in the Washington media for weeks, Andrew Cuomo, the
secretary of housing and urban development, said his department
would lease Ms. Neal a recently renovated one-bedroom town house in
Washington. The rent will be based on her income, which Ms. Neal
said made the town house affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a heroine who should be treated decently,'' Cuomo told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   William Dearman, executive director of the Alexandria
Redevelopment and Housing Authority, which runs the housing project
on the edge of Alexandria's Old Town neighborhood, said he had been
unfairly cast as the heavy because he had evicted Ms. Neal. But he
defended his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great thing that she did,'' Dearman said,
``donating a kidney to this kid. But, you know, we have rules in
this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neal said she had no hard feelings for whoever turned her
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for them,'' she said. ``We feel no anger.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have met Ms. Neal say they come away impressed by her
spirituality and her stoicism, beneath which lies a sharp sense of
public relations. That has helped her collect donations, but she is
still living in Carpenter's Shelter, a place for the homeless in
Alexandria, a Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marian has done most of her own publicity on this,'' said
Frances Becker, executive director of Carpenter's Shelter.
</P>
<P>
   There have been news features on three of Washington's four
major television stations. When a Washington radio station, WRQX,
told of the eviction of a woman who had donated a kidney, listeners
called in pledges of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ms. Neal sat in the living room of her friend's
apartment and talked about her decision to donate her kidney last
year to Terrance Varner, now 8, who lives in the Old Town
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She said she began helping Terrance's grandmother take care of
him last year by taking the youngster, who suffered from renal
failure, to dialysis treatments three times a week. Terrance was on
a long waiting list for a new kidney.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Neal learned that none of Terrance's family members
were suitable kidney donors, she offered one of hers. Even though
they were not related, she was found to be a close match. The
transplant was a success and Terrance is doing well, Ms. Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Spieldenner, a spokesman for the United Network for Organ
Sharing in Richmond, Va., said that of the 4,038 kidneys donated by
living donors last year, just 163, or 4 percent, were from people
unrelated to the recipients by either blood or marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neal, 40, is from Philadelphia, where she worked in
hospitals as a housekeeper and then sorted packages for Federal
Express. She said she had to stop working in 1994 because of a
degenerative back disease that has forced her to use a cane to get
around.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she was not receiving Social Security disability
payments, Ms. Neal said she was appealing a decision in which her
application for benefits had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right,'' she said when asked if she harbored any ill
feelings toward the person who had made that decision. ``Everything
that happens in life, it's all for the good of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision meant that she was forced to live on the $210 a
month that she received from the city welfare agency in Alexandria
and $120 a month in food stamps, which led her to move into the
tiny but well-kept apartment of Patrice Hall, whom she describes as
``my sister in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Ms. Neal and Ms. Hall provided Bible study,
tutoring and arts and crafts for the children in the housing
project, Ms. Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Dearman of the housing authority said he had offered to allow
Ms. Hall to sign a new lease with Ms. Neal as the official
co-tenant, but she had declined. As a result, Ms. Neal had to go to
the bottom of a list of applicants for public housing in the city
and turn to the homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 60 people on the waiting list ahead of her,''
Dearman said. ``Some of them are homeless. Would it be right to put
her ahead because she is a kidney donor? Sometimes there are hard
decisions that have to be made.''

UCLA DEFENSE GOES BACK TO BASICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's defense is like commodity prices: Past
performance does not guarantee future results, so step carefully.
Translated, the Bruins' dominating performance against Boise State
means nothing Saturday at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes have two superb tailbacks (Michael Wiley and
Jonathan Wells), they have a massive offensive line and, perhaps
most telling, they have video of the UCLA-Miami and UCLA-Wisconsin
games. After watching the Badgers and Hurricanes gain 1,186 yards
on UCLA, the Buckeyes probably expect to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, it'll have everything to do with talent and
experience and little to do with strategy and execution. That's the
difference between UCLA '98 and UCLA '99. Last year, the Bruins
didn't have a clue; this year, they have a plan, and they are
organized.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation began when embattled defensive coordinator
Nick Aliotti bolted for Oregon and assistant Bob Field became the
new defensive boss. (Actually, he's the new-old defensive boss,
having served 14 years as defensive coordinator under Terry
Donahue.)
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti treated the Bruins like the NFL veterans he coached in
St. Louis from 1995-97, installing numerous defenses at an
incomprehensible rate. Dazed and confused, the Bruins mulled every
assignment and lost critical reaction time. The results were
wide-open receivers (Stanford, Oregon State) and gaping holes for
runners to exploit (Miami, Wisconsin).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Bruins devoted so much time to learning the
defenses they had nothing left over for fundamentals like shedding
blocks and tackling. Of course they couldn't tackle in games. They
didn't tackle in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Field and head coach Bob Toledo made sure not to repeat
Aliotti's mistake. They treated spring practice like elementary
math _ making sure the Bruins could multiply by 2 before moving to
3. Field spent the entire first week implementing his base defense,
deployed when an offense uses the standard two running backs, one
tight end and two receivers.
</P>
<P>
   That's more complicated than it seems. Each time a receiver goes
in motion, for instance, the defense must respond by changing its
assignments. Add formations that feature three receivers, four
receivers, one running back or two tight ends, and suddenly the
defense is responsible for dozens of assignments each week. Field
had 50 defenses prepared for Saturday's game alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built a good foundation that first week of spring practice,
then began to add the pieces,'' Field said. ``You have to start
with the elementary approach, but eventually you have to move on to
junior high, high school and college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the most important thing was adding pieces at the
right time. We didn't want to overload the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Field implemented 70 percent of the defensive playbook in spring
practice, which carved training camp time for fundamentals. The
linemen practiced pass-rush techniques and shedding blocks. The
defensive backs practiced footwork and locating the ball. And
always, Field made sure each player knew where he was supposed to
be every play. He also honed the substitution pattern so the Bruins
wouldn't repeat their 1998 mistake of having 10 men on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole approach with the players has been to make them
confident about the basics, like recognizing formations, so they
can just react and play,'' Field said. ``If you have to think,
you're paralyzed out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: UCLA's second-quarter interceptions by Julius Williams and
Joey Strycula occurred on consecutive series, not consecutive plays
as was reported in some of Sunday's editions.

USC'S FOX KEEPS BUSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ USC's most versatile player against Hawaii had to be
senior John Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In the 62-7 rout of Hawaii before 50,000 at Aloha Stadium, Fox
played special teams, participated as a reserve at middle
linebacker and took the final snaps at quarterback for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' said USC quarterback Carson Palmer. ``That's
just the type of guy he is. I think that's what is special about
this team. We have a senior class full of guys willing to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox started nine games at quarterback for the Trojans in 1997,
before trying tight end and then linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking for joy: For the first time in several years, it appears
USC may have a reliable kicking game. Sophomore David Newbury
kicked a 48-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 34-yarder in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant coach) Shawn Slocum asked me and I really hesitated
on the first one,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``But Newbury
responded beautifully. The kicker was a big question that got
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbury won the placekicking job over David Bell on Wednesday,
although Bell continues to handle kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong sinks: About the only player not leaving Hawaii in good
spirits was sophomore tailback Frank Strong, who fumbled twice in
six carries.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Strong five fumbles in only 43 career carries,
something that drew the ire of Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot fumble the football,'' Hackett said. ``You cannot
play at USC if you don't hang onto the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbet hurt: Freshman walk-on Kevin Arbet was set to make a
heralded debut by starting as the nickel back, but early in the
game, Arbet suffered a sprained ankle and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Chad Pierson also suffered an ankle injury and was
forced to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen play: USC used seven true freshmen in the game: wide
receivers Marcell Allmond, Kareem Kelly and Steve Stevenson,
defensive tackle Bernard Riley, linebacker Troy Polamalu, defensive
end Omar Nazel and Arbet.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic woes: Even with a police escort, USC arrived at Aloha
Stadium about 25 minutes late, because game traffic clogged the
surface streets around the stadium. The announced crowd of 50,000
was Hawaii's first sellout since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: USC's margin of victory was the largest in a
season opener since a 76-0 win over UCLA in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Trojans' biggest win since 1994, when they defeated
Cal 61-0 and most points scored since USC had 66 against Utah State
in 1989.

FORMER HOUSING SECRETARY GOES ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Henry Cisneros, a former Cabinet officer in the
Clinton administration, goes on trial in federal court here on
Tuesday in what is almost certain to be the last major trial of the
two-decades-long grand experiment of the independent-counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, a former mayor of San Antonio who was once believed to
have a bright political future, faces 18 felony counts on charges
that he lied to federal investigators about the amount of money he
paid over the years to a former mistress in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The charges do not concern the existence of a mistress while he
was married; that is something he acknowledged publicly in San
Antonio years before he accepted the post as housing secretary. The
charges do not involve the payments he made, which he acknowledged
to investigators and to the Clinton administration. Neither is a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The charges for which he could face up to 90 years in jail
involve his telling agents of the FBI that he had paid the woman,
Linda Jones, about $60,000 over the years, when the evidence is
strong that the actual figure was closer to $250,000, and that he
had asked two assistants to help him in the deception.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution case will feature tape recordings that Ms. Jones
made of their telephone conversations after Cisneros was offered a
job in President Clinton's Cabinet. The tapes, which deal
occasionally with the payments, mostly lay out a familiar tale of
former lovers awkwardly testing each other's loyalty. Cisneros
repeatedly expresses fear that Ms. Jones could betray and ruin him,
and she says she is worried that she will be cut off financially.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their pledges on the tapes to never do those things, in
the end that is exactly what they did.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is set to begin on Tuesday for a trial that
encapsulates for many the peculiar nature of the
independent-counsel law, born after Watergate and allowed to die
this summer by a Congress wearied by what the law had produced,
notably Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous attention given to Starr's investigation probably
shielded the Cisneros investigation from scrutiny by the law's
critics.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of commentators have noted that the law provided
for a single prosecutor to focus on one person with few practical
limits on expenditures. In such a situation, the critics have said,
there is an inherent and unhealthy incentive for the prosecutor to
spend a great amount of time and money to find something worth
prosecuting.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in the Cisneros case, David Barrett, has spent an
estimated $10 million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   The law was also supposed to divorce politics from the
prosecution of officials high in the executive branch by
transferring decisions from the Justice Department to the
independent counsel. But few now argue that the law has
accomplished that goal, as each investigation has produced a major
political debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cisneros case, Barrett, because of his background, has
seemed to many a strange choice to investigate a Democratic housing
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Washington lawyer is a well-known Republican
fund-raiser who prospered greatly by lobbying the Department of
Housing and Urban Development when it was controlled by Republicans
before Cisneros' tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who has never been accused of wrongdoing in his
dealings with the housing agency, was nonetheless mentioned
repeatedly in a 1990 report by a House subcommittee titled ``Abuse
and Mismanagement at HUD'' in which he was depicted as a lobbyist
who successfully used access to friends at the agency to win
grants.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980 presidential campaign, Barrett headed the group
Lawyers for Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   At some point early in the Clinton administration, lawyers and
congressional aides said, Barrett asked a friend to have his name
forwarded to Judge David Sentelle, the chief judge of the panel
that appointed special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett declined to comment on his role as a lobbyist or on how
he came to the attention of Sentelle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One notable feature of the Cisneros case is that prosecutors are
using as their main witness against him his former mistress, who
has been branded a liar by those same prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, once known as Linda Medlar, now goes by the name
Linda Jones and is serving a term of 42 months in federal prison on
a variety of charges related to the Cisneros case. She hopes, her
lawyers have said, to have her jail time reduced by cooperating
with prosecutors who are trying to convict Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors demonstrated that Ms. Jones lied about the
audiotapes of her telephone conversations with Cisneros, a pillar
of the Cisneros prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones repeatedly told prosecutors the tapes were originals,
but they were in fact copies that had been altered in parts.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stanley Sporkin, who will preside over the trial, which is
expected to last longer than a month, has ruled that most of the
audiotapes may be admitted as evidence, even though many have been
tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to discussions of their affair and his payments to
her on the tapes, Cisneros makes some embarrassing and critical
remarks about President-elect Clinton, at the same time that he was
offered the job in the Clinton Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   On the tapes, Cisneros is heard telling Ms. Jones that Clinton
is the kind of cheerful politician ``who can't seem to decide hard
things'' and is ``willing to do a deal with the business
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the conversations about their relationship, she warns him
on one occasion: ``Honey, I'm as smart as they come. I know exactly
what would sink you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros tells her on another occasion that if the payments come
up at his confirmation hearing he would ``tell them what we
agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only person in the world who can sink me at that point
_ and I mean serious, I'm talking contempt of Congress, jail _ is
you,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ms. Jones sold about a third of the 40 hours of tapes
she made to a tabloid television program for $15,000. The program,
``Inside Edition,'' distributed transcripts after its broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   That broadcast led Attorney General Janet Reno to start a
preliminary inquiry into Cisneros' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to seek the inquiry that led to Barrett's
appointment might have foreshadowed some of the current tension
between Reno and Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said at the time the tapes were
disclosed that Freeh had pressed vigorously for an
independent-counsel investigation of Cisneros. The officials said
that Freeh was indignant that Cisneros might have lied to FBI
agents who conducted interviews about payments to Jones and said it
would set a bad example to treat that lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, the officials said, had expected that an independent
counsel would judge the matter too small for a full-scale
prosecution and that it would be over in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who resigned from the Cabinet in 1994, is now the
president of Univision, the Spanish-language television network
based in Los Angeles.

USC GETS THE RIGHT ANSWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ The traffic tie-ups this weekend around the city were
enough to give USC coach Paul Hackett fits. USC was late to
practice Friday and the game on Saturday from the congestion.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hawaii fans could have been a little more generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough crowd,'' Hackett said. ``The guy behind me
yelled, `You can't use these points for UCLA!'''
</P>
<P>
   But when those are the worst things you experience on the road,
it has to be considered a pretty good trip. And USC's 62-7 victory
over Hawaii was about as good as it could get for a season opener.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't really a single moment that defined the game,
because the Trojans simply dominated the Rainbow Warriors, scoring
on their first six possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before that I think we'll be a better team than last
year,'' Hackett said. ``It's one thing to say it and one to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans did it Saturday night, and for those who couldn't
stay up late in Los Angeles, there were plenty of highlights.
</P>
<P>
   _Quarterback Carson Palmer demonstrated that he has improved
significantly from last season, completing 14 of 16 passes for 167
yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was in slow motion for me compared to last year,''
Palmer said. ``This win gives us tons of confidence. It shows this
offense does work.''
</P>
<P>
   _Wide receiver was supposed to be a thin position, but it just
might be the Trojans' most exciting. R. Jay Soward had a fairly
quiet start, suffering a mild ankle sprain. But Windrell Hayes
caught seven passes and the freshmen met all expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Kelly had a wonderful debut, with 104 yards receiving,
and Hackett singled out Marcell Allmond for his catch-and-run after
having his helmet torn off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told people about our freshmen, but they didn't believe
me,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young receiving staff stood up and made plays,'' Hackett
added.
</P>
<P>
   _The secondary passed its first test. Even with freshmen Darrell
Rideaux and Kevin Arbet hurt, this group held together. Kris
Richard, Eric Reese and a sore-ankled Tanqueray Clark all played a
part in shutting down Hawaii's passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preseason doubters were there and I never paid attention
to them,'' said Richard, who had an interception and fumble
recovery. ``It's so satisfying. There never was a single doubt I
was prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   _Linebackers apparently still make big plays, even without Chris
Claiborne. JC transfer Markus Steele certainly made an impression.
He returned a fumble 46 yards for a touchdown and tipped the pass
that Richard intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Steele still needs work stopping the run, but who wants to hear
complaints after a 55-point victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a defense couldn't ask for anything more,'' strong
safety David Gibson said. ``A shutout pretty much says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Hawaii's only points came when Mike Van Raaphorst's
pass was intercepted by Quincy LeJay, who returned it for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   So where does this leave the Trojans after one game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there still doubters out there?'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   He then proceeded to answer his own question.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to say, `Well, it's Hawaii... but for us to
get out and play like that against Hawaii, it was a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gibson, who was so excited during the game that he was
actually talking trash to Hawaii's receivers, settled down
afterward to put it into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say we're great because we beat Hawaii,'' Gibson
said. ``We've got to take it for what it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   It means the Trojans are 1-0, which feels a lot better than 0-1.
The opponent might have lost its 19th straight game, but USC will
savor any victory, especially following the Sun Bowl disaster. The
Trojans were supposed to have won that game, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one game, but it's an important game because it's on
the road,'' Hackett said.

TURF IS ARTIFICIAL, METROSTARS' DESPAIR IS BONA FIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The MetroStars have been disintegrating
piece by piece over the past two months. After Sunday's 2-1 loss to
the Chicago Fire, their 12th consecutive defeat, and a knee injury
to their best player, Sasa Curcic, the MetroStars' playoff hopes
all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 22nd loss in 27 games for the MetroStars, who played
in a persistent drizzle Sunday at Giants Stadium. Three days ago
the grass field was removed and the artificial turf field brought
back.
</P>
<P>
   MetroStars coach Bora Milutinovic didn't appear to be quite
surprised when it was suggested that his team had all the
ingredients to go without a victory for the rest of the season,
which has five games remaining. Milutinovic must have been thinking
of all the defensive mishaps that have been the primary reason for
the losing streak and his smile revealed more pain than joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is not over,'' Milutinovic said, ``but our
situation is getting more difficult every day. We have to work hard
to resolve this problem. If you have confidence, everything is
easy, but I'm not sure we have confidence. We took the lead in four
of the last six games and we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Mark Semioli, who was primarily responsible for
Chicago's winning goal when he slipped in his attempt to clear the
ball at the top of his penalty area, looked dejected as he sat in
front of his locker in the dressing room after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where we're a very dispirited team,''
Semioli said. ``We don't seem to find solutions to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Semioli could have added that the MetroStars seem more adept at
finding ways to lose. At least once in every game during the losing
streak someone on defense has made a mistake that has led to a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Khakpour, the Iranian international who is the team's
most consistent defender, is his own most severe critic. He rarely
points fingers at anyone, always blaming the team collectively for
any misfortune. ``We seem to make the same mistake, and we don't
learn,'' Khakpour said. ``When you lose, you have to learn from
mistakes and we don't. I'm as guilty as anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The artificial turf was most likely the guilty party in the
injury to Curcic, who tore the meniscus in his right knee. There
was no one around him when he was injured, almost the same way that
Wayne Chrebet of the Jets broke his foot Friday night. An official
diagnosis of Curcic's injury will be made after further examination
in a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   When Eduardo Hurtado scored his first goal since May 29 to give
the MetroStars a 1-0 lead in the 60th minute, the pain the
MetroStars and most in the crowd of 8,905 felt for losing Curcic
disappeared. It was the only bright spot of the day for the
MetroStars, who have only one game left here, against San Jose on
Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Dema Kovalenko tied it for the Fire in the 69th minute, 11
minutes after he had entered as a substitute. Lubos Kubik gave
Chicago (15-11), the defending Major League Soccer champion, the
victory in the 73rd minute, when Semioli's slip allowed Kubik to go
in alone on Tim Howard.

   LOS ANGELES _ Memo to Los Angeles city council folk who continue
to insist they're still lookin' out for our best interests:
Continue your no-public-funding stance with the NFL. That Sept. 15
``drop dead'' deadline next week for a decision will be the perfect
day for us to tell them to drop... y' know... dead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have another pro football proposition that we're
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, a guy in the Midwest will introduce the Women's
Professional Football League _ WPFL _ starting with two teams, the
Minnesota Vixens and the Lake Michigan Minx.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a $50,000 franchise fee and $15,000 in annual dues.
And if it flies after the first year, they want to expand to six
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you: The Los Angeles Lushes.
</P>
<P>
   Our guess is the fine citizens of L.A. will find a way to fund
it. With anonymous, unsolicited donations, of course.
</P>
<P>
   We'll keep you abreast....
</P>
<P>
   Peter King, that Sports Illustrated reporter who butts his way
on for airtime on CNN/SI, was talking about what a waste NFL
exhibition games are and used the example of the St. Louis Rams
losing quarterback Trent Green in a meaningless game against San
Diego two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their owner, Georgia Frontiere made $800k on that preseason
game,'' King pointed out. ``You think she'd give back that $800k to
have their quarterback of the future back?''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia? Nope. She'll just tell Dick Vermeil to try a little
cosmetic surgery on the depth chart....
</P>
<P>
   Before the new Cleveland Browns' opener Sunday, Drew Carey is
going to lead the new Dawg Pound in a version of the ``Cleveland
Rocks'' song and then do the team intros.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a game on ESPN. Yes, Carey's show is on ABC....
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-nine of the 114 Division I-A football schools play on
grass fields this year, up from 73 (of 112) last year. Colorado,
Oregon State, UNLV and Vanderbilt switched, and Houston doesn't
play in the Astrodome anymore....
</P>
<P>
   For the going rate of having a free-swinging .235-hitting backup
outfielder for one season, Rupert Murdoch gives $10 mil to help
build a Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder about the Dodgers' priorities....
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips has a job, and 22 guys whose best interests he's
supposed to have in mind don't. You make the call....
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones can run, but she can't hide.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when track and field needs her leadership, she's
quietly quit to prepare for the 2000 Summer Games, which begin in
about 375 days.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Globe track and field writer Barbara Huebner analyzed the
dichotomy that Jones finds herself in. Despite the fact many see
her as ``the potential savior of track and field in the United
States,'' the buzz on the Internet is that she's setting herself up
for failure by proclaiming her intentions to win multiple gold
medals so forthrightly.
</P>
<P>
   Huebner quotes Craig Masback, the CEO of USA Track &AMP; Field:
``She has the opportunity to be the first woman on a global scale
to transcend sport. Pele did it. Muhammad Ali did it. Michael
Jordan did it. No woman has ever done it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he also points out: ``Marion has no responsibility for
the sport. It's no individual's responsibility to save, rescue,
build, whatever other term you want to use....'' &QL;

WHEN IN ROME, DO WHAT JOHNSON DID
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 6, 1960: Former UCLA star Rafer Johnson defeats his best
friend and former Bruins teammate C.K. Yang in the Olympic
decathlon during the Rome Games. Yang, of Taiwan, won seven of the
10 events, but Johnson racked up an Olympic-record 8,392 points to
win by 58 points. Johnson scored easy wins in the shot put, discus
and javelin to make up for the other non-first-place finishes. (41)
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 6, 1970: Before what's believed to be the largest crowd to
see a sporting event in Southern California _ 180,223 _ the
California 500 breaks in the new $25 million speedway 40 miles east
of downtown Los Angeles called the Ontario Motor Speedway. Jim
McElreath wins the race against the likes of Al Unser (who led for
166 laps), Mario Andretti, A.J. Foyt and Dan Gurney.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 6, 1996: The Dodgers' Hideo Nomo throws a 9-0 no-hitter
against the Colorado Rockies in Denver, walking four and striking
out eight _ and pitching from the stretch the entire game to keep
his balance on a rain-drenched night.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 7, 1970: At Del Mar, Bill Shoemaker passes Johnny Longden
on the all-time wins list for jockeys with No. 6,033.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 7, 1957: Los Angeles Angels slugger Steve Bilko pounds out
a team-record 56th home run during a 6-2 Pacific Coast League win
at L.A.'s Wrigley Field (to help pitcher Tom Lasorda pick up the
victory). It was Bilko's final home run for the team. (100)
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 9, 1965: Sandy Koufax throws a perfect game against the
Chicago Cubs, a record fourth no-hitter of his career. He strikes
out 14, including the last six. The Dodgers manage just one hit off
Cubs pitcher Bob Hendley, a bloop double by Lou Johnson in the
seventh inning that doesn't figure in the 1-0 final. (7)
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 10, 1973: In the largest boxing gate ever attained on the
West Coast ($475,640), Muhammad Ali knocks out Ken Norton at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 12, 1970: USC's 42-21 football win over Alabama in
Birmingham is highlighted by a 135-yard, two-TD performance by
fullback Sam Cunningham. The game is credited for helping with the
integration of African-American athletes into Southern football
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Birthdays: Wednesday: Former Kings great Rogie Vachon (54).
Thursday: Former Hart High, UCLA and Dodgers third baseman Todd
Zeile (34). Friday: Former USC pitcher Randy Johnson (36). &QL;

FREEZE FRAME: IT'S MAGIC IN A BOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can have any knucklehead explain the benefits
of sports TV viewing with the newest and greatest gadget on the
market called TiVo. But until you see it for yourself, and actually
gasp in amazement as what just happened, it's not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a super VCR that allows the viewer the incredible
ability to _ get this _ not only pause live action, but then watch
it whenever you're ready to continue or jump back to the live
coverage. You in essence watch the game on whatever delay you've
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who's ever been zoned in on a sporting event and had
a spouse interrupt with ``something important'' _ and sure, it was,
but you just missed the key play of the game _ remember this
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Declining divorce rates are already being predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is that it records everything you're watching
digitally onto a hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   Other features are just as remarkable. The slo-mo button allows
you to go frame-by-frame of the live broadcast as well. Since it's
hooked into a phone line, the current programming guide for your
cable or dish system is continually fed into the box, allowing you
to see a schedule of other things while you're watching a program,
and then jump over if you want.
</P>
<P>
   It records DVD quality and allows you to transfer a recorded
show onto a VCR tape if you desire. A splitter is needed if you
want to record one show while watching another.
</P>
<P>
   The price may seem prohibitive, but again remember the value _
$499 for the 14-hour memory machine; $999 for the 30-hour special.
The service runs $9.95 a month or $99 a year, but the $199 lifetime
price is the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   It will come spousal-approved.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, it's only been available through order on the
TiVo Web site (www.tivo.com) or at Good Guys and Fry's Electronics,
but it goes on sale nationwide at Best Buy in time for the NFL
openers.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with TiVo is a machine called ReplayTV, which is not
yet in the stores but sells for $699 (10 hours), $899 (14 hours) or
$1,499 (28 hours). Among other things, ReplayTV does not have the
slo-mo or closed caption ability as TiVo does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's all a matter of how the people value it,'' said
TiVo director of strategic marketing Bob Poniatowski.
</P>
<P>
   For something like this, we're thinking priceless. &QL;

WHITAKER'S PICTURE DEVELOPING NICELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lance Whitaker's future as a heavyweight contender
seemed a bit clouded only six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8, 250-pound Valley-area product was unbeaten when he
was outpointed by capable but limited Lou Savarese on March 6. It
certainly wasn't the step toward a title shot he and his handlers
had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was anything but a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker (19-1, with 16 knockouts) almost knocked out Savarese
at one point _ something top contender Michael Grant couldn't do _
before running out of gas and points. In the process, he went from
raw prospect to credible heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, he took another major step, outpointing then
unbeaten and favored Monte Barrett on the undercard of the David
Reid-Keith Mullings card.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Barrett isn't exactly Grant. He (begin ital)is(end ital)
slick and tough, the kind of opponent who could give anyone
difficulty and one who will remain a good prospect. Without
question, it was a significant victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts him right into the heavyweight picture _ with an
exclamation point,'' said Dan Goossen of America Presents,
Whitaker's promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker's handlers were pleased not only with the victory but
(begin ital)how(end ital) he pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from the Savarese fight, he paced himself and was able
to go the distance easily. He fought well defensively _ ``Barrett
never put a mark on him,'' his trainer, Joe Goossen, said. And he
came on strong in the 12th and final round to solidify his victory,
the sign of an in-shape, gutsy fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Whitaker still is developing. He seems to have lapses
in concentration, he doesn't throw his right hand enough and,
having fought just 20 times, he generally lacks the savvy of an
experienced boxer.
</P>
<P>
   However, he might be the strongest heavyweight in the world. He
has the punching style and much of the power of George Foreman, and
the former San Fernando High basketball player has more athletic
ability than people realize.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, he's beginning to believe anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance seriously boosted his confidence,'' Joe Goossen said.
``Going into the Savarese fight, I think Lance had a few questions
about his own abilities and answered them in that fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, especially after the Barrett fight, he knows he belongs
in the race for the heavyweight championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, as taciturn as they come, downplayed the victory over
Barrett, saying ``It's OK, it's a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   That's another good sign. It means he's able to gauge his
progress realistically and understands there is a lot of work
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good because I went 12 rounds,'' he said. ``But I'm not
really happy about my performance. I know I could do a lot better.
It's a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I'm not fighting at the level I should be. I'm going on
athletic ability, I'm punching with my arms instead of with my
whole body. I think it'll be pretty scary when I fight like I
should be fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen said he'd like Whitaker to fight on the undercard of
Mike Tyson-Orlin Norris on Oct. 23. Jorge Luis Gonzalez, another
hulking heavyweight, is a possible opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker would rather face a high-profile opponent ``who could
do something for my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the winner of the Grant-Andrew Golota fight scheduled for
Nov. 20, which Dan Goossen hopes to arrange?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, something like that sounds good. That would definitely
put me near the top.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Lennox Lewises and Evander Holyfields might be after
that....
</P>
<P>
   More Whitaker: Main Events, which promotes frightening
heavyweight David Tua, has proposed a Tua-Whitaker matchup.
</P>
<P>
   However, make no mistake: No right-thinking heavyweight with
aspirations of winning a world title would choose to go through the
immensely powerful Tua to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Tua might be the best out there....
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Trinidad: Oscar De La Hoya, who faces Felix Trinidad
in a welterweight title-unification bout Sept. 18 in Las Vegas, has
had his distractions. Between personal appearances and his business
interests, it's a wonder he's been able to focus on boxing.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he admits, he hasn't been the hungry fighter he was
early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the feeling is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the fight,'' he said.``For instance, for this
fight, since it's such a big, major event, I'm hungry again. It's a
matter of being motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through so much the way I have, activities outside
boxing, you seem not to worry as much as you used to about
training. I seem to worry more about the future, things other than
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I wanted this fight so bad: It's made me refocus.''
</P>
<P>
   The right stuff?: De La Hoya, a natural left-hander, admits he
contradicts himself when he makes references to strategy. He
doesn't want anyone to know what he's up to.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't difficult to see through comments he made
recently when asked why he doesn't throw many right-handed punches.
</P>

knockout.''

STERLING TIGHT WITH CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Donald T. Sterling had subsidized the Donner Party, an
unexpected Stuckey's sighting would have been followed by orders to
keep walking.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Clippers' owner really that tight with his loot? Well,
when it comes to basketball budgeting, witnesses say the man could
make a dollar holler. His seeming belief that NBA scoreboards
record decimal points has made the smart people in his organization
look dumber than a bag of hammers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sterling's ownership trip will reach a fork in the
road to nowhere. But there (ital)will(end ital) be an arrow
indicating an upcoming ramp to salvation. Sterling will be asked to
take it and dig deep. He'll be encouraged to grant one employee a
contract extension worth $70.9 million over six years. That would
have bought enough pecan rolls to keep the Donners from exchanging
funny looks before they were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the aforementioned Clipper employee is power forward
Maurice Taylor, the resident go-to guy whose new agent has
threatened to make Taylor a guy going to another team if Sterling
refuses to cough up the league maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's new agent, by the way, is the mighty David Falk. And
calling Falk's bluff seems to be as wise as playing chicken with a
Pinto in reverse gear. If Falk had negotiated the Louisiana
Purchase, Memphis and New Orleans would be located in the same
state. Siccing him on Sterling is about as sporting as bringing
along Godzilla to fight a parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Falk has promised that Wednesday's meeting with Sterling
will include no negotiating. If Sterling, as expected, puts the
burden of proof on another season from Taylor (who's in the final
year of his initial three-year NBA deal) before making an offer,
Falk will request a trade.
</P>
<P>
   If Taylor isn't traded, he'll be the lame-duck ringleader of a
gifted frontcourt that includes center Michael Olowokandi and
rookie phenom-in-waiting Lamar Odom. When the season is over, Falk
will take Taylor and his potential into a market where teams - at
this moment - are clearing space in the dusty garages of their
salary cap calculators. Chicago and Orlando have prepared to have
spending money with Tim Duncan and Grant Hill in mind, but when
they strike out on those two, Taylor will be on deck.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clippers, with no sign-and-trade leverage, will have a
grief index that's off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did we just unleash the ``P'' word? Yeah, we did. Here it is
again: potential.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Falk and Taylor are selling. As any fan who's
blinded by financial jealousy will tell you, the 16.8 points and
5.3 rebounds ``Mo'' provided last season are not worth 70.9 million
scoots. But his potential for 20-plus and 8 - year after year --
is. His status as a scoring threat who can maximize the collateral
talents of Odom and Olowokandi is.
</P>
<P>
   Potential is a requisite risk. This is basketball, not condo
sales. Without taking a risk that's mitigated by informed talent
evaluation, you'll never own a contending team. However, you will
save enough chump change to buy goodies and impress your celebrity
cronies in a luxury closet at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the credit for the Clippers' dilemma should be
handed to Taylor. He's the kid who reported to their last training
camp in a condition that promoted lingering injury and an energy
deficit when rebounds were required. Mo's sickly rebounding ratio
is one of the cagey Sterling's convenient reasons for being
reluctant to make him rich.
</P>
<P>
   So if Sterling decides the fork in his road has been stained by
pie, the Clippers' future could be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for Bull run
</P>
<P>
   If you think all professional athletes are lucky, lackadaisical,
cash machines, you've never met former Long Beach State star James
Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, who was acquired with Hersey Hawkins by the Chicago
Bulls in the deal that shipped Brent Barry to Seattle, has been
haunting the Veteran's Park SportsComplex gym in preparation for
his third NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I need,'' said Cotton, ``is a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He may get one in Chicago, where hometown hero Hawkins figures
to start ahead of Cotton at shooting guard. But Hawkins' mileage
and Cotton's capacity for hard work could provide the opportunity
he didn't get in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the full-court morning runs, Cotton often leads
the Vet regulars in game-speed shooting drills.
</P>
<P>
   He also reports that younger brother Schea, the prize of
Alabama's stellar recruiting class, loves Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   Absolute Condition
</P>
<P>
   A. C. Green, the newest old Laker, has been working out at the
Vet and appears to be in splendid shape. Although his Dallas
numbers seem dangerously pedestrian, Green's knowledge of what
needs to be done - on and off the court -- should make him a key
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Another Laker grapevine item involves a proposed reunion between
Phil Jackson and Ron Harper. The drum-beating has gotten a bit
louder. Harp, you recall, did a swell job defending point guards
for Jackson in Chicago, but won't have Michael Jordan or Scottie
Pippen to provide defensive help in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   We're not sure where Jerry West, the Lakers' V.P. of hoop
maneuvers, weighs in on this, but a source close to Harper said the
ex-Clipper would love to return to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still have both exceptions available, but are
expected to use the $2 million slot to woo someone who can start at
power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Add Clippers
</P>
<P>
   The search for someone to compete with Troy Hudson at point
guard continues. The Clippers took a big swing at acquiring the
rights to Steve Francis, Vancouver's broken-hearted draft pick, but
the Houston Rockets were able to muster what the Grizzlies
considered a better deal. ... The hunt for a backup center also
continues, although the Clips were impressed with last week's
audition by 7-foot Zan Tabak, a skilled Croatian who's done NBA
time in Houston and Toronto.

PAC-10 STUMBLES OUT OF GATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's well-packaged edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10's slip is showing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, USC and UCLA won their openers Saturday by a combined score
of 100-14, and Arizona should feel no shame (OK, maybe a litle) in
stumbling in State College (Pa.), and the conference will never be
judged by the ability of Stanford and Washington State to win
games.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, this isn't the same conference that whipped the Big
Ten champ in the Rose Bowl game 19 out of 23 times between 1970 and
1992 and annually shared the distinct of best conference with the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 appears to be feeling the negative effects of too
much parity and too many coaching changes.
</P>
<P>
   Five different teams have played in the Rose Bowl the last five
years (Arizona State, Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington State), nine
of ten teams have bowled in the last three seasons, and seven
different teams have won a bowl game dating back to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This is all good if you're judging a league by its depth. Back
in the good old days, before all this BCS (Bowl Championship
Series) nonsense and rush to have a faux national champ, the sense
of great competition week in, week out, was more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis now is on the 20 or so teams who start a season
with a kernal of belief that they're going to contend for a major
bowl and maybe a national title. And it is very hard to do that
when talent in the west has been more evenly dispersed, when every
school can tell recruits that the Rose Bowl, or at least a bowl
game, is withing reach.
</P>
<P>
   What's better, the Pac-10 sending six teams to bowl games in
1997, or the Atlantic Coast Conference getting reams of publicity
and residual respect with Florida State being a national title
conetnder every year?
</P>
<P>
   If the best Pac-10 teams had maintained their focus in the big
games, the conference might be enjoying the best of both college
football worlds, like the SEC, which seems to send seven teams to
bowls every year while also producing national champs (Tennessee,
Florida).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pac-10 teams are losing the big games. The Big Ten has
won six of the last seven Rose Bowl games. Last year, UCLA gagged
against Miami and Washington was embarrassed by a mediocre Nebraska
team. The last big non-conference win by a Pac-10 team was Arizona
State's upset of Nebraska in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make one very confident of UCLA's visit to Columbus
next week. ...
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the ten Pac-10 head coaches have also been on the job
for four years or less, too. And among the coaches moving on in the
last have been Terry Donahue, the Pac-10's all-time leader in wins;
John Robinson and Bill Walsh, in their second tours at USC and
Stanford; and Steve Mariucci (Cal), Mike Riley (Oregon State), and
Rich Brooks (Oregon), who ran off to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   This turnover has less to do with the quality of the men hired
as much as the turnover it causes on coaching staffs. It's
difficult to create continuity in the recruiting world when new
head coaches hire new staffs. ...
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't help that Pac-10 athletic directors are now
following the time-honored tradition of whipped cream scheduling.
Arizona-Penn State and UCLA-Ohio State are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Every team except Washington has at least one gimmes this year.
They include Boise State (UCLA), Hawaii (USC), Idaho (Washington
State), Middle Tennessee (Arizona), Nevada (Oregon, Oregon State),
New Mexico State (Arizona State), Rutgers (Cal), San Jose State
(Stanford), UTEP (Arizona, Oregon), and SW Louisiana (Washington
State).
</P>
<P>
   Second tier opponents include TCU, Texas Tech, Division I-AA
power Georgia Southern, Fresno State and San Diego State. Three
schools (USC, Stanford and Arizona State) will play Notre Dame. ...
</P>
<P>
   I will hold off on assessing the ability of UCLA quarterback
Cory Paus and USC's offense in general until they play teams with
more filling than an oreo. As opponents, Boise State and Hawaii
defy accurate analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But it was encouraging to see a dozen different Bruins catch a
pass. I even saw a few Bruins on defense actually make a tackle.
USC quarterback Carson Palmer also had a horde of quick receivers,
too. ...
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to beat the rush, here's my early Heisman ballot:
1, Wide receiver Peter Warrick, Florida State. 2, Quarterback Joe
Hamilton, Georgia Tech. 3, Quarterback Drew Brees, Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dayne is obviously missing. My problem with the Wisconsin
back is all of the residual attention he is getting because he
might break Ricky Williams' career rushing record. The Heisman
shouldn't be a life achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's a great bull of a runner, but he's piled up a lot of his
career yards against non-conference and Big Ten cupcakes, and I've
seen him exit a lot of big games with injuries. ...
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Bob Toledo: Do not, under any circumstance, let DeShaun
Foster, Danny Farmer and Freddie Mitchell play a single down of
defense, as they did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   I understand the Bruins are shorthanded on defense, and the
defense-offense bickering of last year might be overcome by this
all-for-one philosophy. But risking your top tailback and two best
receivers to the whims of tackling is just stupid. Especially this
week against Ohio State. If Foster gets hurts playing defense
against the Buckeyes, Toledo can skip the plane trip home. ...

GAUTHIER READIES THE DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Only the shadows really know Pierre Gauthier and
that's justfine with the Mighty Ducks president and general manager
as he prepares hishockey team for another season.
</P>
<P>
   The way Gauthier sees it, a GM has a job to do and nowhere in
thedescription does it state he should be the focus of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players and coaches are the heroes,'' he said. ``The
players are theones people pay to come and see, not me. A general
manager shouldn't be upfront and center.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier certainly can never be accussed of being an attention
grabber. Hewas dubbed ``The Ghost'' in Ottawa, where where he
helped turn around aSenators team that had been the laughing stock
of the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just always in the background,'' said Ottawa president
Roy Malkar.``But he's very observant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed in Anaheim. Gauthier happily remains in the
shadows, butthere's no doubt whose vision the Ducks represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue with a GM is vision,'' said Tony Tavares, the
president ofDisney Sports Inc. who stepped aside as Ducks president
when he hiredGauthier on July 16, 1998. ``Pierre can develop a
vision, be honest about thetalent and he sticks with his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (GM's) don't have a vision, they live day-to-day,
hour-to-hourjust plugging holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier had more than his share of holes to fill. Anaheim was
coming off a33-46-5 season and had just fired coach Pierre Page
after not renewing RonWilson's contract the previous spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in disarray,'' said Tavares, who says his relationship
can best bedescribed as ``when you trust somebody, you don't bother
second guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Left alone to put the pieces back together, Gauthier took the
1998-99 Ducksand asssembled a team that he entrusted to coach new
Craig Hartsburg, who wasallowed to run it without interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in delegating, really delegating,'' Gauthier said.
``(General)managers manage, coaches coach, players play, scouts run
the draft . . . Imight say `draft the best guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier feels he must keep his distance from the players,
especially abouttheir performance. Last year, he addressed the team
once -- during a slump,to let the players know that he was not
planning any big moves and that hebelieved in them.
</P>
<P>
   But he did so only after getting Hartsburg's permission and
jokes ``Iprobably won't talk again for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach is the boss of the team,'' he explained. ``I never
go over hishead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier was an assistant GM with the Ducks under Jack Ferreira
beforetaking the Ottawa job in December of 1995, a move that
Tavares said leftDisney chairman ``heartbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   After turning the Senators into a playoff team, Gauthier left a
lot ofpeople in the Canadian capital heartbroken and upset -- to
say the least.Members of the Ottawa media all but called Gauthier a
liar, a con man andsaid his integrity was lacking when he quit, due
to personal reasons,returned to Southern California and shortly
thereafter was hired by Tavares.To make things even tougher he then
replaced his longtime friend andassociate Ferreira as the GM.
</P>
<P>
   Mlakar was critcized when he didn't ask for any compensation --
something hedid do when Gauthier's replacement, Rick Dudley, left
to go to Tampa Bay thissummer.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Kings executivesaid there was no reason to askfor
any, especially since he feltnothing underhanded was doneby the
Ducks or Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Mlakar said when askedif he felt betrayed. ``There
isabsolutely no way Tony Ta-vares would ever do anythingbehind my
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of my best friends,my kids call him Uncle Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlakar also said there is noreason for people to doubt
Gau-thier's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned things around (inOttawa), but he knew long term(he
wanted to get away),'' saidMlakar. ``He had a vision onand off the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is betweenPierre Gauthier and I, it's no-body
business. (But) I know Ican look in the mirror and seetwo things,
first, I'm bald, andsecond that Pierre Gauthier isstand-up guy and
class act.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise from a man whojokingly admits the two hadvery little
in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relationship based onbusiness,'' Mlakar said. ``I'm
aDiet Coke fanatic, he doesn'tlike soda . . . He likes choco-late,
I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier said he knew hewould ``take some hits'' afterbeing
hired by the Ducks andadmits, ``I probably set myselfup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have said sostrongly I wouldn't come to
An-aheim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But once he took over in Ana-heim it wasn't long before
Gau-thier began to put his stamp onthe team in his usual,
subtleways.
</P>
<P>
   He made no blockbuster tradesor acquistions. Instead, he
dealtinconsistent defenseman DavidKarpa and a draft pick to
Caro-lina for defenseman Kevin Hal-ler and Stu Grimson.
</P>
<P>
   The move worked on two lev-els. Haller's veteran leadershipwas
critical as the Ducks at-tempted to improve their de-fense. Tough
guy and fan favor-ite Grimson, along with JimMcKenzie, who Ferreira
ac-quired from Phoenix earlier inthe summer, provided somemuch
needed security for PaulKariya and Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   He then picked up free agentFredrik Olausson at a bargainprice
and the defensemanhelped transform the Anaheimpower play to the
best in theleague.
</P>
<P>
   The moves may not have satis-fied the media and fans at thetime,
but ignoring outside pres-sure is one of Gauthier's greatstrengths,
according to Tavares.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure to an-alyze and second guess
execu-tives, but he is totally unaffect-ed by that,'' said Tavares.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Gauthier quietlyand efficiently dealt with all
ofthe important contract negotia-tions, especially Paul Kariya's.He
also tried to shore up Ana-heim's most pressing need --skill on
defense -- by acquiringformer Duck Oleg Tverdovsky,drafting veteran
Swedish EliteLeague defenseman Niclas Hav-elid and getting former
first-round pick Vitaly Vishnevskysigned. He also traded for
for-ward Ted Donato.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's Gauthier's abilityto tune out outside
influencesthat cause some to call him``reclusive, aloof,
detached,Pierre Grouchy.''
</P>
<P>
   They are labels that Mlakarthinks are totally unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd like make you think hedidn't have a heart, but he hasa
huge heart,'' Mlakar said.``Just ask about his childrenand wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Tavares admits Gauthier, whomight not say a word to a per-son
the night after talking ex-citedly about a movie like``Shakespere
In Love,'' can bein his own world, especiallywhen things aren't
going well.But Tavares quickly adds itmostly ``comes from being
adeep thinker. He's really abright guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gauthier, who realizedhe wasn't going to be an
NHLcaliber player at an early age,has a masters degree in
sportsadministration and was takingclasses toward his doctorate
upuntil the time he was namedhead scout of the Quebec Nor-diques in
1988. Gauthier stillenjoys the academic setting andcould see
himself teaching afterhis career as a GM comes to anend.
</P>
<P>
   But right now Gauthier's dutiespretty much consume him 365days a
year and don't leavehim much time for much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife always said scoutingwas the best because when youwere
home you were home,'' hesaid. ``Management is 365 daysa year, there
are no holidays.''

DEATH PENALTY CASE WAS STRUGGLE FOR FATE OF A SMOOTH-TALKING
EX-CONVICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Browning's police radio crackled with typical
emergency-worker jargon: ``A nonbreather with extended downtime.''
</P>
<P>
   In plain English, it meant someone probably was dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was midmorning on April 26, 1998, a Sunday. Browning, a field
sergeant and shift supervisor for the Lenexa Police Department in
Johnson County, Kan., was dispatched to the Howard Johnson Express.
</P>
<P>
   The paramedics who met him outside Room 207 said the woman
inside had been dead for some time. A hotel housecleaning crew had
found her in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   Browning walked into the bathroom. She was a slender white
woman, nude, lying on her back. Her long brown hair covered her
face.
</P>
<P>
   Bruises were plainly visible on her torso, legs and arms.
Browning put a finger on her thigh. It was cold to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go down to the front desk and find out who the room is
registered to,'' he told another officer.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Claire-Marie Monti's death had just
begun.
</P>
<P>
   It would develop into one of the most complex and hard-fought
murder cases in recent Johnson County history _ a literal
life-and-death struggle for the fate of Carl Dean Rails, a
smooth-talking ex-convict with a violent temper.
</P>
<P>
   The case ended last month after 16 months of acrimonious court
hearings, mountains of legal paperwork and a last-minute blowup
that nearly derailed Rails' plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, at the age of 36, Rails quietly accepted his fate
and was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. His
guilty plea allowed him to avoid a possible death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   A second defendant, Rails' co-worker Rodney Wayne Henry, was
convicted in May of first-degree murder, rape and aggravated
sodomy. He must serve about 68 years in prison before he can even
think about parole.
</P>
<P>
   For District Attorney Paul Morrison, the decision to accept
Rails' plea agreement was one of the most difficult of his career.
Morrison has consistently lauded the death penalty as a powerful
tool to induce guilty pleas and life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But, comparing it to the nation's nuclear deterrent, he said it
could only be effective if people know you are not afraid to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   The two previous cases in which Morrison had filed capital
murder charges also ended in guilty pleas and life sentences. But
Rails was different from either of those defendants, who had little
or no criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Dean Rails once shot a man in the face with a shotgun.
Later, when told that his victim had survived, Rails said he wished
he had gone back and finished the job.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was out of prison and working as a foreman for a
remodeling company. When a customer refused to pay, Rails and his
boss clogged the customer's plumbing with a hidden piece of chicken
wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``An old contractor's trick,'' Rails' boss testified.
</P>
<P>
   When a previous employer fired him, Rails broke into his
business and stole all his power tools.
</P>
<P>
   Monti was a smart, ambitious 32-year-old woman working for a
computer software company in suburban Philadelphia. She was in
Kansas City, Mo., to train employees of a business in Lenexa, a
Kansas City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths crossed on April 25, 1998, on a sidewalk in
Westport, a Kansas City entertainment district. Rails was with
Henry, his younger drinking buddy and co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   Monti was alone, a stranger in town, looking to pass a Saturday
night dancing and listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen hours after their chance meeting, Monti's battered body
was found in her hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The killers were smart enough to wipe fingerprints off
everything in the room, soak Monti's body in hot water to degrade
DNA samples, and take towels and bedding from the room and burn
them in a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   They were stupid enough to tell their boss what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   When detectives got Henry alone, he crumpled. With a video
camera running, he spun a tale of Monti's last terrifying moments
of life and her death at the hands, he said, of Carl Rails.
</P>
<P>
   It was a story of unprovoked brutality. Rails mercilessly beat
Monti as she begged for her life. He strangled her until his hands
got tired. And then he defiled her lifeless body with the leg of a
metal luggage rack.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said his role was minimal. Afraid to defy his
out-of-control friend, Henry said, he helped Rails restrain Monti
and then dispose of evidence because he was afraid of what might
happen to him.
</P>
<P>
   When detectives questioned Rails, he provided few details but
conceded that he had choked Monti.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison didn't believe much of Henry's version, but he believed
enough to make Rails the third person to face capital murder
charges in Johnson County since Kansas reinstated the death penalty
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Henry was charged with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   A Johnson County jury didn't believe much of Henry's story
either. On May 11, he was found guilty and subsequently sentenced
to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   From a legal standpoint, it was a typical case. Defense attorney
Scott Gyllenborg filed motions to suppress evidence. Hearings were
conducted and the judge made his rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But Rails' case was quite different. It was a point his
attorneys were to make again and again: A death penalty case is a
legal animal unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   Rails was represented by two lawyers from the Kansas Death
Penalty Defense Unit, Ben Wood and Jeff Moots.
</P>
<P>
   Wood made it clear early in the case that everything he did was
with an eye toward how it would be seen by an appeals court 10
years in the future if Rails were indeed convicted and sentenced to
die.
</P>
<P>
   No issue, no matter how minor, would be handled informally.
Everything would be in writing and on the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to strap my client to a gurney and pump poison into
his veins,'' he said on several occasions as he paced and pointed
at a seated Rails.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a legal issue that could be conceived, he and Moots
conceived it. If the credibility of a witness could be cracked,
they would dig deep into his past to do it.
</P>
<P>
   They came at the case from every angle:
</P>
<P>
   - They used an argument of ``reverse inference.'' If a
pathologist failed to save a crucial piece of Monti's body as
evidence that she had been sexually assaulted, then the judge
should find the exact opposite of what the doctor said the evidence
showed.
</P>
<P>
   - They invoked the words of Pope John Paul II and argued that
the death penalty violated the ``evolving standards of world
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   - They provided the results of a North Carolina study showing
that imprisoning someone for life is more cost-effective than
executing them.
</P>
<P>
   - And they obtained an order from the judge to keep the district
attorney from going closer than 10 feet to Rails during trial. They
accused Morrison of ``basic primate aggression'' during Henry's
trial when he tossed a box of facial tissue to Henry.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the defense filed more than 60 motions and promised to
file more than 100. A retired judge was brought in to handle some
of District Judge Peter Ruddick's caseload so he could devote time
to the Rails case.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings, occasionally punctuated with angry outbursts, were
held every few weeks. A tentative trial date was not scheduled
until next January.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly contentious hearing took place on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Rails wanted his pubic hair back.
</P>
<P>
   Wood argued that the state had no probable cause to collect hair
samples from Rails earlier in the case. He accused prosecutors of
going on a ``fishing expedition'' for evidence or simply harassing
Rails by ``ripping out his pubic hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they had been unable to match Rails' samples with those
found on a towel in the hotel room, Wood said, the hair should be
given back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since a portion of our client's body was taken improperly, we
ask that it be returned to the defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison countered that such evidence collection is standard
procedure in cases of possible sexual assault. Morrison noted that
a head hair found at the scene did match Rails' hair.
</P>
<P>
   Wood promised that would be the subject of a future motion.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that Rails' presence in Monti's room was not in
dispute, ``according to most of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took a shot at the science of hair analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to insult voodoo by comparing it to hair
analysis, but hair analysis is not valid science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Things got testy when Wood addressed a defense motion seeking
information about the problems of a witness in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Responding, Morrison described the motion as character
assassination. When he referred to the defense team as ``that
crew,'' Moots exploded from his chair, yelling ``I am not a crew.''
He kept objecting loudly until Ruddick threatened to leave the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing lasted two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Rails defense team tendered its first serious plea offer
shortly before Henry went to trial in May. But his offer to plead
guilty and serve a sentence of life with no chance of parole for 40
years was quickly rejected by Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Henry was convicted and sentenced that Rails
made the offer that Morrison couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney later said that Rails ``went belly up.''
He agreed to plead guilty to all charges and not contest the
doubling of state guideline sentences.
</P>
<P>
   He traded the possibility of a few years on death row and a date
with the state executioner for the certainty of the rest of his
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison accepted the deal, with the support of Monti's family.
</P>
<P>
   But one last problem cropped up on Aug. 12 _ the day Rails was
supposed to enter his guilty plea. The defense wanted to do both
the plea and sentencing that day.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, plea and sentencing hearings are conducted
separately. Morrison said no to the defense proposal. Monti's
parents, who live in Pennsylvania, wanted to be present for the
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting between the attorneys in the judge's chambers ended
abruptly when the door flew open and Ruddick told Wood to leave
until he could cool off.
</P>
<P>
   The judge recessed the case until later that afternoon. Morrison
left the defense with one option to mull over _ a plea that day, or
the deal was off the table.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later Rails walked into the courtroom and quietly
entered his plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug our heels in,'' Morrison said. ``We had given him his
break. That was letting him live. Every other detail was
non-negotiable.''

   ``It's fun to be a small-town editor, especially when you own
the newspaper,'' Michael Gartner observed last week. ``You can say
any damn thing you want. You see these young people come and you
see them every day and you try to inoculate them with your values
and you take great pride when they move up. Plus writing the
editorials _ it's more fun than one person should have.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is the 60-year-old Gartner, a longtime big-time newspaper
editor and a former head of NBC News, giving it all up? Why is he
selling The Tribune _ the 10,000-circulation newspaper in Ames,
Iowa, that he has edited for six years and owned for 13 _ and
becoming a full-time baseball executive?
</P>
<P>
   Well, when it comes to writing for newspapers, Gartner has done
all right. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his editorial writing in
1997. He was the page-one editor at The Wall Street Journal in the
early 1970s and later the editor of The Des Moines Register.
</P>
<P>
   But owning them, or trying to, has been problematic. When he
tried to buy The Des Moines Register while he was serving as its
president in 1985, he was outbid by Gannett Co. Now, he said, the
death of a partner, David Belin, and the tax consequences for
Belin's family ``made it clear we were going to have to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   So sometime this fall, Gartner will be leaving the profession he
has worked in since the 1950s, and going into a whole new line of
work as part-owner of the Iowa Cubs, the Triple-A minor-league
franchise of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner has been The Tribune's editor since he resigned as
president of NBC News in 1993, following the revelation that _
unbeknownst to him _ an explosion of a General Motors pickup truck
videotaped for use in a ``Dateline'' program had been staged.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Ames, the college town 35 miles north of Des
Moines where he and The Tribune's publisher, Gary Gerlach, had
teamed with Belin in 1986 to buy the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the American Journalism Review describes his
posting of the text of the First Amendment and quotations of Thomas
Jefferson on the newsroom walls, and he went on to secure jobs for
alumni of the 20-person editorial staff on newspapers like The
Baltimore Sun, The St. Petersburg Times, USA Today and The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Gartner said he did not yet know how his
life was going to change once he was out of the business. ``I've
never run a baseball team,'' he said. ``I expect to have fun and
enjoy myself.'' He said he had played a little baseball long ago.
Then, with a trace of self-consciousness, he delivered a line he
has used before, a sound bite that he recognizes is virtually
irresistible to a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem as a shortstop,'' he said, ``is the same problem as
I had as an editorial writer. I couldn't go to my right.''
</P>

<P>
   An Unexpected Success for a Reprint Series
</P>
<P>
   The New York Review of Books has vowed to reach a wider audience
than the usual intellectuals with its new book-publishing venture,
which salvages out-of-print classics. So far, 12 titles have been
published in sleek paperback editions, including vanished titles by
Chekhov and Henry James.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the most popular rescue has been a lost stray from
the 1950s that is drawing reviews from the venerable literary
critics at Dog World and The Bark magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The book, J.R. Ackerley's ``My Dog Tulip,'' has merited a
chapter excerpt and a review from Dr. Dog in The Bark, a canine
quarterly based in Berkeley, Calif., that likes to consider itself
The New Yorker of dog magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerley, the late literary editor for the BBC's weekly
magazine, The Listener, wrote a wry portrait of his 16 years with
Tulip, an occasionally willful but loyal German shepherd that he
rescued and indulged and worried over, seeing to her selection of
proper mates and delivery of eight pups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for books that had a certain reputation, but
we wanted books that weren't standard school curriculum books,
books that could surprise people and look at things in unusual
ways,'' said Edwin Frank, the editor of the series. But the
surprise was that ``My Dog Tulip'' was already something of a cult
favorite for people who were elated by its reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled; I was so excited,'' said Claudia Kawczynska,
the editor and publisher of Bark, which is offering the excerpt in
its fall literary issue. ``There are a lot of books on dogs being
published on the canine theme, but this one is so special. It comes
from such a deep understanding of the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, The New York York Review of Books is planning
to publish additional rescued titles. Naturally the list includes
J.R. Ackerley's ``We Think the World of You.'' Tulip has no place
in this novel, but there is a beautiful, neglected German shepherd
named Evie.

   Magazine Lets Photographers Shoot Back
</P>
<P>
   If you were a photographer, you might think it would be nice to
have Time, Rolling Stone and Vogue on your resume.
</P>
<P>
   But you might also find it makes your life miserable, according
to Photo District News magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which magazines are naughty and which magazines are nice?''
asks the September cover story of PDN, as it is known. The monthly,
which caters to the New York photography market, asked 100
photographers who regularly work for consumer magazines which
titles were terrific to shoot for and which were, well, lousy.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines that got a vigorous thumbs-down included Vogue
(photographers cited a ``lack of creative freedom''), Rolling Stone
(``bad paper stock and insensitive art direction''), Time
(photographers ``can't stop gnashing their teeth about it''), New
York (``cheap'' and ``disrespectful'') and Business Week, which was
recently boycotted by freelance photographers until the magazine
raised its page rates.
</P>
<P>
   The list of winners included Bloomberg Personal Finance, Vanity
Fair, Fortune, Wired, Smithsonian and GQ.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Stuart Hughes, editor of PDN, said some results were
surprising. ``I was really surprised by Rolling Stone,'' she said.
``It has won a lot of awards for design and I was surprised that
photographers reacted to the poor reproduction and the busy feel of
the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hughes said she was not surprised, however, that Vogue was
on the list of losers for photographers, citing a general bias
against Conde Nast publications by photographers because of
continued troubled contract negotiations. ``But I was surprised
that the prestige of being in Vogue and the visibility of it did
not outweigh the creative restrictions they place on
photographers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Connell, a Vogue spokesman, said the magazine had no
comment. Rolling Stone, as of the issue dated Sept. 30, had
upgraded its paper stock.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Schaps, director of special projects at New York, said
the survey was unfair because PDN did not reveal which
photographers were polled. ``I'm really surprised they would do a
blind taste test,'' he said. ``Who are the qualifying
photographers? It doesn't sound fair.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that New York's rate is not the highest in the
industry: ``I'll acknowledge that I wish our page rate were
escalating at a better rate. But no one is saying `I'm not working
for you, you're too cheap.' Not yet. We are trying to be responsive
to photographers. And we're certainly not disrespectful.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a painful setback for the Russian military, Islamic
militants mounted a ferocious assault in Dagestan, and a powerful
bomb demolished an apartment building housing Russian officers and
their families in that Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, who had all but declared victory against the
rebels nearly two weeks ago, said at least 30 people had been
killed and about 110 wounded in the blast, which occurred late
Saturday night when a car bomb exploded in Buinaksk, Dagestan's
second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed the ruins of the five-story apartment
complex: a heap of collapsed walls, twisted metal and debris beside
a 10-foot-deep bomb crater.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing coincided with a separate rebel offensive in western
Dagestan, as the militants _ estimated to number several hundred to
more than a thousand _ streamed across the border from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed fighting was an unwelcome political test for
Vladimir Putin, the former intelligence official who was elevated
to the post of prime minister last month by President Boris Yeltsin
and touted as a presidential successor.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in an interview on the ORT Russian television network,
Putin sought to assure a jittery public, still haunted by Russia's
humiliating defeat in Chechnya, that the Russian army's campaign
against the militants would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation in the Caucasus is going according to plan, not
slowly and not too fast,'' Putin said in the interview, which was
taped Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But his calm demeanor contrasted with the frantic efforts in
Dagestan to repulse the rebels. Air force SU-25s and army artillery
pounded rebel positions Sunday as the local authorities in
Dagestan, stung by the surge in the fighting, announced a
mobilization of all able-bodied men.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic clashes, a column of Russian forces
sought to break the rebel attack on a garrison of 50 policemen that
had found itself outnumbered and surrounded by the militants in the
village of Novolakskoye in western Dagestan. Russian news reports
said the garrison had been involved in a vicious fire fight for
more than seven hours and was running out of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's troubles in Dagestan began last month when several
thousand Islamic rebels crossed into the Botlikh region of the
Russian republic from Chechnya, vowing to evict Russians from the
northern Caucasus and create an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   They were led by Shamil Basayev, a Chechen commander, and
Khattab, a Jordanian-born Chechen. The assault, however, was not
supported by the Chechen government of President Aslan Maskhadov,
which has been unable to exert its will over rival warlords.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rebel incursion sparked Russian fears of a brutal
Chechnya-style conflict. Certainly the rebels have some advantages.
They know the terrain and operate with relative impunity from bases
across the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has bombed bases in Chechnya, but has been
reluctant to invade the disputed province, fearing that that would
draw more Chechens into the fighting and involve the Russian
military in a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians have some factors in their favor, too. Much of
the Dagestani population is against the rebels. The Russians also
have enormous firepower, including bombers, helicopters and
artillery, which have been used extensively in an effort to hold
down Russian losses.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial two weeks of heavy fighting near the border,
the Russian military appeared to have chased many of the Islamic
fighters back to Chechnya. The Russian forces declared victory,
though the military warned that the militants might still engage in
hit-and-run tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened this weekend was clearly much more than the
Russians had expected. On Sunday night the war was being carried
out on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the bombing of the apartment complex at
Buinaksk, where the Russian military's 156th brigade is stationed.
</P>
<P>
   Situated southwest of the Dagestani capital of Makhachkaka,
Buinaksk is near two villages _ Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi _ that
have been the scene of clashes between Russian troops and Islamic
militants and their supporters among the Wahhabi sect. The sect has
enforced Islamic law and until recently has enjoyed relative
autonomy in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The car bomb in Buinaksk went off at 9:45 p.m. Saturday, as
soldiers, their families and ordinary civilians were watching a
soccer match on television between France and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children were reported to be among the dead and
wounded, and on Sunday rescue crews dug through the rubble
searching for survivors. Other explosives were reportedly found and
defused near another apartment complex occupied by Russian troops
and a military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A second rebel attack took place in the Novolakskoye region in
western Dagestan as the militants attacked from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the rebels, Russian officials said, was to secure
this region of Dagestan and declare an Islamic republic, which
would be centered in the nearby town of Khasavyurt.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Smirnov, a senior Russian intelligence official in
Dagestan, said the separate attacks were part of a carefully
coordinated plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are links in the same chain,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: YEARS LATER, CAPRIATI STILL COMES UP SHORT
</HEADLINE>

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eight years ago, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati
shared a court at the National Tennis Center like giddy kids
sipping a soda from two straws. So adorable and wholesome, so
talented and hard hitting, the teen-agers turned their riveting
semifinal match at the U.S. Open into a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, life would curdle for both players, innocence would
be crushed like an overhead. But in a full circle that has passed
through darkness and now light, they are back together again.
Seles, now 25, and Capriati, 23, will play each other at the Open
Monday for the first time since 1991. While it's tempting to turn
the court into a stage for symbiotic comeback and mutual closure,
the similarities linking the two should end with the year of their
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1993. Seles vanished as a victim and became a survivor,
while Capriati self-destructed and now pretends to be the victim.
Seles gained introspection from seclusion, Capriati gained nothing
from her experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we just stick to the now and stop asking about the past?''
Capriati said, growing more irritable with each question after
advancing to the round of 16 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, she was bouncing happily around the court like
a kid sneaking a few leaps on the couch cushions. While Capriati
appears thrilled by a resurgence that has revealed her character as
a fighter, she turns listless when asked about anything deeper than
her ground strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of embracing her role as a cautionary tale, she bristles
when she is held up as Exhibit 1 for the Capriati Rule, an
age-eligibility clause that prohibits 14-year-olds from playing
tour events and Grand Slam tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate being labeled like that,'' Capriati said in a recent
interview with CBS. ``I think my situation was very unique. If the
14-year-old can go and make the finals of the tournament then it's
like protecting them from what?''
</P>
<P>
   She has to ask? In 1990, Capriati turned pro two weeks shy of
her 14th birthday. By 1993, she was searching for crawl space away
from the hype. Once the bubble gum lost its flavor, and the stuffed
animals failed as good company, once popularity became a real drag
and her acne became a corporate concern, Capriati began relating to
the hopeless lyrics of bands like Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the nose ring, the rag doll's slouch and makeup from
the Goth home kit. It was called grunge back then. This sullen look
of a rebel was a more comfortable fit than celebrity for Capriati
as she dropped the girlish giggle, picked up a joint and vanished
from the tour like a plume of smoke. By 1994, she was a case file
for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has pointed at peer pressure and the news media,
Capriati has rarely acknowledged her own culpability. To see a real
victim of her time, she could look at Seles.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1993. Once Guenter Parche wielded his boning knife, and
Steffi Graf was able to reclaim the No. 1 ranking ahead of Seles,
once the psyche healed slower than the gash, and every adoring
stranger felt like a threat, Seles was left to endure the demons
when she retreated from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Soon came the nightmares, the initial thoughts of ``Why me?''
and eventually a sense of what was really important in life. This
reflection added substance to a personality that had been defined
by her hair color and volume of her grunts. By late 1995, Seles was
ready to step out as a more completed person.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, such growth has escaped Capriati. It's one thing to
be a teen-ager and not get it. It's another to be 23 and still
treat her mistakes as don't-go-there material. From her recent
responses, she neither feels compelled to tell her story as a means
of reaching teen-agers teetering on self-destruction nor to accept
her role in creating a rule that might save another young player
from the same kind of creepy spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati could talk about what pressure can do to a 14-year-old
girl, about the strain placed on children by overbearing parents,
about the pratfalls involved in a life of too much too soon. When
asked to mull over the past, Capriati has the same refrain: ``No
regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad. Regrets can be healthy and instructional to kids _
and their parents _ who are eager to plunge into the pros without
their swimmies. Like Monique Viele, for one.
</P>
<P>
   The news release passed around last week read like this:
``Donald Trump introduces tennis professional 14-year-old Monique
Viele. Trump will be on hand with his latest find, tennis sensation
Monique Viele. Trump will outline his strategy for Viele's
professional debut. The 14-year-old, who boasts a booming 115 mph
serve, will reveal why she chose T Management Group and why she is
turning pro at such a tender age.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Is it for herself, her parents, or so Donald Trump can
build her into a commodity so big, she will obstruct views of the
river?
</P>
<P>
   Capriati could talk about slick packaging, about the dangers of
fame. For some reason, it doesn't occur to her. If she has grown at
all over the last eight years, if she has looked inside herself as
Seles has, if she has flipped over her mistakes and probed for
answers, how would anyone know it?

KARROS UNIMPRESSED WITH RECENT WINS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Winning 12 of 16 games is a nice way to head into the
final four weeks of the season, but Eric Karros cautions about
reading too much into the Dodgers' recent success.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who Saturday reached 30 home runs for the fourth time in
his career, says the real gauge for the team will come in series
against New York and Houston, two of the NL's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You obviously want to win these games,'' Karros said, ``but
when you are playing great teams with a lot at stake, that's when
you know where you stand.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing a three-game sweep of the lowly Chicago Cubs on
Sunday, the Dodgers move on to Florida, where they open a
three-game series this afternoon against the Marlins. Chicago and
Florida are both in last place and a combined 51 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 16 games, the Dodgers have played only one team over
.500, Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also have six games remaining with rival San
Francisco, which had won eight straight before a loss Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But to Karros, the clearest test will come against the Astros
and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which hosts the Dodgers for the final three games of
the regular season, is leading the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which dropped three of four to the Dodgers last month,
is second in the East but leads Cincinnati for a wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams have great pitching and great intensity,'' Karros
said. ``When you think about what the Dodgers should do for next
season, games with those teams might give you a better idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Although Gary Sheffield went 0 for 4, including a
strikeout and double-play grounder, nobody hit the ball harder.
Twice he lined sharply to Cubs third baseman Cole Liniak, who made
a spectacular diving stop in the eighth. Sheffield finished the
series 1 for 10. . . . Mark Grudzielanek, who was 5 for 8 with two
homers in the first two games, went 0 for 4 to snap an 11-game
hitting streak.

<P>
   MEMRAMCOOK, New Brunswick _ On a state visit to Montreal in
1967, Charles de Gaulle launched a famous war cry: ``Vive le Quebec
libre.'' After a huge pro-independence crowd exploded in delirium,
Ottawa encouraged the French president to pack his bags and return
to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Jacques Chirac made the first official visit
by a French president to Canada's other French-speakers, the nearly
290,000 Acadians of the Atlantic provinces. Speaking here, in ``the
cradle of Acadia,'' Chirac vowed in an emotional speech to renew
``the action of France by your sides.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of several thousand applauded enthusiastically, many
waving Acadian flags, a French tricolor with a gold star. Then they
settled down for a Labor Day weekend afternoon of foot-tapping
fiddle music, family picnics under maple trees and rounds of golf
on nearby links.
</P>
<P>
   The different reactions reflect different times, different
political personalities, but also different approaches to living in
Canada by the nation's two largest French-speaking societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Quebec, you have a French-speaking majority that was
economically oppressed by an English-speaking minority,'' said
Michel Venne, an editor of Le Devoir, a Quebec newspaper that
reflects the pro-independence sentiments of the province's
political leadership. Noting that French-speakers account for
one-third of New Brunswick, he said: ``Here, the French-speakers
have always been a minority. They have developed different survival
strategies _ tolerance, an ability to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   While Quebec's official language is French, New Brunswick is the
only officially bilingual province in Canada. A people with a flag,
an anthem and a holiday, Acadians lack a territory that easily
lends itself to nationhood. It is an archipelago of communities
sprinkled among four provinces: 240,000 people in New Brunswick,
the 35,000 in Nova Scotia, 5,500 on Prince Edward Island and 2,300
in Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, in a deliberate effort to shift the
French-speaking world's spotlight away from Quebec, the Canadian
government made a showcase of New Brunswick, painting it as a
province where French-speakers do not dream of secession but live
happily inside the federation. Although Quebecers outnumber
Acadians by about 20 to 1, Canada chose Moncton, New Brunswick, to
host a conference of leaders from 49 foreign nations with
French-speaking populations.
</P>
<P>
   Historically lukewarm on the idea of independence for Quebec,
Acadians fear that secession by Quebec would leave the rest of
Canada's French-speakers as powerless minorities in an
overwhelmingly English Canada. With Quebec, French-speakers account
for about one quarter of Canada's 30 million people. Without
Quebec, they fall to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From Quebec, nationalists objected to holding a world
French-speaking summit in Moncton, noting that it was named for
Robert Monckton, a British army colonel who helped to orchestrate
the deportation of about two-thirds of the Acadian population from
Nova Scotia, starting in 1755. Acadians, while acutely aware of
that sad 18th-century history, preferred this weekend proudly to
focus attention on their modern day cultural and economic
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a few years ago that people named `Brun' were
changing their name to `Brown,' and that `LeBlancs' were becoming
`Whites,''' said Rene Legere, general secretary of the National
Society of Acadia, a group which represents French-speakers in the
four provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors, he said, have diminished Acadians' inferiority
complex. In 1994, a gathering of the ``Acadian diaspora'' drew
225,000 people to New Brunswick _ from the Canadian maritime
provinces, from Louisiana and from Atlantic communities in France.
More recently, Acadian musical groups have won wide audiences in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Le Point, a Parisian newsweekly, placed a photo of an
Acadian fiddler on its cover, with the caption: ``The Revenge of
the Acadians.'' This international endorsement of Acadian culture
is fueling local pride here. In the last decade, about a dozen
French-language community radio stations have started broadcasting,
drawing tens of thousands of Acadians away from English-language
radio.
</P>
<P>
   International attention and tourism also have given Acadians
greater confidence in speaking French, a language once mumbled
among members of Acadian farming and fishing families who visited
big cities like Moncton for shopping trips.
</P>
<P>
   With French tourism growing, a weekly airline flight started
service in June between Paris and Moncton, a city of 100,000. In
July, diplomats from the French consulate in Moncton announced the
opening of the city's first Alliance Francaise. Every year, about
200 Acadian high school students and about 200 French high school
students fly across the Atlantic to study in each other's schools,
according to Bernard Oswald, vice president of a union of French
friendship groups.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Acadians' growing self-confidence dates from the
founding in 1963 of the Universite de Moncton, now North America's
largest French-speaking university outside of Quebec. In 1969, New
Brunswick became officially bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, Acadians have made a strong push into
business and culture here. Roger Bilodeau, the province's under
secretary of justice, said, ``As the institutions have become
stronger, Francophone Acadians have taken their place in business,
industry and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Memramcook, one local boy, Romeo LeBlanc, grew up to
become the first Acadian appointed governor general, the queen's
representative in Canada. Addressing the French president in fluent
French, this representative of the British Crown said here,
``Against winds and tides, Acadia has remained resolutely, proudly
French.''

This one was for Kim.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Comets made it No. 3 for No. 10, defeating the New York
Liberty 59-47 at Compaq Center on Sunday to capture their third
straight WNBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   As league president Val Ackerman said amid a whirlwind of flying
red, white and blue confetti: ``This is a team that refuses to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   No miracle 3-point shot at the buzzer would beat the Comets on
this afternoon. And no amount of defense in a game turned ugly
offensively would stay the Comets from their title quest in memory
of late point guard Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   But just for good measure, three-time WNBA Coach of the Year Van
Chancellor took out a little insurance. After all, in Game 2 on
Saturday, New York's Teresa Weatherspoon had nailed a 52-foot shot
at the final buzzer to beat the Comets 58-57, even the
best-of-three Championship Series and necessitate Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``After yesterday, I tried to cover all my bases,'' Chancellor
said. ``No. 1, after I left shootaround (Sunday morning), I went to
church. I just wanted the Lord to know whose side I was on, just in
case he had any interest in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got out my lucky coat, tie and pants that I wore in '97
(when the Comets beat the Liberty 65-51 to win the first WNBA
title). My clothier told me not to do that, but I stayed with the
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   But luck wasn't needed in front of the sellout crowd of 16,285
that included Perrot's mother, Connie, sister Lorretta and a number
of other family members.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chancellor had Cynthia Cooper, who for the third
straight year was named Championship Series Most Valuable Player.
He had super sub Tammy Jackson, who takes to the playoffs like a
warrior to combat. And he had Sheryl Swoopes, who put high-scoring
New York 3-point ace Crystal Robinson in a vise.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson was there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably not respected enough around the WNBA,''
Chancellor said of Thompson, ``but all she does is guard the
toughest player each night and do a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Chancellor had Cooper, who shot a nightmarish
1-for-10 some 24 hours earlier but played like a true champion
Sunday. She also danced on the scorer's table as she held up
Perrot's No. 10 jersey for all in the crowd to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooper did what we thought she'd do,'' said New York coach
Richie Adubato. ``She raised her level up and did what a superstar
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper scored a game-high 24 points, going 13-for-15 from the
free-throw line. She fought through double teams, stole the ball
and scored from long range and on the fast break, inspiring her
team in a game that was rarely inspiring to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shot 28.8 percent _ a record low for a Championship
Series game _ but held the Liberty to 30.9 percent shooting
(17-for-55) and outrebounded New York 36-28 while forcing 16
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams played great defense,'' said Adubato. ``We stopped
their people; they stopped ours. The person that made the
difference was Cooper.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Comets became only the fourth franchise in
major-league professional basketball history to win three titles in
a row. The George Mikan-led Minneapolis Lakers were the first. Then
came the Boston Celtics of Bill Russell and finally the Chicago
Bulls of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tip, Cooper made it clear the Comets are her
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the beginning,'' she said, ``I wanted to establish
that I was going to the basket today, that I was going to be a
force to reckon with, that it was going to be tough to stop me and
that if we were going to go down, we were going to go down
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all we've been through as a team and me individually,
this feels great to three-peat, to win a third championship after
so many sacrifices to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper over the past year has endured more than her share of
tragedy and hardship. First, she lost her mother to breast cancer.
In December, one of the two houses Cooper owns in Sugar Land burned
to the ground, though her seven nieces and nephews escaped
unharmed. Then her car was totaled when she was hit from behind by
another driver.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the declining health and eventual death of
Perrot after a valiant fight that took her to Mexico in search of
alternative cancer treatment that might prolong her life.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Perrot made her final trip from Tijuana,
Mexico, back to Houston's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Cooper, who
looked as though she wouldn't be able to stand, let alone play a
40-minute game, came within two points of her WNBA-record 44 in
leading the Comets to a 71-53 victory over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's death Aug. 19 resulted in an emotionally drained Cooper
missing the first game of her WNBA career. But she and the rest of
the Comets put on hold much of their grief as they embarked on a
mission that would not be complete without bringing home title No.
3 for No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been extremely tough to stay focused and to stay
motivated through Kim's sickness and my mom's illness and
throughout the different things that have happened,'' Cooper said.
``The basketball season has been extremely tough. We've been
inconsistent at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to leave the problems on the outside and focus
on the task at hand on the court. I was able to do that for the
most part. I did slip a couple of games, but I just prayed every
day and had faith that God was going to bring me through.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was exactly the type ``Kim-Bim'' would have loved,
since it was dominated by defense, Perrot's specialty. The Comets
led 33-25 at halftime, and New York missed its first 10 shots of
the second half. Sue Wicks, with 11 points, was the only Liberty
player to finish in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This championship was the hard one because of everything going
on,'' said the Comets' Janeth Arcain. ``It's been a very emotional
season, watching Kim fight her battle. We won this championship for
her, and we know she was watching us today.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The confetti operator did not jump the gun Sunday.
There would be no buzzer-beater 3-pointer. The plastic covering the
Comets' lockers to protect the players' clothes from champagne
remained in place. There were no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Comets defeated the New York Liberty, 59-47, to win
a third straight Women's National Basketball Association
championship before a sellout crowd of 16,285 at the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty guard Teresa Weatherspoon hit a 3-pointer at the end of
this game, but it didn't have the impact that her shot from beyond
half court had in Game 2 on Saturday, giving the Liberty a
last-second victory.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the ball landed on the court Sunday, a mountain of
confetti rained from the ceiling and Comets guard Cynthia Cooper,
the most valuable player of the championship series, jumped on the
scorer's table and waved the No. 10 jersey of teammate Kim Perrot.
Perrot died of brain cancer on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won this one for Kim,'' said Houston forward Tina Thompson,
who scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds. ``All the desire,
passion and strength that she brought to this team we showed
today.''
</P>
<P>
   This championship cemented Houston's place as the elite team of
the WNBA. The Comets are the only champions in the three-year
history of the league, but they are hesitant to begin calling
themselves a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be talking about being a dynasty and being
compared to the Chicago Bulls,'' said Cooper, who rebounded with a
game-high 24 points after a 1-for-10 performance in Game 2. ``We
just want to enjoy this championship, because this championship is
unique and special for a lot of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston coach Van Chancellor said it was an extremely difficult
season, because there were a lot of off-the-court distractions.
Cooper's mother died of cancer in February; Perrot was ill for
seven months before she died last month, and guard Sheryl Swoopes
is going through a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what this team has gone through,'' Chancellor said, ``I
don't know of any group of players anywhere at any time in their
lives that deserve a championship more than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Comets can celebrate their championship victory, the
Liberty has to live with a second loss in a WNBA finals. The
Liberty lost a key player in forward Rebecca Lobo to a
season-ending knee injury in the first game and then struggled
through an 18-14 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, if anyone had said we would have
been here in the championship game, I would have been happy,'' said
forward Sue Wicks, who led the Liberty with 11 points. ``But you
get this far and you go into this game and you want to win it. It
really hurts. The higher you go the more it hurts when you fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty was unable to take advantage of the momentum it
built from a rousing come-from-behind victory capped by
Weatherspoon's buzzer-beater in Game 2. A large contingent of New
York fans, inspired by Weatherspoon's heroics, flew here Sunday
morning for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, had been at
the New York Rangers camp in Vermont where he watched Game 2, but
he was sitting courtside for Sunday's final game.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the first half, the teams played even. But the
Comets slowly pulled away in the last two minutes of the period to
take a 33-25 halftime lead. The teams went cold from the field for
a long stretch near the beginning of the second half, and the
Liberty was never able to close to within fewer than seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score any points and I thought we might be getting
killed,'' Wicks said. ``But I looked up at the scoreboard and they
hadn't scored any points either.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though both teams were battering each other, Houston was
the beneficiary of most of the referees' calls. The Comets were 27
of 32 from the line while the Liberty was just eight of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty coach Richie Adubato had been critical of the
officiating after Game 1 at Madison Square Garden. But he held his
tongue this time. ``I've never seen a score sheet where we have
eight foul shots and they have 27,'' Adubato said. ``I guess I'm
not teaching the right techniques. I guess I have to teach how to
attack the basket harder or how to pump fake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets hit only 15 of 52 shots from the field (28.8 percent)
for the game, including six of 21 in the second half. But in
addition to Cooper's 24 points and Thompson's 13, they got 11
rebounds from forward Tammy Jackson off the bench and 11 points
from Swoopes. It was enough to beat the Liberty, which was doomed
not only by poor shooting from the field (30.9 percent), but by
poor rebounding (eight offensive boards) and turnovers (16).

   ``The big difference is that we were more determined today to
not lose,'' Jackson said. ``We had a mind-set that we were going to
come here and take it to them as hard as we can. It is that whole
refuse-to-lose mentality that has made this team so great over the
past three years.''

DREIFORT'S GOOD STARTS ARE A RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It seems so easy now, watching Darren Dreifort blow
through a lineup the way he did Sunday afternoon at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   But in the politics of baseball, there is nothing simple about
Dreifort's season, which has become the feel-good story of the
Dodgers' second half.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said after the 4-1 victory over the
Chicago Cubs that he absolutely would have moved Dreifort to the
bullpen next season despite the objections of the pitcher and
pressure from his agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone acknowledged that if the Dodgers
had been competitive this year, Dreifort probably would not have
been allowed to remain in the rotation due to control problems.
</P>
<P>
   All the intrigue was magnified by the reality that Dreifort, who
had an ERA over six from mid-April to mid-August, had the leverage
of free agency looming after next season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dreifort (12-13) carries much more than subtle threats. He
has the hammer of a dominant pitcher the Dodgers have waited more
than six years to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on behind the scenes can be so complicated,'' Eric
Karros said. ``There is always so much more, but if you listen to
the (radio) talk shows everything seems so black and white.
Happily, Darren has turned this around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort completed the Dodgers' three-game sweep by limiting the
Cubs to five hits and one run in seven innings, walking one and
striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   In his final inning, he proved further that he has gone from a
thrower with nasty stuff to a pitcher with the makeup to go deep
into games.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, he allowed base hits to Jeff Reed and Jose Nieves.
The bullpen was getting loose, and pitching coach Claude Osteen
went out for a chat.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same scenario that repeatedly resulted in big
innings for the opponent and more frustration for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Liniak, a promising third baseman acquired last week from
Boston in a deal that sent Rod Beck to the Red Sox, was next.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort got him to ground into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers always had balked at sending Dreifort to the bullpen
because their medical staff was worried about the everyday strain
on his surgically reconstructed right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Today) was a good test of how far he has come,'' Johnson
said. ``You want to stay out of the big problems, but you also want
to stretch him out a little. You want to send him off with a
positive thought, but you also want him to keep building on
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills came on to pitch the eighth and Jeff Shaw recovered
from a ninth-inning leadoff single by Sammy Sosa to record his 31st
save.
</P>
<P>
   But this game, and much of the last two months, has been about
Dreifort, who also had a two-run RBI double against Jon Lieber
(8-9) in the Dodgers' four-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I had made this statement in June,'' Dreifort
said, after the Dodgers won for the 12th time in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's low point was June 13, when he allowed seven runs in
just 41/3 innings during a sweep by the A's in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson decided to move Dreifort to the bullpen and promote
Jamie Arnold to the starting rotation. Dreifort was upset. Boras
was on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   But several days before Arnold's start he was needed in long
relief, too long in fact, to make his next assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort returned and limited the Phillies to six hits and one
run in an 8-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been easy since. With Sunday's victory,
Dreifort is still only 6-8 since Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He also got rocked three weeks ago in a game against Atlanta.
But in the last 992/3 innings, he has walked just 26 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the first pitch over and good things happen,''
Dreifort said. ``This has really helped my confidence. It can't
help but improve when things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is easier on the manager, who says the pressure to keep
Dreifort in the rotation was overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort) has an agent, Scott Boras, who wants him starting,
too,'' Johnson said. ``I understand his position, but I don't care
about that. I always want what's best for the team.''

GM OFFERS LIFETIME EMPLOYMENT IN CONTRACT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. has offered the United Automobile
Workers union lifetime employment guarantees for many current
workers as it negotiates a new contract, a GM spokesman confirmed
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   GM, along with DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co., faces the
expiration of its three-year contract with unionized workers on
Sept. 14. In the expiring contract, workers effectively have
lifetime employment because the terms bar automakers from allowing
employment to fall by more than 5 percent nationally or in any of a
dozen regions.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers have found this encumbering, particularly the
regional requirement. The automakers are also worried that renewing
the so-called 95 percent rule would force them to hire tens of
thousands of new workers as they enter a period when up to 6
percent of their work forces will be retiring each year. A huge
generation of autoworkers that was hired in the late 1960s and
early 1970s will become eligible for retirement after 30 years
</P>
<P>
   The lifetime employment offer would cover current GM workers
with more than 10 years of seniority. The proposal's contents were
first reported Sunday by Bloomberg News and were confirmed by Edd
Snyder, a GM spokesman. The UAW did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   GM's proposal is aimed at addressing workers' job security fears
while allowing the company to reduce overall employment more
rapidly. As such, the proposal could drive a wedge between workers,
who want lifetime employment security, and union leaders, who
prefer to keep a large membership base, regardless of which workers
belong.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three companies hopes to be singled out by the union
as the company with which it first reaches a new labor contract.
The union then forces the other two companies to accept similar
terms. That allows the company that goes first to craft terms most
favorable to itself and even to agree to provisions that are
difficult for its competitors. Auto executives and labor officials
expect a decision from the union early this week, perhaps on
Tuesday, on which company, or companies, will take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The union held separate talks with DaimlerChrysler and GM
through Sunday afternoon, company spokesmen said. Talks with Ford
have broken off, suggesting that Ford will not be the lead company,
as it has been for the last two sets of labor negotiations. The
Canadian Automobile Workers union has said it hopes to negotiate
first with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   GM, with a large pool of workers eligible for retirement, also
offered to hire significant numbers of workers in the coming years
and to consider placing new products in unionized factories,
according to a contract proposal made on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would allow GM to continue to contract out
parts-making jobs and to use leaner production methods at
unprofitable small-car factories. The UAW would be invited
periodically to address GM's board. GM also proposed a $500
lump-sum payment plus a 2 percent wage increase for the first year
of the contract, a 3 percent wage increase in the second year and a
$1,500 payment in the third year, and offered to increase pension
payments for those retiring after 30 years by 7.6 percent, to
$2,470 a month.

STREET CHESS THRIVES IN LOS ANGELES CAFES AND PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``It's time for truth,'' exclaimed John Graham in
his best chessboard trash talk, dispatching one opponent and
preparing to play another on a recent fading summer night at Fifth
Street Dick's coffee shop. ``I understand! I understand!'' Graham
continued, keeping what he understood to himself. Then he
questioned the man across from him: ``Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   This is street chess in Los Angeles, a distant cousin of last
month's International Chess Federation championship in Las Vegas.
It is a game played late into the night, not at Caesar's Palace but
in parks and cafes, in doughnut shops and on the beach. The victor
wins bragging rights and the occasional side bet instead of a
$660,000 purse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street chess is much different,'' said Richard Fulton, 54, who
opened Fifth Street Dick's near Fifth Street downtown about eight
years ago after a bout of alcoholism and homelessness. ``It's more
talkative.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where many restaurants stop seating at 11 p.m. and the
bars close at 2 a.m., street chess is an exception to the minimal
late-night street life. The game is as much an obsession as it is
recreation, with players continually trying to best one another,
the clock and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the games continue into the early morning, some until
dawn or later, and each spot has its own culture. At Plummer's Park
in West Hollywood, the lingua franca is Russian, because many of
the competitors are immigrants from the former Soviet Union; at
Tang's Donuts in the Silverlake section of East Hollywood, which is
said to be among the most competitive shops in town, precious
little is said at all.
</P>
<P>
   At Dick's, in the Crenshaw District of south Los Angeles, the
game is played at outdoor tables, on a boisterous wave of
camaraderie with a healthy dose of good-natured razzing thrown in
by players and observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't got a rat's chance in hell,'' said one man as he
hovered over the shoulder of another on Friday night. ``You're
finished. Let me take it. Get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeated, perhaps as much by the running commentary as by the
game, the man vacated his spot.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 36, a construction worker who has been playing chess
since he was 8, is said to be the man to beat here, especially in
the fast, timed matches he calls ``blitz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the competition, I guess,'' Graham said when asked
why he plays. ``The creativity of it. I like to play blitz because
it's less stressful. You play a slow game, you go home at night and
you're playing the game in your head. With blitz, you can't even
remember your move right after you make it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dick's is popular as much for its atmosphere as for the games
themselves. On any given night, a chess player might hear a trumpet
playing softly at the next table, or hear the jazz bands or poetry
readers inside.
</P>
<P>
   The players roll out plastic chessboards on rickety tables put
out by the doughnut shop. Several men, and the group is almost
always male, watch and wait to get in on games, some of which are
slow, deliberate matches, while others are races against the clock.
Some players bet on their games. There is the occasional scrape of
metal upon the art-deco patterned sidewalk, as a defeated player
pushes his chair back and another player replaces him.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern continues until Dick's closes, sometimes as late as
4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they take the tables in, they have to run guys off the
tables because they play to the very last minute,'' said Matt
Gibson, 49, an actor and announcer who has been going to Dick's for
about six years. ``Chess is an obsessive game. Chess players go to
bed at night seeing black and white squares floating in their
heads, games they might have blundered or bungled away. It has to
be played obsessively to even be played moderately well.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ On a weekend when millions of Americans see Labor Day
as little more than an opportunity to shop or go to the beach, the
Rev. Judith Kelsey-Powell tried hard Sunday to reconnect her
congregation to Labor Day's roots.
</P>
<P>
   In a stately Methodist church on this city's South Side, Ms.
Kelsey-Powell told her congregation: ``Over and over again,
brothers and sisters, we are called to discern justice. That's what
Labor Day is about. It's not about unions getting their perks,
although that's part of it. It's about every worker getting what
they need to live with dignity. That is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, she called to the altar Oscar Varnadoe, a
barrel-chested member of a printers' union, and he seconded her
message, declaring that ``all of God's children doing God's work''
should fight for those ``who go to work day in and day out,''
earning little as they humbly toil.
</P>
<P>
   The service was part of a fast-growing nationwide effort in
which clergy members and union members teamed up over the weekend
at more than 600 religious services _ about twice last year's
number _ with the goal of educating congregations on labor matters
and lending the church's moral authority to labor's cause.
Religious leaders and union officials see the services, including
nearly 100 in Chicago, as the biggest step so far toward rebuilding
the mighty labor-clergy alliance that existed decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the labor movement struggles to regain its strength of
yesteryear, it has pushed to forge new bonds with religious
leaders, knowing that they could provide pivotal help to workers in
battles for better wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's effort has begun to pay off, not just with labor-related
sermons but with clergy members who have fasted to support
strikers, joined pro-union sit-ins and pressured corporate
executives to shun a no-holds-barred approach to fighting
unionization.
</P>
<P>
   This renewed cooperation has brought labor and clergy members
closer than at any time since the 1960s, when differences over the
war in Vietnam, union corruption and much of labor's indifference
to poor workers fractured what had been a close alliance in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There has historically been this alliance, but then there came
a serious break,'' said Bishop Jesse DeWitt, a Methodist who is
president of the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice,
a group based in Chicago that promotes labor-religious cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural alliance,'' DeWitt said. ``The whole
Judeo-Christian teaching is about justice for workers, the right
for people to have decent wages, a decent place to live and decent
medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s many liberal clergy members put their energies into
helping the civil rights movement instead of labor, but after
seeing disparities between the rich and poor widen in the 1980s and
1990s, they have re-dedicated themselves to helping low-wage
workers, although not necessarily unions. For example, dozens of
clergy members in DeWitt's group have begun a campaign to pressure
poultry companies to improve conditions for their workers,
unionized or not. His group, with 45 chapters across the nation,
has also coordinated hundreds of labor-related services over the
weekend in a program called ``Labor in the Pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the new cooperation, more labor-related courses
are being taught at seminaries. Such courses were common 60 years
ago when the nation had hundreds of worker priests, whose mission
was to help laborers. In addition, religious leaders and the
AFL-CIO are planning to set up a program in which dozens of
seminary students would spend their summers working with different
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both unions and religious groups are guided by core values,
values that reflect the dignity of work,'' said John J. Sweeney,
the president of the AFL-CIO. ``We both share basic beliefs in
justice and fairness for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor-related services, held at churches, synagogues and
mosques, have gathered cachet with unions leaders, clergy members
and some politicians. Sunday in Detroit, Vice President Al Gore
joined Sweeney at a Roman Catholic service and a Methodist prayer
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   There were labor services in more than 50 cities, including
Atlanta, Cincinnati, Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle. In
New York City, Brian McLaughlin, president of the city's central
labor council, spoke at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights
and Congregation Emunath Israel, an orthodox synagogue in
Manhattan. And officials with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in
Manhattan said on Friday that a labor service was planned for next
Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Some business critics deride this labor-religion partnership,
asserting that unions are manipulating a naive clergy into joining
their selfish battles and that clergy members should not take sides
in complex labor battles in which there is no clear right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who says he is a deeply religious Roman Catholic, has
steadfastly wooed the clergy since he became president of the
AFL-CIO four years ago. Aware that many clergy members had soured
on labor because they saw unions as an arrogant elite of high-paid
auto workers and construction workers, Sweeney has focused on poor,
marginal employees like farm workers, janitors and hotel maids.
These are the workers that the clergy says most need the church's
help.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kelsey-Powell, said, ``I just have a strong feeling
about helping marginalized people wherever they are. But you can't
equate unions with the
</P>
<P>
   As at many other religious services Sunday, her Morgan Park
United Methodist Church was full of talk about Jesus, the
carpenter. Her co-pastor and husband, Keith Powell, recited a
litany, developed at the United Methodist Church's headquarters in
Washington, D.C., asking God to remember ``children whose childhood
has been cut short because they are forced to work,'' workers
``displaced by technical change or global pressure'' and those
``who have been discriminated against as a result of their union
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   After each group was cited, the congregation recited, ``Jesus,
worker and carpenter of Nazareth, hear our prayer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The National Interfaith Committee on Worker Justice began
organizing Labor Day services four years ago, starting with just a
handful. This year, the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist
Church mailed a sample Labor Day message and litany to 5,000
pastors, and 18,600 Catholic churches received a mailing from
Sweeney and Cardinal John O'Connor, called ``Putting Labor into
Labor Day Services.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at Temple Judea Mizpah in Skokie, Ill., Robert
Drizin, a Cook County pubic defender who is a member of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, gave
a talk examining the ties between Judaism and labor. He said that
Moses had led the first recorded labor protest when he shepherded
the Jews out of Egypt to escape slavery under the Pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
   Drizin urged the congregation not to forget how unions had
helped improve conditions when their ancestors worked in garment
shops or other factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very good chance our parents and grandparents were
hard laborers, working six days a week, 15-hour days,'' he said.
``The Jews of those generations played a very important role in
making life better for us. All these benefits we enjoy, you forget
where they come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Spanish services at St. Pius Roman Catholic Church on the
South Side were crowded Sunday, and at both the congregations
listened intently to Veronica Meneses, action coordinator for the
National Farm Worker Ministry, a clergy group dedicated to helping
migrant laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meneses sought to rally the congregants, almost all of them
from Central America, to labor's cause, reminding them that papal
encyclicals and bishop's pastoral letters have praised the role
unions play in defending workers' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they did this with reason,'' Ms. Meneses said, ``because
unions have achieved a lot _ the eight-hour day, the minimum wage,
job security and Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest at St. Pius, the Rev. Charles W. Dahm, said he was
more than glad to invite a labor-oriented speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message of Jesus was working for the poor and the
oppressed and defending their rights,'' he said. ``I should think
that the church has a great responsibility aligning itself with the
workers.''

   Dear Diary:

   My friend Marjorie Schoneboom and I visit Atlantic City, N.J.,
several times a year, staying overnight at a casino hotel. We allot
a certain amount of money for each trip and always resolve that
when it's used up, we'll resist the impulse to withdraw more from
the ATM (strategically placed near the slot machines). We promise
each other we'll simply retire to our room and read. This is a
promise we often break.
</P>
<P>
   On our last trip, Marjorie went through her stake very early in
the evening. Reluctant to stop playing after only an hour in the
casino, she started walking toward the nearest bank machine. I
followed and watched as she stood in front of it a moment debating
with herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you bring a book?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I brought a book,'' she sighed. ``I always bring a
book. But somehow the only thing I've ever been able to read in
Atlantic City is `Do you wish to proceed in English or Spanish?'''

   Sue Shire's 3-year-old granddaughter, Danielle Slap, was looking
out the window into the back yard when she spotted a group of four

There's a daddy, mommy, baby and the baby sitter.''

   William N. Farlie Jr., was racing north on Fifth Avenue, about
to cross 52nd Street despite the traffic signal blinking ``DON'T
WALK.'' As he started out, he heard what he described as a
distinctly New York voice explaining to a cluster of tourists:
``That's what it's like in New York. But you either do it really
well or you get killed.''

the red line zoom up when he switched the thermometer from the cold
water to hot.

   ``Do you know what's happening?'' Mrs. Starobin asked.

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Before I came to New York in 1974, via Portugal and Paris, I had
already traveled in a number of underground transportation systems
_ Paris, London, Madrid and Lisbon. I assumed that in a city like
New York, propelled by big financial resources and modern
technology, the transportation system had attained a high level of
efficiency, comfort and security.
</P>
<P>
   I imagined the New York subway as equipped with fast escalators
descending into vast clean marble chambers. I visualized
sophisticated electronic devices that would quickly tell passengers
where they were and the fastest way to get to their destination. I
expected to ride in sleek and silent subway cars of aerodynamic
design, fresh during hot summer days, warm in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I descended into the subway my impression was
that I had somehow entered an underground construction site. Then I
heard a freaky noise coming from the tunnel as a train rolled in at
high speed, and I thought the price of a token should include ear
protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've taken this noisy aggressive subway almost every
day. I believe it is one of the city's main attractions, reflecting
its fantastic urban anatomy. Now I say: New York subway, I don't
care about your unattractive underground structures, your rats,
your noise and your delays. For it was down there, in a cramped
clanging subway car that in 1980 I met her, Frances, the woman I
love and with whom, for almost 20 years, I have shared the joys and
pains of life.

   A young couple were arguing just as Jon A. Overold was passing
the corner of Broadway and 40th Street. He heard only the following
intriguing sentences before the light changed and he crossed the
street. ``What do you mean it's not your problem?'' the young woman
exclaimed indignantly. ``I am your problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   A friend and I were at the movies, watching ``The Iron Giant''
and sitting among adults, children and adults with children. One
inattentive child, about 4 years old, resorted to playing an
electronic video game that frequently beeped.
</P>
<P>
   A man within earshot implored the child's father to intercede
and stop the noise. The father retorted that it was a children's
movie and his son had a right to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should teach your son how to behave in public,'' the
fuming adult countered. The father counterattacked, saying: ``It's
a kid's movie. I'll punch you in the face, and if you don't shut
up, the police will be called.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally a cost-conscious filmgoer burst out with what was the
common denominator to everyone. He called out loudly: ``$9.50!
$9.50!'' A reminder of the price of the film refocused attention to
the screen. The child's mother put a stop to the electronic play.
Silence was restored.

the driver got out and helped an elderly man with a cane out of the

and handed it over.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, who had been standing by patiently, counted it and
to the amazement of Besen, took out a $10 bill and returned it to
the passenger. ``I'm sure you didn't mean to give me this as a

``A STAR CALLED HENRY'' &QL; 
By Roddy Doyle (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll forgive us if we cut to the chase: This is one of the
best novels we've read all year, and better than Doyle's previous
books, although they were fine indeed. It's broader, richer than
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' and less introspective than the somber
``The Woman Who Walked into Doors.'' Doyle's narrator is Henry
Smart, who tells us the story of the first 20 years of his life. He
begins just before the turn of the century with the meeting of his
parents, a teenage maker of rosary beads and a one-legged bouncer
who turns lowlifes away from a Dublin brothel. They are doomed, and
we know it _ babies arrive sick and die, poverty closes in, and we
see their love fade into the dirt and disease of the Dublin slums.
But before it does, Henry Smart is born, handsome, inexplicably
healthy and full of a promise that is too bright for such a dark
place. By the time he is 5, he is living on the streets, smart but
illiterate, and aware of his own gritty charm. When he is 14, he
takes part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and later becomes a
terrorist for the Irish Republican Army. Through it all, Henry's
savvy, rock-confident voice gathers us in. We know he is telling us
a true story, and yet at the same time spinning a tale _ he
survived childhood, after all, by dazzling and conning the adults
around him. In the end, ``A Star Called Henry'' is not just a novel
about one man but about Ireland itself, from a gifted writer who
knows that misery and laughter are not strangers to one another,
and that even the most rancorous place is not a hell if dreams are
still alive there. This is the first volume of a trilogy that will
take readers through modern Irish history by way of the life of
Henry Smart _ and won't we be glad to see him again. &QL;

<P>
   ``He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers
how much it hurts,' '' John Mackey said. ``He lived by that
philosophy and I always followed that advice.'' Mackey was talking
about Jim Brown, the Cleveland Browns' offensive powerhouse from
1957 to 1965 and the man this book calls ``the greatest pure runner
in the history of the NFL.'' Brown is top dog on the list of the
100 best football players of all time, compiled by editors of the
``Sporting News.'' Unlike its counterpart, last year's ``Baseball's
100 Greatest Players,'' this volume doesn't dabble much in the
early days, although the list has Jim Thorpe (at No. 88), Bronko
Nagurski (35), Don Hutson (6) and Otto Graham (7). Among the top 10
are Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Johnny Unitas, Lawrence Taylor and
Dick Butkus. There are photos and a brief overview of each player's
career, and it's all football _ there's only a mention of the
acting career for which Brown left the game at 29, and no notice at
all of O.J. Simpson's retirement activities. Best of all are ``Top
10'' lists (they range from ``Best Players I've Ever Seen'' to
``Defensive Linemen I Admire'' and ``Smartest Quarterbacks'')
solicited from some of the great players themselves, including
Merlin Olsen, Deacon Jones, Charley Taylor, Lance Alworth, Jack Ham
and Troy Aikman. Clear some time before you pick this one up,
because you won't put it down any time soon. &QL;

   ``THE RIGHT SET'' &QL; 
Edited by Caryl Phillips (Vintage, $14) &QL;

<P>
   We began to enjoy this anthology of writings on tennis round
about Page 45, when James Thurber suddenly appeared and described,
delightfully, the 1926 match between France's Suzanne Lenglen and
American Helen Wills, which caught the world's attention at the
time (Thurber's piece is followed by an essay from Wills herself,
which is also great fun). Earlier essays on the history of the game
have interesting titles (``Lawn Tennis: The Sturdy Bastard'') but
are for tennis zealots. For a more general audience, Phillips
includes excerpts from books by John McPhee, Arthur Ashe, Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Althea Gibson, and writings on
Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker and Andre Agassi. There's
a section on tennis etiquette, with a preponderance of attention
paid to the nasty demeanor of the young John McEnroe, although
there's a short essay by Martin Amis in which those other bad boys,
Connors and Ilie Nastase, are mentioned. It ends with a few pages
from Alistair Cooke, titled ``My Life with Gabriela Sabatini,''
which are blissfully free of bad manners _ just what tennis should
be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WORDS FAIL ME: WHAT EVERYONE WHO WRITES SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
WRITING''By Patricia T. O'Conner (Harcourt Brace, $18.95) &QL;

   ``The best writer may not follow every rule every time,''
O'Conner says, ``but they follow most of them most of the time. And
even if you're a Tolstoy or a Balzac, a Thurber or a McPhee, it
doesn't hurt to learn the rules before you break them.'' O'Conner
was an editor at the ``New York Times Book Review'' before she
wrote her first book, the very popular ``Woe Is I: The
Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English.'' Now,
she's a self-described ``grammar maven'' (she's kidding) who
sometimes writes the ``Times' ''``On Language'' column when William
Safire is on vacation. She's obviously following her own advice _
know your audience _ because her approach to words and writing is
as engaging as it is authoritative, and she quotes lots of her
(and, presumably, your) favorite writers. Her justification for
writing this book, oddly enough, is the Internet _ we're all
writing more now that we have laptops and send e-mail, so we need
to brush up our skills. But truly, no hook was necessary. O'Conner
can be our grammar maven any day. &QL;

A FAMILIAR CHANT GREETS GRAND SLAM BY NEW MET
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first the chants came weakly, perhaps even
insincerely. ``Darryl, Darryl,'' a modest number of fans shouted
Sunday as the Mets' Darryl Hamilton squared himself in the batter's
box against Darryl Kile, his former Colorado Rockies teammate.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, be it Queens or the Bronx, such cheers are usually
reserved for Darryl Strawberry, and Hamilton, a Met for barely a
month, knew it.
</P>
<P>
   But with one surprisingly mighty swing, Hamilton made the chant
his, at least for a day. Parking Kile's 86 mph fastball into the
Mets' bullpen behind the right-field fence, Hamilton recorded the
third grand slam of his career to catapult the Mets to a 6-2
victory and put an exclamation point on what has been a terrific
beginning with his new club.
</P>
<P>
   As Hamilton, who has batted .387 since being acquired from the
Rockies on July 31, rounded the bases, pumping his fist, the once
mild chant turned into a roar delivered by 49,117 fans at Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that came from my man who wore 18 here,'' Hamilton
said, referring to the chant and to Strawberry. ``I recall it very
well. I'm a big fan of his. The fans here have been great to me.
It's been unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's blast, just his eighth home run this season,
highlighted an outstanding day for the Mets. Masato Yoshii turned
in another fine pitching performance, and animated reliever John
Franco returned to action.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with Arizona beating Atlanta, 7-5, the Mets gained a full
game on the Braves in the National League East and now stand 2 1/2
games behind them. Cincinnati, which defeated Philadelphia, remains
four games behind the Mets in the NL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who less than a month ago was pitching from the bullpen,
continued a compelling bid for a spot in the postseason rotation.
Mixing his fastball and forkball in masterly fashion, he kept the
Rockies' batters guessing all afternoon, allowing two runs on six
hits and two walks while striking out nine. Yoshii improved to 3-1
with a 1.57 earned run average in five starts since regaining his
starter's role on Aug. 13 after replacing an injured Rick Reed in
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii's personal- and team-best scoring streak of 161/3
scoreless innings was broken in the sixth inning when he
surrendered a two-run homer to Vinny Castilla. But by then, the
Mets had already taken a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was calling a great game, mixing up fastballs and
forkballs really well,'' Yoshii, referring to catcher Mike Piazza,
said through his interpreter, Kota Ishijima. ``Whenever they were
waiting for fastballs, he was calling for the forkball, and vice
versa. The pitch to Castilla that he hit out was a forkball and he
was waiting for it. That was a mistake, but everything else was
good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly delighted with Yoshii's resurgence, Mets manager
Bobby Valentine remained noncommittal about the postseason. ``It's
a long ways away,'' Valentine said. ``But we need him now, and he
has risen to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine called for Franco in the eighth inning, and the antsy
left-hander sprinted toward the mound while waving his glove in the
wind. It was Franco's first appearance for the Mets since being
placed on the disabled list with a sprained finger on July 3, and
the fans _ who have not always been kind to him _ cheered madly.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously on an adrenaline rush, Franco got Dante Bichette and
Todd Helton to ground out before walking Castilla and surrendering
a double down the left-field line to Edgardo Clemente. First
baseman John Olerud saved the inning by making a beautiful grab of
a line shot by Henry Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really nervous,'' Franco said. ``This is the first time
in a long time that I can really smile and say I contributed to the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kile's 8-13 record and 6.33 ERA are not very impressive,
defeating him was huge for the Mets. Kile had been something of an
ace against the Mets, going 9-2 with a 3.21 ERA against them in his
career. He had not lost at Shea Stadium since 1992, defeating the
Mets in their home park four straight times.
</P>
<P>
   A bit wild, Kile showed signs of breaking in the fourth when he
walked two batters, but he escaped unscathed. He was not as
fortunate in the fifth. After striking out Yoshii, he was touched
for a single by Rickey Henderson and then loaded the bases by
walking Edgardo Alfonzo and Olerud. Piazza and Ventura followed
with run-scoring singles before Hamilton brought everyone home.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockies arrived in New York before the series began
late last week, some of them were angry because Hamilton had said
his former team was unsound fundamentally. So he made it a point to
visit the visitors' clubhouse and assure the Rockies that he had
included himself in the comments.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, whose last grand slam was on Aug. 11, 1995, while
playing with Milwaukee, also added that his uncharacteristic fist
pump while rounding the bases was not meant to taunt his former
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see a grand slam too often, so I'm not trying to
show up anybody or make anybody feel bad,'' he said. ``We were
getting some runs and, hey, it's a grand slam. I can count on one
hand the number of times I've done it. It doesn't happen very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do chants of ``Darryl'' for someone other than
Strawberry. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their blue and white habits glowing against the gray
sky, the Sisters of Life radiated joy outside St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Sunday. While the initial news about Cardinal John
O'Connor had seemed grim _ a tumor had been removed from his brain
_ subsequent word had been more uplifting. The tumor had been
confined to the brain's surface; the cardinal was home from the
hospital and might be at St. Patrick's to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   For the 47 nuns of the order, the cardinal's well-being is a
deeply personal subject, because in 1991 he started their religious
community, which is dedicated to defending human life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal and his message are all about the dignity of each
human person _ the born and the unborn, the chronically ill, the
elderly and the frail,'' she said. ``Now I'm sure he has a unique
solidarity with those threatened by illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the city Sunday, the cardinal's health was pondered and
prayed over, his name added to the list of the sick at countless
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do pray to God he will be spared many more years,'' Lumen
Castaneda, 64, said at the Church of St. Brendan in the Bronx,
where she is the Filipino parish leader. ``We were getting used to
the fact that he was retiring this year'' _ the cardinal turns 80
in January _ ``but he still wanted to serve the people of New York.
But with this, I think he'll be retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cardinal, while secluded at his home behind St.
Patrick's, took pains Sunday to make clear that he is anything but
retired. A statement issued by his office and read at a Mass at St.
Patrick's concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal has great and hopeful anticipation for the future
and as has always been the case, expects to serve as the archbishop
of New York at the pleasure of our Holy Father, Pope John Paul II.
He is in no hurry to leave office nor is he in any hurry to reduce
his workload once he has completed the recuperative period.''
</P>
<P>
   There were even rumors that the cardinal planned to make a
public appearance Sunday morning, but the archdiocese's spokesman,
Joseph Zwilling, said that had not been planned.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the cardinal's office said he would resume his
regular Mass schedule next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was hospitalized for 11 days, and was sent home on
Saturday. He is to undergo radiation therapy as an outpatient.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on the cardinal's condition issued by Zwilling on
Saturday night did not say when or by whom the tumor operation had
been performed, and gave no details about the precise size,
location or nature of the tumor, or the medical prognosis. Zwilling
said he could not release any more medical information.
</P>
<P>
   Some parishioners around the city expressed anger that the
cardinal's condition had been shrouded in mystery. Until Saturday,
the archdiocese had given the impression that he was at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center only for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Patrick Boyle, 59, the pastor at St. Brendan's and the
vicar of the northwest Bronx, said that the cardinal had always
shown extraordinary vigor and would probably maintain a presence
even while undergoing radiation therapy.

CAMPAIGN OF TERROR RAGES IN E. TIMOR  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Overwhelmingly defeated at the polls by a people
desperate to cast off a quarter-century of harsh rule, vengeful
pro-Indonesian gunmen unleashed a terror campaign in East Timor on
Sunday, besieging a UN compound and a Catholic bishop's home,
reportedly slaughtering 100 people in a church and threatening to
massacre the pro-independence leadership, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people tried to flee the violence, and
Australia announced it would attempt an airlift Monday of
nonessential UN personnel and Australians.
</P>
<P>
   The descent into bloodshed, arson, and looting began hours after
the UN announced a landslide victory for independence in last
week's referendum on the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified witnesses interviewed by telephone from East Timor's
capital, Dili, said Indonesian police and soldiers stood by or
joined in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen laid siege to the offices of a human rights group, the
Australian Embassy, former US President Jimmy Carter's election
observers group, a hotel for foreigners, and refugee centers,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Other gunmen fired on at least 1,000 refugees camped out beside
UN headquarters, sending them scurrying over the razor wire into
the compound.
</P>
<P>
   A Western military officer in Dili said plainclothes Indonesian
soldiers were among those rampaging through the capital Sunday. The
officer said he spotted Indonesian military weapons, and recognized
members of the elite Kopassus commando branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian military is making an example of East Timor to
all other provinces who want freedom,'' said a member of the
National Council of Timor Resistance, speaking by telephone.
``They're saying, `We'll give you independence _ we'll kill the lot
of you!' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to verify reports of massacres early Monday,
but National Council officials said 100 people were slain in a
church in the town of Same, south of Dili, and another 24 were
killed in Atsabe, to the southwest. The woman who performed a song
advertising the UN-sponsored ballot also was hunted down and
killed, National Council officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 79 percent of East Timor's 450,000 voters voted for
freedom from Indonesia, which has ruled the territory on the
eastern end of the vast Indonesian archipelago since invading it in
1975. An estimated 200,000 East Timorese _ a quarter of the
population _ have died of civil war, famine, and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an offer of independence by Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie if East Timorese spurned continued union with Jakarta, many
Indonesians fear that if East Timor goes free, other restive
provinces _ such as resource-rich Aceh and Irian Jaya _ also might
demand independence.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in Dili said armed men were going door to door
searching for independence supporters, and had torched the Dili
office of the Nobel Peace laureate Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo,
possibly killing people inside. The bishop's residence, where a few
thousand people were sheltering, was surrounded by men with heavy
weapons, cannon, and mortars, people inside said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like'' Indonesian military commander ``General
Wiranto has lost control. He told Bishop Belo that he gave the
order to stop'' the siege, ``but it hasn't stopped,'' said a member
of the CNRT, National Council of Timor Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the UN compound in Dili, where more than 1,000 UN
staff and civilian refugees were holed up in darkness, UN political
officer Geoffrey Robinson said late Sunday night that pro-Jakarta
militiamen surrounded his compound and had been firing weapons
almost nonstop for the last 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're virtual hostages here,'' Robinson said, as gunfire rang
out in the background. ``The militias _ with official acquiesence
or approval _ are willing to target the UN . . . as well as
international observers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two observers from the Carter Center were attacked by militias
Sunday as they tried to evacuate local employees on a ferry. When
they turned to nearby military officers for help, they were laughed
at. When they turned to police, the officers drove away, the Carter
Center observers reported.
</P>
<P>
   A UN convoy evacuating its workers from the western town of
Liquica on Saturday was fired upon first by militiamen, and then by
Indonesian police and soldiers, Robinson said. An American UN
officer was hit in the attack, and the UN helicopter that evacuated
him later was fired on as well. Militias also fired at UN vehicles
trying to get food and supplies in Dili Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian police have failed utterly to fulfill their
obligations'' to keep the peace, as stipulated in a May 5 agreement
signed at the UN, Robinson said angrily. ``Now it's time for
governments like the United States to act very, very swiftly to
insist on alternative security arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an apparent about-face from statements a few days ago,
General Wiranto reportedly rejected calls for an international
peacekeeping force Sunday, telling reporters that East Timor was
still part of Indonesia until the national assembly ratifies last
week's vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said some 1,000 people, including local and
international UN staff who had been evacuated from numerous rural
offices, were sleeping on cardboard boxes in the Dili compound.
About 60 UN workers, plus most journalists and international
observers _ several of whom were attacked in plain view and without
intervention by police _ have been evacuated already from East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   At least four local UN workers have been slain and others are
missing since Monday's vote, but Robinson said the UN will not pull
out. ``We're certainly not going to let a bunch of street thugs
chase us out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance leader Jose Ramos Horta, who shared the Nobel Prize
with Bishop Belo, said it is not ``street thugs'' who are
orchestrating the terror, but rather the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not anarchy _ this is one-way violence, state-directed
violence against innocent women and children, against the church,
against the UN,'' Ramos Horta asserted in a telephone interview
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos Horta said that in a July meeting, General Wiranto told
him, jailed resistance leader Xanana Gusmao, and others that he
could disarm the militias ``in two days _ I just need to order the
commanders in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's getting ignored by Kopassus,'' the special forces
command that is led by rival generals, Ramos Horta said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported scores of killings in the outskirts of Dili
and in strongholds of pro-Indonesia forces in the south and west.
``There is every indication that a massacre is taking place, staged
by military forces,'' Ana Gomes, Lisbon's diplomatic envoy to
Jakarta, told Portugal's TSF radio. ``Over 100 dead would be a
conservative estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how quickly international peacekeepers would have to come
in to restore order, a National Council of Timor Resistance member
said resignedly, ``They're not going to make it in time. It's too
late for peacekeeping. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said food and water shortages could spark a
humanitarian crisis. The neighboring province of West Timor was
bracing for 100,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, a commander of East Timor's pro-independence
guerrillas said his fighters would take up arms again unless the
violence stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not accept further humiliation from the Indonesians,''
Taur Matan Ruak, commander of the Falintil guerrillas, told
Portuguese Radio Renascenca. ``We will use whatever is at hand _
machetes, stones, arms.''

   &UR; PROTEIN _  &LR; DNA research has spawned a new effort to unravel the
secrets of proteins. As the genome map nears completion, other
researchers are studying the essential building blocks produced by
DNA: the roughly 100,000 proteins that make up every muscle, nerve
and fiber in our bodies. Protein mappers have dubbed their study
``proteomics.'' Proteomics has same goal as genomics: to identify
the causes and possible cures for disease, and speed up the process
of developing new drugs. It might be years before this effort leads
to new drugs, but leading scientists think this new field with the

VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN EAST TIMOR AND MANY ARE KILLED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As the outside world looked on in horror
and the Indonesian government promised East Timor protection but
evaded fulfilling those pledges, armed thugs systematically took
over the island territory on Sunday, killing and terrorizing
residents and trapping U.N. workers in their compound.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, there were many reports of large numbers of
killings, with an overall death toll reaching perhaps into the
hundreds. In New York the U.N. Security Council held an emergency
evening session to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, the territory's capital, armed men were said to have
fired into crowds of refugees at the port and at a school beside
the U.N. compound and to have set fire to a building adjacent to
the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese, where refugees had
taken shelter. The gunmen were reported to be massacring residents
in the pro-independence neighborhood of Becora.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of killings and terror in other towns,
including an unconfirmed report that 100 people had been killed in
the town of Same and 20 in the town of Atsabe.
</P>
<P>
   The reports could not be confirmed, because foreigners have been
evacuated from most rural areas and roads are blocked by militia
gangs. But Ana Gomes, Portugal's envoy to Jakarta, told a
Portuguese radio station that ``over 100 dead would be a
conservative estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Several top Indonesian officials, including the armed forces
chief and the foreign minister, flew to Dili for a brief visit and
promised to restore order. But they did not venture beyond the tiny
airport as the irregular militias _ created and armed by the
military _ fired their weapons and burned houses in the streets
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials estimated that in Dili some 25,000 people had
taken shelter where they could, and witnesses reported thousands
huddled in police headquarters, the U.N. compound and the few other
sanctuaries available. Terrified parents tried to pass their
children over coils of razor wire outside the besieged U.N.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Australia said it was sending an aircraft to evacuate its
nationals and all nonessential U.N. staff. Australia and nearby
islands were reported to be preparing to receive as many as 100,000
East Timorese evacuees.
</P>
<P>
   Security worsened, rather than improved, after the visit of the
Indonesian dignitaries, said Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of
Portugal. His country abandoned East Timor as a colony in 1975,
opening the way for Indonesia to invade and declare the island
territory its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for Indonesia itself and the international
community to understand that Indonesia is no longer able to keep
law and order,'' Guterres told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   In a referendum last Monday, 78.5 percent of the East Timorese
who voted favored breaking free as a separate nation. But that
vote, administered by the United Nations, does not take effect
until it is ratified by the Indonesian Parliament later this year,
leaving the territory of 800,000 people in a dangerous limbo after
decades of virtual civil war between pro-independence forces and
the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem this weekend spurred increasing calls for the United
Nations or individual countries _ like nearby Australia, which has
volunteered its armed forces _ to send in peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Minister Ali Alatas asserted Indonesia's
responsibility for East Timor and said no foreign forces would be
allowed into the territory. Other officials insisted that they
would maintain order on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, said, ``I call on those
people causing the deteriorating situation to stop their actions.''
But as of Sunday evening, residents reached by telephone said the
shooting and burning continued.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's apparent yearlong policy of issuing statements but
taking little action to curb militia violence drew expressions of
exasperation from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about the continuing violence,'' President
Clinton said, ``and the people who lost the election should
recognize that they lost it fair and square and should now find a
way to go forward peacefully. The Indonesians should do all they
can to keep the peace and prevent the bloodshed. They have the
capacity, I think, that would enable them to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gomes, the Portuguese diplomat, placed the responsibility
for the violence directly on the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an uncontrolled chaos,'' she said. ``It is a
provoked, planned and orchestrated chaos by military forces. They
want to scare the international community _ the observers and the
journalists _ to get them out and massacre the East Timorese.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents said Sunday evening that part of the Mahkota Hotel,
where most journalists stayed until they were evacuated Sunday, had
been burned. They said the territory's main human rights
organization, Yayasan Hak, had been attacked with stones and
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   There were several reports Monday morning of sustained
automatic-weapons fire overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Given the serious damage that is being done to Indonesia's
international standing, with the eyes of the United Nations and the
foreign press focused on East Timor, a number of Indonesian and
foreign analysts said they found the government's motives difficult
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything more damning to the image of
Indonesia than this sort of thing,'' said James Fox, director of
Pacific and Asian studies at the Australian National University,
who was in East Timor for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't take much to provide law and order,'' he said.
``There is obviously an unwillingness to do it. Either they don't
realize the cost that this will entail or they have decided they'll
pay that cost.''

<P>
   The Indonesian military has a long and intense attachment to
East Timor, where thousands of its men have died and others have
made their careers. The military recruited and armed the militia
groups early this year after President B.J. Habibie suddenly
announced that he would let East Timor go free if it voted down his
offer of more autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   With some members of the military viewing the possibility of
independence as a defeat, their aim in creating the militias
appeared to be to influence or derail the vote through a campaign
of intimidation and terror.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also say that the military, which traditionally
has helped keep together the diverse 13,000 islands that make up
Indonesia, fears that if East Timor gains independence, other parts
of the nation will seek to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the two days since the result of the vote was announced early
Saturday, the militias have run wild. ``To what end?'' Fox said.
``This is so counterproductive and self-defeating. It has to be
stubbornness and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos drove some 5,000 East Timorese to flee Sunday aboard
inter-island ferries, according to reports from Dili, although
militia thugs reportedly prevented some people from departing.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,000 people took shelter at the compound of the
territory's Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop Carlos Belo, who in 1996
shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the pro-independence activist
Jose Ramos Horta.
</P>
<P>
   The police said as many as 15,000 people were crowded into the
grounds of the main police headquarters. More than 1,000 broke
their way into the U.N. compound, where most of the remaining U.N.
workers and a handful of journalists also took shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more journalists, aid workers and U.N. officials who
had completed their electoral work fled Sunday aboard chartered
aircraft. As their planes took off, they could see flames and smoke
rising from fires burning within and around the outskirts of the
tiny seaside capital.
</P>
<P>
   But David Wimhurst, the chief spokesman for the United Nations
in East Timor, said no U.N. staff were leaving before their time
was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to stay put,'' he said by telephone from within the
besieged compound. ``All this violence is clearly an attempt to
intimidate us out of here, and we have resisted this
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The United Nations is obviously doing everything it
can to put pressure on the Indonesian government to maintain law
and order, but it is increasingly apparent that these appeals are
falling on deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those calling for quick intervention by the United Nations
was Ramos Horta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing an imminent, extraordinary humanitarian
catastrophe right under the eyes of the Security Council, and they
are not acting promptly to stop the killings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whole villages have fled for safety into the barren hills, and
Ramos Horta said that in the coming days ``thousands will be
starving and dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Belo echoed his call for help. ``This is the time that we badly
need some peacekeeping troops in this region to protect ordinary
people who have no weapons, such as children, women and the
elderly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials said they had prepared an intervention
force, but Prime Minister John Howard said Sunday, ``You can't go
into the territory of another country without that country's
approval, and East Timor remains a part of Indonesia until a formal
act of separation takes place.''

FINANCIER WANTED IN FRAUD CASE IS CAUGHT IN GERMANY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Connecticut financier Martin Frankel's four-month run through
Europe ahead of the FBI ended Saturday, when German authorities
arrested him at a deluxe lakefront hotel in Hamburg. Frankel went
peacefully, saying, ``You got me,'' authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest essentially ends the career of a man whom associates
have depicted as simultaneously predatory and hapless _ who pulled
off what could turn out to be the biggest insurance heist in
history, authorities say, but whose flight was repeatedly stalled
because he had trouble making up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Extradition proceedings will begin this week against Frankel on
federal charges of money laundering and wire fraud. The process
could go on for months, said Lisa Bull, an FBI spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was accompanied by a woman, identified by the FBI in
Connecticut as Cynthia Allison, 35. Allison was using the alias
Susan Kelly, the FBI said. She was detained for questioning but
later released.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel has been missing since May 5, when police responded to a
report of fire at his abandoned Greenwich mansion and found a file
cabinet and fireplaces full of burning documents. Insurance
regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least
$215 million from a dozen small insurance companies, although a
lawsuit filed by several of these companies put the figure much
higher, at $915 million, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Clues suggested that Frankel had fled the country in a state of
great anxiety. Among the papers police reported seizing in the
mansion were personalized astrological charts drawn to answer the
questions ``Will I go to prison?'', ``Will Tom turn me in?'',
``Should I wire money back from overseas?'', and ``Will I be
safe?'' A to-do list, authorities said, included the item ``Launder
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Later reports had him hiding out in Italy, living off a cache of
diamonds in the company of two women picked from a number of female
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   A New Haven lawyer, Hugh Keefe, who agreed to represent Frankel
in a phone conversation after Frankel left Greenwich, said he is
following his client's case ``100 percent'' through press accounts.
He said that he had not been officially informed of his client's
arrest, and that had no idea what Frankel's state of mind was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew, I wouldn't tell you. But it's easy for me, because
I don't know,'' Keefe said. ``I've never met Marty Frankel.''
</P>
<P>
   Keefe said Frankel was arraigned Sunday on charges of possessing
a fake British passport.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Toledo, Ohio, will return to the United States as
an object of fascination to people who have followed reports on his
case, and who have heard about his multiple aliases and grandiose
misrepresentations. At his parents' home in Toledo, a woman
answering the telephone said the family would not comment on his
arrest out of concern for their ``safety and privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But to those who say they were ripped off by Frankel, the arrest
is good news. Ted Bitter, a tool and die maker from Millbrook,
Ohio, said he knew Frankel could not have kept running forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was inevitable, because Marty Frankel is physically
and mentally weak. He just doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to
see something like this through,'' said Bitter, who won damages
from Frankel in 1991 after bringing a suit against him for a loss
of $64,000 he said he incurred when Frankel was his broker.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter said he had been dazzled initially by Frankel's knowledge
of the market, and later came to believe that he was too panicky
and indecisive to use that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   George Dale, insurance commissioner for the state of
Mississippi, said Frankel's capture does not mean a lot unless the
state can recoup the $187 million Frankel allegedly took from three
Mississippi insurance companies. After Frankel's scam collapsed,
the insurance companies went into receivership, requiring the state
to pay out insurance claims to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Dale said the loss would be spread out among taxpayers. But
Frankel deserves to be punished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a kook, but I think he's a genius,'' Dale said.
``Frankly, knowing what we know about his lifestyle, I really
thought he would have committed suicide before they were able to
catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers regretted the end of the chase. It's not
uncommon for the flight of a high-profile fugitive to become a
matter of public fascination, such as Robert Vesco, the 1970s
wheeler-dealer who eluded federal authorities for more than two
decades before being arrested in Cuba in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of like crooks who get away with it,'' said Arthur
Herzog, who wrote ``Vesco: From Wall Street to Castro's Cuba _ The
Rise, Fall and Exile of the King of White-Collar Crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a certain charm,'' he said. ``That's why they get
away with it.''

GORE PLAYS DOWN SHOWING   IN POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to rebut any suggestion that his candidacy
is in trouble, Vice President Al Gore on Sunday dismissed the
implications of a pre-primary poll in New Hampshire showing he is
in a statistical tie with Bill Bradley. Aides insisted that Gore is
``very pleased'' with the progress of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Bradley seized upon the Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll of
likely primary voters as evidence that their candidate's
unconventional summerlong effort to contact tens of thousands of
New Hampshire Democrats and independents has succeeded
dramatically. The former New Jersey senator plans to formally kick
off his presidential campaign on Wednesday from his hometown of
Crystal City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the `wise guys' said it is too early for that, but I
just think they are dead wrong and I think the voters in New
Hampshire are paying a lot of attention,'' said Mark Longabaugh,
Bradley's New Hampshire campaign director.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two and a half months, Longabaugh said, Bradley
supporters in New Hampshire have distributed 100,000 leaflets,
knocked on 35,000 doors, and spoken to 10,000 people, with
thousands of possible supporters invited by telephone to attend
town meetings with the candidate. Often, candidates wait until the
fall to launch such an intensive effort to identify possible
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed Gore leading Bradley 40 percent to 36 percent,
with a margin of error of 5 percentage points. The survey also
showed Texas Governor George W. Bush maintaining a wide lead over
his GOP rivals. The poll, conducted Aug. 27 to 31, surveyed 400
likely Democratic voters and 400 likely Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking to reporters in Point Pleasant, N.J., said,
``I was pleased by the poll, but it was only a snapshot in time. We
are building in New Hampshire and over time we hope we will be
stronger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman said the vice president is not concerned about
the results. ``We are very pleased with where we are in New
Hampshire,'' said a Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane, who was traveling
with Gore at a Detroit campaign stop Sunday. ``We are engaged in a
dialogue with the New Hampshire people on the type of change that
will work for the working families. We will continue to focus on
issues important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the closeness of the poll, Lehane said, ``Various polls
in New Hampshire have shown the vice president with a very
substantial lead. We all know that these numbers will probably
tighten, but the vice president, from what we have seen, remains
very well positioned with both primary voters and general-election
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   One Gore aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
campaign had been surprised at the closeness of the poll, asserting
that Gore's just-completed internal polling shows that the vice
president maintains a double-digit lead in New Hampshire. Campaign
aides said they have put an extraordinary focus on the Granite
State, with Gore's next visit scheduled Friday. Bradley next visits
the state in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bradley's campaign has had a chicken-and-egg
problem: Many potential supporters tell the campaign they want to
back the former senator but they want assurance that he has a
realistic chance of winning the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bradley has embarked on a two-part strategy to show
that he has a chance. First, the former National Basketball
Association star surprised the Democratic establishment with his
fund-raising capabilities, proving that he has enough support to
come up with the $25 million that experts say is needed to run a
credible primary campaign. Second, Bradley has focused heavily on
the first-caucus state of Iowa and the first-primary state of New
Hampshire, believing that a strong showing in those states will
convince possible supporters elsewhere that he can win.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that Bradley appears to be benefiting from a
desire among New Hampshire Democrats for a political change. While
New Hampshire is enjoying a 2.5 percent unemployment rate, the poll
found only 21 percent of Democrats saying they want to stay the
course and keep current government officials, while 39 percent said
it was time for a change. The poll found that Bradley was
especially strong among independents, leading Gore 51 to 31
percent. New Hampshire allows independents to switch their
affiliation at the polling place during primaries, making them an
important target.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has a well-established tradition of using its
influence as the first-primary state to send a message to the
political establishment. In 1984, Gary Hart upset former vice
president Walter F. Mondale to win the Granite State contest.
Mondale, who questioned Hart's lack of specifics by asking
``Where's the beef?'', went on to win the nomination but lost the
election to President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley hopes to avoid such a challenge by outlining a series of
specific policies throughout the fall. Meanwhile, campaign aides
Sunday were exuberant that months of hard work in New Hampshire had
produced a payoff in the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to convince people we were going to work extremely
hard,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said. ``We knew we had to
start early. We always have reservations about the significance of
polls, but this is a good validation of the inroads we think we are
making.''

 RISE OF REGIONAL AIRPORTS CUTS INTO BOSTON TRAFFIC
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ Thanks to Southwest Airlines and a booming economy, New
England's regional airports are starting to ease some of the burden
on Boston's Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary traffic projections from the Federal Aviation
Administration indicate Logan will grow more slowly than
Massachusetts Port Authority officials had expected over the next
10 to 15 years, in large part because fast-growing airports in
Manchester and near Providence are picking up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   The projections indicate Logan will handle 33.6 million
passengers in 2010, up almost 27 percent from what it handled last
year. But that is still about 4 million passengers fewer than
Massport's most conservative projection for that year.
</P>
<P>
   Logan's share of the New England air passenger market has
dropped from 69 percent to 62 percent over the past four years and
is expected to keep dropping as regional airports continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Kinton Jr., aviation director at Logan, said the
projections do not mean Logan can shelve plans for a fiercely
debated new runway, but he said they are the first signs that
regionalization is working. ``The regionalization effort was never
meant to stop Logan from growing,'' he said. ``Logan is going to
continue to grow, but at a smaller pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA forecasts an annual growth rate at Logan of 2.4 percent
over the next 10 years, dropping slightly to 2.27 percent if the
projection is extended to 2015. Kinton said the forecasts mean that
in some years Logan will experience little or no growth. He also
said the forecasts take into account the development of high-speed
rail service to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kinton credits Southwest Airlines and the booming economy for
boosting regionalization. ``It couldn't have been better timing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest launched service at T.F. Green Airport in Warwick,
R.I., in October 1996. With its low fares and strong performance
numbers, it has become the leading carrier there, ousting US
Airways from the top perch this year.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important than Southwest's rise is that US Airways
and most other airlines at Green have also grown. In other words,
Southwest has grown rapidly, but not at the expense of other
airlines operating out of Green.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic at Green has almost doubled since Southwest's arrival,
and the FAA projects 5.1 percent annual growth over the next 10
years. The forecasts project Green will handle 8 million passengers
by 2010. Airport officials say nearly half of Green's passengers
are from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is unfolding in Manchester, where Southwest
launched service in June 1998. In July, the latest period for which
figures are available, Southwest carried 87,597 passengers. US
Airways remained the top carrier with 90,000 passengers, but only
with the help of its commuter business.
</P>
<P>
   For July, air traffic overall at Manchester was up 17 percent
over July 1998; for the year so far it was up 77 percent. The FAA
projects an annual growth rate of 7.2 percent at Manchester over
the next 10 years, with the airport handling 3.6 million passengers
by 2010, up from 1.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is surprising that the passenger growth at
Green and Manchester has not caused Logan's traffic to hold steady
or decline. But officials at all three airports and at Southwest
Airlines say the low fares available at Green and Manchester are
not just pulling customers away from Logan but putting more people
in airplane seats who normally would not have flown.
</P>
<P>
   The real test of regionalization may come when the economy slows
down. ``Airlines are quick to cut back at regional airports and
maintain services at more dominant airports when the economy
softens,'' Kinton said. ``If Green and Manchester can keep growing
or at least hang on to the passengers they've got, that will tell a
lot about the success of regionalization.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ True to the warning of the tournament's in-house
radar sensors, an ill-intentioned weather system clamped down on
the U.S. Open and caused a case of vapor lock on Sunday. Dozens of
matches were delayed by showers, dozens more were postponed, and
according to the disgruntled players who actually experienced the
banana-peel conditions underfoot, their best efforts were sabotaged
by Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in her life, 15th-seeded Amelie Mauresmo
experienced the trauma of staring down a trio of match points
before, during and after a rain delay. She failed to survive it and
was toppled by Germany's 27th-ranked Anke Huber, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   For the umpteenth time in her life, Mary Joe Fernandez
experienced a tennis-inflicted injury, but she blamed this one on a
slippery court and a second-set rain delay that was officially
declared an instant too late to save her. The tumble she took on
the rain-slicked Arthur Ashe Stadium destroyed her momentum,
strained her left quadriceps, and gave third-seeded Venus Williams
the extra incentive necessary to pull off a 2-6, 6-1, 6-0 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely related to the rain,'' a resigned Fernandez said of
her injury. ``As soon as it starts to drizzle, the lines get very
slippery, the court itself gets very slippery.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who chided herself for not requesting a second-set
stoppage the way she had in the first, said: ``It was too slippery.
But you know, once you get started, you want to keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   A combination of patience and pinpoint aggression gained the
38th-ranked Fernandez the 27-minute first set, where Williams
committed 18 unforced errors. But the 19-year-old Floridian had
already begun to regroup and owned a 2-0 edge in the second set
when, with Williams serving at deuce under increasingly drizzly
skies, Fernandez fell to the court while attempting a running
backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Her left foot slipped and twisted beneath her as she fell, and
when she hit the court, she sat there immobile until a trainer was
summoned. Williams walked over to check that the injury wasn't
serious, and then went to her change-over chair to wait for
Fernandez to exit the court with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the point, it just started coming down much
harder; the match would have stopped after that point, but it was
in between the point where all the damage came,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes later, with the rain in abeyance and the court
wiped dry, their match resumed, but when Williams picked up the
pace, Fernandez couldn't follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened,'' Fernandez said. ``Bad luck. That's the end of
it. I'm not going to overpower Venus Williams.'' Fernandez, who
also had failed to outwit Serena Williams at the French Open before
retiring with a right abductor strain, said, ``If this is the worst
thing that's going to happen to me in my lifetime, I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strafed by drizzle, the 20-year-old Mauresmo, shakier on these
hard courts than she was in her breakthrough run to the Australian
Open final, had just finished saving one match point and faced two
more when she and Anke Huber were yanked off Louis Armstrong
Stadium for a 22-minute rain break that neither of them welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   When they reconvened, Mauresmo served herself out of immediate
danger at 3-5 of the second set only to grant Huber _ the same
spoiler whose third-round ouster of eight-seeded Jana Novotna left
the Czech veteran pondering retirement _ three more match points.
Huber's latest upset left the French loser visibly irked and sent
the 24-year-old winner into the first Open quarterfinal of her
decade-long career.
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo felt the intermittent weather interruptions undermined
her concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know if you're going to get on or not, if it's going
to rain again or not,'' Mauresmo said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Huber allowed the inclement atmosphere to aggravate her:
``I was getting really nervous. I said to myself when it was
raining, `Come on, keep quiet, concentrate, take it easy,' but
somehow I couldn't. Before the match, I just wait; that's not a big
problem. I think when the match started and you have to stop,
that's much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranked a career-best sixth in the world in 1996, the year she
reached the Australian Open final, Huber termed it a coincidence
that her career, hampered last year by foot surgery and Achilles
problems, appears to have revived in tandem with Steffi Graf's
retirement. Huber said she long ago outgrew the stress that came
with being labeled the 30-year-old Graf's heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it puts pressure on you if you're 16 and everybody is
telling you, `Second Steffi.' I won a couple matches and she won
already I don't know how many Grand Slams. It's not that easy,''
said Huber, whose topspin forehand was too much for Mauresmo to
decipher on Sunday. ``You always keep saying there's never going to
be another Steffi, maybe not the next 100 or 200 years. Everybody
still is expecting it, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost three hours later than it was supposed to, day seven
began with an abortive men's singles confrontation between
seventh-seeded Todd Martin and Sweden's oft-injured Magnus Larsson
that seemed to set a precedent for the mayhem that ensued for the
rest of the session.
</P>
<P>
   After having their patience tested for hours by the morning's
showers and on-again, off-again efforts by Arthur Ashe Stadium's
grounds crew to dry the court, fans who had spent anywhere from $41
to $366 for their day session seats booed for a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six minutes into the match, Larsson, a three-time Open
quarterfinalist, walked off the court, a default he blamed on a
flare-up of tendinitis in his left knee. It took one set, the
81st-ranked Larsson said, for him to realize his knee didn't just
hurt _ it was collapsible as a toothpick.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who next faces ninth-seeded Greg Rusedski, a 7-5, 3-6,
6-3, 6-4 winner against Chris Woodruff, couldn't decide whether he
was happy about the 6-3 victory that fast-forwarded him into the
Round of 16 or not. ``If I had won in five long sets, then I'd much
rather have only played one,'' he said.

FIRST LADY'S MINUET ON CLEMENCY ISSUE IS TRICKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With: MRSCLINTON-CLEMENCY-FLAP)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton is finding herself with the
same problem as Vice President Al Gore. Both feel the need to
distance themselves from President Clinton, but neither has quite
figured out how far to go, or how close is too close.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's statement on Saturday that her husband should
withdraw his offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists
shows that the strange intermingling of interests between a
president and a first lady seeking her own political office is
hardly a complete advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Her statement, issued by her exploratory campaign even as she
and the president vacationed at the Camp David presidential retreat
in Maryland, shows that she knows this, and is searching for the
proper distance.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of this whole episode, which the president has yet
to discuss publicly, was calculated with him in their private
hours? And is the distancing by Mrs. Clinton (and Gore) part of
Clinton's determination to see the election of those whose loyalty
helped him survive politically?
</P>
<P>
   At his last news conference, which was held in July, Clinton
gave license to both Mrs. Clinton and Gore to disagree with him.
And earlier, he suggested in June that such separations would
probably not be accidental.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about his reaction to Gore's announcing his
presidential candidacy when Clinton was out of the country, Clinton
said: ``Very often, you'd be amazed how many times over the last 6
1/2 years, we have planned for certain announcements to be made by
the vice president when I was out of the country, because that way
it gets _ I mean, far be it for us to try to maneuver the press _
but he gets better coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's offer of clemency on Aug. 11 for the Puerto
Ricans raised questions about whether he made the offer to help his
wife, who seems all but certain to run for the Senate from New
York, to curry favor with New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. The
offer prompted outrage from a wide range of people, including
law-enforcement officers and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the
Democrat whom Mrs. Clinton seeks to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's action may have hurt his wife's campaign more than
helped it, and on Saturday she released a statement from Camp
David, where the couple was vacationing in private after their more
public vacation in New York last week, saying the president should
immediately withdraw his offer. That, in turn, set off its own
firestorm of criticism on Sunday among many of New York City's
prominent Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the administration said it had already told the
prisoners' lawyers that they had until 5 p.m. on Sept. 10 to accept
the offer and renounce the further use of violence.
</P>
<P>
   On the clemency issue, Jay Severin, a Republican political
consultant in New York, said: ``This is Clinton calculus to a T. He
makes the gesture, she waits, samples public opinion, then ascends
the stage to say no. It is one example in what will be a continuing
series.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The White House is helping to position her. It's
like she's a sailing vessel and the White House is the wind; we
don't see it, but it's there pushing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mrs. Clinton, it is Clinton who has defined
many of the perceptions about her. ``The problem for Mrs.
Clinton,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy at New
York University, ``is that she's running for the Senate of New York
on the record of his presidency. She's never held office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has already taken several positions at odds with
those of the White House, favoring an increase in Medicaid payments
to New York's teaching hospitals, the establishment of a
Palestinian state and the moving of the capital of Israel to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The New York electorate is notoriously fractionalized and
ethnically diverse, and candidates usually campaign by courting
various constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's target audience, Severin suggested, is not
only a particular interest group _ Puerto Ricans, say, or Jews. It
is also the broad swath of independent suburban voters who may
decide the election.
</P>
<P>
   With these actions, Mrs. Clinton is also trying to convey other
important messages _ that she is independent-minded, that she has
New York's interests at heart and that, in the case of the Puerto
Ricans, she is not the bleeding-heart liberal or radical that
Republicans intend to cast her as.
</P>
<P>
   The clemency offer drew a searing reaction from law-enforcement
officers and played into the political hands of New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, the law-and-order Republican who is Mrs.
Clinton's likely opponent in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they were outraged by the Clintons' actions. Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, said Sunday on the ABC program ``This Week'' that
they badly miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an effort by the president, by the first lady, to
manipulate politics in New York,'' he said of the initial clemency
offer. ``I think they thought it had appeal to a specific group in
New York. I think it blew up in their face and I think this is
damage control, and the idea that they're in some kind of dispute,
I think, just insults our intelligence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other critics have suggested that this dance by the first lady
and the president could have unwelcome ramifications for national
policy. For example, the president's offer of clemency to Puerto
Ricans is now being used as an opening by those who want clemency
for Jonathan Jay Pollard, the Israeli spy.
</P>
<P>
   New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn said that if
the president responded to a humanitarian plea for the Puerto
Ricans, he could do so for Pollard. ``We are pleading with Hillary
to impress her husband with the humanitarian aspect of a pardon for
Jonathan Pollard,'' he said. ``Hillary has a lot of work to do in
our community, and we are watching carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said, however, that there is
virtually no chance that Pollard will be released.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton asserted that she had no involvement in the Puerto
Rican clemency offer. Indeed, officials at the White House and Mrs.
Clinton's campaign said that the two were operating independently _
that Mrs. Clinton, like the rest of the country, was unaware that
the White House on Friday had given the prisoners until Sept. 10 to
accept the offer or it would be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the issue will blow over because the prisoners will
not accept Clinton's condition that they renounce the use of
violence. ``She'll be saved by the people who were supposed to be
pardoned,'' Moss said. ``The prisoners will save Mrs. Clinton from
Clinton.''

WRITER OFFERS AMAZON.COM TASTE OF ITS OWN MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Amazon.com Inc. came under fire recently for publishing
lists of books and CDs popular with employees at major companies,
the company, which is based in Seattle, said that its so-called
purchase circles were meant to be ``fun and positive,'' not an
invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   That was all the inspiration that Mark D. Fefer needed. Fefer, a
writer for Seattle Weekly, an alternative newspaper, decided it
might be ``really fun'' to find out which pages on the paper's Web
site were most popular with people who work at Amazon. So he asked
the paper's Webmaster to run an analysis of visits to the site from
the Net surfers whose addresses contained amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Fefer presented the results in last week's issue and on the Web
site (www.seattleweekly.com).
</P>
<P>
   The article ``How I `Escaped' From Amazon.cult,'' a former
employee's biting account of his unhappy life as a customer service
representative remains a popular read among Amazon employees a year
and a half after it was first posted on the Seattle Weekly site.
</P>
<P>
   Fefer also reported that Amazon employees were frequent visitors
to the newspaper's online help-wanted section, and that they tended
to use the site most in the early afternoon, checking out
restaurant reviews and horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Fefer warned investors: ``Amazon staffers are blowing your
hard-earned capital on a lot of midday Internet surfing and weekend
planning!''
</P>
<P>
   The point, Fefer said in an interview, was to have Amazon ``find
out a little bit of what it feels like'' to face this kind of
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Capelli, an Amazon spokesman, noted last week that his
company had responded to concerns about the purchase circles by
enabling customers and companies to stipulate that purchase data
not be included in such lists. As for his own company's employees,
Capelli said the Seattle Weekly report gave little cause for worry.
After all, he said, if workers are surfing the Web in the early
afternoon, they are obviously not going out for long lunches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find that alarming,'' he said, ``I find that
gratifying.''

GLEN MURRAY SIGNS WITH KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Training camp began for the Kings on Sunday with a
pleasant surprise, the sort of upbeat news absent all of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of practice, right wing Glen Murray signed a
new, complex contract, then joined his teammates on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's contract could last for one, two or three years. The
Kings have the option to renew the contract after each of the first
two years. The signing of the 26-year-old Murray, who earned
$675,000 last year, leaves defenseman Mattias Norstrom as the last
key unsigned King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be in camp with the guys, skating and getting in
game shape,'' said Murray, who scored 16 goals last season, 15 of
them before suffering an injury to his right knee Jan.2. ``I was
going to wait until I thought (the Kings' offer) was right and
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the structure of the contract, General Manager Dave Taylor
said, ``There's a significant upside for Glen if he performs
well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to agent Anton Thun, Murray will be paid a base salary
of $1.25 million in the first year, plus performance bonuses
ranging from $50,000 to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   After the first year, the Kings can choose between two salaries
to pay Murray in the second year. One of the salaries is $1.375
million, below the amount projected to be the average NHL salary a
year from now. The other is $1.65 million, above the projected
average. The current average salary is $1.29 million.
</P>
<P>
   The risk for the Kings in the second year is, that if they
choose the lower figure, then opt not to renew Murray's contract
for a third year, he will become an unrestricted free agent before
the 2001-2002 season. If they renew the contract for a third year,
Murray will be paid $1.775 million in 2001-2002. Additionally,
performance bonuses could increase Murray's salary in the second
and third years to the point that he could earn around $2.5 million
in 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to be creative to get the deal done,'' Thun said.
</P>
<P>
   New coach Andy Murray was pleased with the resolution of Glen
Murray's negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you want all the players on board,'' Andy Murray
said. ``What we need from Glen Murray is that he's the player of
two years ago and of the beginning of last year. He knows that.
He's been rewarded with a contract that acknowledges the player he
was before he was injured, not after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough to please
</P>
<P>
   How did his first day of practice as an NHL coach compare to his
first day a year ago at a Minnesota prep school?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys, `You guys almost look as good as the kids at
Shattuck-St. Mary's did after the first practice last year,' ''
Andy Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his evaluation of the Kings' practice, Murray said, ``The
execution for the very first practice was good. We looked like a
pretty good hockey team on Sept. 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the ice was newcomer Ziggy Palffy, the Kings'
most important off-season acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty hard practice for the first day,'' Palffy
said. ``My legs aren't used to it. It's going to be better in a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice Dog ties
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have hired Rick Burrill as assistant trainer. Burrill
spent the last three years with the Long Beach Ice Dogs. They also
have hired Joe Horrigan as their strength coach. Horrigan has
worked extensively with the Ice Dogs the last few years.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ For years, scientists have been racing to map
the human genome in order to get a complete view of the DNA
blueprint that guides the construction of every aspect of our
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the genome map nears completion, other researchers are
studying the essential building blocks produced by DNA: the roughly
100,000 proteins that make up every muscle, nerve and fiber in our
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as gene scientists call their field genomics, protein
mappers have dubbed their study ``proteomics.'' Both efforts have
the same goal: to identify the causes and possible cures for
disease, and speed up the process of developing new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For now, proteomics remains a fledgling discipline led by tiny
firms like privately held Ciphergen Biosystems Ltd. of Palo Alto,
which has created a new system to automate the process of analyzing
proteins. It might be years before this effort leads to new drugs,
but scientists at Ciphergen already have used their system to find
proteins that could help diagnose schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scientists think this new field with the funny name
could be the next big thing in biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I think we'll come to view proteomics as a
revolution of similar magnitude to what we're going to discover
from other big projects like the Human Genome Project,'' said Keith
Yamamoto, chairman of cellular research at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   To grasp his optimism, it's necessary to understand a bit about
the body's cellular machinery. Enrique Dalmasso, chief research
scientist at Ciphergen, said it all begins in the nucleus of our
cells, with the DNA molecules that scientists liken to a blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever cells need to divide or repair themselves, they look to
DNA for instructions. DNA is a double-stranded molecule resembling
a zipper in some regards. To get the job done, DNA unzips itself
and creates a working intermediary called messenger RNA.
</P>
<P>
   If DNA is the blueprint, mRNA is the construction worker. It
uses raw materials called amino acids that are present in the
cells. Following DNA's instructions, mRNA grabs specific amino
acids, in the order laid out in the blueprint, and strings them
together like a pearl necklace. This long string of amino acids
then folds itself _ in ways scientists don't yet fully understand _
to form a protein.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the cell follows a logical process: DNA makes RNA makes
protein. In Dalmasso's construction metaphor, proteins are the
studs and beams that frame the house and the pipes and wires that
run through its the walls. In our bodies, proteins form the
muscles, ligaments, skin and hair. The enzymes that digest our
foods and regulate our moods are proteins, as are germ-killing
antibodies and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proteins form the framework of the body,'' Dalmasso said.
``They are the real actors. Everything that happens in the body
happens because some sets of proteins have interacted with each
other, or provided the pathway for a nerve impulse or signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that proteins are vital to the body's proper functioning,
they naturally are of interest to researchers seeking to understand
disease, said Charles Craik, professor of pharmaceutical chemistry
at UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, most diseases are the manifestation of a malfunction
by some protein or set of proteins. Drugs are the molecular fixes
we throw into the cells to patch over the problems.
</P>
<P>
   As Craik said more precisely: ``Most drugs are small molecules
that hit protein receptors to achieve some desired effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Because drug development mainly is about fixing proteins, one
might wonder why scientists focused on studying DNA. Fred Cohen, a
professor of pharmacology at UCSF, said it makes sense _ in view of
the relationship between DNA and proteins, and the fact that DNA is
much easier to study.
</P>
<P>
   The latter point is easiest to explain.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is made up of four basic chemicals that repeat themselves in
a predictable pattern. That predictability has allowed scientists
to devise instruments that automatically ``read'' the genetic
pattern from a tissue sample, in the same way bar code scanners
pick prices off grocery items.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, proteins are made up of 20 different amino acids
that fold and twist according to rules scientists don't yet
understand. ``If I understand the shape of one protein, it isn't
much help in figuring out the next protein,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking tools to automate the study of proteins, scientists have
used DNA scanners as proxies to identify proteins of particular
interest, Cohen said. It doesn't take the whole DNA molecule to
make a protein. Instead, if we imagine DNA as a long freight train,
each car in the train would be a gene. Each gene contains the
blueprint for a different protein.
</P>
<P>
   So bioscientists have followed a two-step strategy, Cohen says.
They've used high-speed DNA scanners to find genes involved in
important functions, like building heart muscles. Once these genes
have been identified, scientists do the time-consuming studies of
the proteins made by these genes _ for instance, trying to
understand the protein defects involved in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studying genes has been the best way to pick the targets for
your drug-development efforts,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Now proteomics vendors are promising to hand scientists a new
generation of instruments that partially can automate protein
analysis in much the same way that previous generations of
instruments sped up DNA studies. No one expects protein tools to
displace the gene scanners. Instead, proteomics tools should
augment current DNA screening by making it easier to design drugs,
once interesting protein targets are found.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is to put a lot of the complicated chemistry
needed to do protein analysis onto a chip,'' said Dalmasso, the
Ciphergen scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ciphergen is only one of several proteomics vendors _
others include Oxford GlycoSciences of the United Kingdom and Large
Scale Biology Corp., a division of Biosource Technologies in
Vacaville _ its ProteinChip System has won the company considerable
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins with the chips, thin strips of aluminum
coated with chemicals designed to grab and hold certain types of
proteins. Scientists grind up tissues they want to study to create
a protein ``soup.'' They deposit a few drops on the chip and insert
it into a device about the size of a two-drawer filing cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   This ProteinChip reader contains a laser and sophisticated scale
that work together to identify the microscopic quantities of
protein by measuring their molecular weight. Professor Bob
Vessella, a prostate cancer researcher at the Unversity of
Washington in Seattle, said that the first week his lab used the
ProteinChip reader, it completed three experiments his staff had
been working on for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, protein analysis has been something of an art,''
Vessella said. First, scientists would have to isolate and purify
large batches of protein. Then, they would submit these purified
samples to a long series of tests that could be wrecked by the
slightest contamination or error. And it all took a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said the chip can analyze a few drops of
protein, eliminating the need to grow large samples. The reader is
faster and more precise than current, labor-intensive methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't invented any new science,'' he said. ``But the
ability to put all that really difficult protein analysis into a
black box is really phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalmasso said Ciphergen has sold about 50 of its ProteinChip
readers since the company was formed in 1997. Most of these
$150,000 instruments have been placed at academic labs doing basic
disease research.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial biotech firms are evaluating proteomics tools but
have not seemed in a rush to embrace this new wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study of genes is not going to give us all the answers,
and we know that,'' said Paul Godowski, director of molecular
biology for Genentech Inc. ``We're interested in proteomics, but I
wouldn't exactly say it was central to our research efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Paul Kelly with ING Baring Furman Selz in New York
estimates the current market for protein-analysis equipment at $500
million annually, about one-third of what is spent on genomics
instruments. Ciphergen's systems, he said, ``should become
important components'' of this protein analysis market.
</P>
<P>
   Ciphergen isn't talking yet about a public offering, though the
60-person firm clearly is headed that way. It has raised a modest
$25 million from venture backers. John Young, former chief
executive of Hewlett-Packard, is Ciphergen's chairman. William
Rich, a former pharmaceutical company executive, is its chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Rich is an evangelist for proteomics in general and Ciphergen in
particular. He likens the ProteinChip System to past advances in
biotechnology, like invention in the mid-1980s of polymerase chain
reaction, or PCR, the technique that allowed scientists to grow DNA
and RNA in samples large enough to study.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, whether proteomics tools will be
as important as PCR or later advances, like the invention of
DNA-sequencing equipment in the late 1980s and early 1990s by firms
like Affymetrix, PE Applied Biosystems and Molecular Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen, the UCSF expert, said bioscience always has been
driven by tools and techniques. As far back as the invention of the
microscope some 350 years ago, medical science has been a continual
tinkering exercise that makes great leaps whenever the tinkerers
get new tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discovery,'' Cohen said, ``is driven by the industrialization
of fundamental molecular biology experiments.''

E.J.B. ROSE, 89, WARTIME MILITARY ANALYST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   E.J.B. ``Jim'' Rose, who worked with the legendary British code
breakers at Bletchley Park during World War II, died on May 20 in
Sussex, England. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   The advance knowledge of German plans, so laboriously deciphered
at Bletchley Park, helped Britain when it was fighting alone
against the Nazis, and Rose was head of the section that determined
the military importance of the information they received.
</P>
<P>
   Rose later became a noted journalist, a publisher and a
ground-breaking surveyor of race relations in Great Britain,
serving as director of the Survey of Race Relations. In 1969 he
published ``Color and Citizenship,'' a report on the country's
integration and immigration problems, with Nicholas Deakin.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, Rose was best remembered for his
exploits during World War II as an analyst of broken German
military codes and as a liaison between British cryptologists and
higher military authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was at times critical of Allied intelligence reports.
According to The Daily Telegraph, he and a colleague, Alan
Pryce-Jones, visited the American general Kenneth Strong, who was
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's intelligence chief, three weeks before
the costly German counterattack that became known as the Battle of
the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong said the Germans were losing a division a day and
wouldn't hold,'' Rose said. ``Alan was just a major, but he sat on
the edge of the general's desk and said: `My dear sir, if you
believe that, you'll believe anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Joseph Benn Rose was born on June 7, 1909, to a well-off
Jewish family. After attending Rugby and New College, Oxford, where
he spent his spare time working with Jewish refugees in the East
End of London, Rose joined the Royal Air Force in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Rose moved to the government's cryptology
school at Bletchley Park, where he became adept at assessing the
intelligence value of the code decrypted from the Luftwaffe, the
German air force.
</P>
<P>
   He left the RAF as a wing commander in 1948 and, after a brief
flirtation with political office, joined the staff of The Observer,
at the time an influential weekly Sunday newspaper, as literary
editor. Among his reviewers was George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later he became the founding director of the
International Press Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, established
with the backing of the Ford Foundation with the aim of maintaining
a free press in the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Rose returned to England in 1963 when he was asked by Philip
Mason, the director of the Institute of Race Relations in Great
Britain, to serve as the chairman of the survey of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Rose became editorial director of Westminster
Press, and in 1973 chairman of Penguin Books, where he oversaw the
company's acquisition of Viking, a publisher in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was a consultant to UNICEF and served on a government
committee on education of ethnic minority children.
</P>
<P>
   He also was instrumental in the formation of the Runnymede
Trust, a race research center, and served as its chairman from 1980
to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   For his work during World War II, he was awarded the Legion of
Merit. For his work studying racism, he was appointed a Commander
of the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who lived in Kent, is survived by his wife, Pamela; a son,
Alan, and a daughter, Harriet.

ANALYSTS SKEPTICAL OF STRENGTH BEHIND BIOTECH INDEX'S RECORD HIGH &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Amex biotech stock index has soared to
record highs. Wall Street, it seems, suddenly can't buy its fill of
the index's biggest firms.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by high-profile issues like Amgen, Genentech and Biogen,
the index gained another 14 points Friday (September 3) to close at
284.75, comfortably exceeding its previous peak of 256.60 in
January 1992. Chiron also has helped goose the index. Its stock
closed at a record $33.44 last week, amid speculation that Novartis
AG, the Swiss drugmaker that owns 44 percent of Chiron, wants to
acquire the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the index only tracks 15 of the biggest companies, and
veteran industry watchers aren't sure the rally will lift biotech's
400 smaller players _ much less open the window for private
startups to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Richard van den Broek, a biotech analyst for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist
in New York, said that though big biotech stocks have been doing
well for the past two years, the current rally is starting to look
exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in recent memory,'' he said, big biotech
stocks are outperforming shares of large drug companies. Van den
Broek thinks the rally isn't just confined to the big firms, but
``has also broadened out to include select, promising second- and
third-tier companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite up-and-comers, van den Broek lists LeukoSite
Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., firm working on cancer and autoimmune
drugs; Pharmacyclics Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., company developing
ways to increase the potency of radiation and chemotherapy; and two
firms, Medarex of New Jersey and Abegenix of Fremont, Calif., that
are developing mice whose cells produce human antibodies, which
would form the basis for new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Slattery, who manages Amerindo Investment Advisors'
biotech fund, is suspicious of the surge, partly because of its
timing. ``Summer is usually the slow season for biotech,'' said
Slattery, who thinks the current run is being driven by momentum
players who don't understand that biotech stocks can take five to
10 years to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seasoned life sciences investor is not buying into this
rally,'' Slattery warned. ``They're probably taking some profit.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco investment banker Steve Burrill is another skeptic
who thinks the current rally won't provide any lasting help for the
lagging stocks at the low end of the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have some companies that will go up on the momentum or
some bit of good scientific news,'' Burrill said. ``But if you
watch a few days or months, they'll probably come back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrill said he won't be ready to proclaim a broad recovery
until Wall Street warms up to biotech IPOs. ``I don't think
institutions are ready yet for a raft of new biotech offerings,''
he said. ``Their portfolios are still loaded with life sciences
plays that haven't performed up to expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Morrison, a biotech consultant with Ernst &AMP; Young in Palo
Alto, Calif., is more optimistic about biotech companies using the
current momentum to go public. He notes that Vaxgen, a South San
Francisco (Calif.) firm working on AIDS vaccines, and BioMarin
Pharmaceutical, a genetic disease firm in Novato, Calif., both
completed public offerings earlier this summer _ and both still are
trading above their offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by their example, Oratec Interventions of Menlo Park,
Calif., filed an IPO in July to test Wall Street's appetite for a
new, minimally invasive surgical technique to repair ligaments and
other soft tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least a dozen other local biotech companies are in serious
discussions with investment bankers,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean all will take the plunge. Morrison doesn't
envision a repeat of what happened after biotech bounced back from
its latest slump in June 1995, when 62 firms raised $1.7 billion
from IPOs in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the outlook isn't as bleak as it was a year ago,
when the public markets appeared completely closed to new
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Flores, publisher of BioCentury newsletter in San Carlos,
Calif., said he'll have more good tidings to report in this week's
edition. ``Everybody thinks money for startups has dried up, but
our figures will show venture money has been a lot more plentiful
than people think,'' he said.

PUT GOAL OF HOUSE AHEAD OF STOCK OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sept. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I have the opportunity to start buying stock
in his company at a 15 percent discount from market price. He can
purchase an amount representing 10 percent of his annual salary, or
$5,000. The only stipulation is that he must hold on to it for at
least four months. It is a growing company, and the stock has been
increasing in price over the past year that he has been with it,
but I am not sure if we should take advantage of the offer or not,
given our goal of buying a house. We are saving $1,300 a month
toward the down payment in a money market account that earns 5
percent. We currently have about $17,000 saved, or 6 percent of the
anticipated cost of the house. For retirement we fully fund Roth
IRAs for both of us and both contribute 10 percent of our salaries
to 401(k) plans. We would like to be in a house by this time next
year. What would you do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; K.P., Maynard
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I'd do just what you are doing and let the company
stock offer, however attractive it may seem, wait until you have
achieved your primary goal of buying the house. The value of shares
in small and growing companies can be very volatile, and most would
probably be very susceptible to any substantial downturn in the
stock markets, sometimes regardless of the performance of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still tempted to go for the stock offer, approach it
as you would approach any investment. That is to say, ask a lot of
tough questions, and don't let that fat 15 percent discount hold
too much sway.
</P>
<P>
   Is the company profitable, and are its prospects of continued
and growing profits strong? Does it have unique market niche that
is secure, or is it facing substantial competition? Is it in a
business in which a competitor could suddenly come up with an
improved product that blows your husband's company out of the
water? What is the price-to-earnings ratio relative to other
companies in the same industry? Do you have absolute faith in your
company's top management?
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions to ask that might make the idea of
gambling on the stock offer more attractive. Your husband is, of
course, an insider, so he is likely to know whether the company has
strong product or service offerings in the pipeline _ products or
services he feels are strong enough to cause a significant spike in
the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you believe the prospects are strong enough so that
you're willing to take the gamble _ and don't fool yourself that
investing in a small company for a four-to-12-month profit isn't
gambling _ I would limit the contribution to less than the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   If you maintained your current savings schedule, you would have
accumulated $33,890 toward the mortgage down payment over a year's
time. If you cut contributions to $1,000 a month, you would have
$30,126 in the money market account, and you would have invested
$3,600 in stock that might or might not be worth more than you paid
for the shares.
</P>
<P>
   You might look at it this way: If you're attracted to the offer,
you could consider buying the stock as a gamble that, at the very
worst, could delay your home purchase. If you think the upside
potential outweighs that downside, by all means go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But to answer your direct question _ what would you do? _ unless
I had some powerful inside information on the potential value of
this stock, I'd stick with the saving schedule you have established
and save the option of buying the stock until a time when you can
view the purchases as long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   I should also note here that although the term ``inside
information'' has all kinds of negative associations lately, in
your situation, thinking hard about your husband's company is not
only wise, but entirely legal.

BUSCH RUSHES TO WIN THIRD SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The tight and treacherous layout of the L.A.
Street Race's road course didn't phase Kurt Busch, but one tiny
piece of aluminum almost ruined his day.
</P>
<P>
   Busch, preparing to qualify for today's NASCAR Southwest Series
race Sunday, broke his shifter pulling out of his pit stall to
begin his lap. In accordance with series rules, he had only five
minutes to repair the car, or he would be disqualified from the
first day of qualifying and start no better than 21st in today's
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had the crew and the parts to get it fixed, but we
only had five minutes,'' said Busch, the series' point leader.
``Actually, we had to have the car running in five minutes, so we
were pushing the car down pit lane while one of my guys was still
inside trying to fix the shifter.''
</P>
<P>
   With a new metal shifter, Busch turned in the third-fastest lap
Sunday in 53.045 seconds and starts behind polesitter Greg Pursley
and Ken Schrader in today's 1 p.m. race. The first 20 spots were
determined by Sunday's qualifying, and 16 drivers will join the
field this morning _ a dozen through a second round of qualifying
and another four through provisional sponsor selections.
</P>
<P>
   Pursley claimed the L.A. Street Race pole for the second
consecutive year. Last year, he led for more than half the race
before he crashed when he tried to lap a slower car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to be a little more careful this year,'' he
joked. ``I have some experience with road racing on motorcycles, so
I probably have a little advantage over some of these guys. But the
drivers on this series are so competitive that anybody in the top
10 has a shot at winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver who turned in the second-best time Sunday will not
get to race today. Ross Thompson, normally a driver on the
Craftsman Truck series, volunteered to qualify the No. 33 car for
Schrader, a regular on the Winston Cup circuit who was in South
Carolina for the Pepsi Southern 400 and finished ninth. Schrader
was expected to fly into Los Angeles late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what the job description was when I agreed to this, so
I'm not really disappointed,'' Thompson said. ``I'll stick around
tomorrow and try to help Kenny, give him some tips about the
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hornaday Jr., one of the top drivers on the Craftsman Truck
series, qualified fourth, while Kevin Harvic, Craig Raudman, Dennis
Dyer, Rudy Revak, Damon Lusk and R.K. Smith round out the top 10.
Kenny Irwin, also a Winston Cup regular, will have to qualify his
own Southwest Series car because his designated driver, Jon
Zaretski, finished 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many great drivers in this race,'' Pursley said,
referring to Schrader, Hornaday and Irwin. ``When all those guys
come down here to compete, it makes you want to work that much
harder.''

GIVING BIRTH TO A WEB STARTUP _ AND A BABY &HT;    BY STAN BUNGER AND JAN BOYD
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Josh Newman, the guy who in college could always
be spotted with his dog sitting under his chair during class,
decided last year to launch a Web startup called Petstore.com. At
the same time, Newman and his wife, Martha Diepenbrock, decided to
expand their family and adopt a baby.
</P>
<P>
   As the saying goes, timing is everything _ especially when
trying to adopt or raise venture capital funding. There's also
another saying: Life can get complicated.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, Newman and his wife got the call _ the
birth mother of their child had gone into labor _ four hours east
of Dallas in the small town of Nacogdoches, Texas. At the same
time, Newman and his team were entering the final round of
negotiations for their initial round of funding.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of March 9, Newman sat in the hospital maternity
ward in Nacogdoches, cell phone in hand and computer perched on his
lap. The negotiations were tense because Amazon.com had just
announced that it, too, was going to sell pet products and the
funders were nervous. They demanded one more face-to-face meeting
to be convinced that Petstore.com could compete before they would
hand over a check.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a healthy little girl entered the world, and at 3 p.m.,
Newman turned off his electronic gear long enough to take his
family back to the hotel and catch a little nap, his new infant
daughter, Zoe, asleep on his chest. At 6 p.m., Newman drove the
four hours back to Dallas, caught a midnight flight to the San
Francisco Bay Area, landed in his office at 1 a.m., worked all
night with his team in Oakland and arrived for a 6 a.m.
presentation meeting in San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Newman jumped back into his Celica
convertible and once again headed for the airport. ``At this point,
I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone,'' said Newman. The cell
phone rang; the funders were satisfied; now the term sheet needed
to be agreed upon. Newman talked all the way onto the plane. Once
he reached Dallas, his team read the terms over the phone, Newman
approved the signing and they all celebrated the $10 million
windfall for a few seconds. Then it was off to the rental car
counter and Nacogdoches to collect his newly expanded family.
</P>
<P>
   Newman reports that Zoe is growing up happy and healthy and that
the company is growing, too, up from four to 90 employees. He's
also careful to give credit to a person largely responsible for his
success in both ventures: ``I couldn't have done this without my
wife, Martha.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BUS STOPS HERE: Technology has taken on a lot of challenges.
There's software to help the disorganized get organized, and there
are digital cameras designed to let even the fumble-fingered take
decent pictures. And then there's the Muni Railway.
</P>
<P>
   The transit system San Franciscans love to hate represents not
only a challenge, but a business opportunity for Emeryville's
NextBus Information Systems. The startup company's technology first
was deployed on Muni's 22-Fillmore trolley line. A combination of
wireless devices and software lets NextBus predict when the next
coach will roll up to a given bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   The information can be flashed onto an electronic display at bus
stops or accessed via the Internet. While the system won't
necessarily keep buses on schedule, it will at least let passengers
know how long they'll be waiting. Muni officials were pleased
enough with NextBus' performance on the 22 line that they've
awarded the company a $900,000 contract to install the system on
the entire Muni Metro streetcar fleet.
</P>
<P>
   NextBus Chief Operating Officer Jim Maresca said skeptics
abounded when the company first started touting its bus-locating
technology. ``Everybody said, `If you could actually do that, we'd
be interested in buying,''' recalled Maresca, ``but you've got to
show us you can do it first.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Maresca says NextBus is negotiating with a half-dozen other
transit systems for contracts.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some kinks to be worked out. Sometimes, a
streetside display will indicate a bus' imminent arrival when
there's no bus to be seen. And recently, an elderly man waited for
the bus at Fillmore and Sutter streets in San Francisco. When asked
if he liked the idea of knowing when the next bus would arrive, he
spun the conversation toward a discussion of user interface and
ergonomics.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the digital readout was mounted too high off the ground
for him to be able to read it.
</P>
<P>
   SEGA HAS A DREAM: Once upon a time, Sega was king of the video
game mountain. In 1993, Sega's Genesis game machine was going
strong and the company owned more than 50 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nintendo and Sony's fortunes have soared, while
Sega's has plummeted. Industry analysts agree that Sega's market
share has dipped to single digits.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Thursday's (Sept. 9) scheduled North American launch of
Sega's new Dreamcast game system is a Very Big Deal for San
Francisco's Sega of America. Sega is spending $100 million on a
massive marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The effort already has produced such gems as a San Francisco
motorcade, in which police officers escorted a convertible carrying
somebody in a Sonic the Hedgehog costume. ``Isn't a hedgehog sort
of like a skunk?'' asked one cop.
</P>
<P>
   At the same event, dozens of young video game fans showed up in
blue paint (matching Sonic's skin tone), hoping to win free video
games and cash in on a ``dress-alike'' contest. The winners' checks
were handed out by Sega of America Senior Vice President of
Marketing Peter Moore, who appeared to be the only guy in the crowd
wearing a necktie.
</P>
<P>
   It's Moore's job to push product, and he makes a brave
prediction, saying Dreamcast will set a new entertainment-industry
record for single-day sales. ``When we looked during our research,
`The Phantom Menace' did $28.1 million in its first 24 hours,''
Moore said. ``We believe we will be somewhere in excess of $60 to
$70 million at retail that day.'' If numbers like those really
materialize on Thursday, nobody will be feeling too blue around
Sega's offices.

DOWN SO LONG, BUCHANAN AND THE FALCONS DEAL WITH SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-three years of foiled plans and churning heartache were
dissolved in one season for the Atlanta Falcons. In 1998 they won
their first division title since 1980, won the most games in
franchise history (16), scored their most points ever (511), were
unbeaten at home in the Georgia Dome (9-0) and reached their first
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the night before the championship game, safety Eugene
Robinson was arrested on charges of soliciting a prostitute. Hours
later the Falcons were smacked, 34-19, by the Denver Broncos in
Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Way down. Way up. Way down again.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' off-season shook out this way: Robinson was
retained, receiver Tony Martin and linebacker Cornelius Bennett
were released and star running back Jamal Anderson returned despite
trade rumors and a contract holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Falcons prepare for their season opener on Sunday at
home against the Minnesota Vikings _ a rematch of last season's
tingling National Football Conference championship game _ the
Falcons realize they are not the same team.
</P>
<P>
   They are, they hope, a little wiser. Certainly more seasoned.
Hungry enough, they envision, for that final push over the top in
Super Bowl XXXIV. The game on Jan. 30, 2000, will be played in the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to the Super Bowl in the '98 season and blew up,''
linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``We have to distinguish that this
is the '99 season. Last year is behind us. Now we have to work
twice as hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons Coach Dan Reeves said a lot must change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the hunted now,'' Reeves said. ``We are the defending
NFC champions and the intensity is going to be greater. San
Francisco ruled our division for so long; they want it back. And we
start the season against the team we beat to get to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Minnesota is awfully good, but throughout this league,
who is the lesser opponent? We won some close games last year
against some teams that finished 5-11 or worse. Just a point here
or there can change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Falcons know the pulse of the team like cornerback Ray
Buchanan. Like the Falcons, he was down for a long time before he
rose, glimmering.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened with Eugene did affect our team some in the
Super Bowl and there is no denying that,'' Buchanan said. ``It drew
a lot of unnecessary attention to our football team and it was a
tough situation to handle. I was up with Eugene until 3:30 that
morning until I saw his eyes begin to fall asleep. Before we went
on the field, I looked into his eyes, and he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the biggest moments of a lifetime. The cameras were
flashing. The jets were flying overhead. And then we went out and
played so uncharacteristic of our season. We missed tackles. They
picked us apart on a long bomb. We didn't punch the ball in near
the goal line. We didn't make that fourth-down conversion early in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eugene has a chance now to grab back some of his football
legacy. We've been a franchise that's been at the bottom of the
food chain, but now we know what it's like to be at the top. The
Super Bowl can spoil you, though. When I first got to this team
three years ago, I had my mind set for patience. I looked around
the locker room and saw a bunch of studs, but guys who didn't play
like studs. There were some bad seeds. These are good times now. If
we want it enough, the stage is set for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan grew up near Chicago playing football at Proviso High,
which won two games and lost 36 during his prep career.
</P>
<P>
   He was switched from running back and receiver to safety at the
University of Louisville. He did not win many games in college, but
Louisville did beat Alabama in the Fiesta Bowl, and Buchanan was
the game's most valuable player. That caught the attention of pro
scouts.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected by the Indianapolis Colts in the third round of
the 1993 draft, and he played there for four seasons. He was
shuffled from safety to cornerback. And then Reeves called in 1997
and asked Buchanan, then a free agent, to come and be part of the
foundation for the new Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray was the first move I made,'' said Reeves, who became the
Falcons' head coach on Jan. 20 of that year and signed Buchanan on
March 3. ``We had to improve our defense and we needed an
aggressive cornerback to help do it. Finding those type of corners,
ones who can cover the other team's best receiver all day and shut
them down, is very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, Buchanan describes himself as a ``diamond in the
rough'' on teams that struggled. Then came last season, his first
Pro Bowl season, and a spot in the Super Bowl. He sought the
cameras and the newspaper coverage, and they came to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wore the dog collar at the Super Bowl media day, I was
saying that we were underdogs, so why not go with it?'' Buchanan
said. ``Then our fans started wearing them and it was fun. Now,
you've also got to be smart and know how to market yourself. Some
guys like Barry Sanders and Darrell Green are recognized solely for
their ability. Some guys like me have to do a little more and then
you see my ability and appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, and sometimes I get bored and just do stuff. It's my
personality. I am a confident, happy person, outgoing and
outspoken, and I like to joke and have fun. That's always been me.
But I play cornerback on the edge. I don't think of being average;
I think of being feared. I'm not the vocal type with our team,
though. I just try and make plays and let that be contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who turns 28 later this month, is only 5 feet 10
inches and weighs 185 pounds. As he enters his seventh pro season,
he has already produced three seasons with five or more
interceptions, has started in 82 of 93 career games and has led his
team in passes defended in each of his last five seasons. He makes
big plays at big times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is a unique character,'' Tuggle said. ``He has endless
energy. He loves to compete. He has very quick feet, recognizes
plays and can accelerate. There are few like him in pro football at
cornerback with the exception of Deion Sanders. There is a lot of
respect here for Ray and his ability. We count on him.''
</P>
<P>
   To shut down the opponent's best receiver. To make game-swinging
plays. To be the team's conscience and inspiration. To help lead
the Falcons back to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out and light the spark,'' Buchanan said. ``And even if I
don't have matches to light the fire, I'll go out there with rocks
and create a fire. And it will spread.''

NEW RACE, BUT OLD WALK ON THE BEACH FOR BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mo.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRING LAKE, N.J. _ The storm-whipped winds had been lashing the
beach all day Sunday, driving dark clouds before them, roiling the
surf and forcing summer's last vacationers out of the water, when
former Sen. Bill Bradley stepped onto the boardwalk for an
afternoon of handshaking.
</P>
<P>
   Call it dumb luck, or call it a good omen, as Bradley did. But
at that very moment, the sun broke through the clouds in this town
south of Asbury Park, briefly warming the small crowd that had
gathered in their tank tops, swimsuits and sandals to welcome
Bradley on his annual Labor Day political pilgrimage to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary beach walk for Bradley _ who has done
this nostalgia-laced event for 19 of the last 21 years _ and so the
weather was more welcome than ever. For Bradley is running for the
Democratic nomination for president, and Sunday's stroll was a
kickoff of sorts for his national campaign. (He will make another
kickoff in his hometown of Crystal City, Mo., later this week.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my good luck charm,'' Bradley said, gesturing toward
the beach as if it were his home court. ``There are a lot of good
omens out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The clutch of more than 20 reporters tailing him was the largest
ever, his aides said, and included television crews from Britain.
Instead of his usual small coterie of aides, he brought several
carloads this year. And the beachgoers' enthusiasm for their
favorite-son presidential candidate seemed louder than in past
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a french fry, Bill,'' shouted Gloria Hennessy, 64, from
Point Pleasant. ``You're the best. You're going to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later why she liked Bradley, who represented New Jersey in
the U.S. Senate for three terms and still lives in Montclair, Ms.
Hennessy said, ``He's honest and he played basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But if things around him seemed somehow different than in past
years, Bradley looked and acted every bit the same. As he has on
all his beach walks, he wore the sort of informal clothes he did 30
years ago, when he was playing professional basketball for the New
York Knicks: forest-green shorts, size-13 Adidas sneakers and
orange-and-blue socks that were balling up around his ankles from
the moment he stepped out of his car.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bradley was charged up about kicking off his campaign, he
did his best to hide it. He just wandered up to people, offered his
hand without introducing himself, asked a question or two, and then
ambled off. He did not kiss any babies, except his own
grandchildren, and did not ask anyone to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few questions to be answered, mainly from
reporters. At a brief news conference along the arcade in Point
Pleasant a few miles to the south, Bradley was asked by an English
reporter about those ``dogging questions'' concerning his being too
vague about his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied that he had already offered detailed proposals
to require registration of handguns and to revamp campaign-finance
laws, and would soon be releasing more on health care, the economy
and preserving people's pensions. ``I don't feel dogged,'' he said,
adding, ``I feel like we're going out and telling the people what I
believe and what I want to do and who I am and where I came from.''

ENCEPHALITIS THREAT MEANS INDOOR HOLIDAY FOR MANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Loretta Sikiric was outside grilling sausages early
Saturday evening when she heard the thucka-thucka of a helicopter
flying low over her home in Whitestone, Queens. She watched it
swoop in and dump its payload: a pesticide that officials say has
mostly eliminated the mosquitoes responsible for an outbreak of St.
Louis encephalitis, a viral disease that has killed two elderly
people in Queens and may have sickened as many as 37 others.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sikiric, 52, rushed into the house and stood with her arms
outstretched, a stricken look on her face. ``They sprayed me!'' she
announced dramatically to her daughter, Sania Recupero, before
running upstairs to take a shower. The sausages had to be thrown
out.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the scene Sunday, Mrs. Recupero said: ``She got
scared. She was not a happy woman, let me tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sikiric was far from alone. The encephalitis outbreak,
confirmed by city officials on Friday, and the ensuing emergency
operations undertaken by the city have spread consternation across
northeastern Queens and the southeastern Bronx, residents said
Sunday, and ruined the Labor Day weekend for thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday morning, city emergency management
officials said that the spraying of pesticide by helicopter on
Friday and Saturday had been successful and that they believed the
greatest danger had passed. As of Sunday afternoon, the number of
confirmed cases of encephalitis remained at five, including the two
deaths, the same as the day before, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the affected areas, backyard barbecues and other
festivities were called off. Frightened families remained shuttered
indoors, with insect repellent at the ready for anyone who needed
to run essential errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been keeping the kids in the house,'' said Steve
Lauritano, who lives in Whitestone. ``We're worried about the bugs.
We're not using our pool right now. We have been staying inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauritano had gone out only to pick up insect repellent. The
Mayor's Office of Emergency Management had set up a command center
in Whitestone to direct the anti-mosquito operations, and Fire
Department personnel distributed free canisters of the repellent,
part of a $115,000 supply that city officials hastily bought after
the the outbreak was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, the director of the emergency management office,
said Sunday that most of the adult mosquito population in
northeastern Queens had been killed. He said officials were now
focused on killing larvae to preventnew mosquitoes from developing
and were targeting abandoned tires and stagnant water that could
serve as breeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer said the city would provide free chlorine treatments or
pesticides to residents who want to clean their swimming pools. And
he said that sanitation and transportation workers would continue
to pick up abandoned tires and remove them for shredding and
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's news conference, Dr. Neal Cohen, the city health
commissioner, said that all three of the people who were confirmed
to be suffering from St. Louis encephalitis remained seriously ill
and were being treated at area hospitals. Officials have declined
to reveal their names or those of the two elderly people known to
have died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Cohen said all three of the remaining confirmed cases
involved residents of Queens who are over 65. The elderly and
infants are considered the most susceptible to the disease, which
originates in birds and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   At least 34 other people had exhibited some symptoms known to be
associated with St. Louis encephalitis, including fever, headaches
and stiff necks or muscles, officials said. Officials said 31
people were in hospitals and all were being monitored by the city
Health Department and officials from the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But even as officials stressed that there was minimal danger of
contracting the disease, city residents continued to express
concern throughout the day. Officials said that by Sunday afternoon
more than 7,000 people had called the city's special telephone
number with questions and concerns, and that about 300 calls an
hour were still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   City health officials said that the pesticide sprayed in the
Bronx and in Queens, malathion, posed little or no health risk to
humans. But they had urged residents to stay indoors with windows
closed and air conditioning off while the spraying was done.

JEWISH GROUPS TIGHTEN SECURITY FOR HIGH HOLY DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a year of high-profile anti-Semitic violence,
including a shooting at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles,
Jewish groups in the New York metropolitan region are planning
increased security during the approaching High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   Extra police patrols, private security guards and new alarms and
surveillance cameras are some of the measures that will be employed
from Rosh Hashana through Yom Kippur, a solemn 10-day period of
repentance and introspection.
</P>
<P>
   Security during the High Holy Days has been a concern for the
past 10 or 15 years, but this year, congregations are more
concerned than usual, said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple Beth Chai in Hauppauge, the site of arson in August,
worshippers should see a police presence at holiday services, said
Rabbi Laurence Bazer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the Police Department to have a patrol officer
here, just to relieve any fear and increase comfort,'' Bazer said.
There are no suspects in the fire, which destroyed the synagogue's
office, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Howard Buechler, head of the Dix Hills Jewish Center, a
Conservative congregation of 650 families on Long Island, said the
synagogue was installing alarm systems and enough security cameras
to provide a 360-degree view of the building. The synagogue is
hiring more off-duty police officers to provide security than in
past years, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, begins at sundown on Friday,
and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, starts the night of Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of Sacramento and Chicago and L.A., there's a
degree of anxiety,'' Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League said,
referring to a number of recent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In June, three of the five synagogues in Sacramento, Calif.,
were burned in arson fires, and anti-Semitic fliers were found at
two of the sites. In Illinois, Benjamin Smith went on a shooting
rampage against blacks, Asians and Jews, killing two people over
the Fourth of July weekend, the authorities said. And a man faces
attempted murder charges in the shooting of five people, including
three children, last month at the North Valley Jewish Community
Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hassid, executive director of the Jewish Community Center
on the Hudson in Tarrytown, said his group was improving its
security after the Los Angeles shootings. The suspect, Buford
Furrow, who is also accused of shooting and killing a
Filipino-American mail carrier, had called the attack ``a wake-up
call to America to kill Jews,'' the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The center in Tarrytown, which runs a nursery school, an
after-school program, day camps and clubs for the elderly, now has
plans for staff identification badges, entryway monitors, a panic
button that would summon the police, and a requirement that
everyone sign in.
</P>
<P>
   In upper Manhattan, a spokeswoman for the Jewish Community
Council of Washington Heights and Inwood said that the police would
patrol areas near synagogues 24 hours a day.

JACKSON RECALLS WHEN JEWS AND BLACKS MARCHED AS ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His voice was all weary and worn out. But the church
was hushed, and it was time to talk, time to resurrect the details
of history _ those crucial moments during the great struggles of a
fading century when blacks and Jews fought together for the same
causes.
</P>
<P>
   In a robe of green so luminous that he seemed to shimmer in
Sunday's milky morning light, the Rev. Jesse Jackson recalled
Jewish lawyers who joined with Thurgood Marshall to defeat
segregation. He recalled black soldiers who liberated Jews from
German death camps. He recalled blacks and Jews who joined forces
to pass anti-lynching laws, to fight for labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the century ends, what should we tell our children?'' he
had asked at the outset of his sermon at Riverside Church in
northern Manhattan. Near the end of his remarks, he answered the
question. ``Tell them,'' he said in tremulous voice, ``haters will
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, hundreds of worshippers _ black and white
_ stood and gave him a warm ovation. Some wiped away tears. Jackson
simply beamed and raised his hand in a gesture of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Though he never mentioned Khallid Abdul Muhammad by name,
Jackson clearly meant to remind New Yorkers of the bonds between
blacks and Jews, bonds that had been tested in the last few weeks
by Muhammad's daily displays of anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Again on Saturday, during his second annual Million Youth March
in Harlem, Muhammad punctuated his demands for black separatism by
portraying whites and Jews as the mortal enemies of black people.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, speaking with reporters after his sermon, suggested
that the sparse crowd at Saturday's rally showed that the great
majority of blacks reject Muhammad's views and his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But while Jackson condemned Muhammad for ``inciting'' hatred
with his inflammatory words, he also called Muhammad a ``voice of
alienation and despair,'' and he argued that people should be even
more offended by ``the realities'' of economic distress that have
helped to produce such voices.
</P>
<P>
   Citing crumbling schools, abuses by the police and the failure
of Wall Street to invest in places like Harlem, Jackson said, ``So
long as there is alienation and pain, there will be voices of
alienation and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is no stranger to the subject of the relationship
between blacks and Jews in the United States. In 1984, during his
presidential campaign, Jackson referred to Jews as ``Hymies'' and
to New York as ``Hymietown,'' for which he subsequently apologized.
In the years since, Jackson has worked to solidify relations
between blacks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, speaking at a Jersey City, N.J., memorial for Holocaust
victims, he called for ``the sons and daughters of the Holocaust''
to find common ground ``with the grandsons and granddaughters of
slavery.'' In 1992, he assisted in arranging for a documentary film
about black GIs liberating a German concentration camp to be shown
at the Apollo Theater. Two years later, after the Anti-Defamation
League bought newspaper advertisements to publicize Muhammad's
anti-Semitic speeches, Jackson quickly denounced the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond their differing views toward Jews, Jackson and
Muhammad offer distinctly different visions for the future of
blacks in the United States. Muhammad insistently calls for blacks
to disengage from whites at all levels. On Saturday, for example,
he urged blacks to form separate schools and separate ``people's
militias,'' and he recommended against blacks marrying whites.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, by contrast, argued Sunday for blacks to finish the job
of integration, saying that it had led to huge economic and
political gains for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, the most important fault lines in America divide
not by race, but by economic and educational standing. To overcome
what he described as an ``opportunity gap,'' it seems only natural
for blacks and Jews, given their history of shared scars, to again
join forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a century of struggle together,'' he said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 6:
</P>
<P>
   With each new technological advance, the Internet beckons as a
rich and competitive playing field for business, communication and
entertainment. One of the most promising recent innovations is
high-speed Internet access through upgraded cable television lines.
Before long, these lines are expected to offer a nearly limitless
variety of television programs, movies, music, face-to-face
telephones, commercial transactions and other interactive services.
</P>
<P>
   But that lucrative prospect has produced a battle royal in
cyberspace. It revolves around AT&AMP;T's acquisition of major cable
systems as well as its big stake in Excite(AT)Home, an Internet
service provider that would give AT&AMP;T customers access to the World
Wide Web. The fear is that by controlling both the cable and the
avenue to the Internet, AT&AMP;T can dictate where users can go and
what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The alarms are understandable. America Online, with more than 18
million customers, has joined with other Internet companies and
consumer groups to warn that they all could get shut out if AT&AMP;T
gains an Internet stranglehold, or be forced to pay high fees to
AT&AMP;T to reach potential customers. Similar concerns have been
raised over Time Warner's plans for its cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   The critics want the Federal Communications Commission to
require AT&AMP;T and Time Warner to grant equal access to America
Online and other companies that provide Internet services. For now,
the commission has demurred, and rightly so. As William Kennard,
the FCC chairman, has said, it seems premature to impose rules on
cable Internet access to head off a problem that does not yet exist
in a market that has not yet developed. The FCC is also right to
try to block localities from imposing restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers will have a choice other than cable monopolies
like AT&AMP;T and Time Warner will depend on the emergence of other
high-speed technologies. Local telephone companies have begun to
upgrade their service with a technology known as digital subscriber
lines, or DSL, which could compete with cable. They might not have
acted so quickly if it were not for the threat of AT&AMP;T and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite and wireless communications might also provide
consumers with another way to tap into the Internet. America Online
points out that these alternatives to cable are only in formative
stages. But the interest of consumers is served by letting all
these technologies develop and taking regulatory action only if
they fail to provide adequate competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's future and its prosperity clearly depend on the
principle of maintaining open access for all competitors. This
principle has led the Justice Department to block Microsoft from
using its operating system monopoly to force consumers to use its
browser as the sole means to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With 130 million users around the world, the Internet is driving
a major part of the American economy. The question now becomes
whether cable systems, which are inherently monopolistic
enterprises that traditionally belong to the companies that built
and paid for them, become so dominant that they will restrict
consumer choices in getting news, watching programs or buying
products.
</P>
<P>
   In monitoring AT&AMP;T and Time Warner as they venture more and more
into cable Internet services, the FCC should not let down its
guard. Even though cable systems are not now regulated, as
telephone lines are, the FCC should ensure competition and open
access in the future.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is best for the FCC to wait and see how the new
world unfolds before trying to set rigid rules for it. But if AT&AMP;T
and Time Warner do not exercise some self-restraint and act like
good citizens, allowing fair access for America Online and other
Internet service providers with a legitimate service to offer, they
will find themselves subjected to demands for regulation by the FCC
and local communities. It is in their interest to preserve the open
spirit of the Internet.

EDITORIAL: THE LOOK OF LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Sept. 6:
</P>
<P>
   In 1875, a photographer named Alphonse Deriaz took a picture of
the Butchers' Festival in the Swiss town of Morges. The butchers,
26 of them, stand at attention in the town square, their aprons
swept to one side like dashing military tunics. Each man shoulders
one of the tools of his trade. Five of the butchers share a raised
platform with an enormous white-faced bullock wearing a halter and
a crown of flowers while townsfolk look down from the windows
above. What is striking here, besides the soft expression on the
bullock's face, is the very public way that each butcher identifies
himself by his labor, by his apron and bone saw and by the
fraternity, publicly attested, of fellow butchers.
</P>
<P>
   The festival this photograph preserves feels Old World to us,
utterly unlike a modern American Labor Day, which is now less a
celebration of labor than one last gasping infusion of summer's
ozone. But the police and firefighters and union members and
politicians still march together through the city streets on this
day. It would be something to see the butchers of New York marching
too, dressed as for work _ to see them and the sommeliers and the
toll takers and the men and women who build wooden water tanks and
each of the vocations that give flesh to this society marching side
by side, a society articulated, for one parade, into all its
laboring parts.
</P>
<P>
   What is Old World about the Butchers' Festival is not only the
uniforms and, perhaps, the ability to look the source of meat right
in the eye. It is the sense of lifelong calling, of a time when
going to work meant assuming, for life, an identity as binding, if
perhaps not as deranging, as Bartleby the scrivener's. The days
when men and women bore the distinguishing marks of their labor
have certainly not ended, nor will they ever end as long as the
material world is shaped in part by human muscle. But now as a
nation we seem as migratory in our vocations as we do in our
dwelling places, as ready to shift jobs as to shift cities. There
is a familiar, prevailing sense that no matter what the job, it is
probably too small to contain something as volatile and
transcendent as our latter-day identities, which are made up, we
seem to believe, of finer stuff than those of our ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is both trap and liberation, servitude and release, and it
is tempting, on Labor Day, to think of labor _ even the word itself
_ in largely historical terms, to remember photographs of
coal-darkened miners and young women huddled over sewing machines,
of factory workers looking up from the conveyor belt at the
photographer's flash. But there is nothing historical about these
labors. They are still being performed today. Where the world of
work is concerned, we dwell, even in this country, among our
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Some people dream of living in a world without work. But the
better dream, even on a day as relaxed as this one, is that of a
world in which for everyone who wants it the necessity of work is
tempered by a choice of labors.
