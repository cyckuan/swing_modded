<HEADLINE> Swedish Report Suspects Russia, NATO of Submarine Intrusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian and NATO submarines
may have deliberately violated the Swedish waters in recent years,
said the local press quoting a government report.
</P>
<P>
The allegations of Russian and NATO intrusion were made by the
foreign ministry of Sweden, a country considering itself as
neutral in foreign policies, in a classified report.
</P>
<P>
The report, as cited by the press that has acquired access to
parts of its findings, says Russia is the country which has the
most numerous, the most far-reaching and the most important
reasons for submarine intrusions.
</P>
<P>
NATO submarines may have reasons to make intrusions too, it
says, but most evidences speak against individual NATO countries
carrying on systematic underwater activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the report notes that the motives and reasons are no
evidence of intrusions.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on an investigation by a special group
authorized to scrutinize submarine intrusions during the period
between 1989 and 1995 from a security policy aspect.
</P>
<P>
According to Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen, the
motives described by the document are not enough to identify a
country as an intruder.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Three Iranians were hanged in
the open yard of a prison in central Tehran today on charge of
murders, according to a source at the prison.
</P>
<P>
Hossein Darvish, 36, Hassan Rahmani, 40, and Hamid Kouhi, 28,
were put to death by hanging in the Qasre Prison because they
failed to get a reprieve from Iran's supreme court, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
They had been charged with and confessed to different
murders. The Islamic procedure of Qisas (Retribution) requires
that killers be put to death unless immediate family members
forgive the killer.
</P>
<P>
However, the families of the victims refused to offer
forgiveness and they were present at the prison to witness the
hanging.

<HEADLINE> No Rights Talks in APEC Summit Agenda, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- There will be no discussion of
human rights and democracy when Canada hosts a summit of 18
leaders of Asia Pacific region in Vancouver this Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Discussion of rights issues "is certainly not going to happen,"
said John Klassen, director-general for the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum (APEC) in Canada's Department of Foreign
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Canadian government has also declined to endorse a
parallel Vancouver conference on trade and rights, according to
today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In Canada's approach to APEC, tariff reductions and bolstered
economies come first, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Political and human rights in APEC countries and regions is "a
very sensitive issue," Klassen was quoted as saying. "You're not
going to slip it by anyone (onto an APEC agenda)."
</P>
<P>
Taking an aggressive stand would get nowhere under APEC's veto
system and would undermine Canada's quiet diplomacy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some Canadian diplomats conceded that Vancouver is not the
right place for rights talks.
</P>
<P>
The summit of 18 economies, which account for half of the
world's economic production and two-thirds of the population, has
its own rules, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The week-long Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
culminates with a meeting on November 24-25 of leaders of 18
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to draw 5,000 delegates and worldwide attention
from 3,000 journalists, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Dramatically Raise Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's caretaker government
announced today to raise fuel retail prices by up to 200 percent
as of Tuesday, adding that more price hikes could be coming.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came when many gas stations went without any
petroleum supply and people had to wait in line for about eight
hours to buy their ration of 20 liters in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Price for the most ordinary petroleum will rise to 910 lev
(about 0.31 U.S. dollars) from 328 lev (0.11 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government headed by Prime Minister Stefan
Sofiianski has ordered a ban on fuel exports before April 30.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent poll, only 13 percent of those surveyed
said they would continue to drive their own automobiles and 20
percent said they would only use their family cars in case of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
The severe fuel shortage has forced some cities to stop public
transport services.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Pressing Ukraine for Further Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is planning to double its
loans to Ukraine in 1997 if the country continues economic reforms
and improves the investment climate.
</P>
<P>
This year, the EBRD may provide Ukraine with an additional
300-600 million U.S. dollars, which will equal or exceed its total
loans to this former Soviet republic in the past four years, said
Jaroslav Kinach, the EBRD's representative here.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the EBRD, a multilateral official aid institute
with a mission to finance private enterprises in Eastern Europe,
has extended loans worth 440 million dollars to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
However, Kinach said, increased financial support depends
largely on the Ukrainian government's will and ability to improve
investment conditions in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine is a priority country, but our success in financing
project depends on Ukraine's ability to implement reforms. If
Ukraine is successful, we can be successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD official applauded Ukraine's achievements in reining
in inflation and reforming its currency since its independence in
1991 but said the government "has not done enough to make life
easier for businessmen and investors, both foreign and local."
</P>
<P>
"As difficult as it is, we need to push the government when
they stray off the course of reforms or hesitate too much," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government has submitted a package of economic and social
reforms, which are partly designed to improve the business
climate, to the Ukrainian parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
If the package is not approved by the parliament, Kinach said,
the consequences will spur a sharp decline in foreign investment
and inflation and currency devaluation will follow.
</P>
<P>
"The alternatives are truly terrible to contemplate," the EBRD
official warned.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Rebel Police Leader Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's rebel police
leader Phakiso Molise who surrendered Sunday after a military
crackdown on an 11-day police mutiny has disappeared from his
hideout in the Maseru Palace of King Letsie III.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Parliament early today, Lesotho's Deputy Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili said King Letsie III has informed Prime
Minister Ntsu Mokhehle that Molise and a fellow policeman had
escaped from his Maseru Palace.
</P>
<P>
Molise and seven junior police officers, along with 400
mutinying policemen, seized control of the Police Headquarters on
February 6, causing a disruption in police service throughout the
land-locked southern African country.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) quelled the police
mutiny with artillery shells and machine-gun fire, bringing the
police crisis to an end.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the prime minister, Deputy Prime
Minister Mosisili said the government was surprised when being
told that Molise and some of the rebels were staying in the
King's Palace as the LDF attacked on Police Headquarters and the
Maseru Central Charge Office.
</P>
<P>
All the rebel policemen except Molise at the King's palace
were handed over to the army after the attack, but Molise
requested the King for an assurance that he would not be killed
by the army, said Mosisili.
</P>
<P>
Following further discussions with the prime minister, the
King promised unreservedly that Molise would be handed over to
the army.
</P>
<P>
However, Mosisili told Parliament that up to last night the King
refused to hand over Molise. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Increase Outdoor Ad Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Outdoor advertisement prices for
foreign companies or products are expected to have a five-fold
increase when a new law is at place at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"The new tariffs will be approved by the end of February,"
Stanisla Stashevsky, deputy mayor of Kiev, said today.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all open-air ads will likely be affected by
the change, he said.
</P>
<P>
City officials said Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, is losing
much-needed ad revenues due to widespread piracy.
</P>
<P>
"Although Kiev tariffs for billboards match European norms, the
city has not received substantial amounts of this money," said
Yevhen Zyryansky, head of the city advertising department.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Kiev received only 1 million U.S. dollars in
revenues from outdoor ads last year.
</P>
<P>
However, representatives of several ad agencies alleged that
increased tariffs will lead to more advertising piracy.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the cost of an outdoor billboard rangs from 150 to
1,000 dollars per month in the city, depending on the size and
location of the advertisement.

HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. landmine expert said
here today Africa is the most heavily mined continent with about
50 million uncleared landmines.
</P>
<P>
American Friends Service Committee's Southern Africa

disabled out of a population of 10 million," said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
Retired Colonel Martin Rupiya in the University of Zimbabwe
Center for Defence Studies said Zimbabwe has up to two million
landmines and it is very difficult to remove them.
</P>
<P>
The worst mine-hit regions in Zimbabwe are those communal
areas, mainly located along its border with Mozambique. enditem

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
cleared today the Dutch paper and packaging company KNP BT's
acquisitions of two paper merchants in Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The approval, by EU's executive arm, the European Commission,
cleared KNP BT's way to acquire the control of Wilhelm Seiler GmbH
of Germany and Bunzl Italia SpA of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Both Wilhelm Seiler GmbH and Bunzl Italia SpA are subsidiaries
of the Bunzl group headquartered in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The EU said KNP BT's increasing market shares in Italy and
Germany are unlikely to result in a dominant position there, since
other distributors and producers pose sufficient competition.
</P>
<P>
KNP BT is one of the leading producers of paper, board and
packaging, as well as a distributor of graphic paper and other
office products in Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State to Visit EU Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The relations between the
European Union and the United States will top the agenda on
Tuesday's talks between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and European Commission President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
During her visit to the EU's executive, Albright will discuss
with Santer how to "further substantiate" the New Transatlantic
Agenda, signed in Madrid a year ago and designed to improve EU-US
cooperation in a wide range of areas, a Commission spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, EU-US relations have been strained, mainly
because of the U.S. Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law enacted last March allows naturalized U.S.
citizens to sue foreign firms or individuals trading with
Cuba. U.S. President Bill Clinton has twice suspended that
provision for six months -- the last time on January 3.
</P>
<P>
The EU insisted that it wants to normalize relations with the
United States. But it refused to consider easing their opposition
to the Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand remains the same as we already announced," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
EU trade commissioner Leon Brittan said in Geneva on Saturday
that the EU was actively negotiating a resolution of the dispute
with the United States, and had deferred the date for the
nomination of a disputes panel until February 20.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that in the absence of a better offer than
that had so far been made by Washington, a panel would be named by
the World Trade Organization's Director-General Renato Ruggiero on
February 20.
</P>
<P>
EU and U.S. officials will also discuss the EU's Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) and its impact on the international monetary
market. In addition, the meeting will focus on the enlargement
process of the European Union, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
This is Albright's first overseas trip since taking office in
January. Brussels is the forth leg of Albright's tour which also
brings her to Paris, Rome, Bonn, London, Moscow, Seoul, Tokyo and
Beijing.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- India today said it "deeply
regretted" the U.S. State Department's decision to expel two
Indian diplomats who were discharging their normal
responsibilities as consular officers and categorically rejected
any implication to the contrary, Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the U.S. State Department
confirmed Saturday that the U.S. was requesting the Indian
government to withdraw the two officials for activities
incompatible with their consular status.
</P>
<P>
An Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman said it appears
from media reports that the action has been taken in retaliation
to New Delhi's decision to send back two American diplomats over
the Ratan Sehgal espionage affair.
</P>
<P>
Sehgal was a senior Indian anti-espionage official who
allegedly maintained unauthorized contacts with the two American
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two Indian officials would be returning
to India shortly.
</P>
<P>
"Viewing this unnecessary incident, in the broader perspective
of mature Indo-U.S. relations, India will continue to work with
the United States in improving and expanding friendly ties and
cooperation," the spokesman said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> E-Mail Used as Conduit of Racial Prejudice on US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The use of E-mail to send
hate messages is a growing concern on many college campuses in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The first sign of such things happened on January 31 of last
year when Joon Park, a junior at Indiana University in Bloomington
received a phone call from a frantic student that a hate message
has been sent via electronic mail to 700 members of the Asian
Students Association, the group of which Park is the president.
</P>
<P>
The obscenity-laden message included racial epithets and
ordered the students to leave the United States. Less than a week
later, a similar message was sent to the asssociation's office.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of resentment toward Asians on this campus, and
these messages are a way to express feelings to a large number of
people and easily cover your tracks," Park was quoted on Sunday by
the New York Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although it is difficult to know how prevalent such messages
are, they seem to be increasing, said the American Council on
Education, which is based in Washington and represents 1,700
colleges.
</P>
<P>
At the University of California where Asian-American Population
is about 50 percent, according to a report of the New York Times,
the Federal Government has for the first time prosecuted a hate
crime committed by a former student, Richard Machado, who is
accused of threatening 58 students last fall, most of them
Asian-Americans. He warned Asian-American students that if they did
not leave the campus,"I personally will make it my life career to
find and kill everyone of you personally."
</P>
<P>
E-mail harassment on campus has been examined, and the early
findings show that E-mail has become the most popular
communication tool on campus.

<HEADLINE> Cost of International Calls Expected to Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Countries around the world
are expected to see the cost of international phone calls to
plunge if competition really replaces monopoly.
</P>
<P>
A 10-minute international call from the U.S.A. will likely be
reduced from an average 9.1 U.S. dollars to 2 dollars within a few
years, according to a Monday report of the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
A world Trade Organization agreement reached Saturday in Geneva
among 68 countries will open global competition next January in
telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will save as much as 1 trillion U.S. dollars by 2010,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
No country will force companies to lower rates. But they will
permit competition which will mean lower prices, higher quality
and greater choice.
</P>
<P>
The reason international calls will drop 78 percent is that it
only costs slightly more to complete such calls than it does to
complete calls in the U.S.A., where the average charge is now 16
cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
Phone monopolies have kept the price of long-distance calls
high by overcharging long-distance carriers to complete calls.
U.S. companies complained that they had been paying a multidollar
foreign tax with each call.
</P>
<P>
Cellular systems will likely explode as countries turn to
wireless technology and bypass the expense of laying land lines.
In addition, worldwide Internet access is around the corner which
will greatly reduce the cost of long-distance calls, too.

<HEADLINE> Three S. African Airlines Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A memorandum of
understanding was signed here today between South African
Airways, SA Express Airways and SA Airlink, thus making them a
leading aviation network in Africa, the South African Press
Association (SAPA) has reproted.
</P>
<P>
The formation of this alliance would put its participants in a
position to operate the largest and the most modern fleet of
aircraft and to offer an extensive regional feeder network, SAPA
quoted a statement by the alliance as saying.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of the allince was to provide an
integrated national aviation system which would service all routes
ranging from entry level to the national hubs and would offer
national over-border air transportation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the timing and planning of flight schedules
of the three airlines would be adjusted to offer a fully-integrated
service.
</P>
<P>
Although the three airlines would continue to operate
independently, there would be commonality in their branding in terms
of common check-in procedures and the general appearance of the
airlines, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
South African Airways, the main carrier in the alliance, would
continue to serve intercontinental traffic and the high passenger
volume route between the major cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SA Express Airways and SA Airlink would concentrate on
providing more frequent flights on the various routes most suited to
small passenger planes, the statement said. enditem

<HEADLINE> World Aircraft Market in Next Decade Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,800 commercial
jetliners will be built in the next decade, according to a
forecast made by an independent American firm.
</P>
<P>
These jetliners are valued at 367.2 billion U.S. dollars, or 56
percent of the total value of world aircraft production in the
1997-2006 period, said Teal Group, a Virginia-based defense and
aerospace market analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
According to the Teal report relased here today at the ongoing
annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, a total of 25,537 aircraft of all types valued at 655.5
billion U.S. dollars are expected to be built during the decade.
</P>
<P>
Next come fighters in terms of value: 2,846 valued at 110
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other types include helicopters, business aircraft, military
transports, regional aircraft and trainers.
</P>
<P>
Teal predicted that more than half of the commercial and
military airplanes will be built in the United States, although
the U.S. share of the aviation market will go down from 65.7
percent this year to 59 percent in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Europe will follow with a share of one third of the coming
world market, and its percentage will rise to 35.7 percent in 2006
from 29.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the reason for the drop of U.S. share, Teal said that
ex-Soviet militaries and airlines will again be semi-viable
markets by 2006. Moreover, Britain, France and Germany have
next-generation defense systems not in production today but that
will be in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The "rest of the world" percentage of aircraft manufacturing
will slightly rise from 4.5 percent in 1996 to 5.4 percent a
decade later, Teal analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As far as builders are concerned, Boeing's leading share is
growing, thanks to the company's acquisition of McDonnell Douglas,
Teal said, expecting the percentage of its revenues form world
aircraft production to increase from 38.9 percent in 1997 to 44.2
percent in 2006.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts said that the future world aircraft
market, to some extent, depends heavily on the decisions by giant
companies such as Boeing and Airbus.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE,February 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tourism industry is
this year expected to earn the country 272 million US Dollars,
the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
ZTA Chief Executive Joseph Chigwedere said there was an
expected growth of 10 percent in the sector and about 30 percent
growth in income.
</P>
<P>
However, he could not provide arrival figures as he said the
thrust of the ZTA was on revenue generated.
</P>
<P>
He added since 1980, Zimbabwe's tourist arrivals and receipts
had grown at an average annual rate of 10 percent and 30
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates at a one-day meeting on tourism in Harare
that as one of the strategies to promote the development of
the sector, the ZTA would host a tourism investment conference
later this year.
</P>
<P>
He urged local governments to take more responsibility in
tourism planning and development to ensure that the benefits
accrued to the local people through job creation, increased
incomes and infrastructural development. enditem

<HEADLINE> British MoD May Delay Eurofighter Missile Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MoD) is considering to postpone an important missile program to
provide the main weapons system for the Eurofighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The decision to delay the missile project could mean
Eurofighters would be delivered to the Royal Air Force in 2002
before their main armament becomes available, according to a
report of today's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
A consortium of European aerospace companies, led by British
Aerospace's (BA) missile subsidiary, has been vying with the
American Hughes company for the Future Medium Range Air-to-Air
Missile contract.
</P>
<P>
British military sources noted that the MoD, which was
uncertain about their designs, was considering a one-year
postponement of the program and proposing each side five million
pounds (about eight million dollars) for further research on the
project.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the British government had been trying to
gain access to the American missile market, but the United States
refused last December to buy British short-range dogfight missile
for its navy jets.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is increasing pressure for the British
military authorities to retaliate by rejecting Hughes' bid to win
the missile program.

<HEADLINE> Famine Hits Somalia Due to Prolonged Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought and
political instability are causing a high death toll in war-torn
Somalia and forcing more and more people to pour into capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Following the closure of all kitchens where about 150,000
people were fed once a day in more than 30 camps and mosques
during the holy month of Ramadan, now Mogadishu is teeming with
street beggars.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-nine respected clan elders from Bay, Hiran,
Galgudud and Mudug signed a letter Sunday to call for
drought-famine relief, saying a dozen of people die of
famine-related diseases every day in these regions.
</P>
<P>
Residents living in river land now are reportedly eating the
peels of bananas and grapefruits due to the food crisis caused by
long drought.
</P>
<P>
Somalia is in a state of real drought, claimed the Moslem
Aid-UK agency which has recently completed a survey on drought
situation in Hiran, Bay, Lower Shabelle and Mogadishu
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Shufia Abdalla, the agency's representative, said that
with the help of the UN aid agency, UNICEF, the agency is opening
feeding camps in Wadajir Village 30 kilometers south of Mogadishu
and Hamar Weyne, Gubta, Animal Market and Medina
Enclave areas in the capital.
</P>
<P>
A French aid agency called ACF also runs some feeding centers
for children in the country.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers View Belgian Convergence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- EU finance ministers, holding
their monthly Council Meeting in Brussels today, welcomed
Belgium's strategy for fiscal consolidation after appraising the
country's new convergence program.
</P>
<P>
Covering the 1997-2000 period, the Belgian program has been
described by the ministers as general positive, even though a
further reduction in the debt ratio would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has a fair sized safety margin to meet the three
percent public deficit relative to GDP(Gross Domestic Product)
criteria by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The cyclical macro-economic scenario decided up by the Belgian
authorities contemplate eroding the size of the deficit from 3.4
percent in 1996 to 2.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, the deficit should be respectively
two percent, 1.6 percent and 1.6 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Described by the ministers as ambitious yet credible, the
Belgium program has its merits, as is illustrated in the reversal
of the spiraling debt, which is set to fall from 130.4 percent of
GDP in 1996 to 127 percent in 1997 and eventually to settle at
120.5 percent of GDP by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers agreed to invite the Belgian authorities
and the European Commission(EC) to monitor the implementation of
the program and to report to the Council once a year.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, updated program from France and Germany
are due to be studied on March 17.
</P>
<P>
Programs from Italy, Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands
will get the same treatment on May 12.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Promise to US on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu denied today that he had promised to the
United States not to build settlements in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after holding talks with visiting Mexican Foreign
Minister Jose Angel Gurria Trevino, Netanyahu, who just returned
from his U.S. visit earlier today, ridiculed press reports about
his promise.
</P>
<P>
"I'm simply amazed at what I am hearing here. Apparently,
somebody is trying to make headlines over nothing," Netanyahu
said, adding he would convene two meetings of the Ministerial
Committee on Jerusalem Affairs to discuss building settlements in
Har Homa neighborhood in east Jerusalem and "make all the
necessary decisions."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office announced later that the
ministerial committee would meet Tuesday to discuss specifically
road construction in Jerusalem, and a second meeting would be
held next week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan also dismissed that
Netanyahu had made any promise to the U.S.. He reiterated the
government's stand that Jerusalem would be an indivisible
capital city of Israel, and the Jewish state would "build
whenever we feel like it and wherever we feel like it."
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan admitted that the government was considering the
timing of settlement building in east Jerusalem for fear that it
would spark violent reaction from the Palestinians similar to
the last September bloodshed, due to the opening of a tunnel near
the holy site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the city, which killed
over 70 people.
</P>
<P>
But he vowed Israel would not live under threats of violence,
warning that if the Palestinians resorted to violence, the peace
process could be ruined.
</P>
<P>
"We have made very clear that the peace process cannot
continue with consistent threats of violence. Violence cannot be
made an option for the Palestinians, and if they accept violence
as an option, there will be no peace process," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some coalition and opposition lawmakers continued
to put pressure on Netanyahu to start immediately the building
plan in Har Homa neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
A group of coalition lawmakers from the Likud, Third Way and
National Religious Party have already declared that they would
topple the government if it did not go ahead with the building
plan.
</P>
<P>
Likud lawmaker Michael Kleiner, who heads the group, said it
now includes 28 Knesset (Parliament) members. He said the group
would demand Netanyahu keep his promises and commitments on the
Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
Third Way's Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said
today that it was the time to start the building. "It's time to
see more Israeli people in east Jerusalem and one of the ways is
to build settlements," he said, adding that the plan would
start very soon.
</P>
<P>
Likud's Communications Minister Limor Livnat said she believed
that Netanyahu would soon give the green-light for the building
project. She added that despite of the pressures from the
U.S. and the Palestinian side, the government would not
compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party, which was split over the issue,
decided today not to present a non-confidence motion over the
government's failure to go ahead with the building project.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, former foreign minister and leading contender for
Labor's leadership, said he supported the plan of building in
east Jerusalem. But Yossi Beilin, another contender for Labor
leadership, argued that the timing was not good now to go ahead
with the building plan.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said while he supported the building project, which
was also promised by the previous Labor government, he thought
the best timing for it would be after the permanent talks with
the Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Receive Economic Assistance from EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Small and Medium-Size
Enterprises (SMES) in Greece will receive 100 billion drachmas
(about 400 million U.S. dollars) of economic assistance from
European Union funds up until the end of 1999, the country's
National Economy Undersecretary Christos Pachtas announced today.
</P>
<P>
He added that the intermediaries which will administer the
funds had already been selected for the seven biggest geographical
departments of the country.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the regional operational program
(PEP), SMES operating for at least three years will have the right
to submit proposals. In the case of Athens and Salonika, they must
employ between 5-30 persons and have recorded a turnover of at
least 120 million drachmas (480,000 U.S. dollars) in one of the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
In other regions of the country, the corresponding limits are
3-30 employees and 70 million drachmas (280,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Enterprises will receive grants equal to 50 percent of the
investment cost for projects costing 5-60 million drachmas
(20,000-240,000 U.S. dollars). Investments costing over 60 million
drachmas will be accepted but the maximum grant will not exceed 30
million drachmas (120,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Angola Sees Sharp Reduction in School Enrolment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The school enrolment rate in
Angola has reduced sharply in recent years, Education Minister
Burity Dasilva said in the central city of Kuito today when all
schools opened around the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The reduction is due to the nearly 20-year-long civil war
which has destroyed a huge number of schools and the current poor
quantity and quality of teachers, Dasilva said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the church, the non-governmental groups, the
businessmen and all walks of the life to make efforts to
solve the education crisis which should be seen as a national
problem.
</P>
<P>
He called for the immediate improvement of teachers' working
and living conditions so as to attract people of ability to
devote themselves to education.
</P>
<P>
However, the promotion of education depends on sound political
development, the forming of a government of national unity and
reconciliation, as well as the implement of a set of political
and economic measures concerned, he said.
</P>
<P>
The free movement of people and cargos, better communication
facilities, the more favorable conditions in rural areas are also
needed to develop education, he noted.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers Agree Aid for Armenia, Georgia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Up to ECU 265 million(about
307 million U.S. dollars) will be on its way to Armenia, Georgia,
and if appropriate, to Tajikistan, in the form of ECU 170 million
in long-term loans and ECU 95 million in grants, according to a
decision made by EU finance ministers here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a statement after their monthly meeting
that they agreed in principle to provide exceptional financial
assistance to Armenia, Georgia, and that "a similar operation will
be considered for Tajikistan once circumstance allow".
</P>
<P>
This assistance, as what the ministers termed an "exceptional"
measure, was aimed to support the tough reform programs - and
the associated social costs - that Armenia, Georgia and Tajikistan
are undertaking.
</P>
<P>
On February 4, the European Commission has proposed to grant
ECU 50 million to these three countries in five equal annual
installments of ECU 10 million, from 1997 onwards.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the finance ministers decided to invite the
Commission to augment the proposal for the loan, repayable over up
to 15 years, with higher grant elements, i.e. ECU 10 million in
1997 and ECU 17 million in each of the following five years.
</P>
<P>
But the ministers stressed that these grants should be used
only for early repayment of the loan of ECU 170 million mentioned
above.
</P>
<P>
The Commission will negotiate conditions for the assistance, and
Tajikistan will qualify only if it wins the support of the
International Monetary Fund this April.

ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Monza Formula One racetrack
officials shook off opposition from environmentalists to win the
right to hold Italy's Grand Prix race here for another ten years,
according to reports reaching here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Monza city council extended a contract to hold the Formula
One race on the track inside the city's huge park until 2007, the

</P>
<P>
Disputes between environmentalists and track officials over
cutting down trees to extend the racetrack's safety zone
jeopardized the race in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, race track officials will pay the city
of Monza rent of 470,000 dollars a year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Anticipates Role in Reviving Syrian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van
Mierlo said today that the European Union (EU) may play an
affirmative role in restarting the Israel-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo, whose country currently holds the rotating EU
presidency, made remark here after talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the Mideast peace
process this morning.
</P>
<P>
The EU is trying to do its best for the resumption of the
process on the Syrian-Israeli track, the envoy said, adding that
he had visited Syria and met with its president at the request of
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be impossible, during the coming months, for
Europe to play an affirmative role to secure the resumption of the
process on this track," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have frozen since last March after a
series of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants Israel to return the Golan Heights captured in the
1967 Mideast war for a comprehensive peace agreement. But Israel
only agrees to a partial withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Dutch counterpart
following the talks, Moussa told reporters that they discussed
over a working breakfast the importance of "the balanced roles"
Europe and the United States should play in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that Europe does not want to limit itself to
just economic and financial aspects only, but it likes to play a
political role as well," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo, also Dutch deputy premier, said the EU has made great
efforts over the past few months in advancing the peace march,
referring to the presence of its special Mideast envoy Miguel
Angel Moratinos of Spain, who is due here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos did a good job during the talks, leading to the
executive protocol of the Hebron deal, Mierlo said at the end of a
two-day visit to Egypt, a part of his Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
Mierlo accentuated that Europe would complement the U.S. role
for propelling the Mideast peace process since the latter has
played a definitive role since a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the U.S. should avoid playing its role in the
interests of Israel only, while Europe should also shun
supporting Palestine alone.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans were not at first enthusiastic about accepting a
European role in the process but they, and also the Israelis, have
fully accepted us," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Israeli settlement policies, the Dutch
official said that the EU believes it has a negative impact on
the peace process.

</P>
<P>
The city plans to support key enterprises, concentrating its

<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The spill of sulfuric acid
from a Mongolian-U.S. joint venture copper smeltery has so far
killed five people in the north central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The spill, from Erdemi Copper Smeltery in Orhon Province,
happened last Wednesday, a day before the 14-million-dollar joint
venture came into production, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
However, the smeltery's management allegedly covered up the
incident and secured the participation of government officials in
a ceremony the next day for kicking up the facility's operation.
</P>
<P>
The acid eventually spilled up to 6 kilometers from the site
and caused severe damage to the environment and human health,
prompting the local government to impose a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was designed to produce 3,000-6,000 tons of
pure copper a year by using locally available ore resources, so as
to start up Mongolia as a copper producing nation.

BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Beijing Lions and Henan
Wildcats delayed their rivals' run to the Chinese professional
basketball league finals by winning their second home matches at
the best-of-seven semi-finals on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, which had lost its first three matches, downed
Guangzhou Rams 108-99, while Henan, also trailing 0-3 going to
Tuesday's games, nipped Jilin Tigers 117-106.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, which took a 51-48 lead in the first half, extended
the margin to 85-74 in the end of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The host team jumped to 91-74 with a 6-0 run at the beginning
of the final quarter. Guangzhou clawed back tenaciously and put
up a 12-0 run to overtake Beijing 97-96 with four minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's momentum ended here. With many a defensive error
plus a low field goal percentage, Beijing posted a 12-2 run to

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
assured the Philippine government that the recent controversial
decision by the Supreme Court over the Manila Hotel privatization
project will not affect European investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Foreign Department confirmed today that during a
recent visit to Manila, two EU representatives gave the assurance
that the Manila Hotel controversy will not affect their existing
as well as planned future investments in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court nullified the winning bid
of a Malaysian firm to purchase the Manila Hotel and ordered the
government to sell the hotel to a Philippine bidder.
</P>
<P>
The high tribunal ruled that the hotel belongs to the country's
heritage and should not be alienated to foreign control.
</P>
<P>
The decision sparked a controversy and a spate of protest from
the local and international business communities as well as the
Philippine government itself.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos even suggested convening Congress as a
constituent assembly to propose amendments to the charter that
will define and limit the judiciary's intrusion into the country's
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Department has tried to explain the controversial
decision to the foreign business community, allaying fears of a
worsening investment environment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the third largest investor in the Philippines after
Japan and the United States.

By the end of 1996, there were 1.1 million motorized vehicles
in the capital, up 93.9 percent over the figure of 1990. And
regular traffic jams are reported on 99 areas on the roads in
urban and suburban areas, a report from the traffic management
department shows.
</P>
<P>
The major reasons for the tie-ups are that the construction of
roads cannot keep up with the increase in vehicles, the number of
traffic violations is rising, and traffic management is flawed.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the city will develop the public transportation
system this year by increasing the number of buses, establishing
suitable driving lines for buses and giving them priority to pass
through some busy intersections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the city will strengthen the management of
mini-bus and taxi companies, and urge them to improve their
services.
</P>
<P>
The city should improve its anti-disaster system, with the
focus on floods, earthquake and fire prevention, Jia noted.
</P>
<P>
The anti-disaster work should emphasize reinforcing the dams of
Miyun Reservoir and dredging the Yongding and Tonghui rivers to
guarantee a safe anti-flood system for the capital city.

improve the management of the city's floating population, solve
the persistent problem of traffic jams and upgrade the
anti-disaster system this year, the city's acting mayor Jia
Qinglin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing Fifth Session of the city's Tenth
People's Congress, Jia said that tightening the control of the
floating population should be placed at the top of the agenda, as
the number of the people in the city who are not Beijing residents
has gone above three million.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total number of the migrant workers should be
brought under control, while the regulations on employing them
should be closely observed and the illegal labor market be wiped
out.
</P>
<P>
Better management should be in place to supervise the living
areas of the migrants, peddlers in the open-air markets and
markets for agricultural products should be required to hold
business licenses, and the public security departments and
neighborhood communities should keep a close watch over the
temporary residents, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in 1997, Beijing will ease the traffic
congestion through a unified traffic management system. People who
violate traffic regulations will be punished according to law, and
the total number of vehicles will be limited.

MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is likely to
formally join the Organization of Economic Cooperation for
Development (OECD) in the next two months, the Foreign Department
said today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the country is considering joining the

</P>
<P>
The department said the Philippines, which has always been a

</P>
<P>
The OECD is a group of highly industrialized and developed
countries, which studies and monitors the economic development of
other countries and have their economies likewise monitored by
fellow members.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group are also regular sources of its
development funds provided to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore are already OECD members. The

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leaders Call for Dialog Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinian Leaders from
different political factions today called for a comprehensive
dialog between the eight PLO groups, including the extremist Hamas
and Jihad movements.
</P>
<P>
The call was jointly made by Mayef Hawatmeh, secretary general
of the Damascus-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (DFLP), and Farouq Kadoumi, Head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization Political Department, who is currently in
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
A DFLP statement quoted Hawatmeh and Kadoumi as underlining at
their meeting here the necessity of achieving Palestinian national
unity.
</P>
<P>
Without unity, they said, the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) institutions would remain paralyzed, and it would be
impossible to halt Israeli settlement in Jerusalem, the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The two Palestinian leaders agreed "to make joint efforts to
conduct a genuine Palestinian national dialog."
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to jointly rebuild the PLO institutions for
unity, which is "the more powerful weapon in the hands of the
Palestinian people, especially on the eve of the
Palestinian-Israeli final status negotiations due to start on
March 17."

<HEADLINE> Portuguese President Confident of Macao's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio said here tonight that he is "fully confident" of Macao's
future after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The president made these remarks at a grand reception held at
the Macao Governor's Palace for his six-day visit to Macao
before his week-long official tour to Beijing next week.
</P>
<P>
"Macao owns a distinguished political structure, has good
relations with neighboring regions... and is also capable of
cultivating relationship with the European Union and the United
States," he said. "Macao will not only have new government, but
also enjoy its regional and international status set aside in the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration."
</P>
<P>
"Macao will thus enjoy greater prosperity and political and
social stability in the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Macao, the president is scheduled to meet
with top officials of the Macao government, heads of local leading
communities, and director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
Wang Qiren. He will also host the opening ceremony of a number of
public facilities.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Sampaio to visit Macao after he took
office as Portuguese president last year. He is expected to
discuss a wide range of issues concerning the transition of Macao
and Sino-Portuguese relations with Chinese leaders during his
upcoming first visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal maintain good relations since the two sides
established diplomatic relations in 1979. Under the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao, China
will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao as of December
20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said that both Portugal and China want a successful
transition in Macao, thus stepping up their cooperation now and in
the future.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will play an important role in the bilateral cooperative
relations (between Portugal and China)," said Sampaio. "It is the
historical destination for Macao and both peoples are glad to see
it that way."

<HEADLINE> Israel Decides to Advance Construction In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel decided today to
step up road construction in Jerusalem in an attempt to support
its assertion that the city is united and exclusively its eternal
capital.
</P>
<P>
The discussion of the sensitive construction issue regarding
the city at today's metting of the Ministerial Committee on
Jerusalem Affairs was proposed by Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, according to a committee communique.
</P>
<P>
The committee decided to advance the construction of Highway 45
and Highway 4 which connects Jerusalem with Highway 45.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided to accelerate the processes
regarding both the outline and the detailed plans for
constructing the Eastern Ring Road in Jerusalem, including the
Mt. Scopus road.
</P>
<P>
The planning for Highway 80 will also be advanced, said
the communique.
</P>
<P>
The construction in Jerusalem is always sensitive to the
Palestinians who claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has recently come under fierce attacks from inside
his rightwing coalition for not immediately advancing
construction of Jewish settlement in Har Homa, south Jerusalem,
after Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ze'ev Begin, Likud Member of Knesset, declared that he will
submit to a Knesset (parliament) plenum an urgent motion of no
confidence on what he called "The Dangers of Dividing Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that during his recent visit to the United
States, he reiterated Israel's "policy of insisting on our
sovereignty over all parts of Jerusalem and ensuring the unity and
security of the city."
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, Netanyahu promised
U.S. President Bill Clinton that Israel would not resume
construction of Jewish settlement in Har Homa for fear that it
should trigger a fresh wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
General Security Service (GSS) head Ami Ayalon reportedly
warned the cabinet that a decision to build at Har Homa could lead
to what he called a "difficult reaction" by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon made a similar warning before the government opened the
tunnel in East Jerusalem last September. In the following days of
bloodshed violence, 61 Palestinians and 15 Israelis were
killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Acting Mayor Jia
Qinglin has vowed to continue the fight for a clean and honest
government.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth Plenary Session of the Tenth Municipal People's
Congress which opened in Beijing on Monday, Jia noted that great
emphasis will be placed on the anti-corruption campaign in the new
year, as successes were achieved in the work in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first half of last year, the
reception fees for the local Party committees, governments and
legislature dropped by nine percent over the same 1995 period, and
similar charges for other 114 Party and governmental institutions
decreased by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city also created a records system for 40 municipal-level
officials and 197 department chiefs who are permitted to use cars
for public events.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, 40 cases involving officials occupying
unauthorized public housing have been handled, and 128 apartments
and 1.31 million yuan (about 167, 400 US dollars) worth of housing
loans have been retrieved.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, 31,000 officials above division chief level
completed income reports, and some 3,100 officials handed over
gifts which were valued at 1.24 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Among the city's 3,556 state-owned enterprises, 3,390 have
adopted a reporting practice through which gifts must be turned in
to the high-level departments.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the discipline inspection authorities looked into

department-level officials and 165 section chiefs.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Skating Union
(ISU) has ordered an immediate review of its judging system to
find a way to make results more understandable to the public.
</P>
<P>
The move, described by the ISU as historic, is a result of
confusion that surrounded the men's final at the European
championships in Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
"It is now time for a major review of the placing system," said
ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta in a press release from the winter
council meetings in Cape Town, South Africa last week.
</P>
<P>
"Figure skating is an extremely technical sport and it is not
realistic to expect the public to be familiar with the complex but
necessary rules.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is crucial that the public can easily understand
how our sport is judged and we must develop a fair and
comprehensible system."
</P>
<P>
The current judging system is based on placements of skaters in
the short and free programmes of the event.
</P>
<P>
The ISU's figure skating and ice dance technical committees
will conduct feasibility studies into alternative placing systems
and submit a report to the ISU council at its next meeting in
Prague in June.

Rongji today called for the study of Deng Xiaoping's economic
theories to boost the country's socialist modernization drive.

Guided by the basic principles of Marxism, Deng has integrated
the conditions of China with the rest of the world through his
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Zhu

The forum was sponsored by the Financial and Economic Leading
Group under the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.

Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said Deng has put forward a

thought to add to the principles concerning China's socialist
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier noted that over the past two decades, China's
achievements in the process of reform, opening-up and
modernization have shown that Deng Xiaoping's economic theories
are scientific, have great vitality and should be taken as basic
guidelines for building the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two books on Deng's economic theories have been
published; the introduction to one was written by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.

President Hosni Mubarak today over bilateral relations,
Euro-Egyptian ties and the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The extended session of talks were attended by Egyptian Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his
Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes Y Juan, said the Egyptian MENA
news agency.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks, Moussa told reporters that contacts

peace march and to the U.S. role as well.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed the importance for the two sides to interact so
that the peace process may "bear fruit and have a sound outcome,
which does not tilt in favor of one party at the detriment of
another."
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Mubarak and Carlos also exchanged views on the
Mediterranean policy and cooperation within the framework of the
Mediterranean forum and the Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
King Carlos opened the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991 which
brought the Arabs and the Israelis to the negotiating table and
set the land-for-peace formulas as the basis for regional peace.
</P>
<P>
King Carlos arrived here Monday night, accompanied by a
50-member strong businessmen delegation, representing major
industrial companies in the southwestern European country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Spain signed a cooperation and coordination accord at
the start of the four-day visit of King Juan Carlos Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The accord between the industries federations of both countries
provides for promoting direct contacts between companies in the
two countries and the development of bilateral trade relations.

trade exchange, joint investment and privatization in both
countries to be held on the fringe of the visit.

only at 500 million dollars, with the trade balance tilting in
favor of Spain.

cooperation in March 1991, an agreement on investment protection
and an agreement to avoid dual taxation in November 1992.

<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Public Health Minister Chen
Minzhang today called on the whole nation to be more aware of the
hazards of smoking, take forceful measures to limit the number of
tobacco advertisements, and discourage smoking among young people.
</P>
<P>
Chen told a meeting of the organizing committee for the Tenth
World Conference on Tobacco or Health that his ministry will
launch a massive campaign to publicize the dangers of smoking to
encourage more people to kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held in Beijing from August 24-28, with
more than 1,800 participants from over 130 countries and regions
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Themed "Tobacco: Gradually Spreading Pestilence," the meeting
will focus discussions on world trends of tobacco use and
strategies to control the popularity of smoking.
</P>
<P>
A large exhibition will be staged during the conference to
display the achievements of smoking control campaigns.

<P>
China is a major tobacco producer in the world and has 300
million smokers. A recent survey shows that the number of smokers
in the country has increased, and many of them are young people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Has Over 7.34 Million Industrial Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China has made clear with a
just-ended national industrial census its industry's scale,
efficiency and structure after tens years of groping in the dark.
</P>
<P>
The census, taken in 1996, revealed that at the end of 1995
China had 7.342 million industrial enterprises, 2.156 million more
than in 1985, when China's second national census was done.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the enterprises employed 147 million
people, 56.8 percent more than in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Li Qiming, spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau, told a
press conference today that the value-added output of the Chinese
industry grew at an annual rate of 13.4 percent during the span of
ten years, adding the decade saw the quickest industrial
development since 1949, when New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
The census found that China had 118,000 state-owned enterprises
at the end of 1995, 24,000 more than in 1985 and the state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) continued to serve as the backbone of the
national industry in the ten years.
</P>
<P>
"Their total asset was valued at 4,747.2 billion yuan,
accounting for 53.7 percent of the national industrial total," he
said. "The rate, which was 74.6 percent in 1985, dropped annually
by 2.1 percentage points."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, SOEs enjoy dominant positions in petroleum
and natural gas mining, coal gas production and supply, oil
refining, tap water development and supply, wood and bamboo
felling and transportation, as well as some important energy and
raw materials industries.
</P>
<P>
Expounding the difficulties of the SOEs, the spokesman said
that the Chinese state industry's assets-liability ratio stood at
65.8 percent at the end of 1995, higher than most of
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that SOEs also suffered a heavy social burden and that
last year they paid 60.38 billion yuan in retirement and welfare
funds, which accounted for 15 percent of their profit.
</P>
<P>
The census also found that China had 59,311 overseas-funded
industrial enterprises, which employed 8.993 million people, at
the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that oversees investment mainly convergeed in
coastal regions in and that overseas investment in the five provinces
and autonomous regions accounted for less than one percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
"The overseas investors also tended to crowd in electronics,
telecommunications equipment, textile and food processing
industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Chinese workers' competency has also improved in the
ten years.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, engineers and technicians accounted for six
percent of the staff in the Chinese industry. The rate marked a
rise of 3.2 percentage points from 1985.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants U.N. Veto Power Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today called for
a review of the veto power in the United Nations Security Council
to provide for any decision to be vetoed by at least two of its
five permanent members instead of one as practiced so far.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that Malaysia and
some other U.N. members who shared Kuala Lumpur's view in this
matter feel that the veto power is only effective when two
permanent members exercise the right and not only one.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the remarks after a meeting with visiting
U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for International
Organization Affairs Princeton Lyman.
</P>
<P>
Lyman, however, expressed Washington's objection to such
review. "The U.S. would not want to see a change in the veto of
the permanent members. We think it (the veto) is not much of a
problem as, perhaps, in the past."
</P>
<P>
He said the Security Council had become effective lately and
there had been little use of the veto power because there was a
great deal of pressure on everyone to be cooperative and
effective.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Tax Rebate Policy Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans no major changes
to its policy on export tax rebates this year, according to a
senior taxation official.
</P>
<P>
"Both the rebate rates and the system will remain largely
unchanged this year," said Cheng Faguang, deputy-director of the
State Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
"If the policies and detailed operation rules are changed, they
will only be made even more to benefit the interest of exporters,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also said that China will pay all the delayed tax rebates
to exporters by the end of this year, as dictated by a State
Council decision at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The SAT will work together with other government departments to
formulate a set of rules on tax exemptions and rebates for
manufacturers that export goods on their own, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rules will be implemented after State Council approval, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that Chinese exporters were paid 82.63
billion yuan (about 9.9 billion US dollars) in tax rebates last
year, up 50.5 percent over 1995.

The SET index closed at 700.15 points today, following a slide

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Minister Accuses UN of Delaying Food Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 18 (Xinhua) - Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammad
Mehdi Salsh has accused the United Nations Sanctions Committee of
delaying the approval of agreements Iraq has signed for the
supply of food and medicine, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Salsh made the remarks Monday in an interview with the paper
before leaving here for Cairo, Egypt, to attend an Arab meeting.
</P>
<P>
Salsh said Iraq has already concluded orders for importing
products under the oil-for-food deal with the U.N. from eight
countries, including the United States, France, Jordan and
five other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Salsh said the U.N. Sanctions Committee has been
"unjustifiably" delaying the implementation of these contracts,
inflicting losses on exporters, including those from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq expected the first shipment of wheat, rice and milk under
the U.N. deal to arrive in Iraq in the second half of March and
the Trade Ministry will distribute the food supplies in April in
accordance with a government plan, said Salsh.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had decided to import food via Jordanian port Aqaba and
nearly 300,000 tonnes of food supplies will be arriving through
the port, earning Jordan nearly 15 million U.S. dollars in service
fees, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Salsh stressed that Iraq's stand towards Jordan remains
unchanged and "good" Iraqi-Jordanian relations were helping Iraq
maintain its steadfastness in the face of economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Sanctions Committee experts last Thursday agreed on a way
to speed up the approval of food and medicine contracts. Up to now,
only four of the 153 export orders have been approved by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq can export 2 billion
dollars of oil over six months to pay for food and medicine as
well as to defray U.N. costs and war reparations.

<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Most of Zimbabwe's dams now
have spilled, leaving some villagers stranded because of
flooding, the country's national news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said of the 57 inland dams, 40 are over 90 percent
full, with 34 already spilling.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has experienced over seven weeks of continuous rains
with major dams now recording a combined capacity of over 82.19
percent, latest government statistics on the state of major dams
show.
</P>
<P>
The spilling of major dams has left families stranded and
schools closed in some parts of Mashonaland Central, Manicaland
and Midlands Provinces, as homes and schools were swept away by
floods.
</P>
<P>
The spills are however good news for urban local authorities
like Harare and other urban centers whose supply dams and water
reservoirs are 100 percent full, assuring water supply for the
next two and half years.
</P>
<P>
The news agency also reported that elsewhere in the southern
African region, tens of thousands of people have been left
homeless in Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa by flooding.
</P>
<P>
In Malawi and Mozambique, which share the same rivers as they
run east toward the Indian Ocean, food and blankets have been

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- British government on Monday
denied "deliberately burning down" the ancient Benin city in
today's Edo State of Nigeria, when its troops invaded the Binin
kingdom in 1897.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Daily Champion" quoted the British higher
commissioner to Nigeria, Thorold Masefield as saying this at the
opening of the one-week commemorative activities marking the
centenary of the British invasion.
</P>
<P>
According to the high commissioner, the fire which destroyed
the roofs of many of the houses in Benin started "accidently",
not deliberately.

Benin people, but explained that they did not remove all "but
only those half buried in the palace."

<HEADLINE> Citibank Moves to Shanghai's Pudong for Yuan Business Eds: More details added </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Citibank of the United States
on Monday became the first overseas bank to move its Shanghai
branch to the city's Pudong New Area to qualify for business in
the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
Citibank is making preparations for yuan-based services, though
the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, is still drawing up operational guidelines and tax
structures for overseas banks selected to deal in yuan-based
business on a trial basis, said John Beeman, Citibank's chief
representative for China.
</P>
<P>
"We can handle yuan-based loans and deposits, provide
guarantees and settlements, and deal in Chinese treasury and
financial bonds once the operational rules are formulated and we
pass Chinese financial regulatory examinations," Beeman said.
</P>
<P>
"It won't take a long time and I expect our bank to be able to
do yuan business first in April," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citibank is one of eight foreign banks that have been approved
by China's central bank to deal in the local currency on a trial
basis in Pudong, an emerging financial and trade zone separated
from downtown Shanghai by the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
Citibank has the biggest business network among all American
banks in China. It also has branches in Beijing and Shenzhen and
representative offices in Guangzhou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The other seven approved overseas banks are the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., the Industrial Bank of Japan, Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, Daiichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, Sanwa
Bank of Japan, the British Standard Chartered bank, and the
International Bank of Paris and Shanghai, a joint-venture between
France's Banque Nationale de Paris and the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, China's largest commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks given licences for yuan business can only
operate in Shanghai and their clients are limited to
overseas-funded enterprises and overseas individuals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese rules also stipulate that the amount of foreign banks'
yuan liabilities is capped at 35 percent of their debt in foreign
exchange and they must follow interest rate policies for Chinese
banks.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks must relocate their Shanghai branches to Pudong
as a qualification for yuan business, though they are permitted to
retain sub-branches in Puxi, as east Shanghai is known, to provide
foreign currency services.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the restrictions, Beeman said he is confident in
Citibank's prospects in yuan business.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Citibank's experience in local currency
business in more than 130 countries and regions will enable it to
make profits in China.
</P>
<P>
He added that Citibank, which has become a major clearing bank
for the US dollar at the Shanghai-based China Foreign Exchange
Trade System, plans to upgrade its Guangzhou office to a branch
and set up more representative offices in other Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> 6 Countries to Discuss Zaire Crisis in Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of South
Africa, Tanzania and Kenya left here today for Kinshasa to
discuss the crisis of Great Lakes region with Zairean government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka
at a press conference here today before their departure.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said that foreign ministers from Zimbabwe, Cameroun
and Congo, and representative of the Organization of African
unity would join them in discussions in the Zairean capital.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the main agenda of the Kinshasa
meeting is to examine possibilities of holding a third Heads of
State summit in Nairobi to discuss the deteriorating Great Lakes
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a follow-up to another foreign ministers
meeting held recently in Pretoria, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Two Heads of State summits sponsored by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi were held last year in Nairobi to seek solutions
to the burning crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In view of the deteriorating situation in eastern Zaire,
President Moi appealed on February 12 to the United Nations, the
United States and the European Union to provide a force to act as
a buffer between Zaire and its neighbors, meaning Uganda, Rwanda
or Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Zaire accuses the three Great Lakes countries of Backing its
rebels who took up arms to fight last October. But these
countries have denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
However, Ugandan President Y. Museveni recently hinted that
since Kinshasa backs the Hutu rebels to fight Kigali, maybe
Rwanda has supported the Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire to fight
for their right of existence. The Tutsis are part of the rebels
who have now vow to topple the regime in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Kenyan leader called for an immediate
stop by countries fuelling the armed conflict in eastern Zaire by
being directly involved in or supplying combatants with weapons.
</P>
<P>
In January, he also urged the rebels in eastern Zaire to move
out of occupied towns of Goma, Bukavu and Uvira to avoid a
looming war.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that when the rebels move out of these towns, it
would enable international community to seek solutions to the
crisis without further bloodshed.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The five-day specialized
Inter-Parliamentary Conference concluded here this afternoon after
adopting a final declaration by the president of the conference
and speaker of the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) of India.
</P>
<P>
"All our work was naturally inspired by the results of the
Fourth World Conference on Women which took place in Beijing in
September 1995; our meeting was designed to maintain the momentum
and ensure the implementation of the commitments made by the
governments on that occasion," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"During our debates, we have extended and amplified the content
of the Beijing Parliamentary Declaration and the
Inter-Parliamentary Union Plan of Action to correct present
imbalance in the participation of men and women in political
life," it said.
</P>
<P>
What has to be developed, in modern democratic societies, is
nothing less than a new social contract in which men and women
work in equality and complementarity, enriching each other
mutually from their differences, it further said.
</P>
<P>
"A major shift in the mind-set of both men and women is needed.
This would generate a positive change of attitudes towards women
and lead to a new balance in society at large and in politics in
particular," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It goes without saying that women's political rights must be
considered in the overall context of human rights and cannot be
dissociated therefrom. Men and women politicians, governments and
parliaments must pursue their efforts towards the recognition of
these rights and the implementation of the international
instruments which relate to them," it added.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Presidential
Commission on Corruption plans to hold anti-corruption clinics
with implementers and members of the public to make the
anti-corruption campaign more effective.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here on Monday by the commision's
secretary, Mr. Alex Muganda in his presentation on the findings
of the commission at a one-week workshop on investigative
journalism for female journalists.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said the clinics would focus on education and
awareness creation on corruption among members of public. He said
people would be educated on their rights, why they should say
'no' to corruption and where to submit complaints.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Muganda further explained that in a report to President
Mkapa last December, the commission reported that corrupt
practices were rampant from top leadership positions to the
bottom and suggested remedies to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Muganda said although a number of people were mentioned in
the report no legal action has been taken against them so far
allegedly because law enforcers were still investigating the
allegations.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Civil Aviation
Authority has decided to build a second international airport at
Soroti, 130 miles northeast of capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily "the Monitor" today, the proposed
airport will be of similar scale in terms of equipment and
service with Entebbe Airport, the sole international airport in
the east African country at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for choosing Soroti was that it is home to a
regional flying school.
</P>
<P>
Soroti stood out also because of its agro-industry with
factories of meat packing, cashew nut processing, beer and butter
production and fish canning.
</P>
<P>
The airport will cost 144 million U.S. Dollars, according to
the bid made by Soroti.

NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A consultative meeting on
Lake Victoria's environment management is scheduled to open today
in Kisumu, west Kenya, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local community Participation in the 24.3-million-U.S.-Dollar

two-day meeting to be attended by delegates from the World Bank,
donor countries, governments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, as
well as some non-governmental organizations.

organizer of the meeting, has been advocating the community
participation approach to the environmental issues of Lake
Victoria.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (XINHUA) -- Uganda army raided a
suspected rebel camp, killed one, captured a dozen of them in the
East, "the Monitor" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDE) encircled the camp in a
forest in eastern Iganda district, and launched the operation
earlier last Friday, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government detachmont killed one suspect and wounded other
two in a crossfire, and arrested still another four at the scene,
the report said, adding that the whole area was sealed, and the
government detachment captured six in a following mop up
operation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the detachment also captured a batch of
ammunitions and arms.
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched since authority arrested last
Thursday a suspected spy of Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in
Iganga town. The suspect was said to have revealed the existence
of an estimated 50-men camp in the forest. He later led three
trucks of government troops to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said UPDF was continuing its mop up operation
in the area Saturday and the traffic was blocked in the area.

Earlier unconfirmed reports said LRA had sent its members late
last year to eastern Uganda to recruit young people for training
and to spread rebellion. Scatterred reports from the district of
Iganda said that there were activities of armed gangs from late
last year. But colonel Fred Tolit, the director of military
intelligence, said he did not know any rebellion in Iganda, "you
must differentiate between a rebel, a thug and a bandit" he said

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Liberalization, Double-Edged Sword for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Liberalization of the market
for maize, soybean and fishmeal can be a double-edged sword for
the economy and the Thai government faces a tough decision.
</P>
<P>
Last year, under its commitments to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) the Thai government announced liberalization of
imports of soybean meal and maize, with no import quotas. Maize
can be imported from February 20 to June 30 with no tariff on
condition that the domestic price must not be lower than 4.50 baht
(about 0.18 U.S. dollars) per kilogram. Outside this period the
tariff will be 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
There is no quota for imports of soybean meal but importers
must pay a 10 percent tariff and buy domestic soybeans at a
minimum price of 8.5 baht (0.34 dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of the market, which means free imports without
tariffs or quota, of maize, soybean and fishmeal, will benefit
manufacturers of animal feed and poultry raisers, as the move will
help them lower their production cost and increase their profit
margin.
</P>
<P>
However, local planters and fishmeal producers claim that they
will be hurt by the same move, as they have to reduce their prices
to compete with imported materials.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pros and cons of liberalization, the government has
shown its intention to promote the livestock and poultry
industries as more promising ways of improving the economy than
soybean, maize and fishmeal processing.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, livestock and poultry exports have been
important for the country's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Adul Srithem, president of the Agricultural and Cooperative
Community in Chiang Mai, said the government's commitment to the
WTO was implemented without proper preparation and has hurt
farmers.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the government's price-intervention schemes, saying
they were only short-term fixes. Instead, he said, the government
should invest more in improving farm productivity and reduce
dependence on imports.
</P>
<P>
From the government's point of view, however, the conclusion
can be the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Before deciding which is to be sacrificed, a long-term
consideration on which is to be promoted, is needed.
</P>
<P>
A short while ago, the House Committee on Agriculture was of
the opinion that the country's economy could be driven by
livestock and fisheries, so it recommended that the government
make the livestock sector a long-term priority.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand is less competitive as a soybean producer than
other countries, such as the U.S., Thailand should make long-term
plans to stop producing soybean.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the livestock industry firmly supported the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Animal feed is a significant cost factor in meat production and
the sector's feed consumption could increase 40 percent to 1.4
million tons in five years' time, according to Damrong Chianond,
president of the Thai Feedmeal Producers' Association.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Double Coffee Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Coffee Farmers'
Association (UCFA) has decided to double the country's current
annual coffee production of four million bags (60 kg per bag)
during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to a local daily "the new vision" today, a five-year
plan (1996-2001) released on Saturday said UCFA would also strive
for improving the quality of coffee, the number one foreign
exchange earner in Uganda, apart from increasing its yield.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to boost the production, UCFA will
directly export at least 30 percent of coffee products into some
special markets and an extension service will be established in
all major coffee-growing sub-counties with all their activities
fully financed by the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The association will also develop an efficient and functional
information system and encourage the farmers to use
environment-friendly farming methods such as using proper and
sustainable methods of soil management.

WUHAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
will set up a cooperative medical system and take a number of
other measures over the next 15 years to improve farmers' health,
the provincial governor Jiang zhuping has announced.
</P>
<P>
The province will push the co-op medical system to the rural
areas. Both farmers and the collectives will contribute designated
sums to form the medical fund.
</P>
<P>
All the farmers' medical expenditures for minor ailments will
be paid from the co-op monies, which will also cover most of the
costs for serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the system will be introduced into most of
the rural areas in the province.
</P>
<P>
The medical organizations in urban areas will be required to
aid some of their counterparts in the countryside, and plans
should be made to help the 38 poor counties and train medical care
workers for those areas.
</P>
<P>
Steps should be taken to improve the hygiene standard of the
drinking water, spread the use of clean toilets and eliminate
snail fever, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Large-Scale Chinese Oil And Gas Exploration In Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China is expecting a major
breakthrough in oil and gas exploration in the Bohai Sea this
year, with proven oil and gas reserves forecast at 60 million tons
and 10 billion cu m respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National Offshore
Oil Corp. (CNOOC), the Bohai Oil Company, a subsidiary of CNOOC,
will be able to produce 4.5 million tons of crude oil by the year
2000, and ultimately 8.24 million tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC's experts noted that the Bohai Sea has an effective oil
and gas exploration area of 54,000 sq km, or about the same size
as the Dagang, Shengli, East Hebei, and Liaohe mainland oilfields
combined.
</P>
<P>
To date, the four oilfields have verified oil reserves of six
billion tons, with combined an annual output topping 50 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea area, which has a similar geological structure,
has verified only 500 million tons of oil and developed an annual
output of 2.1 million tons. In addition to the 500 million tons,
it still has three very promising exploration areas.
</P>
<P>
A depression in the central part of the Bohai, which has an
area of 8,660 sq km, is expected to produce 25 billion cu m of oil
and eight trillion cu m of gas in total, and is considered to be
the richest oil and gas bearing area in the Bohai.
</P>
<P>
The experts noted that there is also a gas bearing structure
extending from the western part to the southern part of the sea,
which is expected to have billions of cu m of gas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a total of one billion tons of oil reserves have
been verified in an onshore part of the Liaoxi Depression and an
oilfield with proven oil reserves of 30 million tons as well as a
gasfield have been discovered in the offshore part of the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea area has enough oil reserve to develop an annual
crude output of eight million tons, the experts say.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Agrees to Import American Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has agreed
to import United States wheat which had failed to fulfill its
sanitary requirement, local daily Business Report said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on removing sanitary obstacles to trade was
reached on Monday during the meeting of the Agriculture Committee
of the South Africa-U.S. Bi-National Commission, co-chaired by
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and his American
counterpart Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has banned importing soft Durham wheat from
southwest U.S. for months because it has been infected with bunt,
a disease that could affect the quality of the wheat, though not
harmful to the human body.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, the two sides also agreed to
create mutually acceptable mechanisms for sanitary testing of
other food imports from both countries to overcome non-tariff
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Both Mbeki and Gore hailed the agreements as a "breakthrough"
for liberalizing bilateral trade in agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on sanitary reasons and disagreement on
non-tariff trade have caused obstacles in the trade of products
such as U.S. frozen pork and non-containerized chickens as well
as South African exports such as fresh fruit.

HANOI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set targets to

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Villages shelled by Israeli Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT (Xinhua) -- One civilian was killed and two others were
wounded this morning in a Israeli bombardment at villages in the
central sector of south Lebanon opposite an Israeli-occupied
border strip, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery fired down at a number of villages from
a hilltop position overlooking the south Lebanese area of
Nabatiyeh this morning, within its daily aggressions against this
country, the police sources in the area reported.
</P>
<P>
Several shells hit the village of Habboush at 9:00 a.m.
(07 GMT) killing a 33-year-old woman, Naema Yousef Halal, and
wounding two others, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Damages were also caused to some a dozen of houses in
the village, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the Israeli bombardments, guerrillas of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched attacks at
Israeli positions of Dabbesheh, Soueida and Dhuhra, but no
casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The civilian casualties were made after an international
committee monitoring a limited truce in the border area between
Lebanon and Israel ended a meeting in the south Lebanese
border town of Naqoura without denouncing any sides for
cease-fire breaches.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee comprising representatives of France,
Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States met in
headquarters of the U.N. peace-keeping forces at 11:00 a.m.
(0900 GMT) Monday to discuss complaints filed by Lebanon and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
After ending its meeting around the midnight, the committee
issued a statement urging all combating sides to respect the
terms of a cease-fire understanding Lebanon and Israel reached
in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the complaint lodged to the committee, Beirut wanted
Israel to be held accountable for the wounding of a shepherd
and damages to homes in the Beqaa during a string of Israeli
air attacks last week.
</P>
<P>
Israel lodged a counter claim after its forces discovered
five bombs planted within the occupied zone which they said
put civilians at risk.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation committee accepted as "factual" both claims
but issued no condemnations.
</P>
<P>
"In lights of these events, the monitoring group by unanimity
deemed it necessary to urge once more all combatants to abide
strictly and fully by the provisions of the understanding reached
on April 26, 1996 and exercise restraint and caution in military
operations in the vicinity of civilian populated areas," the
committee statement said.
</P>
<P>
The April understanding, under which the cease-fire monitoring
committee was set up, bars all the parties from targeting
civilians in their military operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the understanding does not impose a ban on
guerrilla attacks on Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon
and gives the Israeli troops a right of "self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Moslem guerrillas and bombardments by
Israeli forces constitute a daily scene on the last active
battlefront of the Arab Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1.100-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel
from crossing-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank Takes Over Forex Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's central bank has
resumed its control over the foreign exchange earnings of the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) which earns
the country 80 percent of its foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The government has, through a statutory instrument signed by
Minister of Finance and Economic Development, Ronald Penza,
ordered ZCCM not to dispose of its foreign exchange earnings but
to surrender it to the central bank, Bank of Zambia (BOZ), local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, BOZ stopped handling foreign currency earnings
from ZCCM after another statutory instrument was issued allowing
ZCCM to offload almost 100 percent of its foreign currency
earnings onto the market.
</P>
<P>
Since then, ZCCM's foreign exchange earnings has been
immediately made available to the market following BOZ's
withdrawal from handling 45 percent of ZCCM's earnings.

<HEADLINE> University Students Work As Part-Time Postmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Teachers and students at a
leading university in northeast China had a hard time in the past
just posting or receiving letters, because the post office was so
far away.
</P>
<P>
Now, all they have to do is take a few steps from their
dormitories to a special letter box, established by a group of
"volunteer campus postmen".
</P>
<P>
"The idea of providing on-campus postal service for students
and teachers came to me in early 1993," recalled Xu Changpo, a
student in the Mechanics and Engineering College of Northeast
University in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the school administration, Xu formed a team
of volunteers consisting of 47 students with outstanding academic
records. "The members of our team must be academically good, so
that they have spare time and energy to serve others," Xu
explained.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers set up letter boxes near dormitories and
teachers' residences, which they check every day, rain or shine,
carrying letters to the post office, and delivering arriving
letters.
</P>
<P>
"Some letters fail to provide a clear address or name, and we
have to go from dorm to dorm to find the recipient," Xu noted.
"Sometimes we climb six to seven floors and knock at dozens of
doors."
</P>
<P>
During holidays and vacations, the volunteers usually ask those
remaining on campus to be substitutes, or even return earlier than
other students. Some have even given up the chance to go home.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, they have helped their schoolmates
and teachers send and receive more than 720,000 letters, without a
single missed letter.
</P>
<P>
"Almost everyone on campus knows us, and we've gotten a lot of
greetings and cards from our fellow students during festivals," Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
One New Year's Day card went like this: "While we are listening
to music or studying English in our warm dormitories, you are
braving the bitter cold of the winter evening and teaching us the
meaning of 'dedication'."

<HEADLINE> Germany To Aid Chinese Lake Ecology Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The German government has
signed an agreement with north China's Hebei Province for 13
million Deutsche marks (about 8.9 million U.S. dollars) to help a
Baiyangdian Lake ecology project.
</P>
<P>
Baiyangdian is known as the "bright pearl of north China", but
has become seriously polluted as more factories are built near it.
</P>
<P>
The project calls for purification of lake water, planting
trees, and several other projects for ecological recovery of the
lake and nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, Baoding City has removed 13 industrial polluters at a
cost of 44 million yuan (about 5.5 million dollars), and a waste
water disposal plant and coal ash waste plant in the lake area
went operational recently.
</P>
<P>
Anxin County, which is next to the lake, has put more than 1.2
million US dollars into rebuilding county roads, and building
better toilet facilities and garbage disposal areas.
</P>
<P>
The county also improved more than 400 diesel engine boats in
an effort to reduce pollution in the lake.
</P>
<P>
In a related move, nine counties near the lake have closed down
1,600 small paper mills, leather processing and dying factories,
and oil refineries, and nearby Renqiu City has closed 26 small
factories.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the amount of industrial waste water discharged into
the lake has been greatly reduced after the closing of those small
factories.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Enter World Telecoms Projects: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian business people can
now enter world Telecoms projects but foreign firms are still
limited to a 35 percent stake in the country's projects, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
L. Parapak, secretary general from the Ministry of Tourism,
Post and Telecommunications said that Indonesian business people
are now able to participate in overseas telecommunication
projects, particularly in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was one of the 68 nations involved in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) talks in Geneva on February 15 on opening up
world telecommunications markets.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia, as a developing country, has insisted on the stance
that basic telecommunications business in Indonesia is open based
on three schemes, the joint operation plans, management contracts
and joint ventures, in which a foreign investor is allowed to buy
or to have a maximum 35 percent share," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the limit was essential because there was a big
difference between developed nations' and developing nations'
telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, as part of the deregulation program to
attract overseas investors, Indonesia will allow foreign investors
to set up wholly-owned businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are seven cellular operators in Indonesia,
three of which are partly foreign owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will not open long distance telecommunications
services and international call services to foreign firms until
2006, he added.
</P>
<P>
The global telecommunications pact will take effect on January
1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The WTO estimates the world telecommunications market is worth
more than 600 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Parapak said telecommunication investment in Indonesia would be
worth 15 billion dollars between 1997 and 2000, while the value of
telecommunications service might reach 4.16 billion dollars a
year.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Using Rare Earth For Farm Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Heilongjiang province
has successfully used rare earth for large-scale wheat, soybean,
and beet growing, with per hectare output increasing 10 percent on
average.
</P>
<P>
The province has added one billion kilograms of grain to its
harvest by using the rare earth compound in recent years, an
increase valued at 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rare earth, the so-called "industrial gourmet powder," is a
kind mixure of trace elements. One U.S. expert calls the
breakthrough in applying rare earth to farm production the most
important development since the discovery of the rare earth
element over 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's top rare earth producer. Agronomists in
Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, and Hubei provinces discovered after years
of research that plants could have 10 percent higher yields when
rare earth was used in treating seeds or sprayed on plant
leaves. The quality of farm produce could also be improved,
agronomists say.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government decided to spread the use of rare earth
farming technology in the 1980s and built a number of rare earth
compound factories in Henan, Shanxi, and Heilongjiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has established a group to spread use of rare
earth compounds in crop growth and has held training classes to
demonstrate the technique.
</P>
<P>
Rare earth has been used for crops in many provinces and cities
by now.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Clashes Reported in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government forces
and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas have continued
their sporadic clashes in the southern Mindanao island, making an
interim regional truce accord a scrap of paper.
</P>
<P>
Captain Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Army's Sixth Infantry,
confirmed today that the latest of a series of skirmishes occurred
on Sunday night after some 100 MILF guerrillas attacked the 39th
infantry battalion at a village in Buldon town in Maguindanao
province.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, government troops fired several rounds of
mortar shells to repel the attackers. No casualties were reported
in the incidents.
</P>
<P>
The renewed clashes prompted the MILF to postpone its peace
talks with the government from February 16 to February 25. The
rebel group also warned to scrap the rescheduled peace talks if
the military continues its offensives against MILF strongholds.
</P>
<P>
In response, Detoyato said the clashes erupted only after MILF
rebels harassed the government forces stationed near the Kabulnan
irrigation project in Agwak town on February 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
"It is (them) who are provoking us. We are just maintaining our
defensive positions," Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fortunato Abat, chief government negotiator in talks
with the MILF, also asked the MILF to refrain from conducting
patrols in the areas concerned to avoid further clashes.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the MILF and the government signed a limited
ceasefire agreement to end a week-long armed conflict in Buldon
town which broke out on January 16 and killed 40 people.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), is now the largest Muslim rebel group still fighting
the government troops. The MNLF signed a peace deal with the
government last September.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- CitiBank has become the first
overseas bank to move its Shanghai branch to the Pudong New Area,
to get involved in yuan-based business.
</P>
<P>
"The relocation is intended to make preparations to open a full
line of services in foreign currencies and RMB," according to the
bank's leading representative in China.
</P>
<P>
Central bank rules require all foreign banks to relocate in the
Pudong New Area before they deal in yuan. Pudong is a new economic
zone across the Huangpu River from the old part of the city.
</P>
<P>
After the relocation, overseas banks will be able to handle
yuan-based loans and accounts, provide guarantees and clearing
services, and deal in Chinese treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
They can keep a branch in Puxi, west Shanghai, or in the
downtown area, to provide foreign-currency services.
</P>
<P>
CitiBank has the biggest business network in China of American
banks, with branches in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, and
representative offices in Guangzhou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
China has approved two groups of eight overseas banks to deal
in yuan on a trial basis. These include CitiBank, the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., the Industrial Bank of Japan, Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, Daiichi Kangyo Bank, Sanwa Bank, and
Standard Chartered. Also included are International Bank of Paris
and Shanghai, a joint-venture between France's Banque Nationale de
Paris and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China's
biggest commercial bank.

Aggression, the Beijing Changan Theater, the Dongdan Gymnasium,
and the Modern Chinese Literature Museum, in line with the
capital's role as the country's cultural center.
</P>
<P>
The city also built more public facilities last year, including

BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's table tennis queen
Deng Yaping, preparing for her title defense at the world
championships in April, was suffering from a waist problem, a
newspaper here reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am worried whether I could maintain my technical form," Deng
was quoted by the China Sports Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper said doctors who examined the world number one last
week said she was suffering from protusion of intervertebral discs
in the waist area, which sometimes causes numbness in her legs.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said numbness caused by the illness is rare for table
tennis players but would deteriorate if not treated immediately.
</P>
<P>
She now has to wear a special belt around her waist to control
the situation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Deng took the women's singles title at last world championships
in Tianjin, China, in 1995 and won the women's singles gold at the
Olympic Games at Atlanta last year.
</P>
<P>
Deng told the paper she has limited the training time to about
three hours a day but planned to increase in March.
</P>
<P>
"I always trained harder than the other players before major
events but this time my physical condition would not allow me to
do that," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who was voted member of the Athletes' Committee of the
International Olympic Committee last week, said she would attend a
committee's meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on April 14-15 but
would bring a trainer with her to keep training.
</P>
<P>
The World Table Tennis Championships will open in Manchester,
Britain, on April 24 and conclude on May 5.

<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Irland's triple Olympic
champion Michelle Smith has missed an out-of-competition doping
test and could be banned if she misses another, the world
governing body of the sport said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The International Swimming Federation (FINA) told the Associate
Press that Smith was absent when the FINA drug testers arrived at
her home in Ireland last October.
</P>
<P>
But FINA said Smith's absence did not mean she had violated any
FINA rules right now.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant doping rules, a swimmer would face a
four-year ban, which is decided by a independent doping panel, if
he or she misses two such doping tests.
</P>
<P>
At the Atlanta Olympic Games, Smith won the 400 meters
freestyle, 200 meters individual medley and 400 meters individual
medley. She also took bronze in the 200 meters butterfly.

<HEADLINE> Children of Parents With Ichthyosis More Likely To Have Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in central China's
Hubei province have found that the offsprings of people suffering
from ichthyosis, run a higher risk of having leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Pediatrics Institute of the No.1 Hospital of
Hubei Medical University discovered the connection with
ichthyosis, a congenital disease referred to as "fishskin disease"
that is characterized by rough, scaly skin, but which does not
harm the sufferer's health or life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The research group was headed by Professor Zhong Weikun, who
began a survey of 46 children with leukemia and their relatives in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of leukemia among family members with
ichthyosis can be as high as six to fifteen per thousand, said
professor Zhong, while the general incidence rate of ichthyosis is
four per thousand and that of leukemia is five per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that it will be a major breakthrough for the
prevention and treatment of leukemia if the discovery can help
scientists find the genes that cause leukemia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
tightening control over pollution while approving new development
projects, according to the Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources here today.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, a new statutory instrument was signed on
Monday by Environment Minister William Harrington.
</P>
<P>
By such a move, the government intends to make it mandatory
for investors and developers to carry out environmental impact
assessment before putting up any structures.
</P>
<P>
Building or clearing on larger areas of land without
assessment or posing a danger to the environment will be stopped
with investors and developers punished, said Harrington.
</P>
<P>
He added that sustainable development demands that all
activities planned and designed should take environment into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
"Through this instrument, the Environmental Council of Zambia
will be further strengthened to ensure compliance. It is
therefore meant to make environment a prime consideration in all
areas of our socio-economic development," Harrington noted.
</P>
<P>
Environmental impact assessments will not only ensure that
developmental projects are environment-friendly but will also
ensure that the investors' long-term interest be sustainable.

URUMQI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- According to recent statistics,
in 1996, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

</P>
<P>
There are 160,000 ha of orchards in the region, which is known
for high-quality fruits due to fine weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
In recent years however, the region's position has been

government carried out several projects to improve the breeding of
fine strains, and increased the planting area.
</P>
<P>
At present, the region is planing to develop 6,600 ha of new
fruit varieties each year and raise fruit output to 150,000 tons

DHAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi cabinet Monday
approved a proposal for setting up the National Stock Exchange

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Chains Reaching to Suburban Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Suburban residents in east
China's biggest metropolis of Shanghai are getting a taste of
urban life with some new supermarkets that are moving into the
city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
One 4,000-square-meter supermarket in Jinyang in the Pudong
area offers numberous types of goods from food and clothing to TV
sets and appliances. It is one of two supermarkets opened in the
area by Nonggongshang Supermarkets, one of Shanghai's biggest
chains, which plans to open 10 more outlets in the suburbs this
year, said Yang Dexin, its general manager.
</P>
<P>
Yang explained that, with the rapid urbanization of the
outskirts, many locals have gone from farmland to factories and
businesses. Rural people, like their urban brethren, began to
develop a taste for supermarkets because of the wide variety of
goods and clean shopping area.
</P>
<P>
"This is a perfect chance for us to extend our business to the
suburbs," Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Other major chains in the city, such as Lianhua and Yaohan,
have started to set up outlets in suburban Shanghai, and local
suppliers and cooperatives, a mainstay of China's rural commerce
and trade, are changing outlets in rural areas into supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that a supermarket network covering both urban and
rural Shanghai is providing an important new production and
marketing link between urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The supermarket business has been mushrooming in Shanghai in
the past couple of years, and there are now about 800 supermarkets
for the city's 13 million people.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Implement New Economic Reform Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania is to speed up its
economic reforms this year with a series of measures including the
privatization of 3,600 state enterprises and the freeing of
prices, Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea announced today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market will be liberalized and all
limits on imports and exports will be cancelled, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prices are expected to go up on average by some 50-100
percent. The government is imposing maximum prices on electricity,
heating, transport, medicines and post and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Romania raised the prices of gasoline and diesel oil on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea leads the new government that won last November's
general election on the promise of more market-oriented reforms.
</P>
<P>
The previous government had been slow to implement reforms such
as closing bankrupt state-run industries and kept the country's
currency artificially high against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Small businesses, the agricultural sector, energy-intensive
industries and privatized enterprises will be the focus of the
reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said 70 loss-making state-run enterprises
are to be reorganized and will have to cut their workforce by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Salaries of state workers are also to be raised by 130 percent
to offset the impact of rampant inflation. The minimum monthly
salary will be increased to 150,000 lev (about 21 U.S. dollars)
from 97,000 lev (about 14 dollars), Ciorbea said.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly salary is now equivalent to about 48
dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to double unemployment benefit and raise child
benefit and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are to
provide some 1 billion U.S. dollars to help the country
implement these measures.

<HEADLINE> Bill Gates Makes Hit at Seattle Science Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Bill Gates, Chairman of
Microsoft Corporation, told an audience of 2000 today of a massive
investment planned for research, and the coming of three
dimensional computer grapics.
</P>
<P>
Gates, speaking on personal computers, drew the largest
audience yet attracted to lectures, seminars and discussions at
the annual meetings of the American Association for Advancement of
Science (AAAS).
</P>
<P>
With his electric notebook showing video graphics on a huge
screen, Gates, one of the pioneers of software for personal
computers and co-founder of Microsoft company, described the
implications for everyone in a world connected by interactive
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
"Every job today involves information," he said, urging
everybody to use electric communications such as E-mail to get it
in the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
At the presentation, Gates displayed the gadgets in his
personal computer including his E-mail which he said received
hundreds of messages every day, and the latest developments of
software.
</P>
<P>
Gates, who astonished the business community by abruptly
reinventing his entire company around the Internet in 1996, told
the audience that virtually everything Microsoft did these days
was focused on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In his updated book, The Road Ahead, Gates said there would be
"no turning back" despite the Internet's irritating
deficiencies. "We can't anticipate all of the technical
breakthroughs that lie ahead," He said. "but interactive
networking is here to stay, and it's just beginning."
</P>
<P>
Gates' goal, which is to make software easier and more
enjoyable for people to use, is central to the success of
Microsoft, founded in 1975 and now one of the world's leading
companies. It has more than 20,000 employees in 46 countries and
revenues of 8.6 billion U.S. dollars for the fiscal year ending
last June.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the current fiscal year, Microsoft planned to
invest two billion dollars on research and innovation. Microsoft
Research was working on making the computer interact on more human
terms through, for instance, speech recognition and understanding
the user's natural spoken language.
</P>
<P>
To create more communicative visual interfaces for tomorrow,
the group was also engaging in many aspects of three-dimensional
graphics, including techniques for rendering highly realistic
scenes at low cost and creating more natural and lifelike
animation, and new ways to capture and represent everyday objects
and outdoor scenes in the computer.
</P>
<P>
Computer, information science and technology were an important
topic at the AAAS meeting, due to close Tuesday.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is reportedly
cooperating with Russia, the United States and Canada in developing its
uranium resources to boost the country's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
A Mongolian-Russian-American joint test production of uranium
with an annual production target of 400 tons of uranium is
underway in Bayankhairhan of the central Dundgovi Province.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia, Russia and the United States are also studying a
resumption of uranium production in the Mardai mine in the eastern
Dornod Province, which used to be mined by the former Soviet union
unilaterally in the 1980s under a secret Mongolian-Soviet pact.
</P>
<P>
Canada joined Mongolia and Russia in an experiment of mining
the Kharaat uranium mine in the eastern Dornogovi Province. With
the experiment results expected to come out this year, the mine
will be put into operation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has an estimated 1.4 million tons of uranium reserves,
about 23 times the annual consumption of uranium in all the
nuclear power stations in the world.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Declares Desire to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's new government today
made clear that it is keen to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), according to a report of the state-run BTA
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"The caretaker cabinet decided to express the country's desire
for full membership in NATO," the report quoted Foreign Minister
Stoyan Stalev as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1989 that any Bulgarian government
has declared the country's desire to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria was the closest to Moscow of any Soviet bloc country
and even after the 1989 drastic changes in Eastern Europe was at
best ambivalent about joining the 16-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly expressed its strong opposition to NATO's
plans for expanding into Eastern Europe since they were officially
announced in January 1994. The alliance wants to take in former
Warsaw Pact member states from central and eastern Europe, but
Russia regards that as a threat to its own security.
</P>
<P>
"With its decision, the government responded to the desire of
the prevailing majority of the Bulgarian citizens," Bulgaria's new
president, Petar Stoyanov, said in a national broadcast statement.
</P>
<P>
The BTA report said that the government had entrusted the
foreign and defense ministers to draft preparations to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The move reflects a policy turn under Stoyanov, an ardent
supporter of his country's accession to NATO and the European
Union.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Keeps Sliding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency baht has
continued to depreciate against the surging US dollar in volatile
trading.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market still doubts the baht's stability
and selling pressure persists.
</P>
<P>
The central bank set the mid-rate for the baht against the
appreciating US dollar at 25.99 baht on Monday, one satang up from
the last trading day last week.
</P>
<P>
Heavy purchasing of dollars pushed trading to its highest point
of the day at 26.12 baht before closing at 26.06 baht.
</P>
<P>
Interbank rate rose to 20-21 percent because of the central
bank's steps to counter speculation and commercial banks' moves to
set aside liquid asset reserves.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign hedge funds have temporarily closed their position
in the Thai market and are watching events, according to dealers.
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence of strong attacks on the baht on Monday
and orders from Singaporean traders were of normal volume, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
Fund managers are waiting until late this month when the
central bank announces key economic indicators for January.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese railway authorities
are predicting a new railroad construction boom, crediting a 4.14
billion US dollars in government investment this year, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that, the funds, up from 3.9 billion US dollars
in 1996, will be spent to lay tracks on 1,269 kilometers of rail
lines, open 1,261 kilometers of new railways and 444 kilometres of
second line rails to traffic, and to build 1,750 kilometres of
electrified railways.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quotes Cai Qinghua, vice-minister of railways as
saying that priority will be given to key projects that are near
completion or are in urgent need of transportation.
</P>
<P>
These include the Nanning-Kunming, Beijing-Kowloon, Nanjiang
(Turpan-Kuerle), Xi'an-Ankang and Hangzhou-Zhuzhou lines as well
as auxiliary projects of the Datong-Qinghuangdao railway, said
Cai. Many of the railway projects are in western China.
</P>
<P>
Cai said 700 million US dollars will be spent on the
Nanning-Kunming Railway, an essential project to facilitate
development of the isolated southwest region.
</P>
<P>
Track-laying on the 900 kilometer electrified line running
through the remote provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, will be complete before March 20. The
entire line will open to traffic in November, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Some 310 million US dollars will be allocated to finish
construction on the Beijing-Kowloon railway, which opened last
year, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
Train services on the transport artery will be sharply
increased when a new national transportation plan takes effect on
April 1, ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary work on the line will be finished by the end of June
to welcome the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1,
Cai said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
initiated a seven-point program to improve the country's tourism
industry in cooperation with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at boosting the tourism industry's
declining growth rate and increasing foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, tourism destination development is top
priority, as many sites in the country have been spoiled by
pollution and weak management. Joint government and private
actions will be taken to protect tourist attractions and improve
their management.
</P>
<P>
Immigration services will also be streamlined and criminal
activities at the county's airports eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to liberalize the airline industry and to
build more international airports in provinces to bring in more
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Actions will be taken to improve shopping services and refunds
on value-added tax for tourists and to crack down on cheating in
jewelry sales.
</P>
<P>
More international conferences and exhibitions will be
promoted, as businessman spend about 50 percent more than the
ordinary tourists.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourism will also be promoted to lower overseas
spending by Thai tourists.
</P>
<P>
More overseas advertising will be made to cope with heavy
competition.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that in 1996 Thailand's tourism industry
earned 200 billion baht (8 billion US dollars) from 7.25 million
foreign arrivals, compared with 191 billion baht (7.64 billion
dollars) from 6.95 million foreign arrivals in 1995.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Price Down, Production Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The average price for OPEC's
basket of seven crudes went down to 20.57 U.S. dollars a barrel
last week, the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat announced today.
</P>
<P>
Last week's average price dropped by 1.5 dollars compared with
the previous week's average price of 22.07 dollars a barrel,
falling below OPEC's reference oil price of 21 dollars a barrel
the first time in recent years.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's monthly average oil price in January was 23.19 dollars a
barrel, 32 cents down from the previous month's average price of
23.51 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The daily output of crude oil production of the 11 member
countries of OPEC reached 26.55 million barrels, rising above the
highest line of 25.03 million barrels set by the organization.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's return to the international oil market under the United
Nation's "oil for food" resolution was the main reason for the
increase in the crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's daily crude oil production reached 3.7 million barrels
in January, of which 1.1 million barrels were exported. It was an
increase of 300,000 barrels compared with last December.

YANGON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is cooperating with the
United States and Sweden in the field of elephant conservation.
</P>
<P>
Official paper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted Minister

Speaking at the opening session of the 7th International
Seminar on Conservation of Asian Elephants here on Monday, Chit
Swe said that Myanmar has been cooperating extensively on
environmental and forestry issues both bilaterally and

extraction and contributing not only to the national economy but
also to the sustentation of natural environment. About 50 per cent
of Myanmar's land area is covered with forest.

QUITO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Acting President
Fabian Alarcon has named two more ministers for his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The two are Minister of Energy and Mines Raul Baca Carbo, and
Secretary for Public Administration Arturo Gangotena.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon was selected by Congress as the country's interim
president early last week after the legislators voted to oust
President Abdala Bucaram on the grounds of "mental incompetence."
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old congress leader will govern the country until
1998 when he is supposed to call new elections.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon appointed Thursday new cabinet ministers for defense,
finance, health and public works, in addition to the minister of
the government and the presidential secretary named earlier.

Government sources said that Jose Ayala Lasso, Ecuador's senior
official at the United Nations on human rights, would probably be
named the new foreign minister.

Diego Ponce and a woman, whose name was yet to be revealed,
would be in charge of the Housing and Urban Development Ministry
and the Environment Ministry respectively.
</P>
<P>
Still to be designated are the ministers of industry and trade,
labor and human resources, information and tourism and social
welfare, for which there are still no nominations, the sources

KIEV, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is about to embark on a new
three-year strategy to boost its cooperation with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The bank hopes the program will improve the efficiency of its
work in Ukraine, an EBRD official told Ukrainian Prime Minister
Pavel Lazarenko here today.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the bank is on a one-week visit to Ukraine to
study the country's domestic situation, including consumer demand,
economic reform and privatization before coming up with a
detailed strategy.
</P>
<P>
Alan Moris, who is leading the delegation said the bank's board
of directors will make sure that neither side will miss out on
opportunities for cooperation this year.
</P>
<P>
But he appeared to indicate that Ukraine should not expect too
much from the EBRD and said that the bank could not provide all
the investment the country needs.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko said he hoped the EBRD would increase its investment
in key sectors of the economy such as energy, urban transport,
infrastructure and aviation.
</P>
<P>
Roman Shpek, Director of the EBRD's bureau in Ukraine, said
after the meeting that the bank is studying 21 projects here with
a view to providing loans.
</P>
<P>
During the next two months, EBRD is expected to give Ukraine
the first batch of loans totaling 277 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Isthmus countries will
maintain their coffee-retention program which coffee growers have
been implementing during the past two years to sustain coffee bean
prices on world markets, representatives of coffee growers
confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants from Ecuador and the six Isthmus countries,
Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and
Colombia, met today in Copan, Honduras to analyze market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The price of coffee beans has been rising rapidly on the New
York Exchange in recent weeks and reached 180 U.S. dollars per
46-kilogram sack last weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, the Costa Rican Coffee Institute (ICAFE) has warned
against exaggerated optimism. Institute president Alonso Lara
affirmed today that "great caution" should be taken by
coffee-growing countries since international market quotations had
been characterized by huge price fluctuations in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
After several days of a sustained rise, coffee bean prices
dropped slightly Friday in face of rumors that Brazil's harvest --
the largest in the world -- could be bigger than expected.
</P>
<P>
Coffee prices have risen precisely because of a drop in
production, especially in Colombia, the second biggest producer in
the world, and because of lower stock levels in the hands of
dealers.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's 80,000 coffee growers are hoping to benefit from
the hike in coffee prices, but production this year will be
affected by last July's floods and several pest infestations.

<HEADLINE> Improved Bus Plan Emphasized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing municipal government
is being urged to focus on improving urban public transport
facilities and stemming the sector's decline, "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Beijing Municipal People's Political
Consultative Conference (BMPPCC) have called for the adoption of a
comprehensive urban transportation development strategy for
different traffic forms, especially buses and subways.
</P>
<P>
At the on-going six-day fifth session of the eighth BMPPCC,
which opened last Saturday, members said that it is necessary to
give priority to developing the public transport sector under the
city's special circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Yang Dazhong, senior engineer with the Beijing Public Transport
Institute, believed that the priority will raise the efficiency of
the road-handling capacity, ease the pressure of investment in
building new roads and alleviate traffic jams and accidents.
</P>
<P>
Yang suggested the municipal government adopt regulations
stipulating that various vehicles should make way for buses on
downtown roads, and vehicles cannot hinder buses near bus stops at
main crowded crossing roads or on the streets.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the municipal government should also collect
public transport taxes form the city's enterprises and institutions
in proportion to the total wages of their employees.
</P>
<P>
The number of automobiles in Beijing is growing at a rate of
14.5 percent annually and roadways increased only at 3.6
percent a year over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Among vehicles on the urban road network, 48 percent are
official or private cars which carry six per cent of the
passengers while five per cent are buses and trolley-busses which
carry 31 percent of the total passengers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the number of automobiles reached one
million, which exhausted the capital city's transportation
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Some members attributed the city's traffic jams to the poor
transport management system and the blind development of private
cars beyond the handling capacity of the road network.

<HEADLINE> Retail Markets Create Jobs For Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty retail markets are
planned in Beijing this year to provide jobs for those laid off
from State-owned enterprises, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper quotes Cao Jie, a Beijing Bureau of
Labour official as saying that, as business people in these
markets are exclusively laid-off workers from State-owned
enterprises, the markets are named "self-support" to show those
people will be able to stand on their own feet.
</P>
<P>
The first such market in Beijing was established last November
in Xicheng District.
</P>
<P>
Business people in the market enjoy preferential policies, Cao
said. Those policies include stall fees that are up to 70 percent
cheaper and reduced administrative fees levied by the municipal
administration for industry and commerce and other departments.
</P>
<P>
These markets will be located mainly in urban areas where there
are a large number of laid-off workers and there are few
commercial establishments, Cao noted.
</P>
<P>
In this way, more laid-off workers will find ways to support
themselves and people around these markets will get conveniences.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will help laid-off workers to run
their own enterprises to create more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
As China adopts modern corporate systems, many employees in
State-owned enterprises have become redundant. In addition, many
enterprises are having difficult, forcing many workers to be
poorly paid or out of work.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the number of laid-off workers in Beijing is expected
to hit 200,000. There also will be 51,000 unemployed people and
175,000 people who are new to the labour market. Therefore, about
400,000 people in Beijing will try to find jobs in 1997, the paper
says.

<HEADLINE> Alert Command Starts Operating in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKAARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta military command
on Monday began operating the national alert command (PKN) which
would be effective throughout the territory, military sources in
the Indonesian capital said today.
</P>
<P>
"Through the command post, people can contribute information to
the authority and related-agencies regarding the truth of rumors,"
Jakarta military chief Maj. Gen. Sutiyoso said.
</P>
<P>
Following recent rioting, President Soeharto has asked for
alert command posts to be set up at regional military commands
aimed at ensuring peace before the May general elections in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The task of the national alert post is to anticipate and early
detect various potential problems which may lead to mass riots and
disruption to the development process, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sutiyoso said people were expected to give contribution to the
post because averting riots which may disrupt process of national
development was the responsibility of all Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
The national alert command involved a number of parties,
including public figures, religious leaders, military, policemen
and the local municipal officers.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has since last July been hit by a series of riots in
Jakarta, east Java, west Java and west Kalimantan during which 12
people were killed and scores injured and hundreds of public
buildings, shops and houses were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
however, government officials have said recently that despite
current riots in the country, political stability and security
were under control.

<HEADLINE> Italian Men Mother-Fixated: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The widely-held belief that
Italian men have a mother-fixation was officially confirmed today
in a survey published by the national statistics office, ISTAT.
</P>
<P>
Both before and after marriage Italian men retain extremely
close ties to their mother and when marriages break down a quarter
of husbands go home to mother, the ISTAT survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Seven out of ten unmarried men over 35 years old still live
with their parents and continue to do so until they die.
</P>
<P>
Among bachelors of all ages, 21 percent stay at home with their
mother and another 21 percent live within one kilometer from home,
ISTAT said.
</P>
<P>
Only a fifth assert their independence to the extent of moving
more than 50 kilometers away from the maternal home.
</P>
<P>
In the case of married couples who do not live with their
parents, 78 percent of husbands see their mothers at least once a
week and a third do so every day -- the figure rising to 39
percent in the south, where more than half of husbands speak to
their mothers on the telephone several times a week.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the telephone was the only indicator in
which women appeared to maintain closer ties with their mothers
than men -- over half of daughters speaking to their mothers daily.
</P>
<P>
After divorce only 17 percent of wives go back home, compared
with 25 percent of husbands. And among the unmarried, only 15
percent of women continue to live at home, while the percentage
for men is 21, the survey shows.

<HEADLINE> World Copper Production will Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The world production of
copper concentrate in the period of 1997-2000 is expected to grow
17 percent to 8.1 million tons, a report issued by the Chilean
Copper Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
Oceania's copper production was expected to increase by 24.8
percent and Asia's by 5.7 percent, but the European and African
outputs were expected to reduce by 7.5 and 2.5 percent
respectively, the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
It said that copper producers in the Americas, where nearly 70
percent of the world's copper comes from, would increase their
output from the current 4.94 million tons per year to 5.76 million
tons in the year of 2000, an implied growth of 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Latin America, representing 67 percent of the regional
production, would remain the most important producer of copper
concentrates in the world, and Chile, which alone provided 2.33
million tons of the continental production, would consolidate its
leadership in the area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chile, with an annual production of 10 million tons of ore,
accounted for 25 percent of the world production, and was the
world's number one ore producer.
</P>
<P>
With the materialization of new projects and expansions of
mines in operation, Chile was expected to increase its annual
copper output to 3.07 million tons in 2000, meaning it would
provide 53 percent of American copper.

<HEADLINE> Buried Rain May Save Arid Plains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China will capture and store
more rainwater to raise more crops and animals in the northern
part of the country, according to a report in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Lack of water to irrigate farm land has plagued the northern
plains of China, while valuable rainwater drains uselessly into
rivers or evaporates, China Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
Underground water reserves have been consumed. The average
annual rainfall in the area is 500-600 millimeters, only 20
percent of which can be stored in dams.
</P>
<P>
Li Lierong, the director of Department of Geological
Environment under the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources,
said the now-empty underground caverns that once held the area's
water reserves are huge.
</P>
<P>
Li said rainwater now lost can be stored in them. The emptied
aquifers beneath the plains can hold 100 billion cubic meters of
water, according to a survey conducted by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Water now pumped out of dams to prevent overflows and flooding,
and which now drains off into rivers to the sea, could be pumped
into the enormous underground spaces, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Storing water underground has worked well abroad, Li noted, and
is also being tested in pilot projects in Beijing and Shandong and
Henan provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Yanzhou, Shandong Province, more than 100 million cubic
meters of water from nearby rivers was pumped into underground
storage spaces, or "underground dams," between 1983 and 1986, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The water was used to help irrigate 16,600 hectares of
farmland, it said.
</P>
<P>
Five million cubic meters of water from the Miyun Reservoir in
Beijing was pumped into underground caverns in 1995 for later use.
</P>
<P>
Li's department will select more pilot districts in the area in
the near future. Scheduled sites include plains crossed by Haihe
and Runhe rivers and others near Taihang Mountains and in Shandong
Province, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Li also said the ministry is studying how to desalinate
water for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
A pilot desalination program in Shulu, Hebei Province, helped
irrigate 10,000 hectares, raising the grain yield by 26.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Li's department also has pilot desalination projects in
Jingxian County, Hebei Province, and Jinghai County in suburban
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Because the desalination projects have made notable progress,
Li said another pilot projects will be introduced in Jiangsu,
Shandong, Henan and Anhui provinces.

<HEADLINE> Second-hand Merchandise Popular in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Buying second-hand goods is
becoming increasingly popular this year although expensive and
fashionable goods still sell well in Beijing's large department
stores, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I came here for shopping because second-hand goods in this
center are priced low and are of rather good quality," said Miao
Yuhe, a worker who will retire in three years.
</P>
<P>
Miao bought six used tables for 150 yuan in the newly opened
Likang Golden Bridge Used Goods Trade Center, two km north of
Asian Games Village.
</P>
<P>
Miao's viewpoint, shared by most consumers of second-hand
goods, explains why farmers in suburban areas account for a large
part of the consumers of used goods.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Chen Jiang, manager of the trade center, said their
customers in the past month were not limited just to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Urban consumers of used goods consist mainly of single people,
elderly people, low-income families and a large population of
migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing Municipal Trust Co. indicate that
60 percent of the company's two-million-yuan sales of used goods
in the first six months of 1996 came from urban consumers.
</P>
<P>
Average sales of Beijing Used Goods Exchange Center in southern
Beijing and its 16 chain thrift shops reach 150,000 yuan (18,072
US dollars) every day.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Hebei Province living around Beijing have come a
long way to buy used goods in his center since it opened on
December 26.
</P>
<P>
The used goods business promotes the sales of new products and
production of new generations of products besides meeting
different consumption demands, said Song Genquan, manager of the
exchange center.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Vows Determination to Join First Euro Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi today reiterated the importance for his country to be one of
the first European Union (EU) members to adopt the planned
European single currency, Euro.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who is on a second visit to Germany within ten days,
held separate talks with leaders of the German state of Bavaria
Edmund Stoiber in Munich and leading businessmen in Frankfurt,
mainly to convince them that Italy could not be left out of the
first Euro wave of states to adopt the single currency.
</P>
<P>
"Europe without Italy is not Europe," Prodi said, referring to
the cultural, economic and military importance of his country.
</P>
<P>
Italy is now the only stable country in the Mediterranean area,
the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch the Euro by January 1, 1999. But
scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met as few
members have been able to fulfill the European Monetary Union
(EMU) criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty due to their sluggish
economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the criteria is that the budget deficit and national
debt of a member country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Prodi indicated Saturday in Rome that Italy was already
reaching three of the five criteria. He also expressed confidence
that his country would fulfill all the five by 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not coming to Germany to challenge the Maastricht
criteria, nor do I want to impose a different position on
somebody," Prodi was quoted by German media as saying in Munich.
</P>
<P>
The Prodi government, which has staked its reputation on
joining the single currency from its planned start-up, has been
jolted by earlier media reports that EU officials planned to delay
Italian EMU membership until the year of 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
Some German bankers also indicated their rejection for an early
Italian membership.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Cooperates with U.S., Sweden in Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is cooperating with the
United States and Sweden in the field of elephant conservation.
</P>
<P>
Official paper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted Minister
for Forestry Chit Swe as saying that in collaboration with the
Smithsonian Institute, the Metro Washington Park Zoo of the U.S.
and the International Foundation for Science of Sweden, a research
center would be set up in Myanmar that would be able to support
its efforts to implement a breeding program for captive elephants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the 7th International
Seminar on Conservation of Asian Elephants here on Monday, Chit
Swe said that Myanmar has been cooperating extensively on
environmental and forestry issues both bilaterally and
multi-laterally, establishing strong ties with many renowned
international non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
He added that Myanmar is committed to abide by the standards
and norms of the Rio Declaration and the Forest Principles since
his country signed the Biodiversity Conservation and Climate
Change Conservation at Rio in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The elephants of Myanmar range over a large expanse of the
country from the sub-temperate regions in the north to the
tropical rain forests in the south, playing a vital role in timber
extraction and contributing not only to the national economy but
also to the sustentation of natural environment. Myanmar has a
forest cover of about 50 per cent and most of it is natural.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, co-sponsored by the Myanmar Ministry of
Forestry and the Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AESG), was
attended by experts from 12 countries including Germany,
Singapore, the Netherlands, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, the
United Kingdom, the United States, Indonesia, India and
Switzerland.

<P>
Ellawala was killed last Tuesday at Kuruwita Town during
political clashes between the ruling People's Alliance (PA) and

</P>
<P>
She charged that the main opposition United National Party
(UNP) leadership was well aware of the criminal tendencies of some
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Because the UNP was aware that the Peoples Alliance would win
the forthcoming local government elections, they were now
resorting to violence.

could be reduced by raising revenues, cutting government debt and
other forms of economic adjustment, Finance Minister Carlos
Davalos Rodas said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador has the lowest tax rate in Latin America and this
situation had to change, he said. The government also needed to
improve tax collection, especially from taxpayers who were able to
pay up.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was talking to other sectors of the
economy in a bid to reach consensus on how to resolve the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The new government was formed after Fabian Alarcon was sworn in
as acting president on February 11.
</P>
<P>
He replaced President Abdala Bucaram, who was ousted by
Congress on the grounds of "mental incompetence" on February 7
following widespread protests against the austerity measures he
authorized to solve the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon, who will act as president until August 1998, has said
that his government will focus on stabilizing the economy,
reforming the political system and restoring the country's
international credibility.
</P>
<P>
The government was preparing a "large-scale reactivation" of
the economy to correct the budget deficit, to fight inflation,
unemployment, high interest rates and to reactivate the country's
productive capabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon's government has terminated Bucaram's unpopular
austerity measures including steep hikes in the cost of public
services.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A jade burial suit for a
prince from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), regarded as
the best ever found, is on display in this capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The suit, made of some 4,000 square pieces of jade, is just one
of more than 1,000 exhibits on show in the city museum to
represent major archaeological finds in the province since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Five local archaeological projects were listed among China's
Top Ten Archaeological Finds, an annual award set up in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The five include the Zhaolingshan site -- a neolithic tomb
group in Kunshan, the city famous for its "clay pyramid"; the
Longqiuzhuang site in the city of Gaoyou, where fossilized rice
serves to explain the history of rice-growing some 5,500-7,000
years ago; the ruins of a Tang (618-907) city in Yangzhou; a cave
in Tangshan from which a human skull and teeth dating back some
500,000 years were found; and the tomb of a prince of the Western
Han Dynasty in Xuzhou, where experts have unearthed a great number
of bronze, iron, gold, silver and jade ware -- including the jade
burial suit.

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Mafia Children Be Separated From Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An Italian mayor proposed today
that the children of known mafia criminals should be forcibly
removed from their parents and educated elsewhere to prevent them
from becoming criminals too.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Pippo Cipriani, the left-wing mayor of
Corleone, a Sicilian hill town forever linked with the mafia
thanks to the Marlon Brando film, the Godfather.
</P>
<P>
This came one day after a 21-year-old son of a jailed mafia
boss Toto Riina was sentenced to four years in prison for mafia
activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that mafia children should be "bombarded with messages
and values which offer an alternative and counter their
traditional values."
</P>
<P>
"We must break this system of transmission of values," he said,
"The adults must pay for their crimes they commit, but we can save
the innocent in time."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that special institutes be set up, funded out of
the money confiscated from mafia criminals, to look after the
mafia children.
</P>
<P>
However, Cipriani's proposal immediately drew criticism from
several mafia experts.
</P>
<P>
Caltanisetta deputy public prosecutor Paolo Giordano labelled
it as an ideal, saying "an imposed education, even from the best
motives, could bring in negative reactions".
</P>
<P>
Piergiorgio Ferreri, secretary of the Association of Children's
Court Judges, held it would make the problem worse rather than
solve it, asking, "Where are we going to put thousands of children
-- in a ghetto?"

MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Anti-drugs representatives from
30 countries and 15 international organizations gathered in Baku,
Azerbaijian, today for a U.N. meeting to strengthen drug fighting
in the Middle East, Central Asia and Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijian's President Geidar Aliyev told the opening session
that his country is becoming more attractive to drug traffickers
due to its geographical location and the loosening of borders in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said the country has had some success in combating the
production of drugs, but more preventive measures are needed to
stop traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Reports, from the meeting of the U.N. subcommission for
combating illegal drugs in the Near and Middle East, said that up
to 60 percent of the 30 tons of heroin seized and destroyed by law
enforcement agencies between 1994 and 1995 were caught in the
Middle East, Central Asia and Caucasus regions.

MEXICO CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Latin America's external

last year, said a report published today by the U.N. Economic

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Tajik rebels headed by Bakhram
Sadirov today released all remaining six hostages, ending a
two-week crisis which saw 16 people taken captive by the group.
</P>
<P>
The six hostages, including U.N. military observers and refugee
workers and Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zhukhurov, were freed
after Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov personally ventured into
the mountains to negotiate for their release.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader later apologized on Russian independent NTV
television for the hostage taking, but said he had no other option
to secure the return of 40 of his men from bases in neighboring
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The crisis started on February 4 when the rebels seized 16
hostages over two days, including Russian journalists,
U.N. workers and the Tajik security minister.
</P>
<P>
Sadirov had demanded that the government pick up and deliver 40
of his fighters from bases in Afghanistan. On Sunday, the
government handed over 33 men. Sadirov then released five of the
remaining 11 hostages in return for direct talks with the
president.
</P>
<P>
The last six hostages were then released Monday evening. They
were the Tajik security minister, U.N. military observers from
Switzerland and Ukraine, and U.N. refugee workers from Nigeria,
Russia and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the rebels have taken hostages. In
December, they took 23 people, including U.N. workers, who were
all released unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Latin America's External Debt on Rise in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Latin America's external
debt amounted to 607 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, or a 3.4
percent rise over the previous year's 586 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. report, this is the lowest growth rate
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The report, released here today by the U.N. Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), said that the lower
values of European currencies and Japanese yen versus the dollar
in 1996 contributed greatly to the low growth rate.
</P>
<P>
While Venezuela, Peru and Chile maintained their debt levels of
1995 of 36, 32 and 22 billion dollars respectively, Mexico was
able to reduce its external liabilities by 1.1 billion dollars to
160 billion dollars, thus saving an interest payment of some 100
million dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Brazil and Colombia recorded the biggest increase in
their foreign debts. Argentina's debt jumped to 96 billion dollars
due to government bonds and securities issued to finance its
fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
Increase in Brazil's private sector debts taken on to modernize
its industrial plants led to a 10 percent hike in the country's
total foreign debt. Brazil now is the biggest debtor in Latin
America, with 175 billion dollars of foreign liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Next to Brazil was Mexico with 160 billion dollars. The total
sum of the two countries' foreign debt reached 335 billion
dollars, accounting for 55 percent of the total debt of the
region.

<HEADLINE> China Reforms Test System in Primary Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- At least four Chinese
provinces and cities have abolished an old test system in primary
schools in a bid to ease students' pressure.
</P>
<P>
So far, schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Liaoning
province have abandonded the 100-mark exam standard, a scoring
system ranging from zero to 100 (full mark).
</P>
<P>
The system has been criticized because it encourages parents
and teachers pay more attention to scores than to whether a
student is actually learning anything, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the four cities and province have began to use four
grades of "excellent, good, pass or fail" to define students' exam
results.
</P>
<P>
Students may feel less pressure as such evaluations are more
flexible, the paper explained.

LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major beat off Labor's attempt tonight to oust its agriculture
minister and paved the way for a full-blooded no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
It secured a 13-vote win in a crunch Commons vote after all
nine unionists abstained.
</P>
<P>
The censure motion against Douglas Hogg was defeated by 320 to
307. The result means the prime minister can still hope for now to
soldier on until his preferred general election date, May 1.
</P>
<P>
Even before the vote, Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis told BBC,
"I think the opposition has got its timing wrong, it's got its
objectives wrong, and it has got its relationship with other
parties wrong, and that is not a good sign for the future."
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown also accused Labor
leaders of having botched it by failing to consult other parties
before making the censure vote public.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today condemned the Israeli decision to build new
settlements and confiscate Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who made a brief stop here this evening before leaving
for Moscow, made the remarks at a press conference after meeting
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at the Presidential
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Israel of foot-dragging in implementing the Hebron deal
which was signed last month, Arafat said that the Israeli
violation concerning Jerusalem has been more frequent recently.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision to set up a new settlement in Abu Ghoneim
hill in east Jerusalem has sparked Palestinian outrage.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel has confiscated several thousands of square
kilometers of land from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is not only a Palestinian city, it is also an Arab,
Islamic and Christian one," he said, adding that another Arab
summit or Islamic summit is possible in case that Israeli
continues procrastination on peace negotiations on the city which
he wants to have as the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mubarak and Arafat covers the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process, particularly the
Palestinian-Israeli track following the implementation of the
Palestinian-Israeli protocol on Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank town of Hebron, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement signed last month, the Israelis and
Palestinians will begin talks on a final peace agreement within
two months. They will negotiate their final borders and the future
of Jerusalem and of the 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will break into nine groups
from today to deal with pending issues in the Hebron protocol and
the interim agreement as a result of Sunday's peace talks between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, the first since the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that the coming steps toward settling the
Palestinian issue depend on how the joint committees will work.

<HEADLINE> Virginian House Approves Retirement of State Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Virginia's House
of Delegates today voted 100-0 to retire 57-year-old state song
"Carry Me Back to Old Virginia," which critics say glorifies
slavery, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
The song was written in 1875 by James A. Bland, a black
minstrel from Flushing, N.Y., and adopted by the General Assembly
as the official state song in 1940. It was written from the
viewpoint of a freed slave who loves Virginia. But the song was
with such words like "darkey."
</P>
<P>
In 1970, then-state Sen. L. Douglas Wilder, a grandson of
slaves who became the nation's first elected black governor, made
the first appeal attempt and "similar legislation became an annual
fixture, rejected every year by lawmakers who said the song was an
important part of Virginia's heritage," the report said.
</P>
<P>
But critics argued that the song was so offensive that it was
no longer taught to school-children and hasn't been performed at
an official state function in two decades.
</P>
<P>
A bill on the matter was approved by the state Senate on
January 28 and it now goes back to the Senate for action on a
House amendment that eliminated a provision calling for a special
commission to find a new state song.
</P>
<P>
However, some suggest keeping the song, but changing the
offending words, considering Bland was the nation's only black
composer of a state song.

MAPUTO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano reiterated here today the southern African country has
decided to suspend its membership of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Mozambique will withdraw from COMESA until the organization
makes clear its relationship with the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC), Chissano said in a statement issued by the
Presidency.
</P>
<P>
Chissano will not attend the annual COMESA summit in Zambia in
April and his country will not approve the accord on the
establishment of COMESA, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Chissano met earlier today with three COMESA representatives
-- Kenyan Planning and Development Minister R.O. Oyondi, Zambian
Trade and Industry Minister Afeyo Manbayi and Malawian trade
and Industry Minister Chakakala Chaziya.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers were dispatched by COMESA Chairman and
Malawian President Bakill Muluzi to deliver a letter to Chissano
to invite him to attend the forthcoming COMESA summit.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and
Southern Africa (PTA) signed in 1993 a treaty transforming the
PTA into the COMESA, which was to come into effect on being
ratified by 10 countries including Mozambique. enditem

<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian named Emad
Abdel-Hamid Ismail, standing trial on charges of spying for
Israel, has admitted being recruited by the Israeli secret
service, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted General Prosecutor Ragaa el-Araby as saying that
Ismail, 24, has confessed that he met Azam Meteb Azam, an Israeli
of Arab origin, when he was sent by his company to Israel
for training at a women's wear factory.
</P>
<P>
Azam, who was working as a maintenance technician in the
factory, is also facing trial on charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial today at the Emergency Supreme State Security
Court, Ismail said Azam introduced him to two Israeli women, Mona
Shawahna and Zohra Youssef.
</P>
<P>
Later, when one of the Israeli women asked him to work for the
Israeli intelligence for 1,000 U.S. dollars per month, he agreed.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said the two Israeli women will be tried in
absentia for recruiting the Egyptian. No date for the trial has
yet been set.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel but
ties have been cool. Israel has said Azam is innocent.
</P>
<P>
Azam and Ismail, arrested last November, could face up to
death penalty if convicted.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Offers Opportunity for Talks in Cyprus: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A face-to-face talks between
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash can be held this year, U.N. envoy in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. Secretariat will discuss ways to
arrange the talks in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Feissel made the remarks at the Larnaca Airport shortly before
his departure for New York, where he will meet with U.N. officials
to review the situation in Cyprus and discuss "how to proceed
with the objective to bring the two leaders together this year."
</P>
<P>
Feissel, U.N. resident representative on the island, said
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan "is making a major effort to
bring the two leaders together in 1997 and, in fact, in the
first half of the year."
</P>
<P>
He said that the opportunity 1997 offers is also recognized by
other countries, adding that the U.S., Britain and Russia are
actively involved in supporting Annan's effort.
</P>
<P>
Feissel noted that "we had a lot of tension here since last
summer, which underlines the fact that the current situation is
not something that you want to maintain, because it can always
create a problem."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the violence occurred since last summer,
in which three Greek Cypriots were shot dead and a Turkish
solider was murdered. The tension has also escalated on the
island since last month following the Cypriot government's
decision to buy Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said when President Clerides and Denktash come
to direct talks they should talk about all the issues,
including security, which he described as "a key aspect" for
both Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup supported by Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian parliament,
the House of People's Representatives, discussed a draft bill on
the establishment of a road fund today, the Ethiopian News Agency
has reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the road fund will be collected from budget,
fuel levy, annual vehicle licence renewal fee based on axle load,
overloading fines and other road tariffs and used to timely
finance the road maintenance and road safety measures.
</P>
<P>
The bill demands the Ethiopian government allot 30 percent of
its capital budget to the development, maintenance and
rehabilitation of roads.
</P>
<P>
It means the government should spend 600 million Birr (about 92
million U.S. Dollars) per annum in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian road authority said there are some 17,769
kilometers of roads in the country under its administration while
8,043 kilometers of roads under regional control and 3,000
kilometers managed at municipality-level. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cameroun's Government Vows to Support Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Camerounian Prime Minister
Peter Mafany Musonge said today that insurance companies can
count on the government of Cameroun for assistance and support.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the government's determination to ensure the
adoption of new insurance rules in line with the Yaounde Treaty
when opening the 21th general assembly meeting of the Federation
of African National Insurance Companies (FANAF).
</P>
<P>
The Camerounian government will review the tax system
governing insurance companies and pay its debts to insurance
companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will protect the state-owned insurance firms
when making efforts to liberalize the national economy, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The insurance sector in the country has improved considerably
after experiencing some difficulties in 1993 due to general
recession and its restructuring is now on course and has yielded
some positive results, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for more professionalism and solidarity among
African insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
About 300 experts from 20 African and European countries are

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Confirms Proposal on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
confirmed that it has discussed with British officials the
British-back proposal to deploy a multinational force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of deploying a multinational force has been
discussed in depth twice with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind and Britain's representative for Cyprus, Sir David
Hannay," government spokesman Yiannakis cassoulides told
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that at this stage, "we are not
aware of a comprehensive plan concerning this idea."
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a multinational force in Cyprus appeared in
Sunday's edition of the British paper The Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Britain would participate with a 600-troop
contingent in the 5,000-strong multinational peace-keeping force
to Cyprus under a plan to reunite the island.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the make-up of the force, Cassoulides said this
must be under a mandate from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Cypriot government "is ready to accept
participation of Greek and Turkish contingents in the force to
facilitate the decision to set up the force."
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted the commander of such a force should not
come from either the Greek or Turkish contingent but should
be a person from a third country.
</P>
<P>
He said as far as he knows the U.S. would favor Russian
participation in the force.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community are intensifying their
efforts to try to reach a Cyprus settlement within the year of
1997.

<HEADLINE> Liberians Want African Peace-Keepers to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Many Liberians wish the west
African peacekeepers stay longer in Liberia, a report reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope there will be request to allow ECOMOG (the
peacekeeping forces) to stay far longer than six months because
the new national army and police must be trained to become
neutural," said former Police Commissioner Brownie Samukai.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day meeting in Monrovia, the foreign ministers of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) decided on
Friday that the peace-keepers will start pulling out of the
west African country six months after the general elections
scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a new conference, Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi said: "There will be a new armed force and a new police force to
carry out the duty of security and defence of the territorial
integrity of this country (Liberia)."
</P>
<P>
However, Liberians feel doubtful that their faction-ridden country
can produce a neutral army or police in six months and are pressing the
interim government to seek an extended mandate of the ECOMOG, which
has been in Liberia for seven years since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see ECOMOG here another year after a successful
election," said university lecturer Jeff Jallah. "It will take time
for these new soldiers and policemen to understand their own role and
duties."
</P>
<P>
Former guerrilla leader, Charles Taylor, who started a civil
war in 1989, has also come out in support of a longer stay for ECOMOG,
a force he previously denounced as an occupation army, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Purchase 12 Rooivalk Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African Air
Force (SAAF) is considering buying 12 Rooivalk combat helicopters
from Denel, a leading arms manufacturer in the country, said a
source here today.
</P>
<P>
The first Rooivalk plane equipped with Mokopa anti-tank
missiles was expected to be delivered to the SAAF next year, said
the source.
</P>
<P>
Defence Minister Joe Modise said it is important for SAAF to
possess the best possible equipment to fulfill its diverse duties
in the maintenance of peace and the transport of humanitarian
aid.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the Rooivalk by the SAAF could also create more
jobs, he said
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a public showing of the latest model of the
combat helicopters here, Denel Managing Director Johan Alberts said
the deal could generate 6,000 jobs for the country.
</P>
<P>
Denel is currently undertaking marketing exercises in the Far
East, the Middle East and Malaysia which has already expressed
particular interests in ordering the Rooivalk.
</P>
<P>
Denel Chairman Dave Brink said the Rooivalk, cheaper than the
U.S. Apache helicopter, represents the leading edge technology
for which South Africa holds the design authority. enditem

CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who arrived today, held
talks his evening at the Presidential headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
The talks cover the latest developments of the Mideast peace
process, particularly the Palestinian-Israeli track following the
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli protocol on Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron, the Egyptian
MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement signed last month, the Israelis and
Palestinians will begin talks on a final peace agreement within

of Jerusalem and of the 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will break into nine groups
from today to deal with pending issues in the Hebron protocol and
the interim agreement as a result of Sunday's peace talks between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, the first since the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that the coming steps toward settling the
Palestinian issue depend on how the joint committees will work.

<HEADLINE> S.African Jailed in Iran Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A 27-year-old South
African has been freed and is soon to return home after being
jailed in a prison in Iran's capital Teheran for almost five
weeks, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Department of the Foreign Affairs Marco Boni
said in Pretoria that the released, identified as Stuart Timm of
Johannesburg, now is staying at the home of South African
Ambassador to Iran Moosa Moolla in Teheran.
</P>
<P>
Timm had been held without charges since January 12 when he
was arrested with a Swiss companion during a tour to Iran to buy
leather. He then was working on a social program in neighboring
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has since then made several attempts through
diplomatic channels to get Timm released, but in vain.
</P>
<P>
A strong protest was lodged to the Iranian authorities about
two weeks ago and Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo also urged Teheran
to either charge or release Timm.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to South Africa Mohammed Mahdavi last week
reportedly returned to Teheran to expedite Timm's release.
</P>
<P>
Boni said Nzo was informed on Sunday by his Iranian counterpart Ali
Ahkbar Velayati that Timm would be released today.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased that the matter has been resolved," said
Boni. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chirac Meets Albright on NATO, Franco-US Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today talked with visiting United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on a series of international issues, notably
NATO reform and Franco-American relations.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Albright that France did not "ask for" its return
to the NATO integrated military command structure, and that it
would consider this only if the reform of the military alliance
brought about "the emergence of a real European identity of
defense."
</P>
<P>
France has asked the United States to hand over NATO's
Naples-based South Command to a European officer, a request which
has been repeatedly rejected by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that whatever the result could be of France's
attempt to bring about NATO's Europeanization, France does not
regard the issue as a bilateral difference with the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would take a definitive position on the outcome
of negotiations with the United States over NATO reform before the
NATO Madrid summit in July.
</P>
<P>
France will most probably maintain its simple membership of
NATO while staying out of its integrated military command
structure if the United States refuses to hand over the South
Command.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed her hope that her visit to France would mark
"a new page" in Franco-U.S. relations in reference to the tension
between Paris and Washington which mounted at the end of the term
of former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good start for the second administration (of U.S.
President Bill Clinton)," she said as quoted by French
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's eastward expansion, Chirac and Albright agreed that
it is "important to maintain stability in Europe."
</P>
<P>
They also agreed upon the need to reach an agreement with
Russia on relations between NATO and Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Draft Defence Policy for Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's national defence policy
for the forthcoming 21th century is expected to be drafted out
in May as a committee has been launched to take the job.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 15-member committee here today, the chief of
defence staff, Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar, said the new
defence policy should reflect Nigeria's posture home and abroad
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
He urged the committee, led by Air Vice-Marshal Al-Amin
Daggash from Nigerian Defence Academy, to evolve a vibrant and
self-reliant defence policy to meet the realization of
the nation's aspiration of a politically stable and united and
economically just country.
</P>
<P>
The committee, whose members come from the military, police,
security agencies and academics, is expected to submit its
report to the chief of defence staff by the first week of May
this year.
</P>
<P>
The dynamic foreign policy, fertile land mass, abundant human,
material and mineral resources of Nigeria have continued to make
the west African country a target of attack, envy, sabotage
and indirect military threat by some foreign powers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria must not lose sight of various border encroachments
and other criminal activities by "some of the countries
contiguous to our nation", he said.
</P>
<P>
The general charged Cameroun of the so-called "expansionist
tendencies" on Nigeria's eastern flank, saying Nigeria must take
it into consideration when designing national defence policies.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have clashed repeatedly since 1994 over
the ownership of the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula. The dispute is
pending before the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
"More important to bear in mind is the current efforts by
superpowers to undermine Nigeria's influence in the sub-region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The "negative tendencies must not be allowed to detract us and
jeopardize our efforts at achieving an enduring collective
security arrangement in our sub-region and Africa as an entity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our national defence policy must be sensitive to
developments, whether external or internal, and it must retain
sufficient flexibility and a threshold below which a nation's
military preparedness must not fall irrespective of internal or
external changes," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Reserves Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official said
today that the Iraqi oil reserves has been enhanced over the
past six years, according to the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
Fa'iz Abdullah Shahin, undersecretary of the Iraqi Oil Ministry
made the announcement in a preliminary study quote by the INA.
</P>
<P>
He said that oil exploration teams of the Oil Ministry have
been able to increase the state's oil reserves by exploring new
oil fields in the west of the country.
</P>
<P>
Shahin indicated that huge quantities of unexplored oil can be
added to the state's oil reserves which stands at 112 billion
barrels. But the official did not disclose the amount of the
newly-found reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said great progress has been made on negotiations between
his country and foreign oil companies to develop a number of Iraqi
oil wells and to increase oil production capacity to 6 million
barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Iraq is seeking to increase its export capacity from 2.5
million bpd to 6 million bpd within six or seven years. Oil
companies from Russia, France and other countries have expressed
readiness to cooperate in this respect once the U.N.-imposed
sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iraq since 1991
after the end of the Gulf War to drive out the Iraqi troops from
Kuwait following its 1990 occupation of the oil-rich emirate.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been allowed by the U.N. to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food and other
necessities to alleviate the sufferings of its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil export shrank from 3.2 million bpd before the 1991
Gulf War to the current 2.5 million bpd because of the more than
six years' U.N.embargo.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes Possible Israeli Withdrawal from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz said here today that Lebanon welcomes an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, the Lebanese National News Agency
(LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Israeli proposal on deploying French
forces in south Lebanon after its withdrawal is aimed at
"prettifying the image" of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and "burning out the French role" in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied south Lebanon in the late 1970s and set up the
self-proclaimed "security zone" in 1985 to curb the cross-border
attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone has since then become
the last active battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz returned home Sunday from a one-week visit to France,
where he had a meeting with his French counterpart Herve de
Charette.
</P>
<P>
Paris has held back its support for a so-called "Lebanon
first" proposal raised by Netanyahu to separate the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks of the Mideast peace process, and has categorically
denied an Israeli report that France agreed to send troops to
replace the Israeli forces to act as a buffer between Lebanon and
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foregin minister was quoted by the state-run
LNNA as saying that after the election of Netanyahu and
"negative impacts of the Israeli government's positions" on the
public opinion of the country and the world over, the Israeli
government thought it should do something to "beautify its image
and the image of Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that if Israel wants to withdraw, Lebanon will
welcome and "it is the obligation and duty of the
Lebanese state to prevail its authority, its forces and its
sovereignty on its land."
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 is not negotiable
and there is no room for understanding or deals with Israel (on
the withdrawal)," the foreign minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 calls for an unconditional withdrawal of
Israeli forces from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There have been debates recently in the Israeli cabinet on
whether the Jewish state should pull out its troops from south
Lebanon after two Israeli army helicopters heading toward south
Lebanon crashed over northern Israel. Seventy-three soldiers and
airmen were killed in the tragedy.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The one-day Third
Plenary Session of the South Africa-U.S. Bi-National Commission
ended in Cape Town today, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was mainly focused on reviewing progress made by
the commission's six sub-committees since the last session in
Washington last July, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The commission, co-chaired by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and
his U.S. counterpart Al Gore, was established in 1995 and meets
every six months by turn in both countries.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the meeting, Mbeki and Gore
presented the united front despite their rows about South
Africa's proposed arms deal with Syria, a country the U.S. has
listed as a "state sponsor of terrorism".
</P>
<P>
They stressed that occasional disagreements on foreign
policies between the two countries would not damage their
mutually beneficial relationship.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa-Syria arms deal was left off the commission's
original agenda but was discussed in private talks between Mbeki
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
On this regard, Gore said certain issues were best discussed
in private and Mbeki said Gore would be consulted with before
South Africa makes a final decision on whether to go ahead with
the arms sale.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed issues such as the Great Lakes
crisis and bilateral cooperation of law enforcement against the
drug and crime, a common threat to both the United States and
South Africa. enditem
