BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed his appreciation for the great efforts made by people of
insight from all walks of life in the United States, including
those in the Democratic and Republican parties, especially
President Bill Clinton, to realize Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) with China.

"I believe that an early settlement of the PNTR status for
China will serve to promote Sino-US economic and trade relations
and bilateral ties as a whole, is in the fundamental interests of
both countries, and is the common aspiration of the people of the
two countries," Jiang said.

<P>
SAN JOSE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana rejected foreign intervention at a press conference here
Monday at the end of a meeting with his Costa Rican counterpart,
Miguel Angel Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
"While I'm Colombia's president, there'll be no foreign
intervention in this country," the Colombian president said.
</P>
<P>
These statements were made here at the end of a talk between
the two presidents within the framework of a 24-hour visit that
Colombia's leader is making to Costa Rica, accompanied by Foreign
Minister Guillermo Fernandes de Soto.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana explained he has never thought and will
never think about a possible invitation of "Blue Helmet" forces to
reach peace in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's government will persist in peace negotiations to
solve internal problems and reject foreign intervention in his
country's internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana reiterated the option of looking for a solution to the
armed conflict lived in his country through negotiations with the
rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and National
Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
On his part, Costa Rica's president reiterated his country's "

<P>
QUITO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Attorney-General Mariana
Yepez resisted Monday accusations made against her by America's
embassy in Ecuador and accused the U.S. government of having
violated Ecuador's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The rejected declarations written in a letter by Larry Palmer,
trade representative of the American embassy in Quito, show they
commit outrage against this country's national sovereignty and
Ecuadorian institutions. These statements are unfounded and lack
any proof at all, she said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the U.S. embassy in Ecuador sent a letter to
Ecuador's Attorney-General Mariana Yepez, announcing suspension of
cooperation and economic help to this Ecuadorian dependency.
</P>
<P>
The letter accused the attorney of obstructing justice's action
and protecting suspected corrupters under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The attorney denounced Larry Palmer for putting pressure on
Ecuador's Attorney-Gerenal's Office that verdict be made in favor
of an American citizen involved in an operation carried out by
Ecuadorian police.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the fact that the American embassy's
intervention in Ecuador's internal affairs must be rejected
because it violates Ecuador's sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves on European Trip, Hard to Sell NMD Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton's first stop will be Lisbon, where he will meet
European Union leaders over the European security and trade
disputes between the United States and EU.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is developing a stronger defense identity within NATO,
and the president is about to attend 14th U.S.-EU summit, which is
certainly a record," said Clinton's National Security Advisor
Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has supported a stronger Europe "as a complement to,
and not a competitor of, a stronger transatlantic alliance,"
Berger added at a background briefing on Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Portuguese leaders will discuss European security
issues, Southeast Europe,cooperation on East Timor, and a number
of African countries.
</P>
<P>
After Lisbon, Clinton will travel to Germany, where he is
expected to talk with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder about
the U.S. plan to deploy a national missile defense system. The
German leader would voice concerns among the European countries
that the plan could undermine the existing arms control regime.
</P>
<P>
NMD is also a tough issue during Clinton's visit to Russia.
The Clinton administration is trying to persuade Moscow to agree
to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) signed in 1972
in order to clear the way for its NMD project.
</P>
<P>
Russia, strongly opposing the U.S. NMD project, has rejected
any changes to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin are also expected
to discuss the third round of strategic arms reduction or the
START III.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. administration has noted that it did not
expect any resolution of arms control issues during the summit,
which is the first between Clinton and the Russian new president.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the president will have had an
opportunity to discuss it with President Putin. He will describe
for President Putin what we see as a new threat," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect these issues will be resolved at this summit. I
expect that there will be a good opportunity for us to explain our
view of the problem and for President Putin to express his view of
the problem," he added.

<HEADLINE> Italy Backs NATO's Open Door Policy For Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
Monday reiterated Italy's support for bringing Romania into NATO
at a meeting here with Romanian Foreign Minister Petre Roman, a
communique issued by the Italian Foreign Ministry reported.
</P>
<P>
Italy feels that a process for a "geographically balanced"
expansion of NATO is fully valid and, in this connection, Dini
confirmed for Roman an "open door" policy for future candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister was reported to have spoken of a process
which must be considered as "a dynamic exercise, not concluded
with the decision on the first candidates."
</P>
<P>
Roman, the communique said, affirmed that his country lends
foreign policy priority to membership in Euro-Atlantic
institutions and hopes to be brought into the enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Italian support for this aspiration, Dini cited the
role of greater importance Romania is certain to play in southeast
Europe and had words of praise for Bucharest's progress in
relation to joining the European Union, also backed by Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped to see further consolidation of progress in
deregulating the Romanian economy and stabilizing legislation
which will favor the arrival of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
On the visiting minister's request, Dini briefed him on
institutional reform under way in the EU and discussed the matter
of building a common European defense system.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident Romania would, to the benefit of the
entire region, successfully come to terms with the country's
international commitments.
</P>
<P>
Romania now holds the presidency of the Conference of Black Sea
States and will next year take on the presidency of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and co-
chair the table for work on democratization for the Stability Pace
in the second half of the current year.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy also appreciates Romania's contribution to
regional initiatives under the INCE and SECI umbrellas and
Bucharest's participation in the Conference for the Development
and Security in the Adriatic and the Ionian, held in the northern
Adriatic port of Ancona on May 19 and 20.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Dini and Roman recalled the strategic
partnership launched in 1997 with the joint declarations of the
two nations' foreign ministers and progress in consolidating
political and economic relations since this date.
</P>
<P>
Italy, it was recalled, is Romania's leading trade partner with
two-way trade valued at 4 billion U.S. dollars and Italy is
represented in Romania by some 8,000 enterprises.

enforcement of democratic institutions."

America.

manner in which the Fujimori regime handled this problem is "a
serious threat to the inter-American system and its commitment to

<HEADLINE> Italy's Tourist Boom Predicted This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy will enjoy a real tourist boom
this year, according to a study issued Monday by the country's
international tourism research institute, CISET.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a survey of Italian tourist firms,
forecast an increase in tourism this year of 8.1 percent over 1999,
with the highest numbers expected between the months of May and
October.
</P>
<P>
Economic stability would seem to be the main reason for the
sudden increase, the study said, given the nationalities of the
expected visitors, with Americans heading the list, followed by
Japanese and then British tourists.
</P>
<P>
All three nations have a stable, booming economy, and the
strength of the dollar, the yen and the pound means excellent
exchange rates for the tourist in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Another reason given for the boom is the Holy Year, as the
Catholic Church is hosting events throughout the year to celebrate
the anniversary of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, however, "culture" remains top of most tourists
' reasons for visiting Italy.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism is also booming, with Italians themselves holding
fourth place on the list of nationalities.
</P>
<P>
This desire to travel is also increasingly leading Italian to
foreign parts, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
However, limited by the super-dollar and a slight increase in
petrol prices, their destinations remain largely within Europe.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Backs U.N. Role in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi government on Monday
expressed support for the role of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) in south Lebanon where the Israeli occupation forces had
just withdrew.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Bin Abdel-Salam Faresi was
quoted by the Saudi News Agency as saying after a cabinet meeting
that his government "followed closely the reports on the withdrawal
of the Israeli troops from south Lebanon".
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal ended the Israeli occupation of such dear part
of the Lebanese territories. The Saudi government congratulates the
brotherly Lebanese people and government on such great victory,"
Faresi said.
</P>
<P>
"After Israel's compliance with the will of the international
community expressed in the U.N. Security Council resolutions No.
425 and 426, we hope that the Lebanese sovereignty and territorial
integrity will be respected," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli should not make the security of its northern borders a
pretext for launching attacks on the Lebanese people and
territories and holding Lebanon responsible for security while
Israel knows the country can not shoulder such responsibility in
the absence of fair, comprehensive and permanent peace in the
region," the minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"What we have to underscore in this regard is the role of the
UNIFIL in south Lebanon under the provisions of the U.N.
resolutions No. 425 and 426," Faresi added, noting that "the Saudi
government expresses support for the efforts aimed at reinforcing
UNIFIL and raising its efficiency."

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Stresses Expansion of Ties with Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
here on Monday stressed the importance of expanding ties with the
Netherlands based on respect and mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting Dutch Foreign Minister Van Aartsen,
Khatami also called on the whole world to give up conflicts and
seek reconciliation, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Humanity has experienced one century of conflicts, with the
Europeans bearing the brunt of the most tangible losses during the
two world wars, Khatami stated, adding that Iran and the Middle
East have also suffered from various wars and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the new millennium, let's lay a strong
foundation for humanity based on logic and dialog," the Iranian
president advised.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the idea of dialog among civilizations, which he
said has been welcomed by many countries and signifies the need for
peace, security and friendship among the human beings.
</P>
<P>
Iran has opted for detente in its foreign policy in order to
achieve the conditions appropriate for the dialog among
civilizations, Khatami said, adding that good results have been
achieved in this regard by expanding ties with the neighboring and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch foreign minister welcomed Iran's foreign policy of
detente, which he said has helped promote Iran's relations with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
He also called for expansion of ties with Iran through the
exchange of high ranking delegations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>

BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
received here on Monday Terry Larsen, special envoy of the U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lahoud stressed the necessity of finalizing
the procedures of liberating the Shebaa farms from the Israeli
occupation and releasing the Lebanese prisoners inside the Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud refuted the logic of the so-called practical borders,
asserting that the international borders are the criterion of the
Israeli withdrawal under the U.N. resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Larsen told reporters that he briefed Lahoud on
the progress made in the implementation of the U.N. resolutions 425
and 426 and on the report presented by Annan to the U.N. Security
Council on May 22.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy underscored that the Israeli pullout from the
Lebanese boder area is going on.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations pointed out the necessity of the withdrawal
of every Israeli soldier from Lebanon, Larsen said, adding Israel
is serious in finalizing the pullout process.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. expert team will demarcate the Lebanese-Israeli borders
in accordance with Annan's report, he added.
</P>
<P>
The team met here on Monday with a Lebanese expert team on the
demarcation issue, Larsen disclosed, voicing hope that the
technical work of the two teams will be finalized during the few
coming days.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is to
help the Lebanese government restore sovereignty over the liberated
areas in the south. The UNIFIL will be deployed in the area in
cooperation with the Lebanese government, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are several delicate issues on the borders where dozens
of Lebanese citizens were injured by Israeli forces," Larsen noted,
adding that he asked Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to ask his
soldiers to control the situation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy arrived here Monday noon on a three-day visit to
Lebanon. He will leave for Damascus on Wednesday to meet Syrian
Foreign Minister Faruk al-Shareh.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland to Resume Home-Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Rival Northern Irish politicians
Monday stressed the importance of all sides working together to
make the reconvened assembly succeed.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble of the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), and Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon of
the Social Democratic and Labor Party, were speaking at a news
conference in Belfast ahead of the re-start to devolution at
midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing executive was suspended in February because
of an impasse over paramilitary arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Pro-British Ulster Unionists voted to re-enter
government with republicans based on an offer by the Irish
Republican Party (IRA) to put its arms beyond use.
</P>
<P>
Mallon stressed that success would depend on all members of the
coalition pulling their weight and working together and said that
people would not tolerate another cessation of the devolved
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Any four-part coalition anywhere in the world is going to be
difficult. But we will try to ensure we build up the type of
collective approach required," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are resolved to center on making a new political
dispensation here and to make it work in the most creative and
most imaginative way possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mallon said he hoped General John de Chastelain, who heads the
body overseeing decommissioning, would be able to produce a report
on arms before the end of June.
</P>
<P>
"We know what was stated in the IRA statement, we know the
wording of it and we await the action that will be taken in
relation to the crucially important confidence-building element in
terms of that statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he deplored recent shootings in Northern Ireland
but said he could not comment on the killing of Edmund McCoy, who
died Monday after being shot in a bar in the south Belfast suburb
of Dunmurry.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also said the incidents underlined the need for the
immediate decommissioning of paramilitary weapons and the
responsibility on mainstream paramilitary loyalists to address the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at Saturday's Ulster Unionist Council meeting voted
by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent to back Trimble's proposal
to test the IRA offer to put its arms beyond use.
</P>
<P>
But anti-agreement party members have continued to voice their
opposition to the restoration of devolution in advance of actual
IRA decommissioning.

<HEADLINE> Romania-Israeli Cooperation in Field of Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Minister of Defense
Sorin Frunzaverde and Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh
signed here Monday a bilateral agreement providing for cooperation
in peace times in defense industry, military intelligence,
civilian control over the air space and army procurement.
</P>
<P>
Frunzaverde said he approached details of joint actions for the
rehabilitation of the Romanian defense industry, such as the joint
unfolding of research programmers and the building up, at Romania'
s request, of a modernization center for the Romanian aeronautics
in Brasov.
</P>
<P>
He added that the initiatives would materialize thanks to the
experience as a result of the cooperation between the Elbit
Israeli company and the Romanian IAR Ghimbav Brasov airplane maker
in the up-grading of Puma helicopters, as well as between Elbit
and Aerostar Bacau in the up-grading of MIG 21 and MIG 29
airplanes. Artillery was another potential cooperation domain in
which anti-tank missiles could be jointly made, according to
Frunzaverde.
</P>
<P>
The two officials highlighted Romania's wish to rehabilitate
its defense industry by implementing state-of-the-art technology
to employ highly qualified workforce. "For the Romanian defense
industry to redevelop, the existing competitive elements have to
be maintained and high technology introduced for the production of
modern equipment and its trading on third markets," Frunzaverde
said.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also approached Romania's stand on the state
of affairs in the Balkans, on a restructuring programmed for the
Romanian Army, as well as on the participation of Romanian troops
in the U.N. forces deployed between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Israel welcomes Romania's presence in the U.N. forces in this
area, yet a
final decision in that sense rests entirely with the Romanian
Government," Sneh said.

MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official said
Monday that Moscow remains staunchly opposed to NATO membership of
the Baltic states, but that it would not use force to resist the

Russia is ready to use only political and diplomatic means in
its effort to prevent the expansion of the transatlantic military
grouping to its western borders, said Sergei Ivanov, secretary of

"We believe that the NATO enlargement to the East and the
admission of new countries, including former Soviet republics,
will not add security to us," the Interfax news agency quoted
Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The approaching of NATO military bases to Russian borders "
would require an additional reaction," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of only one military-political group will not
bring security," Ivanov said.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien Monday vowed to push a significant Quebec bill through
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"It will pass the Senate. We'll make sure it's passing," the 66-
year-old prime minister told reporters at Parliament Hill in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "clarity bill" would give the Commons the final
power to reject secession of the French-speaking Quebec from the
rest of Canada if it believes any of the related questions in a
future referendum is unclear.
</P>
<P>
The bill already passed the Commons in March and is yet to win
the necessary passage at the upper house.
</P>
<P>
"Senators have a right to express their point of view. I think
the bill is extremely necessary. It's one of the most important
bills this government has presented in a long time," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
His comment on the sensitive issue in the country came as Unity

business leaders have said.
</P>
<P>
In evidence submitted to a Commons committee which was released
Monday, the Institute of Directors (IOD) said that the British
business cycle "remains obstinately out of sync" with business
cycles on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Brown, the chancellor, has said that he will use five
tests to decide whether Britain should join the single currency.
But he has refused to give a "running commentary" on the chances
of meeting those criteria.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it believes in principle that Britain
would benefit from joining the euro if the economic conditions
were right.
</P>
<P>
The IOD agrees with the government that Britain would benefit
from joining the euro, provided the economic conditions were right.
But it disagrees about the likelihood of it happening in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Lea, head of the IOD's policy unit, said: "There are no
signs that the UK economy is converging with those of core
euroland."
</P>
<P>
The House of Commons will asses early in the next Parliament
whether the conditions laid down by the chancellor have been met.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France Crack Down on Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain signed an agreement with
France Monday on joint efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants
using the cross-channel Eurostar train.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal reached at a meeting of European justice
ministers in Brussels, British officials will be able to check the
papers of passengers heading for Britain who board the Eurostar in
France.
</P>
<P>
Reports said recently the Eurostar has been targeted by people
seeking illegal entry to the UK.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw said that by allowing UK
immigration officers to carry out immigration checks before people
board the train in France, the officers should be able to prevent
any inadequately documented passengers arriving in the UK.
</P>
<P>
At the Brussels meeting, Britain also joined the anti-crime
arrangements of the Schengen agreement in a move to combat cross-
border crime, such as drug smuggling and vehicle crime.
</P>
<P>
Britain also signed a convention making it easier to obtain
evidence abroad for use in British criminal courts. It also agreed
with Spain to strengthen cooperation between the Gibraltar police
and the Spanish police.
</P>
<P>
British police and other law enforcement agencies will now have
access to the Schengen Information System, a computer database
which will help them to track down stolen vehicles or firearms or
suspects who may have fled abroad.

<HEADLINE> GCC Refuses Discussion With EU on Human Rights Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan said Monday that the
GCC states would not discuss human rights issues with the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the Saudi capital of Riyadh,
Hujailan said the GCC states neither object the human rights topic
nor have embarrassment in this respect, but believe the discussion
must be "under the umbrella of the United Nations as the issue
concerns the entire world and not only Europe."
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- have clarified their stances
and informed the EU during a joint meeting of foreign ministers
held on May 22 in Brussels, adding the EU had understood the
message.
</P>
<P>
Hujailan said the GCC members were not embarrassed from
discussing this matter with the EU in a clear and frank manner.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, head
of the GCC side, had earlier explained the GCC stands towards the
human rights issue which he said was based on the Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
The GCC chief described the recent campaign against the GCC
countries and particularly Saudi Arabia by a number of
organizations carrying the slogan of protecting human rights as "
illiterate."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, some human rights organizations based in
Europe including the Amnesty International charged Saudi Arabia for
holding political prisoners behind bars.
</P>
<P>
During their last meeting held in the western Saudi city of
Jeddah in April, the GCC foreign ministers condemned the Amnesty
International for the campaign, calling on other organizations to "
seek accuracy and show respect for beliefs, culture and
civilizations of the peoples."

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Dutch FMs Discusses Improving Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his visiting Dutch counterpart Van Aartsen held talks
here Monday on the improvement of bilateral relations, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference, Kharrazi said Iran and the
Netherlands enjoy high potentials for economic and cultural
cooperation and hoped that Aartsen's historical visit to Iran would
serve as a prelude to develop bilateral relations,
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between the two countries faced obstacles in
the past 20 years since the establishment of the Islamic republic,
Kharrazi pointed out, hinting that Aartsen's visit, the first by a
Dutch foreign minister since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, is of
great importance.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Dutch government to end its support for anti-
Iran terrorist groups, which he said has created a negative
atmosphere among the Iranian community in that country as well as
the Dutch media.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Netherlands is cooperating with terrorist groups,
the atmosphere of suspicion will prevail between the two countries,
so this should be brought to an end, Kharrazi stressed.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Kharrazi said the difference of values and
culture should be considered in any evaluation of human rights
records.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the double standard of European countries on human
rights who employ the issue as a political leverage against
independent states.
</P>
<P>
Aartsen, who arrived here on Monday, said for his part that his
country supports the initiative of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on holding dialogue of civilizations.
</P>
<P>
He praised Iran's progress, especially in holding the sixth
parliamentary election in February, which give reformers a chance
to control the legislative body and push forward reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also stressed the importance of cooperation in
anti-drug campaigns, the refugee issue and the Middle East peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Represent War Against Iraqi People: European Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The decade-long sanctions represent
a continued war against the ordinary Iraqi people as they have been
hardest hit by the sanctions, the visiting European parliamentary
delegation said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, contradictory to the U.N. Charter and laws, is
a "big mistake", the delegation told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which includes three British, Irish and Italian
members of the European Parliament, arrived in Baghdad on Sunday to
pay a four-day visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Basheer Khan Bahai, member of the
delegation, said that they hope the visit will get them acquainted
with the humanitarian situation of Iraq, who has been under
stringent U.N. sanctions ever since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that as many as 1.3 million people, mostly children
and the elderly, have died as a direct result of the sanctions, and
the present death rate among children and the elderly have doubled
compared with 1989, the year before the sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
After the visit, the delegation will draw up a report and submit
it to the European Parliament subordinate to the European Union,
Bahai said.
</P>
<P>
Niyal Andrews, another member of the delegation, called upon the
U.N. to start "an immediate and frank dialogue" with Iraq to end
the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
There have been growing pressure from Europe on the U.N. to lift
the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On April 3, Vittorio Sgarbi, an Italian member of the European
Parliament, arrived in Baghdad by taking a small plane with other
three people from France and Italy to protest the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marie Benjamin, one of Sgarbi's companions on the April
mission to Baghdad, has declared that he will organize another
flight from Paris to Baghdad in defiance of the U.N. embargo.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Main Reformist Party Not to Introduce Candidate for Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's main reformist party of the
Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) announced Monday that it
will not introduce its candidate for the post of future Majlis
(parliament) speaker in order to prevent any differences among
reformist parties.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF will refrain from nominating candidate for the post of
the speaker in the new parliament so as to prevent eventual
discrepancies among groups of the reformist coalition "May 23
Front," the IIPF leader Mohammad Reza Khatami told the Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, the young brother of President Mohammad Khatami, said
that the IIPF underlines to implement its reform plans with less
possible costs and based on the consensus within the "May 23
Front."
</P>
<P>
Most of the 18 groups in the coalition in support of President
Mohammad Khatami have announced to support the candidacy of former
Majlis Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, Secretary of the reformist Assembly
of Combatant Clergy, in Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi, a former radical, also enjoyed support from the
conservative camp to regain the post of Majlis speaker after former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani abandoned his seat in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the IIPF has the intention to introduce Mohsen
Mirdamadi, a non-cleric member of the IIPF, to run for the post of
speaker as two other prominent reformist leaders Mohammad Reza
Khatami and Behzad Nabavi, the coalition's spokesman, declined to
be nominated for the post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mirdamadi said that the IIPF will propose Khatami and
Nabavi vice speakers of the reformist parliament which officially
started work on Saturday, putting an end to the conservative
dominance on the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that if Nabavi declined to be nominated for the
post of vice speaker, Khatami would also refuse being nominated.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that the difference over future Majlis
speaker cast a shadow over the future coordination among the
reformist parties and groups.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will Violence Return in South Lebanon?  by Huang Ling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Due to the Shebaa Farms issue,
religious conflict and factional struggles, violence still looms in
South Lebanon though Israel withdrew its troops from the region on
the dawn of May 24, wrapping up its last front war with Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the past 22 years, Lebanese Cedar flags
are fluttering side by side with Israeli David Star flags in
several border towns, a reminder that Israel has ended its last
front war with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
However, whether peace will persist in south Lebanon remains a
big question mark as dozens of Lebanese youths on Sunday crossed
the border barrier and tossed stones at Israel patrols, prompting
Israeli soldiers to fire back and injure three Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has stopped border violation and tried to keep order
among the visitors, nevertheless, the resistance group has vowed to
continue its fight against Israel if Israel does not retreat from
the Shebaa Farms and fails to release dozens of Lebanese in Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly said
Hezbollah will not cease fire until the Shebaa Farms returns to
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese leaders and guerrillas regard the 200-square kilometer
controversial farms, which are located on the west side of Mount
Hermon and still under Israel's control, as an indivisible part of
the Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
Israel argues that the Shebaa Farms belong to Syria, and that a
withdrawal from the area will be considered in peace talks with
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United Nations announced on May 22 that
Shebaa Farms is not within the area that Resolution 425 obliges
Israel to pullout from Lebanese occupied land.
</P>
<P>
If Hezbollah attacks Israeli positions on Shebaa and the latter
retaliates, the dispute will rekindle the fire in south.
</P>
<P>
The traditional dispute between Muslim and Christian can also
draws Lebanon into the mire of war.
</P>
<P>
Most Christian families have members who joined South Lebanon
Army (SLA) or had close relations with the SLA which, funded and
controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state patrol the Israeli-
occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
One Hezbollah leader has threatened that if SLA militiamen does
not surrender, "their throats will be cut off in bed."
</P>
<P>
For fear of Hezbollah attacks, many Christian families fled to
Israel before the disassembly of the SLA troops, though Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud had assured Christian residents of their
security.
</P>
<P>
In the southern city of Nabatiye, a taxi driver of Shiite named
Ali Bageer told Xinhua that Christians are all "traitors and
collaborators with Israel". In a urban cafe, Muslims always link
SLA and Israel with Christian.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon will not see an early end to the ethical
antagonism.
</P>
<P>
Even between the two main resistance groups, Hezbollah and the
Amel movement, there are many divergences.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, detached from Amel in 1982 and
spearheaded the resistance movement in the south in order to end
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The two Shiite organizations fought in 1989 to gain more Shiite
Muslim support in Lebanon. Faced up with the same enemy, they later
agreed to cooperate and fight together.
</P>
<P>
But in the south, Hezbollah has won more Shiite Muslim by
fighting Israeli troops and SLA and setting up schools and
hospitals for the poor. Amel, of course, will not willingly lose
its traditional domain and try to extend its influence in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two guerrilla groups have begun a race of seizing Israeli
abandoned weapons. The supporters of two movements erected their
flags on different positions and moved Israeli tanks and loaded
ammunitions to their bases.
</P>
<P>
If the government does not disarm the two guerrilla groups, it
is likely that fighting might erupt anew in south Lebanon.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
their assaults on rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
Monday, reportedly killing dozens of militants.
</P>
<P>
In what was described as a large-scale operation in southeast
Chechnya, federal forces unleashed aerial and artillery raids on
rebel positions in the Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno districts, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Gennady Alyokhin, a spokesman with the combined federal
forces in the North Caucasus, said federal defense and interior
troops killed 15 militants, including an unidentified rebel
commander, near the Sayasan community of the Nozhai-Yurt district.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 rebels were killed in the same district while
fleeing in six trucks, Interfax reported, quoting military sources.
It was not clear if that also happened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, four federal paratroopers were
killed early Monday when their armored personnel vehicle and a GAZ-
66 truck hit a landmine near the village of Avtury, the Shaili
district of Chechnya, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The toll could be even higher if another convoy scheduled to
take the same road did not change route at the last moment,
Interfax said, noting that there were three landmines laid on the
road.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) - Telecommunication regulatory
authorities in Tanzania and other southern African countries have
been urged to harmonize their regulatory policies to improve their
services and lower the current high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day special general meeting of the
Telecommunication Regulators Association of Southern Africa
(TRASA) held in Dar es Salaam on Monday, the Tanzanian Minister
for Transport and Communications Earnest Nyanda said regulators
should make sure they hold telecommunication operators' greed for
profit so that they do not suffocate their enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"High tariffs like those charged in our region limit access to
 telecommunication services to a few people, which negates your
obligation as regulators to guarantee that the majority people
benefits from the services," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He told participants from Zambia, Malawi, South Africa,
Mozambique, Botswana, Swaziland and the host Tanzania that the
region must chart out the cost-effective services to both
operators and their clients in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also commended TRASA for the positive role it has played in
recent years, especially in the move to adopt interconnected
regulations and tariff guidelines to ensure universal access to
quality and affordable telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
TRASA is a forum for national telecommunication regulatory
authorities in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

<P>
ANKARA -- The 12th Turkish Coal Congress issued a final
declaration on Monday, calling for full use of the country's coal
resources, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that Turkey's coal and energy problems were
discussed at the congress at Eregli town, Zonguldak Province,
northwest Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It said that Turkey has 1.1 billion ton of coal and 8.4 billion
tons of lignite reserve. It is wrong and dangerous to claim that
the local resources are not sufficient and make Turkey dependent on
natural gas, nuclear energy or imported coal.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to meet Turkey's energy needs through its own
resources, said the declaration.

<HEADLINE> Peres, Katsav Nominated as Israeli Presidential Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres and former tourism minister Moshe Katsav were
nominated respectively by their parties on Monday as candidates for
Israeli presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The election, which had been set to take place on July 31,
will be a secret ballot in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament),
according to a statement issued by Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg's
office earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
The candidacy endorsement of Peres, who is also a former
prime minister, was announced Monday afternoon at a meeting of One
Israel ruling coalition, officials revealed.
</P>
<P>
The nomination, which was originally scheduled to be
confirmed on Friday, was sped up after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak clarified his position regarding his party candidate.
</P>
<P>
Although the relations between Barak and Peres are reportedly
sour for a long time, Barak said in Monday's meeting that he had no
doubt that Peres would be an superior president.
</P>
<P>
Thanking for the support from Barak and other party officials,
Peres promised that if elected, he would act for the unity of the
people. He said that he would use peace as a unifying factor in his
term.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, it was also announced that Haim Ramon,
Minister in Prime Minister's Office and one of Barak's closest
confidants, will lead Peres's campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the major opposition party Likud unanimously
elected Knesset member Moshe Katsav as its candidate for the
presidential election in its Monday afternoon meeting.
</P>
<P>
The race between Peres and Katsav will be equally matched,
with the former seeming to have a slight advantage now.
</P>
<P>
A survey published by local newspaper Jerusalem Post on Monday
showed that Peres is now holding ballots from as many as 53 of the
120 Knesset members, in contrast with an estimated 38 for Katsav.
</P>
<P>
However, Katsav said Monday afternoon that he knew of at least
45 Knesset members who support his election. He also claimed that
the key to his election lies with the 17 Knesset members of the
ultraorthodox religious Shas party, who have not decide their
favorite candidate until now.
</P>
<P>
Peres reportedly has good personal relation with Shas spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who will made the final decision about
which candidate the party will support. But Katsav was known for
his religious ardor.
</P>
<P>
The election was put into the parliamentary schedule after
the 76-year-old President Ezer Weizman informed Burg Saturday night
that he will resign by July 11.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, whose second-term as president should only end in
2003, was forced to leave the post ahead of schedule after the
revelation of his financial irregularities with a French Jewish
businessman and the subsequent police investigation.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and State
Attorney Edna Arbel published a damning report regarding the case
last week, saying that the president had behaved in an improper
manner by accepting more than 300,000 U.S. dollars from the textile
tycoon Edouard Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
After Rubinstein said he decided to close the investigation
against Weizman without a recommendation to indict only because the
statute of limitations on the charges had run out, calls for
Weizman's resignation reached a crescendo.
</P>
<P>
The president, who had implied his resignation even before
the financial scandal due to his deteriorating health, made the
final decision Saturday night after consulting with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and all the president's confidants.
</P>
<P>
Barak expressed regret over the situation that had arisen on
Monday afternoon. The circumstances surrounding the termination of
President Weizman's tenure are "painful and sad," Barak noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, Burg, who is also the vice-president,
will serve as acting-president during the interim period between
Weizman's resignation on July 11 and the inauguration of a new
president.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration will take place a day after the election, or
on August 1, before the Knesset begins its summer recession on
August 4, Burg's office said in its statement.

<P>
BAGHDAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Two civilians were killed in U.S.
and British warplanes' bombings over northern Iraq on Monday, the
official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the spokesman said that at the local time 10:15
(0615 GMT), nine hostile formations of the U.S. and British planes
from the airspace of Turkey made 18 armed sorties over northern
Iraqi provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil, bombing civilian and
service facilities and installations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 9:35 (0535 GMT), six formations of
the enemy jets from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait made 14 armed sorties
over southern Iraqi provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery intercepted these planes,
forcing them to flee back to their bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their planes have made a total of
21,441 sorties, among them 4,040 from Turkey and 17,401 from Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, over the two no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes have been enforcing the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq shortly after the 1991 Gulf War with
their self-claimed aim of protecting Shiite Muslims and Kurds from
the forces of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the zones and has constantly challenged
the hostile planes by targeting the aircraft with surface-to-air
missiles and anti-aircraft artillery.

<HEADLINE> IRGC Commander Worries About Security of Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Commander of Iran's elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Rahim Safavi said Monday that
Tehran has been turned into insecurity under the impact of social,
economic and political imbalances.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a flag-hoisting ceremony, Safavi urged the security
forces, which is de facto under the command of the IRGC, to
maintain "sustainable and popular security in Tehran."
</P>
<P>
"Preservation of security in Tehran as the capital city of the
Islamic Republic of Iran is greatly important for the people,
government and the system," he was quoted by the Islamic Republic
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since the election of the reformist President Mohammad Khatami
in 1997, the country, particularly the capital, has turned into an
arena of spiraling factional struggle between the reformists and
the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Several opposition leaders and dissident writers were
mysteriously killed in Tehran in 1998 and investigation showed the
involvement of secret agents of the Intelligence Ministry in the
political killings.
</P>
<P>
Following the overwhelming victory of the reformists in the
February parliamentary elections, a close ally of President Khatami
was seriously injured in an abortive assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Safavi underlined that a balance should be created through
cooperation among the legislative, the executive and the judiciary
branches and various organizations should help the security forces
through their support to establish security.
</P>
<P>
Warning that global arrogance and Americans opposing the Islamic
system intend to transfer Tehran into a state of insecurity, he
expressed hope that the security forces could powerfully establish
security not only in Tehran but throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander also noted that preservation of security in
the country is a difficult task, given its 7,000 kilometers of land
and sea joint border and neighborhood with 15 countries and an area
of 1.648 million square kilometers with a population of 63 million.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Iran plays a key role in the strategic region,
adding that peace and security in the region has no meaning in the
absence of Iran.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seeks Peaceful Settlement of Dispute With Iran Over Gulf Gas Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Monday sought to solve
the dispute with Iran over a gas field in north Gulf through
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah voiced hope
that Kuwait and Iran will "settle the issue of the continental
shelf very soon, as a result of sincere efforts and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud welcomed anew the Iranian government's decision to
stop drilling and withdraw installations and machinery from Al-
Dorra gas field, according to the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the "decision, which came in response to Kuwaiti
request, sincerely reflects keenness of the Iranian government on
bolstering friendly relations between the two countries in all
fields."
</P>
<P>
Al-Dorra gas field is located in a sector in northern Gulf
waters where the demarcation of the continental shelf is subject to
rival claims by Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The three Gulf states have been locked in talks for years to
agree on a demarcation scheme, but have failed so far.
</P>
<P>
Iran started drilling three months ago in the disputed offshore
area, which caused concern from both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced on May 13 that its "rig (which) operated in the
Dorra region stopped drilling when these disputes emerged."
</P>
<P>
Tehran has also reportedly expressed readiness to hold meetings
with Kuwait to reach an understanding on the disputed area.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs to Meet in Jeddah Saturday: GCC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan said Monday foreign
ministers of the GCC states are to meet in the western Saudi city
of Jeddah next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the Saudi capital of Riyadh,
Hujailan said the ministers will discuss many political and
economic issues of common interest for the GCC states at the
regional, Arab and international levels.
</P>
<P>
The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency quoted Gulf diplomatic sources in Saudi
Arabia as disclosing the topics will include the Iraqi issue, Gulf
affairs, the Middle East peace process and the dispute between the
UAE and Iran over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Iraq's implementation of the United Nations
resolutions related to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait will be reviewed
during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the UAE-Iranian territorial dispute, the sources said
the GCC foreign ministers will discuss developments concerning the
issue in light of the efforts employed by a tripartite GCC
committee tasked to work out a mechanism to arrange direct
negotiations between Tehran and Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
Both UAE and Iran claim sovereignty over the strategic islands
of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are located in
the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf. The isles have been controlled by
Iran since Britain retreated from the region in 1971.
</P>
<P>
According to the Gulf sources, another topic of Saturday's
meeting is likely to be the long-standing Qatari-Bahraini border
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain are locked in a dispute over several small but
potentially oil-and-gas-rich Gulf islands. The isles are controlled
by Manama since 1930s but also claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Although the two states have formed a joint committee to try to
negotiate a settlement, Qatar has also brought this issue to the
International Court of Justice, a move at which Bahrain has voiced
reservations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Willing to Cooperate With U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is willing to cooperate with
the new U.N. humanitarian coordinator and provide him with
necessary facilities to fulfil his duties in Iraq, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohamad Said Al-Sahaf said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf made the remarks during his meeting with Tun Myat, the new
U.N. humanitarian coordinator, who arrived in the Iraqi capital
Baghdad at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Iraqi foreign minister said there will be no
problems in implementing the U.N. oil-for-food program if political
elements are ruled out.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Tun Myat assured Sahaf that he is ready to do
everything he can to remove obstacles hindering the implementation
of the U.N. oil-for-food deal to alleviate the plight of the Iraqi
people, who have been the hardest hit by the decade-long U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Iraq, Tun Myat had said he would try hard to
make the U.N. oil-for-food program a success, stressing that the U.
N.humanitarian deal had failed to meet the needs of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Tun Myat replaced Hans Von Sponeck, who resigned at the end of
March to protest the failure of the U.N. oil-for-food program in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and Britain of impeding the
implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program by deliberately
putting on hold contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to buy
humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal, launched in late 1996, allows Iraq
to import a limited amount of crude oil to finance imports of food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the
crippling impact of the U.N. sanctions since Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and
leaders of the European Union agreed Monday to continue a
comprehensive dialogue between the two sides despite their
differences over Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has attached major significance to its relations with
Europe and will continue to do so," Putin told a EU delegation at
a meeting in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is and will be a European country by virtue of its
location, culture and attitude to economic integration," the
Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the EU delegation, Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres, congratulated Putin on his election to the
Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
Putin was sworn into office earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said that the EU regards Russia as a key element in
building a common Europe.
</P>
<P>
Putin described his talks with the EU delegation as "a
constructive and comprehensive dialogue with a common Europe."
</P>
<P>
He defended Russia's fight against Chechen rebels but said
Moscow would "cooperate with international organizations and the
press to make the situation in Chechnya more transparent."
</P>
<P>
Putin said the federal government has a clear plan of the peace
settlement in the Northern Caucasus and would pursue the course to
the end.
</P>
<P>
He said great efforts have been taken to observe human rights
and Russian laws in Chechnya, noting that representatives of all
international organizations who wished to visit Chechnya have been
there.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 correspondents, among them over 500 foreign,
are accredited in Chechnya, Putin added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed bilateral economic cooperation,
and Putin promised to address the questions posed by European
businessmen to encourage investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is one of Russia's key trading partners. Its
trade turnover with EU accounts for 35 percent of its total
foreign trade; 60 percent of foreign investment in Russia comes

<HEADLINE> Narcotic Drug Seizures Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide narcotic drug seizures
in 1999 increased more than 400 tons to total 4,256 tons, it was
announced here by the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the
Interpol.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference, the two institutions told the
press that the amounts of seized heroin, cocaine and cannabis all
increased compared with a year ago when the total seizure totaled
3,837 tons.
</P>
<P>
Michel Danet, Secretary-General of the World Customs
Organization, said that customs seizures alone, that accounted for
one third of the total seizures last year, represented financial
losses for criminal organizations of the amount of 60 billion
United States dollars or the equivalent of 6,000 X-ray scanners
that can be used to detect smuggled drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said that two to 10 times more psychotropic substances were
seized last year than in 1998 with more than 100 million tablets
seized around the world. The psychotropic substances consisted of
ecstasy, amphetamines and metamphetamines.
</P>
<P>
The WCO chief added that controls on chemical precursor
shipments are also a necessary adjunct to the fight against
narcotic drugs. A total of 179 tons of chemical precursors, used
as additives in the production of narcotic drugs, were intercepted
across the globe in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Paul Higdon, Interpol criminal intelligence director, said that
half of last year's 2.5 million Interpol intelligence
communications were related to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
WCO Secretary-General Danet warned that drug traffickers tended
to use legal goods as camouflage on illegal drugs. The commercial
goods used as hideouts included machinery and motor vehicle parts,
toys, fruits and vegetables, computer monitor tubes, drinking cans
and specially-delivered parcels.
</P>
<P>
As origins of narcotic drugs are concerned, Asia was still the
largest producer of opium and heroin in 1999, accounting for 94
percent of the world's production while South America was the sole
producer of cocaine in the world.

<P>
The average life expectancy of Russian men is 61 years and four
months while that for women is 72 years and 11 months, a
difference of more than 10 years, Interfax said, quoting the State
Statistics Committee.
</P>
<P>
The national average life expectancy represents a major
improvement than that of 1994, when men lived on average only 57
years and 7 months and women, 71 years and two months, with an
average life expectancy of less than 64.
</P>
<P>
Only 76.2 percent of Russian men and 91.3 percent of Russian
women reach the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
Russia has registered a major drop in its population in recent
years. According to the State Statistics Committee, Russia's
population was 145.3 million as of April 1, a decrease of 0.2
percent than that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The population decline is attributed to lowered standard of
living,mounting divorces and a death rate that surpasses the birth
rate.
</P>
<P>
Russian demographers warn that the country's population might
drop to below 100 million by the middle of 21st century unless
effective measures are taken.

ATHENS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Valery
Giscard D'Estaing has won this year's Onassis Prize for
International Understanding and Social Achievement.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press conference Monday, Stelio
Papadimitriou, president of the Onassis Public Benefit Foundation
and the Committee for the Onassis International Prizes, said that
D'Estaing, born in 1926 and became France's president between 1974
and 1981, was a major contributor during his presidency to the
development of international relations.
</P>
<P>
He described the former French president as the main and
decisive figure for the progress that was achieved at that time
towards the forming of the 15-member European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
D'Estaing was also the motivator of the idea to form the group
of the seven Western industrialized countries (G7), he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's notable composer Mikis Theodorakis, born
in 1925, has won the Onassis Prize for Culture (Arts and
Humanities).
</P>
<P>
Theodorakis wrote for all musical forms, Papadimitriou said,
adding that his work, rich and versatile, transcended the limits
of music and covers areas such as poetry, prose, philosophy,
musicology even political essays.
</P>
<P>
John Doran, born in 1945 and a professor of soil science at
the U.S. University of Nebraska, has won the Onassis Prize for the
Environment.
</P>
<P>
The awards ceremony will take place in November in Athens.

<HEADLINE> Senior Russian Official on Afghanistan Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian security official
said Monday that the possible preventive measures against the
Afghanistan's Taliban do not necessarily imply strikes on Afghan
territory.
</P>
<P>
Preventive actions also include the possibility of building up
pressure on the Taliban's regime by diplomatic and political means,
said Sergei Ivanov, secretary of the Russian Security Council, a
government body that includes leaders of the country's power
ministries.
</P>
<P>
Many Russian officials have recently threatened preventive
steps against the Afghan Talibans for their alleged support to
rebels in Russia's breakaway Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said he would not rule out anything because Moscow sees
a"threat to (its) security" from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
" A flood of drugs and terrorists are coming from the territory
controlled by the Taliban and if we do not stop this flood there,
new problems may arise near Russia's borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also pointed to economic sanctions as the other measure
to put pressure on the Talibans. In addition, Moscow might
strengthen its support to Taliban's rivals, the Northern Alliance,
which include military assistance to those who fight against the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Other preventative measures include the provision of assistance
to Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and other Russian allies bordering
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"All this does not imply strikes on Afghan territory," the
Interfax news agency quoted Ivanov as saying.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Presidential Aspirant Rejects Call for Resigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment Minister Ben
Mwila on Monday defied pressure on him to leave the ruling
Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
The Nation Executive Committee of the MMD called for Mwila's
expulsion from the party after he publicly announced his intention
to contest the MMD presidential candidate for the 2001 elections
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, who is also MMD treasurer, said he has the following of
the majority of cadres in the MMD and has not seen any reason why
he should be expelled.
</P>
<P>
The MMD was founded on democratic principles which he is simply
exercising, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwila said he has not done anything that could warrant his
expulsion from the party, adding that he would go ahead with his
election campaign to ensure that he wins the battle.
</P>
<P>
But President Frederick Chiluba, who can no longer run for the
next presidency as his second and last five-year term expires in
late 2001, has indicated that he would ensure that Mwila does not
become the president, and the MMD said it is not the time to start
the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest with a business empire
spanning manufacturing, construction, finance and fertilizers,
helped Chiluba defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991
elections and now is seen as a leading candidate to replace
Chiluba as the ruling party leader to stand for the next
presidential elections.

<P>
LUANDA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- European Union's representative to
the Great Lakes region Aldo Ajello expressed here on Monday
concerns over the dialogue between the warring parties in the
conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency Angop, the EU envoy said
that although the situation in DRC has been improved, there still
exists some concerns that could delay the dialogue between the
government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to him, if there is possibility to implement the
Lusaka peace accord, it is due to the work done by the two sides,
respectively the government supporters Angola and Zimbabwe, and
the rebel backers Uganda and Rwanda, said the Angop.
</P>
<P>
The EU diplomat said he hopes that the UN peacekeeping mission
arrives in the DRC as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
As one of the main supporters of the DRC government, Angola has
sent its troops to the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to Angola, Aldo Ajello is expected
to meet the Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Be More Effective Involved in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia, like all other least
developed countries, has to overcome impediments affecting its
effective integration into the World Trade Organization (WTO), a
high- ranking Zambian official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry William
Harrington said that the main impediments for the country to
integrate into the WTO include institutional, infrastructural and
human resource constrains, as well as market access and supply
capacity limits.
</P>
<P>
He told a two-day national workshop with the WTO that
unfamiliarity with the rules and implications of the system also
prevent the country from bringing its role in the WTO into full
play.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government is determined to address these problems,
said the minister, adding that the government's efforts can't go
without the inputs from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that at national level a deliberate step should be
taken to educate people about the multilateral trading system and
its implications.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Deploy 3,000 Soldiers to S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders Monday decided
here to send a 3,000 strong troops to reinforce the UN
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, and help shore up the faltering
peace process there.
</P>
<P>
The decision of redeployment, only one month after the
withdrawal of the West African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) from
the country, was made by member state leaders of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS)at their two- day summit
ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following the summit, the ECOWAS
 Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate said the reinforcing troops
would help the 11,000 strong UN peace keeping force, known as the
UNAMSIL, to supervise disarmament and demobilization of the
country's former rebels according to the 1999 Lome Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said that details of the planned redeployment would be
worked out with the UN and donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ECOWAS spokeswoman Adriane Diop also revealed at
the occasion that Foday Sankoh, leader of Sierra Leone' s former
rebel Revolutionary United Front "would be taken out of Sierra
Leone and kept in a safer place".
</P>
<P>
Sanko was captured in Freetown by the pro-government fighters
earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Spend 27% of Budget on Debt Repayment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite of donors initiatives
to grant debt relief to Tanzania, the government will have to
spend about 27.4 percent of its recurrent budget in the coming
fiscal year on repaying the outstanding external debt which stands
at around 6.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Making a pre-budget briefing to the Finance and Economic
Affairs Committee and the Social Welfare Committee in the
government on Monday, Minister for Finance Daniel Yona said the
national debt will continue to affect the country's development.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government plans to spend about
1.389 trillion Tanzanian shillings (about 1.74 billion dollars)
during the 2000/2001 fiscal year, in which 1.071 trillion
shillings (about 1.34 billion dollars) will be recurrent
expenditure while development expenditure will account for 317.9
billion shillings (about 397.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget for the forthcoming fiscal year increases by 208.8
million shillings (about 261,000 dollars) or 17.7 percent over the
current financial year, said Yona.
</P>
<P>
He explained that apart from debt repayment, the recurrent
budget will also cover salaries for civil servants and other
charges.
</P>
<P>
It will also be shared among five priority sectors, namely
defense and security, judiciary and foreign affairs, social
services, economic services and production sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that the money set aside for other
charges in government ministries, departments, regions and
councils is still below the actual needs.
</P>
<P>
The situation left the government with no choice but to
continue with its efforts to increase revenue and reduce
non-urgent activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yona also noted the new budget fundamentals and policies focus
on collecting revenue no less than 856.4 billion shillings (about
1.07 billion dollars) and continuing with the privatization of the
remaining loss-making public utilities.
</P>
<P>
Focus will also be on improving management of government
expenditure, maintaining foreign exchange reserves of
international standard, creating an environment that guarantees
procurement of small scale loans and improving the management of
both domestic and foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to hold down the inflation and
improve investment climate, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian fire fighters have put
out all the forest and grassland fires within its territory, the
state fire-fighting department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy director of the state fire-fighting department, who is
only identified as Dorjdavga, said that 110 fires occurred in the
country this year, 36 more than the previous year, with losses
totaling over 100 million tugrik (100,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He stressed that 16 of the fires came from Russia, incurring
about 60 percent of the total losses.
</P>
<P>
Most of the other fires were started by smoking, picnicking,
sparks from car exhausts and poaching. The usually dry weather
this spring helped the fires spread quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 74 fires occurred in the country, charring 3.13
million hectares of land.

GAZA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat discussed with Israeli Environment Minister
Dalia Itzik the latest developments of the Middle East peace
process in the West Bank City of Ramallah on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Voice of Palestine Radio said Arafat talked with Itzik on the
regional peace process particularly on the Palestinian track in
view of "the obstacle laid by Israel on the peace path and its
incompliance with the signed agreements with the Palestinians".
</P>
<P>
Itzik was the first Israeli minister to meet Arafat since the
fierce clashes between the Palestinians and the Israeli troops mid
this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Israeli radio reported that Itzik informed Arafat
during their meeting that Israel would not tolerate the re-
occurrence of shooting by Palestinian police like that seen during
those clashes.
</P>
<P>
The minister also asked the PNA to tighten control over the
Palestinian Security Forces, it added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over U.S., British Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has informed the U.N. Security
Council of the recent U.S. and British warplanes' attacks on
southern and northern Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In two letters, one to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and the
other to president of the U.N. Security Council, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf pointed out that during May 15-22,
the U.S. and British planes carried out 152 armed sorties from
airspaces of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed civilian and service facilities, killing
a child, injuring 11 others and caused heavy property damages,
Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that these aggressions represent
continuation of the aggressive policy pursued by the U.S. and
Britain, with the aim of harming Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government "completely rejects" the so-called no-fly
zones imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain "in an attempt
to justify their aggressions on Iraq," said Sahaf.
</P>
<P>
He called upon intervention from the U.N. secretary general and
U.N. Security Council president to make the U.S. and Britain stop
such acts and pay respect to Iraq's sovereignty as well as the
international law, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that nearly 300 civilians have been killed and 860
others injured by the U.S. and British air raids over the no-fly
zones since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched the
Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq.

</P>
<P>
He said the concept envisages empowering the impoverished
people, "subordinating government functionaries to the people,
granting financial autonomy to the local governments, making them
capable of generating their own resources."
</P>
<P>
Musharraf stressed the need for a new relationship between the
districts and provinces, preparation of new rules of business,
preparation for provincial financial awards to the districts and
training of district government officers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by the governors of the four provinces
and other high-level federal, provincial and military officials.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf's government has promised to establish
genuine democracy at the grass-roots level in Pakistan after the
army dismissed the civilian government last October and the
devolution of power is a major plan designed toward this end.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Faced With Oligarchy Before Coup: Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Pakistan
observed on Monday that the Pakistani government was an oligarchy
before October 12, 1999, when the army took over power from a
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
"What regretfully existed in Pakistan on that day (October 12,
1999) and for years prior to that time was merely a feigned
appearance of what we can call a form of 'oligarchy',"the court
said in a lengthy judgment issued here.
</P>
<P>
The court Monday issued the detailed 579-page unanimous
judgment of a 12-member bench of the apex court,authored by Chief
Justice of Pakistan Irshad Hasan Khan on the petitions challenging
the October 12, 1999, coup.
</P>
<P>
The court announced on May 12 a short order to justify the
military action which led to the collapse of the elected
government of Nawaz Sharif and the setting up of General Pervez
Musharaff's current government.
</P>
<P>
In its judgment the court said a situation arose to which the
constitution provided no solution and the intervention of the
armed forces became inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The court said no one could disagree that Pakistan must have
democracy but the Sharif government, although superficially
elected, was a form of "oligarchy" rather than democracy.
</P>
<P>
The judgment, however, set a three-year period for the current
military government to complete its political and economic reform
plan and return power to an elected government.

<HEADLINE> Supachai Stresses WTO to Create Third World Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
must take more concern about the needs of developing countries,
stressed the designated WTO Director-General Supachai Panitchpakdi
on Monday in Hannover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The World Agricultural Conference opened on Sunday in Hannover,
the capitol of the state of Lower Saxony. Supachai made a speech
on the conference and pointed out the world trade agreement only
made sense if they provided jobs and improved living standards in
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said it was quite important that the world trade is
opened up to agricultural produce from the developing countries.
He warned also that the terms of trade deals already completed
could not be fulfilled by all developing countries at the same
pace. Because some countries cannot cancel their subsidies or
increase import quotas within prescribed time.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that the trade agreements could not decline the
unemployment in developing countries. "There must be wrong with
the trade agreements" if trade did not create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Director-General of the WTO is Mike Moore, a New
Zealander and Supachai Panitchpakti will take over in September
2002.

<HEADLINE> Floods Continue in South Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Floods continue raging with the
rivers of Shabelleh and Jubba bursting their banks, devastating
entire villages and farmlands in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
River Shabelleh has crushed its banks on 12 new points around
Jowhar and Mahadday in Middle Shabelleh region.
</P>
<P>
According to the local authorities, the floods seriously
affected 23 villages and displaced more than 7,194 families who
are now scattered in the towns of Jowhar, Balad and villages which
still remain above the water levels without food, shelter or
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Nur Hassan, acting governor of the region, declared that
the regional capital of Jowhar, 90 kilometers north of Mogadishu,
was on the brink of becoming an island as the flood waters got
closer to the town from every direction by the day.
</P>
<P>
The floods have already cut the road linking Jowhar town to the
central regions including its immediate neighbor Hiran region.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also devastated farmlands exceeding 21,500
hectares in the region.
</P>
<P>
The floods are also endangering the road linking Jowhar town to
 Mogadishu, with the flood water in distance of less than 500
meters from the main road.
</P>
<P>
If this economically vital road is cut, Jowhar town will be
left with only one very sandy road for its connection with the
capital. Jowhar town depends much of its essential supplies on
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Jubba River, the largest in Somalia, has inundated more than 40
square kilometers between the towns of Jilib and Jamama of Middle
and Lower Jubba regions.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of villages and thousands of hectares of farmlands have
been washed away.
</P>
<P>
The floods from Jubba River have already caused serious
economic setback for the southern port city of Kismayu, 500
kilometers south of Mogadishu, after the flood waters cut off the
road linking the capital to Kismayu.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 Eritrean Refugees Cross Border to Sudan: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- About 30,000 Eritreans have been
registered in refugee camps along the Sudanese border since the
fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia resumed more than two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Latest information from the Nairobi Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Monday that the figure as
of Monday morning included 630 Eritreans, mostly women and
children, who arrived over the weekend at the Gerghef and Omsafir
crossings.
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrivals in the Sudan said they fled ahead of the
advancing Ethiopian forces and preferred to stay in border
encampments to await news from their villages.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva, UNHCR announced Monday it had approved an allocation
of 1.4 million U.S. dollars from its emergency fund for the relief
operation in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency said it had so far delivered more than 1,700
tents to the Sudanese Commission on Refugees for distribution to
the arrivals in the extremely hot and arid region.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR office here also said that around 350 mostly Eritrean
refugees had arrived in Yemen by small boats across the Red Sea.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Rebuilds First Bridge Over Danube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Traffic over the Danube River in
Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, was resumed after a rail and road bridge was
rebuilt and opened to traffic Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new bridge is a major accomplishment of Yugoslavia's
reconstruction, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told some
150,000 people who gathered to mark the completion of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Europe should be proud of Yugoslavia's reconstruction and be
ashamed of the disaster brought about by NATO's aggression last
year.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, who took a train on Monday through the bridge to
arrive in Novi Sad, suggested that the bridge be named after
Bossko Perossevic, chairman of the executive committee of
Vojvodina Autonomous Province, who was assassinated on May 13.
</P>
<P>
The 432.5-meter-long bridge is located 75 meters upstream from
the original bridge, which was destroyed during NATO's air strikes.
With rails in the middle of the 4.5-meter-wide lanes and sidewalks,
passengers can travel by train from Belgrade to Novi Sad, and then
to Budapest and Port Solun, Greece.
</P>
<P>
During last year's NATO bombing, all three of the bridges over
the Danube in Novi Sad were destroyed. Ruins from the bridges
blocked international shipping via the Danube for almost one year.
</P>
<P>
Before the bridge was completed, monthly losses for Yugoslavia,
due to the disruption of transportation, were estimated to be as
high as 7 million marks (3.3 million U.S. dollars).

PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The French Foreign Ministry on Monday
asked all French nationals to leave temporarily the capital of the
South Pacific island nation of Fiji because of the tension there
caused by a coup d'etat attempt.
</P>
<P>
"After taking into account the recent evolution of the
situation in Suva, capital of Fiji, our ambassador has recommended
to our compatriots, whose presence there is not indispensable, to
leave for the time being the Fijian capital and to stay away from
the places of demonstration or rally," said the foreign ministry
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
France has also been following closely the situation in Fiji
and has reinforced security at the French embassy in Suva, it said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Fijian army, Frank Bainimarama, has declared a
martial law in Fiji and taken over the executive power, eleven
days after some armed civilians took hostage the country's prime
minister, Mahendra Chaudhry.

<HEADLINE> French Minister Backs Germany's European Federation Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- French minister of economy, finance
and industry, Laurent Fabius, on Monday expressed his support for
the German proposal to build a European federation.
</P>
<P>
Fabius, who was former prime minister and speaker of the
National Assembly, said the proposal, made two weeks ago by German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, was positive, although it should
be discussed by France and Germany and backed by all European
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Fischer has posed the real questions for the future, even
though he used the taboo word of federalism," said Fabius at a
conference on international monetary issues in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no answers without a unified Europe or a close
consultation, especially between Paris and Berlin," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fabius also said that former French president Charles de Gaulle
predicted in the 1960s that in 50 years Europe would have a
federation.
</P>
<P>
"In 2007, the Treaty of Rome will celebrate precisely its 50th
anniversary. It would be a beautiful ambition for our generation
to prepare from now the adequate political structure of Europe
with its economic and monetary force," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a French minister publicly supported the
proposal. It came one week after the Fischer proposal was
violently attacked by French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement said on May 21 that Fisher's proposal shows that
Germany has not been cured of Nazism and that Germany is always
dreaming of a Holy Roman-Germanic Empire.

<HEADLINE> Three Serbs Shot Dead by Albanian Terrorist in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- An ethnic Albanian terrorist
opened fire on a group of Serbs in Kosovo on Sunday night, killing
three people and injuring two others, Yugoslavia's state news
agency Tanjug reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The dead include a four-year-old child, said Tanjug. The two
injured were sent to a hospital close to a military base of U.S.
troops.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place in a village shared by Albanians and
Serbs in the region of Gnjilane in the southeastern part of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force in Kosovo confirmed on Monday that a
group of U.S. troops were patrolling several hundred meters away
from the shooting venue. The U.S. soldiers did not return fire and
the Albanian fled after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Since the NATO-led peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo in June last
year, there have been 4,511 violent incidents against ethnic Serbs,
which resulted in 888 deaths.

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Entry to Boost S. Korea's Trade Surplus: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) is expected to help increase South Korea's
trade surplus with China by more than one billion U.S. dollars a
year, a South Korean government think tank predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy believes
South Korea's exports to China will increase to 3.2 to 5.5 billion
dollars every year while imports will go up to 2.1 to 3.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports of transport equipment, textiles and garments to China
will soar, said the South Korean government think tank in its
report on the impact of China's WTO entry and the economic ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It said, however, the exports of chemicals, timber, paper,
metal products, machinery and equipment will see less-than-
impressive growth.
</P>
<P>
The institute urged South Korean companies to make greater
efforts to gain a larger share of the growing Chinese markets,
especially in goods distribution, advertising, sales consulting,
finance, communications and construction.
</P>
<P>
However, the think tank said, for the long-term, South Korea's
exports will be affected since China will attract more foreign
investments after its entry into the world trade body.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua)-- The following are highlights of
diplomatic news items Xinhua released today:
</P>
<P>
China, India Agree to Work for Settlement of Border Issue
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Indian President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan agreed here today to work for an early and proper
settlement of the border issue between the world's two most
populous countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in talks with the Indian president who arrived here
Sunday for a 7-day state visit that it will take time and patience
on the part of both sides to settle the border issue left over
from the past. He said China has always taken a positive approach
toward the settlement of this issue.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two sides can constantly create a good
atmosphere on the basis of mutual concession and mutual adjustment,
the spirit of understanding that has been reached between leaders
of the two countries, and seek a fair and reasonable solution to
the issue through negotiations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Makes 4-Point Proposal on Sino-Indian Relations
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made a four-point proposal here
Monday for the development of China-India relations during talks
with Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan, who is on a 7-day
state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's first point is to increase visits between personnel of
the two countries to increase mutual understanding and trust.
Along with high-level official visits between the two countries,
various levels of contacts in different forms should also be
actively conducted between parties, parliaments, business circles,
the media, academics, and non-governmental organizations of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The second point is to expand trade and economic cooperation,
and lay a more solid foundation for the bilateral relationship.
There is great potential for bilateral trade and economic
cooperation, and the two sides should make efforts to explore new
channels to exchange market information, and encourage
entrepreneurs in mutual investment, with the aim of bringing two-
way trade and economic cooperation to new highs.
</P>
<P>
The third point is to strengthen coordination and cooperation
in international affairs, and make joint efforts for the
establishment of a just and reasonable new international political
and economic order. Coordination and cooperation will also serve
the lawful interests and rights of the developing countries, and
the promotion of world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's fourth point is to properly handle issues left over
from the past in the spirit of seeking common ground while
reserving differences. This does not mean shelving disputes
forever, nor does it mean developing bilateral relations only
after all disputes are completely resolved. The two sides should
start from their common interests, transcend some disputes, and
push forward bilateral relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China will improve the safety of
children's bikes and toys following the a survey that showed that
nearly half of those products were faulty.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision said
today it plans to urge local government departments in charge of
quality and technical supervision to strengthen their supervision
over the production and marketing of these products.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey on children's bikes and toys conducted shows
that only 55.6 percent of all bikes and toys are up to state
standards, the Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The survey sampled 81 varieties of products manufactured by 46
factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong,
Henan and Jiangsu, all leading producers of children's bikes and
toys in China.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Scholar Discovers Ten Major Benefits of Peaceful Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" here will
publish a signed article Tuesday deliberating on 10 major benefits
of a peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Kongli, the author of the article, wrote the 10 major
benefits as follows:
</P>
<P>
First, Chinese compatriots living on the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits will enjoy emotional harmony. If a war breaks out
between the two sides, the people of the two sides will be the
mostly affected, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Second, the people of the two sides will enjoy safety,
stability and peace. The people living in Taiwan will no longer
worry about wars and instability.
</P>
<P>
Without peaceful reunification, the status of Taiwan is not
stable and any separatist words and activities might lead to wars,
the article warns.
</P>
<P>
Third, after peaceful reunification, Taiwan compatriots will
enjoy, together with their compatriots living on the mainland, the
reputation and dignity of China as a big power in the world.
</P>
<P>
While enjoying a high degree of autonomy, Taiwan people will
also take seat in the National People's Congress, the parliament,
and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the
top advisory body, and enter the central government as leading
members, the article says.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fourth, the two sides will enjoy economic cooperation
beneficial and complementary to each other, while the two sides of
the Straits as well as Hong Kong and Macao could be turned into a
mammoth economic entity in East Asia, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the legal rights of the Chinese people across the
Straits will be better protected in personnel exchanges, working,
investment, trade, schooling and marriage.
</P>
<P>
After reunification, China will make laws that can better
protect the interests of compatriots from the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, a unified China will become an unprecedented power with
an increasingly enhanced international status. When China
achieves reunification, it will establish diplomatic ties with
almost all countries and regions and participate with almost all
international organizations in the world, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan people will have an even larger space in the
international arena. And Taiwan people can, with suitable status,
join international organizations and the Chinese delegation to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has suffered from a so-called issue of "international
space," but it is not a result of the pressure from the mainland
but a result of the worldwide recognition on the One-China
principle, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Seventh, a peaceful reunification will save a huge amount of
money being used for defense purposes for the both sides. The
article further suggests that the military forces of the two sides
can be mutually complementary and join hands in defending the
motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
It will be beneficial to the welfare of the Taiwan people if
the island could save part of its annual defense expenditure by
more than 10 billion US dollars, the articles says.
</P>
<P>
Eighth, the two sides are mutually complementary in the field
of science and technology. A unified China could help the
mainland implement its strategy of developing science and
technology and Taiwan could launch its "science island" program.
</P>
<P>
Ninth, after peaceful reunification, there will be no longer
any block for exchanges between the two sides, which will be of
great importance in rejuvenating the Chinese nation, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the article believes that a unified China will greatly
contribute to peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
The article emphasizes the huge financial benefits brought
about by the peaceful reunification of China as well as the
unlimited potential for future cooperation between the two sides
in politics, international relations, and culture and education.
</P>
<P>
It quotes late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as once saying, "We
should jointly strive for the reunification of the motherland and
the rejuvenation of the Nation."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan people should make their proposals on the benefits they
want from the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Any
rational proposal will be negotiable under the One-China principle,
the article says, echoing the Chinese government's stance on the
issue.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel blew up one of its military
outposts along the Lebanese border on Monday to win United Nations
verification that it has withdrawn totally from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Tziporen outpost was blown up... as part of the
redeployment on the border," an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
The outpost, about ten kilometers from the northern town of

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows Not to Allow Philippines' Dismemberment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
stressed Monday that he will not allow the dismemberment of the
Philippines as the government and secessionist rebels resume peace
talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the president reminded the government panel of
its four-point agenda while urging the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front(MILF) not to waste this chance at peace.
</P>
<P>
"We are one nation. We are also a multi-cultural society. Every
Filipino, Christian or Muslim, is the equal, in law and in fact,
of every other Filipino," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government's four-point agenda in the peace
talks are:
</P>
<P>
-- The government shall continue to pursue peace negotiations
with the MILF within the framework of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
-- The government shall assert and uphold its authority under
the constitution, to preserve territorial integrity, maintain law
and order and protect the civilian population, through effective
military and police actions.
</P>
<P>
-- The government shall vigorously pursue socioeconomic
development programs in Muslim areas including those in the MILF
area of influence.
</P>
<P>
-- The government shall continue with the full and effective
implementation of the Government-Moro National Liberation Front (
MNIF)Peace Agreement as a commitment and proof of its sincerity
and goodwill, to resolve the Mindanao problem politically.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has also ordered an immediate end to any
move by local government units that tend to restrict the free
movement and commerce of Muslims in the country.
</P>
<P>
This includes, Estrada said, the issuance of identification
cards and additional registration requirements only for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Government and MILF negotiators are scheduled to resume peace
talks in Cotabato City on Tuesday, after the MILF agreed to the
government's proposal to go back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno, for
his part, said the arrest of 26 suspected MILF sympathizers in
connection with two mall bombings this month will not hamper the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
Muslim state in Mindanao for more than two decades. Another major
Muslim group, MNIF, signed a peace agreement with the government
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Former President Put Under House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's former President
Soeharto was put under house arrest Monday, according to spokesman
Yushar Yahya of the Attorney General's Office (AGO).
</P>
<P>
"As of today, Soeharto's status has been shifted from city
arrest to house arrest," Yahya told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the house arrest would expire on June 11, but could be
extended another 30 days if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 78, had been under city arrest and banned from
leaving the country since early April and he underwent several
investigations at his residence for corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the AGO is considering to move the former ruler
to a secure state-protected location.
</P>
<P>
But Yahya said no appropriate alternative location had been
found.
</P>
<P>
"After we met the police, we found that moving him will create
problems. If we move him to another place, that place will become
restless. So we decided to find the most conducive place for the
probe and for his health, which is (his current home)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is suspected of abusing power and authority by issuing
decrees and government regulations to amass funds through seven
tax-free charity foundations he set up and chaired during his 32
years in power.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has pledged that Soeharto
will be brought to justice before August 10 or before his city
arrest status expires.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, student protesters demanding that Soeharto stand
trial immediately have clashed several times with riot police near
Soeharto's residence in central Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Sees Increase in One-Horned Rhinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to conservation efforts,
the number of one-horned rhinoceros in Nepal has increased to 612
from fewer than 100 more than 30 years ago, Nepali ecologists said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in rhino population shows great success in the
conservation of the endangered species," Thirtha Maskey, director
general of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife
Conservation(DNPWC), told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Maskey said Nepal began serious rhinos conservation in 1973,
when the Nepali government enacted National Park and Wildlife
Conservation Act and prohibited poaching of rhinos.
</P>
<P>
The act stipulates that anyone who kills one rhino will be
subjected to a maximum of 15 years of imprisonment plus a fine of
100,000 rupees (more than 1,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent the sharp decrease of the endangered rhinos,
the government also set up 15 rhinos conservation areas and
regular patrols were arranged to prevent poaching, said Maskey.
</P>
<P>
The number of one-horned rhinos dropped from more than 800 in
the 1950s to fewer than 100 in 1973, due to lack of reservation
areas, rampant poaching and habitat destruction, said Narendra
Pradhan, an ecologist with DNPWC.
</P>
<P>
"Large numbers of people living in northern hills emigrated to
Chitawan plains in southern Nepal and destroyed rhinos habitat,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Listed as endangered species by the Convention on International
Trade of Endangered Wild Fauna and Flora, one-horned rhinos can
only be found in Nepal and India. The total number of the animal
stands at around 2,000.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Seek Urgent Talks on Fiji Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia would seek urgent talks
with Fijian Army Commander Frank Bainimarama who has declared
martial law and assumed executive control of the troubled Pacific
island nation, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Downer said details of the latest developments in Fiji were
still sketchy.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the military have taken control," Downer told the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation television.
</P>
<P>
He said he would seek to speak to Bainimarama as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we will do our best to communicate with him, of
course we'll try to," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're not exactly sure where President Ratu Mara is, but the
indication is that he has ceded power to the military," Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether he's done so willingly or not also isn't entirely
clear," he added.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia still insists on a return to the
constitution and full democracy in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama's move to assume power came just two days after
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara appointed himself as the country'
s interim ruler and dismissed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and
his government.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, has been
held at gun-point in the nation's parliament by coup leader George
Speight since May 19.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Official Urges Reduction of Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tanzanian official
has made a suggestion to reduce by 30 percent of technical
assistance from donor countries in a bid to save foreign exchange
to hire skilled Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
Aloyse Mushi, director of the Tanzania Private Sector
Foundation, told a meeting by representatives of donor countries
in Dar es Salaam at the weekend that the cost of foreign experts
has reached "extraordinary disproportion" and ought to be reduced
considerably, newspapers here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mushi, who was reading the business sector's statement on donor
support to Tanzania, said that the cost of foreign experts had now
become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
"In Tanzania, for example, the total cost of technical
assistance in 1998 was some 300 million U.S. dollars, of which at
least 200 million dollars represented the salaries, housing
allowances, air travel and other direct costs of the 1,000 or so
international experts provided as the core of technical
assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, the total salary cost of the whole civil service
in Tanzania in the same year, including administrators, clerical
staff, teachers and health workers was just 100 million U.S.
dollars," he added.
</P>
<P>
There were hundreds of unemployed skilled Tanzanian
professionals who could do the same work that the foreign experts
were hired to do at more economical costs.
</P>
<P>
"Let's help Tanzania aim at generating wealth and we shall have
removed poverty and disease. Let's start by using effectively the
cheapest already available resource which is the people of
Tanzania," Mushi said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a pity that graduates are roaming the streets, local
consultants have nothing to do, up-coming businessmen are not
incubated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank Country Director for Tanzania, James Adams,
agreed that donors and the government ought to sit down and
discuss the issue of technical assistance.

<HEADLINE> Polish Prime Minister Rejects Withdrawal of Coalition Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on
Monday rejected resignations of five ministers from the Freedom
Union (UW), a partner of his Solidarity-led ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The five UW ministers, including deputy prime minister and
finance minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, and Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz, tendered their
resignations earlier Monday following a decision of the UW's
executive council to withdraw from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to stop cooperation with Buzek's Solidarity
Election Action (AWS) amidst a row for vital economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The UW is unhappy with Buzek's inability to discipline maverick
Solidarity lawmakers, who have on several occasions voted against
the government's own economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are considered crucial to prepare Poland for its
entry into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Buzek on Monday told journalists that he had rejected the
resignations and called for immediate talks with the UW.
</P>
<P>
"I won't force them to stay, but I believe tendering their
resignations like this is highly irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the minister to continue their work.
</P>
<P>
Balcerowicz, who heads the UW, did not rule out the possibility
of renewing alliance with the AWS on Sunday, but said such a
renewal must be under a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement could be reached between the two sides, the
Solidarity bloc may try to form a minority government. Otherwise,
it faces early elections.
</P>
<P>
The Solidarity bloc controls 185 of the 460 seats in the lower
house.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Construction Fundamental To Development Of Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China is taking measures to
reinforce infrastructure construction in a drive to implement its
strategy of developing its western regions on a large-scale.
</P>
<P>
The backward infrastructure has long hindered development of
these regions, prompting the Chinese government to prioritize
infrastructure construction there.
</P>
<P>
Ten projects involving transportation, water conservancy, and
environmental protection have been approved by the central
government along with funds.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that investment in the western regions
between January and April this year amounted to 53.3 billion yuan
(6.42 billion U.S. dollars), surging 10.9 percent on an annual
basis. Increase of funds channeled to infrastructure construction
was 2.9 percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The government has also planned a substantial increase in
transportation and water conservancy projects in the near future.
</P>
<P>
This year, 20 airports in the west will be renovated and
rebuilt, with an estimated investment of five billion yuan,
according to the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the next decade, new roads totaling 150,000 km will be built
which will eventually provide arteries to villages in the region.
</P>
<P>
Huge amount of investment will also be poured into the railway
sector in the next 20 years, crucial to the long-term strategy of
reviving China's western regions.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police formally
commissioned five ultra-high-speed interceptor boats Monday in an
effort to stage more effective attacks on marine criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
"The vessels have been designed with input from Anti-Smuggling
Task Force (ASTF) personnel based on hard-won experience gained
over the years," said Hui Ki-on, commissioner of police, at the
commissioning ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five crew members with their speed boats, named Damen
Cougartek Sea Stalker 1500, conducted a 30-minute exercise joined
by an aircraft of the Government Flying Service after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Specially built to cope with extremely hazardous and
challenging working conditions, the boats are fast and highly
maneuverable for the crew to operate with up-to-date electronic
navigation and communications systems.
</P>
<P>
The new vessels, costing 7.5 million HK dollars (960,000 U.S.
dollars) each, were designed by the UK-based company Cougartek and
built in the Netherlands by Damen Shipyards with American engines.
</P>
<P>
Measuring 14.77 meters in length and with the hull made of
marine-grade aluminum, the vessels were optimized for traversing
heavy waves at a speed of more than 60 knots.
</P>
<P>
On the safety front, they are fitted with high freeboards which
can provide greater protection to crew members when the sea is
rough.
</P>
<P>
With the new vessels, the marine police of Hong Kong has seized
27 speedboats of criminals and more than 20 million HK dollars (2.
6 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
The ASTF was formed in 1991 to combat rampant smuggling of
stolen vehicles and other contraband by high-speed smuggling
vessels.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Turkey Ties Cannot Be Sabotaged: Turkish Envoy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish ambassador to Iran Turan
Morali said here Monday that the ties between Tehran and Ankara can
not be sabotaged by any third party.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of Iranian and Turkish businessmen, the
ambassador also urged the two neighbors to utilize their common
historical and cultural backgrounds to improve bilateral relations,
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Turkey soured recently over Turkish
press accusations that Iran had been involved in the murder of two
Turkish intellectuals for their outspoken support of Turkey's
secular system which Iran opposes.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also accused Iran of giving shelter to Turkish
separatists, and its police arrested hundreds of Iranians in Ankara
and Istanbul a week ago on various charges, which have sparked
strong protest from Iran, who believes that Israel was behind all
the accusations in order to sabotage Iranian-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not recognize the Israeli regime and calls for armed
struggle with the "entity" to get back all occupied Arab and
Islamic lands. It is also unhappy over military cooperation between
Turkey and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Morali, who have been summoned twice by the Iranian Foreign
Ministry for protest recently, regretted that certain section of
the Iranian and Turkish press have gone to extremes in advocating
their governments which pursue different systems, causing tension
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the press in the two countries for suffering from
a chronic disease of misunderstanding and accused them of
publishing baseless reports which damage the trade relations
between the two countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that trade volume between the two countries has
decreased sharply over the past few years, the ambassador hoped
that the current conference of the Turkish and Iranian businessmen
would serve as a prelude to better trade cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of Iran's Chamber of Commerce, Industries
and Mines Ali-Naqi Khamoushi urged both Iran and Turkey not to let
any political tension damage trade and economic cooperation, IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a 140-member Turkish economic delegation, he
stressed that the two countries should consider bilateral trade
cooperation as a lasting affair.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed regret over the low level of trade volume
between the two countries, which stood at only 793 million U.S.
dollars during the past Iranian year (ending on March 19), a sharp
decline from the figure in 1980s which topped 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation, headed by Turkish Under-Secretary for
Foreign Trade Kursad Tuzmen, arrived in Tehran on Sunday with an
expected aim of mending fences between the two countries and
expanding trade exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Manila Works for Wholesale Release of 21 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it will work for the wholesale release of the 21
hostages, mostly foreigners, whom the extremist Abu Sayyaf seized
from a dive resort in Malaysia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing in the Presidential Palace, chief
government negotiator Secretary Robert Aventajado, who also heads
the presidential flagship projects committee, said this was
President Joseph Estrada's latest directive to him.
</P>
<P>
"He reiterated his earlier instruction to work for a 'global
release'. The thrust is to have the hostages released, all of them
at the same time. There will be one negotiation, one bargain for
their release," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is hard to set a timetable for the release of
the hostages, saying it would depend on the conduct of the rest of
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said his team started formal negotiations Saturday
in Talipao of the southern Sulu Province, with four leaders of the
Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The panels discussed three demands presented by the hostage
takers,which include the creation of an independent Islamic state
and the establishment of a Sabah Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said the third involves the prevention of foreign and
domestic trawlers from operating in Sulu Sea and the other parts
of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
While the government flatly rejected the first demand,
Aventajado said they would discuss the second, but stressed that
this would be"in accordance with existing Philippine laws and
subject to cooperation of the Malaysian government."
</P>
<P>
As for the third proposal, he said, the government can work
with them in this particular concern, "subject to existing laws."
</P>
<P>
Aventajado is scheduled to fly back to Sulu on Tuesday or
Wednesday to continue the negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Gold Exploitation Rampant in North Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 gold panners from
various countries including Tanzania, Malawi, Burundi have been
illegally extracting gold in Impapa in the northern Mozambican
province of Niassa, and the local authorities are unable to
control the situation, "Noticias" daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Niassa provincial director of mineral resources and energy
Arzidio Matsinhe could not give an exact estimate of the amount of
gold extracted and illegally exported.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet been able to gather data to allow us to
estimate the amount of gold produced each day or each month, but I
can assure you that large amounts of this metal are crossing the
border," he said.
</P>
<P>
Matsinhe also failed to give the number of prospectors involved
in the illegal extraction of gold in Impapa, saying "there are
various groups that are scattered in the bush searching for the
precious metal, but unfortunately, we cannot control them". But he
was convinced the total number could be more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that 37 licenses for gold prospection have been issued
since 1993 when the Impapa deposits were discovered. These
licenses are held mainly by Mozambican citizens, but some foreign
companies, particularly South African ones, have also been
authorized to exploit the Impapa gold.
</P>
<P>
However, illegal prospection started almost as soon as the gold
was discovered.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1990s, the provincial government dispatched a police
team to " check the situation but that was impossible, and the
illegal activity went on, which led us to think of other methods
to discipline the activity", said Matsinhe.
</P>
<P>
"Some private operators were licensed to occupy the area that
was being exploited illegally, to try and ensure that the gold
reserves could be exploited in an orderly manner", he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that, because of difficult access to the site, one
of the licensed companies, the South African "Kenn Miner",
suspended its operations.
</P>
<P>
Matsinhe could not estimate the amount of gold existing in
Impapa, but he said "we hope that with the completion of the
rehabilitation work on the road to Lupiliche, we will make an
assessment of the real potential".
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has never had official estimates of its gold
reserves believed to be rich in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
Gold panners must sell gold to the state and the Mozambican
government purchased 1,541 kilograms of gold in 1998, however, the
amount of smuggled gold was never known.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's central bank on Monday
announced rate cuts of a half percentage points for one-day
commercial loans and interbank loans, Czech Republic media
reported.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate for one-day commercial loans will be cut to 7
percent from 7.5 percent, while the interbank loan rate will be
reduced to 10 percent from 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate cuts are effective on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the central bank decided that from July 1 on,
the minimum amount of cash reserves for deposit in the country's
banks will be reduced from 10 percent to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in 5 years that the country has reduced
interest rates and relaxed its currency policy.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the reduction of interest rates will help boost
domestic demand and stimulate exports.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, Slovakia has pursued a tight currency policy
with high interest rates. While having helped control inflation,
the stiff policy also resulted in a shortage of loans and funds,
reduced production, thus weakening exports and domestic demands.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Fights Against Water Shortage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING May 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has begun a war against a
water supply crisis described as the fourth most serious one since
it became the capital of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Last year the city received only 349 mm of precipitation,
accounting for only 60 percent of the normal amount. As a result,
the 16 large and medium-sized reservoirs around Beijing were short
of 800 million cubic meters of water, enough for all Beijing
residents to use for over a year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, underground water in the Beijing area has dropped
2.3 meters in the past months due to an ongoing drought.
</P>
<P>
"The city is now experiencing its fourth water shortage in the
past half a century. We must do something to ensure water supply
to its 13 million residents," experts attending a recent meeting
said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The city's decision-makers are also concerned about the issue.
Earlier this month, major officials with the Beijing municipal
government gathered to discuss 26 measures suggested to deal with
the water shortage problem.

"We will open more water sources, save more water, protect the
water quality and use water more wisely," said Liu Qi, mayor of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We will use more recycled water and make full use of other
water resources like rainfall and flood," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, Beijing will make the Guanting
Reservoir in suburban Beijing another major water source as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
At present the city's drinking water mainly comes from
underground water and the Miyun Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Major measures to resolve water shortages in the capital
include building five new sewage plants, adopting water-saving
taps and banning illegal car wash services.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can save 150 million cubic meters of water within
two or three years," said Liu Qi.
</P>
<P>
Located in the relatively dry north China, Beijing lacks water
resources. An average Beijinger only has 300 cubic meters of water
to use each year.

<P>
The waste of water resources also leads to Beijing's water
shortage. A latest survey showed that millions of tons of water is
being wasted in the city every year due to bad-quality faucets and
lavatories.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the growing population and dry climate factors,
water pollution also contributes to Beijing's water woes, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that Beijing's water use has
increased 40 times since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the city will need five billion tons of
water by 2005, 5.4 billion tons by 2010, two billion tons more
than the city's present water supply.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, Beijing has experienced three water emergencies.
One was during the mid-1960s, another in the mid-70s, and the
third at the beginning of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is not the only city which has scarce water. According
to a latest official figure, some 400 of China's 668 cities are
facing water shortages, and of the 400, more than 100 are
seriously threatened by water shortages.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly half of China's rivers and over 90 percent
of its urban water resources have been polluted.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-Up: Japan Urged to Honor One China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that Japan should honor the one China principle, properly
handle the Taiwan issue, and open up the future of Sino-Japanese
friendly relations in the spirit of drawing on lessons from
history.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in a meeting with the secretaries-general

</P>
<P>
Hiromu Nonaka of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party told Zhu that
on the Taiwan issue, the Japanese government will strictly adhere

which he said remains steadfast and unchanged.
</P>
<P>

Party, and Takeshi Noda of the New Conservative Party, arrived in
China earlier today for a two-day goodwill visit at the invitation
of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>

China through direct negotiations, Nonaka said, noting that Japan
will make efforts to earnestly strengthen its good-neighborly
relations with China in the spirit of drawing on lessons from

preparations for the visit.
</P>

Zhu expressed the hope that the new Japanese cabinet headed by
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori will, as ever, work to promote the
overall development of Sino-Japanese relations.

<P>
He said that the development of China-Japan relations has
maintained momentum on the whole, and a series of important
understandings reached between President Jiang Zemin and late

achievements already realized in certain fields.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's New Development Strategy Beneficial to Ethnic Minorities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's strategy to develop the
western region on a large scale is an important historic step
toward the common prosperity of Chinese people of all ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Li Dezhu, minister in charge of the State Ethnic Affairs
Commission, airs this view in an article in the latest issue of a
leading Chinese biweekly "Seeking Truth" to be published on June 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, titled "Great Development of the West
and the Ethnic Issue in Our Country," western China is the
birthplace of the Chinese nation and also the area most densely
populated with the ethnic minorities who have made remarkable
contributions to national unity.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, the Communist Party of China
and the government have attached great importance to the issue of
unbalanced development between the east and the west. The first
generation of leadership with Mao Zedong at the core began to deal
with this issue in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, a large number of factories were removed to the
western region from the east to become the first group of modern
industries in the west.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the third generation of leadership with Jiang Zemin
at the core proposed the strategy of developing the western region
on a large scale for inheriting and developing the socialist cause
with China's own characteristics, as initiated by the second
generation of leadership headed by Deng Xiaoping, the minister
says in the article.
</P>
<P>
Li says that the new development strategy is of great
importance for dealing with the ethnic issue in China, and he
urges unified thinking toward the decision and arrangements made
by the central leadership.

<HEADLINE> China's New Development Strategy Beneficial to Ethnic Minorities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the article, at a national conference on ethnic
work held last year, Jiang Zemin said that since the founding of
the People's Republic of China, the country has carried out two
major tasks in dealing with the issue of ethnic minorities. One
is to lead liberated people of different ethnic groups to take the
socialist road through changing the social system, and the other
is to speed up economic and social development for minority people
and in areas densely populated by ethnic minorities, so as to push
forward the common prosperity of all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The first historic task had been completed through democratic
reform and socialist transformation in the ethnic minority areas,
while great progress has been made in implementing the second task,
as the productivity in ethnic areas has been greatly enhanced,
their social and cultural fields remarkably developed, and living
standards largely improved, the article says.
</P>
<P>
However, the imbalance between the development of the Han, the
majority ethnic group in China, and ethnic minority groups is a
legacy of history, and has not been completely eliminated, the
article says. It has been a problem affecting and obstructing the
resolution of the ethnic issue in the initial stage of socialism,
it says.
</P>
<P>
Consolidating and developing the socialist ethnic relationship
must be given a very important place in the strategy of developing
the west, Li proposes.
</P>
<P>
He calls for taking note of several aspects of the ethnic issue
in the western region, including some historic legacies, the
impact of religions, disputes over resources, cultural and
language barriers, and separatists supported by foreign forces. (

<P>
According to the minister, the implementation of the strategy
to speed up the development in the west will result in the
formation of a national market to strengthen the concentration of
the great family of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Li stresses that the relationship between the general interests
of the state and the interests of minority groups and areas
densely populated by ethnic minorities must be correctly handled
during development of the west.
</P>
<P>
These underdeveloped areas have some special interests that
need special care, Li says. While safeguarding the general
interests of the state, the special interests of ethnic minorities
must be cared for in order to demonstrate the advantages of
socialism, he says.
</P>
<P>
The development strategy has turn the long dream of people
living in the west into reality, which is of boundless beneficence
to the development of the whole country as well as the ethnic
minorities, the minister says.
</P>
<P>
He goes on to call for legal protection of the strategy. A
number of laws and regulations must be stipulated, validating the
preferential policies for the development of ethnic minorities and
ethnic areas in the form of law, he says.
</P>
<P>
The State Ethnic Affairs Commission will take up its
responsibilities in developing the western region, according to
the minister.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court to Rule on Lebanese Guerrilla Leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese guerrilla leaders,
held by Israel for years as "bargaining chips" for missing Israeli
servicemen, appeared in open court Monday, with verdict to be
issued in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Judge Uri Goren of the Tel Aviv District Court said that he
would rule on the fate of Mustafa Dirani and Sheikh Abdel Karim
Obeid on July 12 unless the government decides to release them.
</P>
<P>
The open court hearing was held on Monday for the first time
since they were spirited away from Lebanon by Israeli commandos,
for all previous hearings were held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, a former Hezbollah religious leader, was caught by
Israeli commandos from his home in southern Lebanon in 1989, while
Dirani, the former Amal security chief, was seized by Israel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
They are being held as bargaining chips by Israel to discover
the fate of missing Israeli servicemen in Lebanon, particular
airforce navigator Ron Arad whose plane was downed in Lebanon in
1986.
</P>
<P>
During the court hearing, state attorney Dvora Hen said that
Dirani and Obeid pose a danger to Israeli security because they
were leaders of a "terrorist movement."
</P>
<P>
However, Hen said, that the two men could be freed by July 17 if
Israel decided not to extend their administrative detention -- a
method used by Israel to keep people in jail without charge or
trial.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, along with other resistance group such as Amal, have
been fighting to end Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The hearing came a day after United Nations envoy to the Middle
East Terje Larsen asked Israeli government to free all Lebanese
detainees, following Israel's troop withdrawal from south Lebanon
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Larsen was here on Sunday to prepare his report on the Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, supported by Iran and Syria, has vowed to continue to
fight until Israel gives up more land and free all Lebanese
prisoners from its jails. The Lebanese government echoed the
Hezbollah demand.  Last month, the Israeli supreme court ordered
the release of 13 Lebanese.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Presidential Election Slated for July 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
Speaker Avraham Burg announced on Monday that the Knesset will hold
a secret ballot on July 31 to choose a new president to succeed
outgoing President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
The new president will be sworn in a day after the election on
August 1, before the Knesset begins its summer recession on August
4, a statement issued by Burg's office said.
</P>
<P>
The election was put into parliament's schedule after 76-year-
old Weizman informed Burg Saturday night that he will resign by
July 11.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, whose second-term as president ends in 2003, was forced
to leave the post ahead of schedule after the revelation of his
financial irregularities with a French Jewish businessman and the
subsequent police investigations.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and State Attorney
Edna Arbel published a report on the case last week, saying the
president had behaved in an improper manner by accepting more than
300,000 U.S. dollars from French textile tycoon Edouard Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
After Rubinstein said he decided to close the investigation
against Weizman and not recommend to indict him only because the
statute of limitations on the charges had run out, calls for
Weizman's resignation reached a crescendo.
</P>
<P>
The president, who had implied his resignation even before the
financial scandal due to deteriorating health, made the final
decision Saturday night after consulting with Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and all the president's confidants.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, Burg, who is also the vice-president,
will serve as acting president during the interim period between
Weizman's resignation on July 11 and the inauguration of a new
president on August 1.
</P>
<P>
There are currently two leading runners in the campaign for the
presidential post - former Prime Minister and current Regional
Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres, a senior political figure of the
left-wing Labor Party, and former Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav,
who was a Knesset member from the opposition Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Although Barak and Peres are at odds for a long time, the prime
minister made clear in recent days that his support for Peres'
candidacy was unwavering.
</P>
<P>
Barak and his One Israel coalition Chairman Ra'anan Cohen
reportedly agreed on Sunday that Peres' candidacy would be
validated by the party's board on June 2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Likud will convene Monday afternoon to formally
name Katsav as its candidate for the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
A survey published by local newspaper The Jerusalem Post on
Monday showed that Peres is now holding ballots from as many as 53
of the 120 Knesset members, in contrast with an estimated 38 for
Katsav.
</P>
<P>
However, most analysts believe that Katsav still has chances, as
the deciding votes will come from 17 Knesset members of the ultra-
Orthodox religious Shas party, and Katsav has a possible advantage
for being considered as a religious man.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres also enjoys good personal relations with Shas's
spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who will make the final
decision about which candidate the party will support.

through direct negotiations, Nonaka said, noting that Japan will
make efforts to earnestly strengthen its good-neighborly relations

<HEADLINE> Premier Urges Accelerated Building of Social Security System in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As China's reform has entered its crucial stage and the country
is in a transitional period, China can not achieve social
stability without creating a perfect social security system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the social security system must be
independent from all enterprises and institutional units, and
compatible with the country's economic capacity.
</P>
<P>
Three most important social security systems should be set up
first, he said. They are the basic pension system, the security
system for factory layoffs and the jobless, and the security
system for the basic living need of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The key to further improving the social security system is
having a stable and reliable fund-raising mechanism, he said. He
disclosed that the government is planning to set up a national
social security fund by liquidating some state properties, issuing
special long-term bonds, and adopting other possible methods.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of ensuring the timely and
sufficient distribution of pensions and subsidies for the jobless,
saying that delayed money must be paid within this year and no new
delays will be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
The central government will give a proper sum of subsidiary
funds to money-tight areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Wu Bangguo also attended the meeting.

and Hebei, Liaoning, and Shaanxi provinces, and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.

urgency of accelerating the improvement of the social security
system. Securing basic rights and living conditions for the
working people is the fundamental goal of the Party, he noted.
</P>

instruction on the Party role that the Party should always
represent the fundamental interests of the people.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Wage Council Recommends Pay Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's National Wages
Council (NWC) Monday recommended increases in pay and in bonus
payment in light of the country's quick economic recovery and
favorable prospects.
</P>
<P>
NWC Chairman Lim Chong Yah said at a press conference here that
the recommendations included increases in employees' compensation
in the form of a Monthly Variable Component (MVC) and a speedier
restoration of the Central Provident Fund.
</P>
<P>
"The much-feared economic recession in Singapore turned out to
be short and mild. The recovery is fast and robust," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's cost cutting package in November 1998, led by the
government, has contributed to the speedy economic recovery, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The package, including a 10 percentage point cut in employers'
Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution and a wage cut, has in
fact brought down average wages in Singapore by 5.8 percent in
1999, according to NWC chairman.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, Singapore has posted a
robust 9.1 percent growth and the authorities has revised forecast
of about 6.5 percent in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for
this year to around 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, indicators concerning unit labor cost have fell
substantially and the wage share to GDP ratio also declined
perceptibly to 41.4 percent, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government announced in April this year the
restoration of CPF by 2 percentage points, a move nine months
earlier than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The NWC, formed in 1972 and a tripartite body comprising the
government, employers and union representatives, advises the
government on wage policies and issues wage guidelines in line
with long-term economic objectives.
</P>
<P>
NWC's recommendations, if accepted by the government, serve as
a basis for wage negotiations between employers and unions.

LHASA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- "People in Ngari will seize the
opportunity of accelerating the development of western China for
rapid and all-round economic growth," said Doje Cering, a
commissioner of Ngari Prefecture of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Ngari covers 345,000 square kilometers in northern Tibet at an
elevation of 4,500 meters, and is known as the "ridge of the roof
of the world." It lags behind other areas in economic development
because of poor transport infrastructure and geographical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture will give priority to the development of
transport, energy, environmental improvement, agriculture, and
animal husbandry, he said at the Third Session of the Seventh
Regional People's Congress which just closed in Lhasa, capital of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, construction of key projects, small towns, and
economic belts along the highways and in rural areas will be
accelerated, he added.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering also welcomes people from other parts of China to
grow vegetable in Ngari. The prefecture will open up more land
this year, and has drawn up a series of preferential policies to
attract technicians and vegetable growers from other regions.

<HEADLINE> Social Scientific Publishing Houses Cooperate for Greater Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The four publishing houses under
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) recently
collaborated to gain a greater share of the market.
</P>
<P>
Social Sciences Publishing House, Social Scientific
Documentation Publishing House, Economic Management Publishing
House, and Local Records Publishing House announced the formation
of a publishing commission for mutual business coordination.
</P>
<P>
The four publishing houses annually produce many academic works
by CASS experts and scholars, with good economic and social
results.
</P>
<P>
However, a CASS official said they lacked the exchange and
cooperation necessary to further their expansion.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the commission will effectively
allocate personnel and other publication resources among the four
publishers, who will employ a uniform CASS brand for their
products.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Invites Bids to Boost Defense Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A variety of defense projects to
improve capabilities of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), from
transport planes to main battle tanks, were still open for bids
with decisions expected to be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Industry Office (SSM) will implement a project to
modernize seven C-130 Hercules transport planes and to purchase the
final batches planned of a total of 145 helicopter gunships and 1,
000 main battle tanks this year, Anatolia News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the modernization projects, which total
some 10 billion U.S. dollars, will be completed within the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The project to upgrade C-130 transport planes will give the air
force intercontinental flight ability. It will be financed by SSM's
own funds, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In the bidding process for the 145 helicopter gunships, the SSM
received the final bids from competing firms on May 21 and was
expected to conclude its evaluations in June.
</P>
<P>
The bidding for 1,000 new-generation main battle tanks is
rapidly nearing a conclusion. The four major competing companies
have until July 3 to forward their final bids in line with the
stipulated criteria.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Visit Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi
Shihab confirmed here Monday that president Abdurrahman Wahid is
going to pay an official visit to Australia some time next month.
</P>
<P>
But, since no exact schedule has been fixed, "such a plan could
still be changed," Shihab told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to embrace our close neighbor (Australia) and try
to ease any possible threats of disintegration in Indonesia's
territory that may come from Australia," Shihab said when asked
about the purposes of Wahid's visit.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't say that Australia is a threat for Indonesia's
unity. I just say that there is a possibility (that threats of
disintegration come from Australia)," Shihab stressed.
</P>
<P>
"And if I talk about possibilities, it means that may be yes,
may be no. That is one of the reasons why the president decided to
go to Australia. Hopefully, non-government organizations in
Australia will help us in preventing disintegration threats in our
country," Shihab said.
</P>
<P>
However, Shihab added that the House of Representatives has
asked Australian Prime Minister John Howard to pay visit to
Indonesia first "before President Wahid goes there."
</P>
<P>
"And the government has filed such a proposal to the Australian
government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Shihab has said that the main aim of the president's
visit will be to mend bilateral ties that plummeted last year
after East Timor's vote for Independence on August 30.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Indonesian Navy has suspended some of its joint
training programs with Australia which are not considered top
priority.

Monday.
</P>

The 88-storey twin towers at a height of 452 meters linking

<HEADLINE> Israel Threatens Powerful Revenge Against Hezbollah If Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel will make a powerful response
to the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and their "god-fathers" if
the guerrilla group attacks northern Israel from Lebanon, said a
senior Israeli diplomat in an article published in newspaper Le
Figaro here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This response will not only be aimed at these terrorists who
perpetuate the attack, but also against these people who help,
support and allow terrorist organizations to operate against
Israel from Lebanon," said Eytan Bentsur, the general director of
the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is now "more effective" to protect the security
of Israel from the internationally recognized frontier than from a
security zone set up by Israel in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur said that the pullout of Israeli troops from south
Lebanon will also "deprive terrorist attacks of their so-called
legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
Through the pullout, Israel also expects to put an end to the
attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas, who he said are commanded by
people not in Lebanon but elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its pullout from its self-imposed security
zone in southern Lebanon last week after a 22-year occupation of
Lebanon's southern border area.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Makes 4-Point Proposal on Sino-Indian Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin made
a four-point proposal here Monday for the development of China-
India relations during talks with Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan, who is on a 7-day state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's first point is to increase visits between personnel of
the two countries to increase mutual understanding and trust.
Along with high-level official visits between the two countries,
various levels of contacts in different forms should also be
actively conducted between parties, parliaments, business circles,
the media, academics, and non-governmental organizations of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The second point is to expand trade and economic cooperation,
and lay a more solid foundation for the bilateral relationship.
There is great potential for bilateral trade and economic
cooperation, and the two sides should make efforts to explore new
channels to exchange market information, and encourage
entrepreneurs in mutual investment, with the aim of bringing two-
way trade and economic cooperation to new highs.
</P>
<P>
The third point is to strengthen coordination and cooperation
in international affairs, and make joint efforts for the
establishment of a just and reasonable new international political
and economic order. Coordination and cooperation will also serve
the lawful interests and rights of the developing countries, and
the promotion of world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Makes 4-Point Proposal on Sino-Indian Relations (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang's fourth point is to properly handle issues left over
from the past in the spirit of seeking common ground while
reserving differences. This does not mean shelving disputes
forever, nor does it mean developing bilateral relations only
after all disputes are completely resolved. The two sides should
start from their common interests, transcend some disputes, and
push forward bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said he believes the current visit by
president Narayanan coinciding the 50th anniversary of diplomatic
relations between China and India will further push forward good-
neighborly and cooperative friendship in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1950s, late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and late
Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru jointly pioneered the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the generally acknowledged
principles guiding state-to-state relations which are still full
of vitality today, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The five principles are mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and
peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the 50 years of diplomatic relations between
China and India as "good-neighborly and friendly." He stressed
that a stable, healthy, and normal relationship between the world'
s two most populous countries serves the fundamental interests of
people in both countries, and the peace and stability of the
region.

<P>
Narayanan said the India-China relationship has developed
smoothly over the past few years, especially since President Jiang
's 1996 visit to India. During that visit, China and India agreed
to seek to forge a 21st-century-oriented, constructive, and
cooperative partnership under the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president said that decision is of great
significance for the sustainable development of India-China
relations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan stressed that as the two countries share a wide range
of interests in various areas, there is no excuse for the two not
to properly resolve issues left over from the past. Rather, they
should be good friends and good partners forever.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan and Jiang also discussed many other issues of mutual
concern, including the multi-polarization of the world, the role
of the United Nations, the reform of the United Nations Security
Council, the establishment of a just and reasonable new world
political and economic order, and the maintaining of peace and
stability in south Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they agreed that a forum for Chinese and Indian
notables will be established, with the aim of increasing
cooperation and understanding.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, and Indian Minister of Heavy Industries and Public
Enterprises Manohar Joshi also attended the talks.

<HEADLINE> China to Set National Action Plan for Tobacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Public health authorities in China
are considering a national plan of action for tobacco control to
tackle the prevailing problems of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Such a plan will have to be made by every member state of the
Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization (WHO),
including China, by the end of 2001, according to a regional
action plan on tobacco and health (2000-2004).
</P>
<P>
The regional plan also requires effective legislation and
regulations to deter and control tobacco use by the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
"We must act right now to draft the action plan and tobacco-
control strategies in line with the national conditions of China,
because smoking has become an urgent public health problem in the
country," Professor Wang Ke'an, president of the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine (CAPM), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three percent of male adults and four percent of females,
or 320 million people, are smokers in China, making the country
the world's biggest consumer of tobacco products, he told a
conference on policy development for tobacco control in China in
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes now claim the lives of 2,000 people in China every
day, and the death toll is expected to climb to 8,000 per day, or
three million every year, by the middle of the next century if
current smoking patterns persist, according to the results of two
studies of tobacco-related deaths in China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Anti-smoking campaigns in China are still confronted with many
difficulties and challenges," acknowledged Hou Peisen, an official
with the Ministry of Health (MOH), such as the lack of a good
social environment for tobacco control, a close relationship
between the national economy and tobacco production and
consumption, and the promotion and smuggling of cigarettes
produced by multinational tobacco corporations.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, sponsored by MOH, WHO, CAPM, and the
Johns Hopkins University of the United States, is focused on
topics such as policy development, the taxation of tobacco
products, smoking among adolescents, tobacco control in schools,
and social losses due to tobacco consumption.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Ali el-Saeedi
said on Sunday that Egypt Electricity Authority will not be
privatized. It will continue to be owned in full by the state. Its
shares can not be offered on the Stock Exchange because it is the
owner of the national network which is connected with the grids of
Mashreq and Arab Maghreb countries, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid said the government was
pressing ahead with implementing the privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the shares of the Egyptian Communications
Company will be offered for sale at the Stock Exchange in October.
The company's assets have been estimated at between 24 and 25
billion Egyptian pounds (6.9-7.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Insurance and Social Affairs Amina el-
Guindi said Sunday that pensions will be increased by 10 percent as
of July 1 in implementation of State policy to give more care to
pensioners. About 6.9 million pensioners will benefit from the
increase, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will display thousands of ancient coins, bones and
pots, that were handed over by Israel after its withdrawal from the
Sinai peninsula in the 1980s, in a new museum, officials said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000 artefacts will be taken in 2,000 crates from the
Egyptian Museum to a new scientific museum facility built at a cost
of 2.5 million Egyptian pounds (720,000 U.S. dollars) in the Suez
Canal town of Qantara, 130 kilometers northeast of Cairo.

<P>
AMMAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Four Japanese nationals have been

southern Maan District of Jordan, police sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three of them died on the spot on Sunday when their car had a
head-on collision with a truck. The fourth died of injures shortly

</P>
<P>

road accidents, with some 670 deaths in 1999 in traffic-related
disasters.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes over 3 Tons of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces seized 3,141
kilograms of various narcotics in the southern Fars province during
the past week, the provincial security forces commander Hussein
Zulfaqar announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zulfaqar said that the drugs were confiscated in two separate
operations and included 155 kilograms of heroin, 2,414 kilograms of
opium and 572 kilograms of hashish, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that his forces also arrested 18 drug
smugglers and confiscated six guns, six automobiles and
motorcycles, seven mobile phones in the operations.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit for smugglers to ship drugs from the "
Golden Crescent," one of the world's largest drug producing center
in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian official said earlier this month that over 262 tons
of various narcotics had been seized in the country in the past
Iranian year ended on March 19.
</P>
<P>
A total of 185 Iranian anti-drug forces were killed in the year
in clashes with drug traffickers, bringing the total number since

<HEADLINE> Turkish-Iraqi Border Oil Trade Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- With the introduction of a new decree
by Turkish government to limit border trade with Iraq, particularly
oil, the amount of cheap oil being brought into Turkey from Iraq
has been halved.
</P>
<P>
While 1,500 trucks used to cross the Turkish-Iraqi border every
day before the decree was issued one month ago, the number has
since fallen to 100-150, Turkish Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after
its invasion of Kuwait, Turkey closed down its border gate at
Habur, southeastern Turkey, which links Turkey to the Middle East
and Iraq, seriously affecting people living in the region.
</P>
<P>
With the reopening of the gate, the region's economy flourished.
But debates over how the government would control oil trade via the
border area arose.
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, the government worked out new regulations that
the fuel brought over from Iraq should be sold to a state-owned
company at the border and reach consumers after state tax had been
levied on it.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, trucks will be able to bring in 75,000 tons of
oil via Habur and 15,000 tons via Igdir border gate one month,
whereas the figures were 150,000 tons and 30,000 tons respectively
before the decree took effect.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government put restrictions on border
oil trade for fear that the fuel money in the southeast will go to
the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has launched
armed struggle since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some foreign oil companies allegedly lobbied the
Turkish government to curb the fuel trade since they were suffering
great losses as a result of the influx of cheap fuel.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Thailand Office of the
Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) will help train anti-drug agents

Lao officials in July would be financially supported by the United

<HEADLINE> Scientist Sounds Alarm on Quake Risk near Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A leading Turkish earthquake expert
has signalled a warning on the huge risk of a major earthquake in
the country's southwest Aegean region, reported Turkish Daily News
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ali Kocygit made the appalling forecast at an
earthquake symposium in Izmir, Turkey's third largest city on the
coast of the Aegean Sea, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake with an approximate magnitude of 7.0 on the
Richter scale should be expected at any time in that region's
cities, said the professor.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a known earthquake-prone country in west Asia, witnessed
a 7.4- and a 7.2- magnitude earthquakes on August 17 and November
12 both in western Turkey. Altogether 18,000 people were killed in
the calamities, which also caused the country a property loss of
200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kocygit cautioned that a majority of the region's cities,
including Izmir, Manisa, Afyon, Denizli and Canakkale, which are
located in a very active earthquake zone, need to take measures to
ensure safety in the event of a big earthquake.
</P>
<P>
He explained that ground throughout the region is very weak and
therefore not able to withstand a strong earthquake, which would
result in an enormous amount of damage in the crowded cities in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Kocyigit reasoned that over the last 90 years, more than 50
strong earthquakes have occurred with magnitudes between 5.0 and 7.
0 in the region. "In those disasters we lost thousands of people
and 100,000 buildings. So we should not forget the earthquake
risk," he added.
</P>
<P>
He believed that stress is building up along the zone's fault
line and said that immediate action should be taken, emphasizing
that the city plans need to be changed and the majority of the
buildings have to be transferred to safer places around the
outskirts of these cities.
</P>
<P>
"The municipalities in the region have to enforce a ban on
constructing new buildings on unsafe ground and all the unsafe
buildings should be demolished as soon as possible," he called.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak assumed the
Center Party leadership on Sunday following the resignation of
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai from the cabinet and the
party helm as he faces trial on sexual assault and harassment
charges.
</P>
<P>
Shahak is to meet Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Monday to discuss
the change in the staffing of the party's portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is speculation that Barak may use the
opportunity to reshuffle his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The possibility of erecting a security fence between
Jerusalem and the villages of Abu Dis and Azariya on the outskirts
of Jerusalem, slated to be transferred to the Palestinian National
Authority (PA), is being considered as a way to prevent the violent
clashes between Palestinians and Israel Defense Forces soldiers
seen two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Defense establishment sources have expressed their concern in
recent days that the lack of any tangible division between
Palestinian autonomous areas and Jerusalem will allow Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to realize his goal and increase his influence
over areas in the east of the city.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Sunday that he
fully supported Minister of Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres's
candidacy for the president. The nomination will be made Friday at
a Labor Party Central Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (Parliament) faction of the opposition Likud party
is to meet on Monday to name its Knesset Member Moshe Katsav as its
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the race say the outcome of the campaign for
presidency depends on how the 17-member Shas Party votes.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations Middle East envoy Terje Larsen Sunday asked
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to release Lebanese citizens held
in Israeli prisons, saying the move would lessen tensions in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who came to Israel to prepare a report on Israel's
withdrawal from Lebanon and compliance with the U.N. Resolutions
425 and 426, also suggested that there might be a need for further
Israeli move near the Shebaa farms on the western flanks of Mount
Hermon, but made clear that the United Nations has accepted
Israel's argument that the area was taken from Syria in the Six-Day
War in 1967, not from Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Leaves for Madrid for Talks on Regional, Bilateral Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak left
here Monday morning for Madrid on a state visit to Spain at the
invitation of King Juan Carlos I.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Mubarak will hold talks with the
king, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and parliament leaders on
ways to help push forward the Middle East peace process and boost
the European-Mediterranean relations, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Madrid hosted the Middle East peace conference in October 1991
which kicked off the Arab-Israeli talks. And the 15 nations of the
European Union and 12 eastern and southern Mediterranean countries,
including Egypt, started the Euro-Med partnership, or the Barcelona
process, during a meeting in 1995 in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will also exchange views with the Spanish leaders on
means of further intensifying political, economic and trade
cooperation between Egypt and Spain, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' trade volume stood at around 600 million U.S.
dollars in 1999, with Egypt exporting 120 million dollars worth of
goods. Spain's 1.2 billion dollars in investments are mainly in
Egypt's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Spain has agreed to provide Egypt with soft loans totaling 300
million dollars with a yearly interest rate of 1 percent, to be
repaid over 40 years. It has also granted Egypt 10 million dollars
to fund feasibility studies for projects in Egypt, in which the two
countries have agreed to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak last visited Spain in l985.

<HEADLINE> Poor Harvest Predicted in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The target of 2.2 million tons of
maize for Kenya to be harvested this year will not be realized
owing to the failure of rainfall in the current planting season,
according to a report.
</P>
<P>
Although the Agriculture Ministry had initially estimated that
1.2 million hectares would be sown with maize, only 70 to 80
percent of the field received rainfall, Monday's Daily Nation
quoted the Kenya Vulnerability Update report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Erratic rainfall in several key arable areas during most of
the long rainy season has caused widespread fears of another
less-than-average harvest," said the report by the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID).
</P>
<P>
Planting of the long-rains maize crop has extended
uncharacteristically into May and is expected to continue into
June, particularly in the major grain-growing regions of the Rift
Valley Province, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The gloomy forecast came soon after Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi warned last Thursday that 23 million Kenyans, 80 percent
of the country's population, were likely to starve following the
failure of long rains in current planting season.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prices for maize, staple food for Kenyans,
jumped by 30 to 50 percent in April over those in the period of
1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The maize price hike is expected to continue due to last year's
poor harvest and lack of rainfall this season, observers here
said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Makes Efforts to Stop Stowaways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. and Canadian
immigration experts were recently invited to lecture frontier
inspection officials in the coastal province of Fujian in east
China.
</P>
<P>
They instructed the Chinese officials in methods for
distinguishing genuine passports and related documents from forged
ones during the four-day training course.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said this was only part of Fujian's efforts to
crack down on the increasing number of stowaway attempts in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The province has often been used by so-called "snakeheads,"
border crossings organizers, to help people illegally emigrate to
Japan, the United States, Canada, and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Local police have intensified their efforts to stop these
activities in recent years, and seized a total of 2,173 illegal
emigrants in 218 cases last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of stowaways soared 60.1 percent last year, although
the number of cases declined by 6.8 percent, a local police source
said.

NAIROBI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- At least six people and thousands
of livestock have perished due to famine in Wajir District in
northeastern Kenya, the Daily Nation newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A drought assessment report from the Arid Land Resource
management project run by the Office of the President said that
more than 22,000 malnourished children in the district are in need

"The situation in Wajir had developed into a full blown
drought. The long rains have failed and almost the entire surface
water sources are dry," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released in the wake of an international appeal
sent out by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi last week when he
disclosed 23 million Kenyans are likely to face hunger because of
the failure of the March-May long rains in the country.
</P>
<P>
Worst hit by the drought are the northern and northwestern
parts of Rift Valley, North Eastern, Eastern and Coast provinces
as well as large parts of Central Province.

Program had accepted to provide relief food supplies in the next

discussions with the Sri Lankan Government and Opposition leaders
and other interest groups, had briefed the U.S. Under Secretary

Kumaratunga and leaders of Opposition and the Tamil political
parties to discuss the peace process as well as the current
military crisis in the country's northern Jaffna peninsula.

since 1983, recently launched a fierce attack on government troops
in a bid to recapture their former stronghold in the Jaffna
Peninsula which they lost in 1996.

Consequently, the country was placed on a war footing on May 3
together with the promulgation of severe regulations under the
Public Security Act.

friendly countries to deal with the critical security situation in

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Concerned About Mergers Among Oil Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday voiced the concern about the formation of
new alliances and mega mergers among giant oil companies,
describing the trend as a threat to national oil corporations (
NOCs), mostly in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that oil industry saw over the last three years a few
mega mergers involving BP-Amoco, Exxon-Mobil, Total FINA-ELF and
BP-Amoco-Arco, Mahathir questioned whether the NOCs would remain
relevant in the phase of these new alliances and mega mergers in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
"How should they (NOCs) function in a system in which
production, prices, policies, technologies, etc. are dominated and
dictated by the few merged giant entities?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after opening the fifth Asia Oil and Gas
Conference here, Mahathir said Malaysia is still uncertain whether
it wants to forge a close relationship with the world's merged oil
giants.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Malaysia, through its national oil corporation
Petronas, would enter into an alliance with the Indonesian
national oil corporation Pertamina, Mahathir said Malaysia is
willing to work with Indonesia in oil production if the
opportunity comes along.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Mahathir urged the oil and gas industry to
lead in the search for alternative sources of energy to be well
prepared in facing the depleting energy resources around the world.

<HEADLINE> Germany Calls for German-Thai Trade Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany has urged Thailand to set
up a joint economic committee to promote more two-way trade, the
Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Werner Muller, German minister of economic affairs and
technology, made the proposal during his recent visit to Thailand,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The committee would represent the business community and be
chaired by government and industrial representatives, Muller was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic relations between Thailand and Germany had
"suffered a setback during the economic crisis," but have since
recovered as reflected in the 20 billion baht (510 million U.S.
dollars) that Germany invested in Thailand last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 60% of Germany's exports are to other
European countries and that had to change otherwise Germany would
lose its global market, the German minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a regional initiative to increase the
profile of German companies and products, in an attempt to
increase German exports to the Asia-Pacific region, according to
the report.

<HEADLINE> Dazhai: Yesterday's Model Commune, Today's Travel Destination (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Dazhai, a model village cited by
China's late leader Mao Zedong for its spirit of hardworking in
grain-growing, is now determined to make itself famous again by
turning the village into a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Located in a mountainous area in north China's Shanxi province,
Dazhai shot to fame in the 1960s through transforming the rocky
hills into terraced grain fields by displaying the spirit of
teamwork and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
"Dazhai will surely become more green and beautiful in three to
five years," said Guo Fenglian, the woman leader of the village, "
we'll turn our village into a garden attracting more tourists."
Guo was formerly known as an "Iron Girl.",
</P>
<P>
A travel agency and a hotel have been established in Dazhai
employing some 500 villagers who used to grow crops, together with
a souvenir plant and souvenir shops.
</P>
<P>
"Learn from Dazhai", one of the most popular slogans in 1960s
and 1970s in China, still reminds many Chinese of Dazhai's
devotion and determination in growing crops in the harsh, drought-
prone loess mountains.
</P>
<P>
Still in the spirit of teamwork and self-reliance, Dazhai
villagers have replaced crops on the terraced fields with
vegetation, grass and trees, fruit trees in particular, such as
pine and cypress, date, peach and apricot trees. Such a shift will
not only continue to protect soil and water of the cultivated land
but also improve the local environmental and ecological conditions
in the long run, some villagers said.

<P>
In addition, the village has turned 167 hectares of barren
hills into various vegetation. A forest park has also been built
in the village with a memorial kiosk dedicated to late Chinese
premier Zhou Enlai (1898--1976).
</P>
<P>
"The idea of solely growing crops is outdated," she said, "we
now have many other ways out. And fruit-growing is just one of
them which has proven to be economically beneficial and
environmentally friendly."
</P>
<P>
"Eco-tourism has served as and will continue to be a pillar
industry of Dazhai," said Guo, adding that the village will spend
another 300,000 yuan (36,145 U.S. dollars) planting trees this
year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of developing varied economic sectors, the village
has become one of the richest in Xiyang county, with its total
output value last year reaching 70 million yuan (8.4 million U.S.
dollars) and a per capita income of more than 3,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
What is worth-noting is that the output value from agriculture
accounted for less than one percent of the total. The formerly
grain-growing village now has industrial and commercial buildings,
Sino-foreign joint ventures producing woolen sweater and cement as
well as a marine cultivation center. And Dazhai hosted annually
more than 100,000 tourists in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Dazhai is not what it used to be, it's no longer a
farming village in the traditional concept," Guo said, "We are
making it a profitable tourist attraction," she stated.

<HEADLINE> 47 Injured in Bomb Blast in Medan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The injuries were rushed to three hospitals in the city, about
1,300 kilometers northwest of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the injuries were caused by flying shrapnel," nurse
Halimah at Herna Hospital's emergency unit was quoted by the paper
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted North Sumatera Police chief Brig. Gen.
Soetanto as saying that the explosion shook the Indonesian
Protestant Church during a Sunday service. There were no
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said that a second bomb was discovered at the
Batak Protestant Church and a short time later a third one was
found at the Christ the King Church.
</P>
<P>
The second bomb was detected by a church warden and later
detonated outside by members of the police's bomb squad. The third
bomb, however, went off accidentally when it was about to be
detonated at the local police's Mobile Brigade Headquarters,
injuring a police.
</P>
<P>
Soetanto warned that the incidents were an attempt to stir up
communal violence similar to that in the riot-torn province of
Maluku and called on the public to exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
Governor Tengku Rizal Nurdin said he had been informed the bomb
was of the same type as those used in Maluku and Jakarta violence.
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly designed by provocateurs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medan, a city of some 2.5 million people, has a large Christian
population, mostly from the Batak ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Following the blast and the discovery of the bombs, a meeting
was held between leaders of the North Sumatera military and police,
local administrative and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
General-secretary of the North Sumatera chapter of the
Communion of Indonesian Churches A.R. Pardede and Chairman of the
local Council of Indonesia Ulemas Mahmud Aziz Siregar called on
the public to refrain from blowing the incident out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the largest Muslim Organization
Nahdlatul Ulama Hasyim Muzadi said the blast was part of an
attempt to undermine the government. He labeled the blast as a "
systematic and well-coordinated" attempt to stir up trouble. He
therefore called on the public not to be provoked by actions that
were "deliberately created to destabilize" the country.

<HEADLINE> US Again Asks Taliban to Hand over Osama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States has again asked
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia to hand over Saudi exile
Osama bin Laden for trial in the case of bombing American
embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The request was renewed in a meeting of U.S. Under-Secretary of
State Thomas Pickering with Taliban envoy Syed Mohammad Haqqani
here on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani on Sunday said he reiterated the Taliban's stand that
Osama cannot operate against anyone from the Afghan soil and that
he is a guest to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that no evidence has been so far produced against Osama,
although Washington claimed that the Saudi dissident was involved
in the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Haqqani, his meeting with Pickering, which lasted
for more than two hours, was focused on terrorism, Osama issue,
narcotics and the setup of a broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pickering, who was here on a visit, met with Pakistan's Chief
Executive General Pervez Musharraf and senior officials in his
government earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A Wellington-based newspaper
Monday quoted New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark as saying her
country will probably follow Australia's example and eventually
establish diplomatic ties with the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was quoted by the Dominion as saying: "In
the normal course of events establishing diplomatic links with
North Korea wouldn't have been a very high priority. But given
Australia's moves now I think we would probably have an interest
in moving on from there."
</P>
<P>
Clark reportedly made the remarks when answering a question at
the annual dinner of the New Zealand Institute of International
Affairs over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Australia became the second country in the
year to restore diplomatic relations with DPRK. Italy resumed
links with the country in January.

WELLINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's information
technology (IT) market grew in value by 10.5 percent last year to
reach more than 2 billion U.S. dollars, New Zealand InfoTech
Weekly reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The market was boosted by Year 2000 jitters that resulted in
big spendups on hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted International Data Corporation New Zealand
Manager Dinesh Kumar as saying that last year was an "exceptional
year"for hardware sales because of pre-Y2K spending, which "
probably also filtered into the service side."
</P>
<P>
Kumar predicted the IT market will experience compound growth
of 5.5 percent in the next five years, with services outpacing
other sectors to grow by nine percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, 65 percent of companies around the
world will have Web sites, up from 46 percent last year and 36
percent in 1998, he said, adding: "New Zealand is already ahead of
these figures,with between 60 and 65 percent of companies having a
Web site at the end of last year."

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers outscored
the Portland Trail Blazers 103-91 to take a 3-1 commanding lead in
the Western Conference finals of NBA on Sunday in Portland, Oregon.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers is one step to the NBA Finals now with the fifth
game being scheduled in Los Angeles on Saturday. If the Lakers
could oust the Blazers in the rests of the best of seven series,
it will be their first trip to the NBA championship round since
1991.
</P>
<P>
Glen Rice came alive for the Lakers, scoring 13 of his 21
points in the decisive third quarter, veteran Ron Harper had a big
game and Shaquille O'Neal foiled Portland's "Hack-a-Shaq"strategy
by making all his nine free throws in front of a hostile crowd.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and is perfect
on the line with 9-9.
</P>
<P>
All-Star guard Kobe Bryant was held to 18 points on just 5-of-
15 shooting from the field but Harper, who hit the winning basket
in Game 3 at Portland, stepped up with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed Wallace had a big game for Portland with 34 points and
13 rebounds and Steve Smith added 20, but Scottie Pippen was
limited to 11.
</P>
<P>
Portland got off to a fast start, building a 26-16 lead after
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers closed the gap to five at the half -- 47-42 --and
broke the game open in the third quarter as Rice began knocking
down his jump shots.

Los Angeles outscored the Blazers 34-19 in the third quarter
and coasted to victory.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Sets to Get Euro 2000 Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Robbie Fowler is almost certain to
be included in England's squad for the European Championship
finals after Kevin Keegan revealed the Liverpool striker is set to
start Wednesday's friendly game against Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Keegan was certainly impressed by Michael Owen's rejuvenated
partnership with Alan Shearer against Brazil, increasing the
likelihood they will start Euro 2000 together up front.
</P>
<P>
But the England coach, who described the display in a 1-1 draw
at Wembley as "good but we've got to come up a lot on that to win
Euro 2000", is still determined to make several changes in the
friendly against Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking about starting Robbie on Wednesday. I'd like to
have a look at him alongside Alan Shearer," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"Michael has looked very sharp and Robbie has looked pretty
sharp. He doesn't have to play on Wednesday to prove that he can
get through 90 minutes but he has to take some part in the game
for himself as well as me," he said.
</P>
<P>
And given that Keegan is planning to tell his 28-man
provisional squad which six players are likely to miss out before
the friendly against Ukraine, that would appear to all but confirm
Fowler's ticket to Euro 2000 and spells likely misery for Andy
Cole.
