<HEADLINE> Scholars Say "One Country, Two Systems" Best for Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Reunification with the mainland
under the policy of "one country, two systems" is the best mode to
guarantee the freedom and autonomy of Taiwan people, Macao
scholars said here today.
</P>
<P>
Pai Wan Leung, a well-known Macao scholar and president of the
Returned Chinese Association in Macao, made the remarks today at a
gathering marking the 50th anniversary of the "February 28
Uprising", which took place in Taiwan in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The uprising first started in Taipei and later spread all over
Taiwan. Uprisers accused the Kuomintang Authorities of tyranny and
dictatorship, demanding democracy and autonomy. The uprising was
crushed in a few days.
</P>
<P>
"Only after a national reunification under the principle
of 'one country, two systems' can the Taiwan people enjoy true
freedom and autonomy," said Leung in a written speech. "People
across the Taiwan Straits should join hands for the great course
of reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
A dozen well-known scholars attended today's gathering,
organized by the Macao Daily News. They urged the Taiwan
authorities to stop its splitting acts and accept the policy of
"one country, two systems' put forward by Deng Xiaoping for an
earlier realization of reunification.
</P>
<P>
"The only feasible way to realize a peaceful reunification of
China under current condition is to accept the policy of 'one
country, two systems'" said Zhou Ligao, vice-president of the
University of Macao. "It fully demonstrates the wishes of
democratic politics and autonomy which was represented in the
February 28 Uprising."
</P>
<P>
Another scholar, Chan Taipak, deputy editor-in-chief of the Tai
Chung Pou Newspaper, refuted the idea that the "February 28
Uprising" was a demonstration of the tendency of independence,
saying that is a "hundred percent lie".
</P>
<P>
He said that those who tried to go against the principle of
"one China" and to split China are "traitor of Dr. Sun Yat-sen"
and "sinner of the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
The scholars said that the best resort for Taiwan people in
seeking true freedom and autonomy is to follow the tide of history
and realize reunification under the principle of "one country, two
systems", as will be successfully implemented in Hong Kong and
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"With China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong in 1997 and Macao in 1999, people in Taiwan will see that the
two places will remain prosperous and stable under the policy
of 'one country, two systems,'" said Ng Si Meng, deputy
secretary-general of the Macao Union of Neighborhood Associations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a strong and reunified China will be the best
protection of the fundamental interests of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"Only a strong and reunified China can meet the demand of
autonomy of the people in Taiwan," Ng said. "That was what the
uprisers fought for 50 years ago."

Conference (CPPCC) from Hong Kong arrived in Beijing today to
attend the Fifth Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee,
which is scheduled to open Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Julu, deputy secretary-general of the CPPCC National
Committee, met the 61-member Hong Kong delegation at the airport.
</P>
<P>
All the members expressed full confidence in the smooth
transition of Hong Kong. Member Maria Tam Wai-chu said that the
Hong Kong people grieved over the passing of Mr. Deng Xiaoping,
and would turn grief into strength and carry forward Deng's behest
by firmly implementing the principle of "one country, two systems"
and contributing to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is my firm belief that the central government will be able
to carry out the principle of 'one country, two systems' and the
policy of reform and opening up in a thorough way," she added.
</P>
<P>
Member Wan Tai Min said that Hong Kong now enjoys social
stability and economic prosperity, and will certainly return to
the embrace of the motherland smoothly on July 1 this year, adding
that Hong Kong's economic growth to a large extent hinges on the a
highly-competent and efficient team of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
"Recently the central government announced the appointment of
leading officials in the first government of the Hong Kong special
administrative region (HKSAR), and all principal Chinese civil
servants currently in office were on the list of appointees," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"This has greatly boosted the morale of the civil servants in
Hong Kong, enhanced the Hong Kong people's confidence, and showed
the Chinese government's determination to implement the principles
of 'one country, two systems' and 'Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong'," he noted, saying that this would help the smooth
transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong members also showed a seething enthusiasm for
involving themselves in the country's government and political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Describing the motherland's reunification as an aspiration
shared by the Chinese all over the world, Member Yew Mui Leong
suggested that the relevant sides give scope to the Chines culture
and the work concerning overseas Chinese. And he proposed sorting
out a theme that can be accepted by the Chinese people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits and across the world, for the sake of
promoting the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to do so with my painting exhibits," said Yew, who
hosted a series of exhibits of paintings featuring the relations
between Dr. Sun Yat-sen, forerunner of China's democratic
revolution, and the overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Maria Tam Wai-chu said Hong Kong and the interior area have
different legal systems, and that she hoped to contribute her
share for the legal cooperation and coordination between Hong
Kong and the interior area.
</P>
<P>
"As a CPPCC member, it is my duty bound to help more Hong Kong
residents to acquire a better understanding of the laws in the
interior area and encourage them to invest in the interior area,
and to help the interior areas to use Hong Kong as a bridge to
draw more investment from overseas," she said.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 108 CPPCC National Committee members in
the Hong Kong region. Some of them are already in Beijing,
attending sessions of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National
Committee and of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen members of the CPPCC National Committee from the region
of Macao, headed by NG Fok, a member of the Standing Committee of
the CPPCC National Committee, also arrived here this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Stresses Importance of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 is of great
significance to China as the Chinese government is to resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Communist Party of
China (CPC) is to hold its Fifth National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, obtaining a bumper grain harvest is closely related
to the whole situation of the country's reform, development and
stability.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun here at
today's closing of a national work conference on administrative
restructuring of rural credit agencies.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said that China has made notable
achievements in agriculture and the rural economy in recent
years. China achieved good grain harvests in 1995 and 1996
successively, while township- and village-based industries have
also maintained a favorable trend of development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Chinese farmers had a per-capita net income of 1,900
yuan, up eight percent over the previous year, and in the same
year some seven million poverty-stricken people in rural areas
were able to have enough food and clothing, according to the
vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Jiang said, the country's agriculture and rural
economy are expected to maintain their overall development
momentum, making new contributions to the entire national economy
and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that in 1997 China plans to achieve the
same grain output as last year, while trying to produce a bit more.
</P>
<P>
This year the country's township- and village-based enterprises
are expected to develop at a moderately fast pace, while the
per-capita income of the farmers is expected to increase by around
five percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the government plans to help some 12 million
rural people shake off poverty this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Enliven Housing Sales by Financial Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China is taking steps to boost
housing commercialization by setting up housing-related banks,
public funding and home-owner loans and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of
Construction, China continues to suffer from slack housing
sales. The year-end figure of 1996 showed that a total of 50
million sq m of residences were lying idle nationwide, including
30 million sq m of ordinary houses.
</P>
<P>
The residents' poor purchasing power and the higher housing
prices account for the excess of residences, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To promote housing commercialization and reform, the Ministry
of Finance has already reduced or remitted 48 varieties of
irrational taxes concerning housing construction and sales, in a
bid to secure a rational commercial housing price.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country is setting up housing-related banks on a
trial basis in a number of cities, which are expected to provide a
financial guarantee as well as loans and mortgages for residents'
housing purchase.
</P>
<P>
And great headway is being made in raising housing funding,
which has topped nearly 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China is continuing to draft a series of rules governing
administration, operation and appreciation of the housing
fund.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Session Receives 90 Proposals (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Session of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has received 90 proposals.
</P>
<P>
Economic development in the first year of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000) and the realization of China's long-range
goals for the year 2010 remain the central issue for the members
of the CPPCC National Committee, officials of the CPPCC National
Committee analyzed.
</P>
<P>
They added that there is a distinct rise in the number of
proposals for cultural and socialist ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
A proposal on how to ensure the top quality of the Three Gorges
Dam project has been cited as the No.1 for the coming session. Zhu
Baifang, a senior engineer who has made surveys of the Dam area
for several times, said in the proposal that the Three Gorges
Project is the world's largest water conservancy and hydraulic
project, as well as a super big project on the Yangtze, China's
longest river.
</P>
<P>
As result, he noted, first-rate quality must be sought for the
project.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also set forth suggestions on how to enhance quality
supervision, improve the technological system of the project, and
optimize bidding techniques for the project.
</P>
<P>
The Proposals-Handling Subcommittee is expected to receive a
larger amount of proposals before March 7, the deadline for
submission of proposals, its official said.

<HEADLINE> China, ASEAN Cooperation Emphasized at CAJCC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China and the ASEAN developed
a new channel of cooperation by setting up the China-ASEAN Joint
Cooperation Committee (CAJCC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
during the opening of the committee meeting that the committee was
an important follow-up step to seal China's full dialogue
partnership with the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
"The first meeting of CAJCC gives us a good opportunity to
compare notes and pool our wisdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
CAJCC is an umbrella committee charged with overseeing the
various facets of China-ASEAN relations, ranging from trade and
economic matters to science and technology, culture, information,
environment and social development.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is comprised of seven countries: Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the committee would work in the spirit of
equality, mutual benefit and friendly cooperation and put forward
detailed proposals for deeper cooperation between China and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
He said that developing a good-neighborly partnership of mutual
trust with ASEAN was an important component of China's foreign
policy. He said that China would continue to work actively and
effectively for the deepening of bilateral cooperation in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that China-ASEAN cooperation held out even broader
prospects, based on the premise that the rise of China and ASEAN
members serves peace, stability and prosperity in Asia and the
world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was a great deal of common ground between
China and ASEAN. Both attached importance to maintaining regional
and global peace, stability and development, and were dedicated to
this end.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and ASEAN were each committed to economic
development, regarding maintaining domestic stability and running
a successful economy as the central tasks.
</P>
<P>
Both need to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of
the developing countries and work together to promote regional and
global cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and ASEAN both adhere to the principle of
non-interference in each other's internal affairs and stand for
closer dialogue and cooperation and peaceful settlement of
disputes between states.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that, based on these common positions, we are
fully capable of broadening the all-round cooperation between
China and ASEAN, and making its scope and depth more commensurate
with each other's needs and potentials of development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the first meeting of CAJCC that the Chinese people are
profoundly saddened by the death of Deng Xiaoping, an outstanding
leader and chief architect of China's reform, opening up and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics that Deng initiated would continue to move
forward. The friendly relations and cooperation between China and
Asia and the world as a whole would grow stronger, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered at the inauguration, Ajit Singh,
secretary-general of ASEAN, extended his condolences over the
death of Deng Xiaoping, and he attributed the improvement and
strengthening of China-ASEAN relations to Deng's leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said that "to ASEAN, relations with China are very
important," and that though there may be differences between the
ASEAN and China from time to time, as good neighbors, "we can
resolve them in a peaceful and friendly way, through consultations
and negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He noted that relations between China and the ASEAN countries
date back to ancient times and are firmly grounded, and bilateral
trade and economic ties have had remarkable growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Noting that ASEAN-China relations are "active and fruitful,"
Singh said that the CAJCC will be another important mechanism, as
it will oversee the various facets of ASEAN-China relations,
ranging from trade and economic matters to science and technology,
culture, information, environment and social development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the frequent contacts, broadening
cooperation and growing goodwill will provide a firm basis for the
work of the CAJCC, which will give further impetus to the
cementing of closer and more meaningful ties between ASEAN and
China.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of CAJCC runs through Friday. It is being
co-presided over by Chen Jian, assistant Foreign Minister of
China, and Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan, Director-General of the ASEAN
Department of Malaysian Foreign Ministry.

STOCKHOLM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Norway won the Nordic
Combined team event at the Nordic skiing world championships in
Trondheim, Norway on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finland and Austria finished second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
Halldor Skard, Bjarte Engen Vik, Knut Tore Apeland and Fred
Borre Lundberg won the ski jumping ahead of Finland and the Czech
Republic, despite a massive jump of 99.5 meters from Jan Matura.
</P>

That allowed the Norwegians to start the 4x5km cross-country
relay with a seven second advantage on the Finns and Halldor Skard
effectively killed off the contest by setting a terrific early
pace.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior military officer
today called for strict political discipline in the army to
safeguard the authority of the Central Committee and the Central
Military Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
</P>
<P>
The most important point in observing political discipline is
that all actions must follow the demands of the CPC Central
Committee and the Central Military Commission, said Fu Quanyou,
chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA).
</P>
<P>
Fu made the remarks today while addressing a meeting on
discipline inspection, which was convened by the Headquarters of
the General Staff of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
As a high-ranking command organ, the Headquarters of the
General Staff should play an exemplary role for all military
organs and troops in firmly following the CPC's absolute
leadership over the army, he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he urged senior and middle-level military
officers to abide by the fundamental political norms of the Party
so as to ensure the smooth implementation of administrative and
military directives.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, officers and men of the PLA and
the armed police across the country watched the memorial meeting
for the late Deng Xiaoping Tuesday morning, vowing to turn sorrow
into strength and continue to safeguard state sovereignty and
security, and China's socialist undertakings.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Central Bank on Inflationary Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
today expressed concern about the spate of price increases, which
it said could trigger another inflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its latest economic bulletin that
efforts to reduce inflation, which was pegged at 15.8 percent in
January, could be "frustrated" by periodic adjustments to
administered prices.
</P>
<P>
It said the 4-9 percent fuel price rise announced at the
beginning of the year was still to be felt, so was the impact of
the increase in rural bus fares, which went up by 15.5 percent
last week.
</P>
<P>
The bank said despite the price rises, it would continue to
closely monitor inflationary trends with a view to keeping
inflation low.
</P>
<P>
"As in the past, however, efforts in this direction have been
frustrated by various factors, notably periodic adjustments to
administered prices," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
It, however, said inflation was unlikely to exceed 20 percent by
June this year, slightly above the original forecast of 17 percent
made last September. enditem

<HEADLINE> Industrialization Urged for Flower Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese floriculturists have
been encouraged to develop flower-growing into a profitable
industry through increasing production, improving product quality
and tapping rich floral resources.
</P>
<P>
The plans for developing flower production should be designed
to be suitable for the development of the whole agricultural
sector, Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The government should issue a series of preferential policies
to support the sector. Some measures should be taken to improve
the quality of flowers, such as improving strains, updating
cultivation technology and training qualified workers, Chen told a
national conference on industrialization of flower production.
</P>
<P>
"We should tap our abundant floral resources as far as possible
and turn them into commodities by making full use of the cheap
labor in the vast rural areas," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that the sector will enjoy a huge
potential domestic market, since Chinese people still pay little
attention to flowers, compared with other kinds of consumption
goods.
</P>
<P>
China's flower market has been dominated by cut flowers, potted
and decorative plants, lawns and traditional potted landscapes,
according to Deputy Minister of agriculture Liu Chengguo.
</P>
<P>
China will produce two billion sprays of cut flowers annually
by the year 2000, involving seven billion yuan in output value and
earning 200 million US dollars through exports, Liu said.

industry and commerce Kelbert Nkomani said the private sector had
a role to play in the economy.

HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Victoria
Harbor will be transformed into a spectacle at a late March Friday
with more than 30 sailing vessels taking part in a parade to mark
the start of the "Sail Osaka '97", organizers said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Osaka race will be the first international tall ship race
ever held in the Northern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The race, organized by the city of Osaka and assisted by the
International Sail Training Associations, will attract some 50
vessels from 18 countries and regions, such as Argentina,
Australia, Columbia, France, Indonesia and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The race is also a festival of sail promoting friendship among
the young participants and the citizens of the ports involved --
Hong Kong, Okinawa, Kagoshima and Osaka.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong is the starting port, the Urban Council and the
Marine Department, assisted by the Hong Kong Tourist Association,
play host by jointly staging the "Hong Kong Tall Ship
Spectacular". The carnival will include such events as
exhibitions and on-shore water sports demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The participating vessels will sail northeastward to Okinawa on

<HEADLINE> China to Issue One Billion Yuan in Bonds for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to float one
billion yuan (about 121 million US dollars) in corporate bonds to
increase funding for the Three Gorges Project, with public
issuance scheduled to start on February 28.
</P>
<P>
China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation
(CTGPC), which is both the issuer and the dam project proprietor,
said the bonds will be sold at their face value -- 100 yuan, 1,000
yuan and 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, rated AAA-, the second-highest rating possible, are
for three years with an annual interest rate of 11 percent, which
will not fluctuate in accordance with inflation.
</P>
<P>
Interest calculation will start from the day of issuance and
end upon expiration of the three-year term, when capital will be
repaid together with interest.
</P>
<P>
A team of underwriters, with Shanghai-based Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo
Securities Co. Ltd. as the lead sales agent and Citic Securities
Co. as the subordinate, has contracted to be the wholesaler. The
signing ceremony was held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the CTGPC will float domestic bonds,
said Lu Youmei, president of the corporation, at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"CTGPC will continue to issue bonds in the future, in
accordance with the project's need for funds and the market
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be issued in bills and made available for
purchase to all urban and rural residents in China, enterprises,
government agencies and financial institutions. They can
voluntarily buy the bonds from underwriting team's approved
outlets in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Yichang and other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Buyers can transfer the bonds to others or use them as
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the issuance and upon approval, the
bonds will be listed for trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The bonds have full support from the Three Gorges Fund which
provides an irrevocable guarantee. The fund is composed of profits
from the Gezhouba Hydroelectric Power Station downstream from the
Three Gorges and revenue from minor extra charges on electricity
imposed in most parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The enormous power generating capacity of the future
hydroelectric power station to emerge at the dam site promises
considerable gains for potential investors, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The station will have a generating capacity of 84.7 billion
kilowatt hours (kwh) a year, or one tenth of China's total power
supply by the project's completion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Income from bonds to be issued will be used to offset a
shortfall of investment to the dam project left over from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Total spending on the Three Gorges Project was 8.2 billion yuan
last year, with 4.2 billion and three billion yuan coming
respectively from the Three Gorges Fund and State Development Bank
loans.

Jiang made the remarks here today at the closing of a three-day
national work conference on administrative restructuring of rural
credit agencies.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the meeting that the government is not able to make
all the investment needed in the agricultural sector, as the
country has a large population and an underdeveloped
economy. Therefore, the banking industry should play its full role
in assisting the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Credit agencies play a decisive role in the rural banking
sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China has over 50,000 rural
credit agencies, with a total staff of over 600,000 and total
assets of 1,400 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year rural credit agencies had 879.4 billion
yuan as the remaining sum of deposits and 629 billion yuan in
outstanding loans, while 80 percent of loans borrowed by rural
households and 70 percent of those borrowed by township- and
village-based industries came from these agencies.
</P>
<P>
Referring to administrative restructuring, Jiang insisted that
the reform must adhere to the principle of the cooperative system.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ownership of rural credit agencies belongs
to the shareholders, and the head of an agency must be appointed
through democratic election by the members, while all major issues
related to the agencies must be decided by the members' congress
or the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 percent of the loans issued by the agencies must go
to their members, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier asked all rural credit agencies to reinforce
their management and improve the performance, noting that the
administrative restructuring of rural credit agencies and building
a rural cooperative banking system are a pioneering issue,
directly related to agricultural development, the well-being of
farmers and the prosperity of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked governments at various levels to strengthen their
leadership over the issue, and he asked the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, to reinforce its supervision and
administration of rural credit agencies and to support their
development.

<HEADLINE> Notable Progress in Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China has made "notable
progress" in building the Three Gorges Project since the world's
largest water-control scheme started four years ago, a project
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996 construction workers had excavated 126
million cu m of earth and rocks, approximately 85 percent of the
total to be excavated, said Lu Youmei, president of the China
Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Workers have also filled more than 48 million cu m of earth and
rocks, or 52 percent of the total backfill, Lu said at a ceremony
held for the issuance of one billion yuan-worth of bonds to
increase funding for the project.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the water-diversion channel, which is to
redirect the flow of the Yangtze after the river is dammed this
November, is near completion. The channel is expected to hold
water in May and be navigable in October, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The expressway linking the dam site with the nearby towns, the
Xiling Yangtze Bridge, the Yangjiawan Wharf and the Three Gorges
Airport has been put into service, and various infrastructure
facilities now meet the demands of major sub-projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Construction of the project is slightly ahead of schedule,
investment remains within the state budget, construction quality
is in accordance with design and resettlement has made a good
start," the corporation president said.
</P>
<P>
"The damming of the Yangtze this November, the first-stage goal
of the project, is now a certainty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of resettlement, Guo Shuyan, deputy director of the
Three Gorges Project Construction Commission under the State
Council, said that China has developed 6,600 ha of land in the
reservoir area and on it built houses covering a floor space of
578,000 sq m for farmers and 498,000 sq m of housing for urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
Guo went on to say that the country has completed the
reconstruction of 99 factories and is moving another 256.
</P>
<P>
He said 70 percent of the infrastructure facilities that will
be submerged after the damming of the Yangtze have been rebuilt
elsewhere, and 42,300 people have relocated.
</P>
<P>
"Funding for the Three Gorges Project has been sufficient so
far," the official said. By the end of 1996 China had invested
20.8 billion yuan in the project, guaranteeing the progress of the
project's construction and resettlement work.

<HEADLINE> People of Central Party and Government Departments Commemorate Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Following the funeral meeting
for Deng Xiaoping yesterday, departments under the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee and the central government have
held various activities to commemorate Deng.
</P>
<P>
People with the departments studied President Jiang Zemin's
eulogy on Deng Xiaoping, saying that they would cherish the memory

the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at
the core.
</P>
<P>
The eulogy summarized Deng Xiaoping's outstanding deeds and
great bearing in his long revolutionary life, expounded the
precious wealth Deng left to the Chinese people, and proclaimed
that the people will continue to unswervingly carry on the
socialist undertakings, they said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed they would follow Deng's great thinking of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and turn sorrow into
strength to create an even more beautiful, powerful and prosperous
China.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the departments, scores of them all together, have
held forums and picture exhibitions to commemorate Deng, and many
people wrote memorial articles.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Develop Gold Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to turn out 100
tons of gold this year and earn 800 million yuan in profits from
this sector, according to an ongoing national gold work conference
here.
</P>
<P>
More efforts will be made to use advanced technology, cut down
production costs and strengthen management, in a bid to give an
impetus to the industry's sustained, speedy and healthy
development.
</P>
<P>
The industry will invest 1.6 billion yuan in fixed assets this
year, one billion yuan of which will be used for basic
construction; the other 600 million yuan will be used for
technological improvements. Thus, China's annual gold production
capacity is expected to be raised by 7.25 tons.
</P>
<P>
And 400 million yuan more will be injected into prospecting
this year, which is expected to add 150 tons of gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
China's gold production last year reached 120.6 tons, up nearly
12 percent over the previous year and 6.1 times the 1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
China aims to raise its annual gold production to 150 tons by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The industry has found it profitable to cooperate with foreign
partners in developing low-grade gold ore resources and in
risk-taking geological prospecting.

<HEADLINE> "Guarantee Quality of Means of Agricultural Production" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese departments in charge
of commodity circulation and quality control have been urged to
keep an open eye on the quality of means of agricultural
production before this year's spring plowing.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of means of agricultural production for growing
major crops in key areas must be guaranteed in order to ensure a
bumper harvest this year," State Councillor Chen Junsheng said
here today.
</P>
<P>
A key measure is to clear poor-quality products, such as fake
and shoddy seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, out of commodity
circulation, Chen told a national telephone conference.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned distributors and supply and marketing
cooperatives in the rural areas should continue to play a leading
role in distributing seeds, chemical fertilizers and other
materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local departments concerned should launch successive checks in
enterprises producing and selling means of agricultural
production. Local governments must strengthen crackdowns upon the
production and sale of fake seeds, chemical fertilizers and
pesticides, which may cause heavy economic losses for farmers, he
urged.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that agrotechnicians should help farmers
learn how to buy genuine and quality means of agricultural
production.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns of Overheated Runup in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that "caution seems especially
warranted" over the extraordinary runup in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
During a testimony in the U.S. Congress, Greenspan said, "There
are reasons in the current environment to keep this question on
the table."
</P>
<P>
"History demonstrates that participants in financial markets
are susceptible to waves of optimism," he said. "Excessive
optimism sows the seeds of its own reversal in the form of
imbalances that tend to grow over time."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan roiled stock markets over the world in early December
with his now-famous question about whether "irrational exuberance"
was driving the market. His remark today also resulted in a sharp
plunge in the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan balanced his warning by noting that members of the
U.S. Fed must look for trouble and "even I must admit our economic
prospects are quite favorable."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan listed the factors he believes have kept inflation
unusually contained: job insecurity restraining wage growth,
intense global competition, a strong dollar keeping a lid on
import prices and wide profit margins that give firms room to
accommodate increased costs without raising retail prices.
</P>
<P>
But he said that all of those factors may be temporary and he
could not rule out a preemptive increase in interest rates to
hold economic growth and prices in check because the stock price
runup could help feed inflation.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that given the long lags between interest rate
changes and their impact on the economy as a whole, "we cannot
rule out a situation in which a preemptive policy tightening may
become appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation
becomes evident."
</P>
<P>
Today's testimony accompanied the Fed's twice-a-year report to
the U.S. Congress on its handling of monetary policy and economic
expectations.
</P>
<P>
In its forecast for 1997, the Fed predicted economic growth of
between 2 percent and 2.25 percent, inflation between 2.75 percent
and 3 percent and an unemployment rate between 5.25 percent and
5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Calls for Study of Military Theory, Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior military official has
urged all the officers and men of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) to arm themselves with correct military theory and modern
military science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The two aspects, which have been much emphasized by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, are keys to building a powerful army, said
Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and
director of the General Political Department of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
Correct military theory means that the people's army should
obey the Communist Party's absolute leadership and unswervingly
keep in line with the Central Committee with Jiang at the core and
the CMC of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Yu said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, high technology has become a basic factor in
raising the army's combat effectiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu made the remarks at a recent conference in which some
military units and individuals talked about their experiences in
stepping up theoretical studies and in the application of modern
military science.
</P>
<P>
The entire PLA must take the study of military theory and
science as a major political task, Fu stressed.

BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The General Political
Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) released
a circular here today requiring all troops and armed police to
study President Jiang Zemin's memorial speech for Deng Xiaoping.
</P>

Such study is of great significance for remembering the
remarkable deeds and great ideological contributions of Deng
Xiaoping, and for uniting closer around the Central Committee and
the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away last Wednesday at the age of 93. Jiang made
the memorial speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on all units of the PLA and armed police to
organize officers and men to study other memorial documents,
articles and video materials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Seminar On Taiwan Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A seminar to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Taiwan "February 28 Uprising" was held here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), attended the
seminar.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, who is also a member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said, "At this moment we deeply cherish the memory of
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who made a great contribution to carrying
forward the country's peaceful reunification process by putting
forward the 'one country, two systems' proposition."
</P>
<P>
"We will further adhere to the `one country, two systems'
principle under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with
Comrade Jian Zemin at its core to make new contributions to the
reunification drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation for the Taiwan people's patriotic
spirit in the movement for democracy half a century ago, he
pointed out that history has again proved that the fate of the
Taiwan compatriots is closely related to that of the Chinese
nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that, as a patriotic democratic movement
demanding freedom and opposing the tyrannical Kuomintang, the
uprising was by no means an "exclusive" or "Taiwan independence"
movement as some people who harbor the vicious ambition of
splitting the island from China have alleged.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government always respects the demand
of the Taiwan compatriots, which was illustrated by the speech
made by President Jiang Zemin in 1995, and in a series of
government policies, regulations and measures governing the
protection of the legal rights and interests of the Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Finally he pointed out that the year 1997 marks a historic
turning point in China's history. With the resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, the
reunification of Taiwan with the mainland has become a more urgent
mission for the whole Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, attended by about 400 people, was organized by the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the All-China Federation
of Taiwan Compatriots.

<HEADLINE> France, US Resume Talks on NATO Europeanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States
have resumed over the past few weeks negotiations on the
Europeanization of the Naples-based Southern Command of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), reported the local daily Le
Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting official sources, said that although little
progress has been made in reaching an agreement over the issue,
the United States has for the first time shown its willingness to
look for a compromise acceptable to both.
</P>
<P>
France has insisted that the Southern Command be headed by a
European officer and that a U.S. admiral remain the commander of
the Sixth Fleet of the United States Navy and some air and navy
forces of European allies.
</P>
<P>
Or, as France suggested, the United States will be in charge of
"functional" operations of NATO forces in the region, while
Europe commands the "territorial" operations of the allied
forces.
</P>
<P>
Washington rejected the demand and presented a counter-proposal
which includes the creation of a NATO rapid action force in the
Mediterranean region to be headed by a European officer, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The United States also suggested a sharing of responsibilities
for the different territories of the region between the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to keep its control over allied forces
in the eastern part of the Mediterranean and the Middle East,
while the western part of the Mediterranean could be put under the
control of Europeans, said the report.
</P>
<P>
France called the U.S. proposal insufficient although it agreed
to study "different possible packages" of proposals from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
France bases its demand for the take-over of the Southern
Command on the theory that Europe and the United States do not
necessarily share the same interests in the Mediterranean region,
which has become the most sensitive area for the security of
Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the idea of a double NATO command for the region is
not new. From 1952 to 1967, an American admiral commanded the
Southern Command from Naples, while a British admiral commanded a
NATO Mediterranean force from Malta, which was baptized Afmed.
</P>
<P>
France has made it clear that if negotiations with U.S. do not
produce any positive result before the NATO Madrid summit in July,
it will stay out of its integrated military command structure as
it has since 1966.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not to Accept Preconditions for EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government will
not accept a solution to the Cyprus problem as precondition for
its accession to the European Union (EU), a government spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said that "Of course, any effort to set the solution
of the Cyprus problem as a precondition for entry to the EU
worries us."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government "will strive not to allow the two issues
to be connected and to prove that it is not the side to be blamed
if a solution is not reached when accession talks begin," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides pointed out the EU did not support simultaneous
accession talks with the Turkish Cypriots, but some of its member
states made the proposal asking for Turkish Cypriot participation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Britain, France and Germany insisted on the
participation of all Cypriots in the accession process. Greece
had made counterproposals on the issue, which were turned down.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a meeting between the EU and Cyprus, within the
framework of the Cyprus-EU structured dialogue, was postponed in
Brussels in view of disagreement among EU member states over
Turkish Cypriot participation.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted the Cyprus government will only be
satisfied when the EU issues a common communique regarding
Cyprus' political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he agrees with the Greek position and
noted the EU must reaffirm its decision of March 6, 1995, whereby
accession talks will begin with Cyprus six months after the end
of the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides reiterated that the Cyprus government does not
disagree with EU efforts to inform Turkish Cypriots of the
benefits they will have from the island's EU accession.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which has been remained divided since 1974, applied for
full EU membership in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Peace Process Still on Track: Weizman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
has expressed his conviction that the Middle East peace process
was still on track despite rows between Israel and Palestine over
construction of new settlements in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting British Prime
Minister John Major this afternoon, Weizman said that he was still
"very optimistic" about the future of the Middle East peace
process despite some "ups and downs you have today."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israeli plans to build 6,500 homes for
Jews in Arab East Jerusalem were expected to trigger new violence
in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, Weizman stressed, "People should realize how much we
have achieved in the past 20 years. For the first 30 years after
the establishment of the state of Israel, we were at each other's
throats."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president, who arrived here Tuesday for his first
official visit to Britain, said, "I hope that in the foreseeable
future -- whether it is five years, three years, two years -- we
will have peace with all the Arab nations and sail merrily into
the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, British Prime Minister Major said, "What
we have tried to do is act as a facilitator. I don't think it is
our job to add to the difficulties and it is our job to add to the
solutions."

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns of Possible Attack on Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A top official of the Lebanese
Hezbollah warned here today that his organization could resume
Katyusha attacks on northern Israel if the Jewish state continues
"aggressions" against Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Naim Kassem, Hezbollah's Deputy Secretary General, was
quoted by the Free Lebanon Radio as saying that a Lebanese-Israeli
truce agreement, which was reached last April, does not rule out
the possibility that Israeli civilians are targeted by Katyusha
rockets if Israel continues violating the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The shiite pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, spearheads
a guerrilla warfare to oust Israeli occupation forces from a
1,100-square-kilometer enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting and weighing whether things have reached the
limit requiring a real response which constitutes a real
retaliation for the aggression," Kassem said.
</P>
<P>
Seven Lebanese civilians have been killed in bombardments of
the Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia since the implementation of the cease-fire
understanding, which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz in south
Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the understanding, which demands civilians on both
sides of the border be kept away from military operations, a
five-nation monitoring committee comprising France, Israel,
Lebanon, Syria and the United States was set up to supervise
violations of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The committee has met for 14 times to discuss complaints
lodged by Lebanon and Israel against each other over breaches of
the cease-fire understanding.
</P>
<P>
However, the only thing the committee has done was to issue
repeated non-mandatory statements, drawing attacks for
incapability to avert civilian casualties in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UK SFA Bans Seventh EX-Barings Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Securities and
Futures Authority (SFA), the financial market regulator, banned
James Bax Tuesday from acting as director of any securities
business for 21 months for his role in the collapse of the bank in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Bax, 44, head of Barings Securities in Asia and former boss of
rogue trader Nick Leeson, became the seventh former director of
the merchant bank to be suspended by the SFA.
</P>
<P>
The SFA said Bax had admitted that he failed to take action to
remedy control weakness in the Barings Singapore organization and
did not act quickly or firmly enough to investigate Leeson.
</P>
<P>
However, Bax said that he had to accept the ruling that he
should be banned for 21 months, running from the start of the
SFA's proceedings against him in March 1996 until the end of 1997,
and pay 10,000 pound (16,300 US dollar) costs because he could not
afford the substantial costs of defending himself against the
SFA's charges.
</P>
<P>
The SFA has already finished action against seven of the nine
former Barings chiefs it found had failed to show "due skill, care
and diligence" in overseeing Leeson.
</P>
<P>
Ian Hopkins, former head of treasury at Barings, has a week to
decide whether to appeal against an order banning him for three
years while Ron Baker is the only ex-Barings director to appeal
against an SFA reprimand.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Official: US Seeks to Block Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official said
here today that the U.S. seeks to block the implementation of the
oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and the U.N. last May, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz made the remarks during
a meeting with visiting former Algerian President Ben Bella, also
head of a delegation. Aziz criticized the U.S. for persisting in
maintaining the U.N.-imposed embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. seeks to block the implementation of the
oil-for-food deal which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food and
medicine badly needed in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also praised the efforts made by Bin Bella and other Arab
and international personalities on the European arena in support
of Iraq and its demand for the lifting of the over six-year-long
U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq for Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
For their part, Ben Bella and members of the delegation
called for an immediate lifting of the embargo and urged the
international community and humanitarian organizations
to make efforts to put an end to the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Adopts Decision on New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ministerial Committee on
Jerusalem Affairs decided this evening to approve the construction
of Har Homa Jewish settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem,
according to a communique released by the Cabinet Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhood at Har Homa will include approximately 6,500
housing units. The first stage will include approximately 2,500
units," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided to allow Palestinians to build
3,015 housing units in 10 neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu gave
green light to the plan earlier this week in spite of
furious opposition from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu issued a warning to the Palestinians saying that it
would be a grave mistake if they respond to the plans with
violence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources threatened that any Palestinian
violence could delay the first phase of further Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to alleviate anger of the Egyptian
people, who are valiant supporters of the Palestinian cause,
Netanyahu phoned President Hosni Mubarak this morning to inform
him he was going ahead with the building plan.
</P>
<P>
In his first reaction to the anticipated decision, Jordan's
Crown Prince Hassan Tuesday informed Israel that he canceled his
visit to Israel at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the committee meeting, peace activists from the
left-wing Meretz Party and Peace Now organization demonstrated
outside the Prime Minister's Office demanding that the committee
put on hold the project.
</P>
<P>
Security was reinforced In Jerusalem and in parts of the West
Bank today for possible violent resistance by the Palestinians
over the issue of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident in Hizmeh village Tuesday evening further
complicated the security matters in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities are concerned that thousands of
Palestinians might resort to violence after prayers on Temple
Mount in Jerusalem's Old City Friday.

CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Niger today expressed
their concern about the volatile situation in the countries known
as the Great Lakes region of Africa and called for peaceful
settlement of the mounting hostilities.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Niger President Barre Mainassara appealed to the parties concerned
to reach a peaceful solution to the regional problems.
</P>
<P>
They called for more international support for maintaining
peace in the region and stressed the importance of respecting
international borders and national integrity of all countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region includes Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Uganda

rebels in the country. The three countries are all inflicted with
civil wars with ethnic Hutus against Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released at the end of Mainassara's three-day
visit, also reiterated the importance of Afro-Arab cooperation and
called for close cooperation between the Organization of African
Unity and the Organization of Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> "Flawed Advice" About Gulf War Syndrome: Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- There were "serious flaws" in
advice given to ministers about the use of harmful pesticides by
British forces in the Gulf War, said the British Ministry of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
A critical report by Sir Richard Mottram, the ministry's
permanent under-secretary released today, found wide-ranging
"internal confusion" in the Defense Ministry about the use of
harmful pesticides during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Ministers were made about the extent to which pesticides had
been deployed in the Gulf, and civil servants had failed to pass
on their knowledge in the appropriate way.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames was quizzed by MPs over
claims he misled the Commons on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He had told MPs that the pesticides were hardly used in the
war, but later had to admit their use had been widespread.
</P>
<P>
"Information was neither assessed nor followed up properly,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The internal inquiry could lead to disciplinary proceeding
against individual civil servants and officers.
</P>
<P>
Soames commissioned the inquiry in December after he was
forced to apologize to the House of Commons for misleading
parliament over the use of the pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Campaigners claim that these chemicals could be responsible for
Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
David Clark, shadow defense spokesman, wrote to Soames Monday,
demanding that he announce the findings of the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
"If Nicholas Soames takes seriously his responsibilities, he
will come to the House of Commons to make a fully public and
accountable statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Defense Minister Sir Archie Hamilton said ministers
could not be expected to know everything and Labor's claim was
election "hysteria."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Bombard South Lebanese Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces bombarded this
afternoon villages near the frontier of the so-called "security
zone" in south Lebanon in retaliation for a guerrilla attack
on an Israeli convoy in the buffer enclave.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that some 10 artillery shells fell
onto the village of Baraashit, Bint Jebeil, at 2:30 p.m. (1230
GMT), slightly wounding a 45-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also bombarded Iglim Al-Toffah, a mountainous
area some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut, which is often
used by Lebanese guerrillas as a springboard to launch attacks
on the Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis fired 155mm heavy artilleries at Jebal Rafih
and the vicinities of Sujoud, Rihan and Beit Yahoun, the security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
attacked this morning an Israeli convoy near an Israeli
position at Beit Yahoun, Beit Jebeil, without causing
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the Lebanese capital of Beirut,
the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that its fighters launched the attack at 9:00 a.m.
(0700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces started the bombardment in the
morning following the guerrilla operation, and several shells
hit the place some 50 meters away from the public school
in Baraashit.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who asked for anonymity, noted that today's clash
did not go beyond a daily trade of fire on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a top official of Hezbollah
warned today that his party would possibly resume Katyusha
attacks on northern Israel if the Jewish state continues
aggressions agaisnt Lebanese civilians.

<P>
They include Richard Nxumalo, Themba Msibi, Jan Sithole and
Jabulani Nxumalo, South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted

<HEADLINE> France, European Parliament Clash Over Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The French government and the
European Parliament today raised voices in their clash over the
new immigration law of France, which the European Parliament said
should be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The president of the European Parliament, Spanish conservative
deputy Jose Maria Gil-Robles who is on a visit here, today
canceled a meeting with French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette,
after the latter described the European Parliament as "not worth
its name."
</P>
<P>
"France considers it shocking that the European Parliament
could debate the questions which concern the sovereignty of its
member states and the responsibility of their governments and
national parliaments," said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would raise the issue at the next European
Union (EU) foreign ministers' session and during meetings of the
Inter-Governmental Council of the EU.
</P>
<P>
European deputies of the Strasbourg-based European Parliament
adopted last Thursday a resolution which said the new immigration
law of France reminded one of "appeals for denouncement" of
foreigners of the old times.
</P>
<P>
The text, adopted with 213 votes for and 118 against, was
presented by several Euro-deputies from the leftist and ecologist
parties of France itself.
</P>
<P>
The immigration law, also called the Debre bill in reference to
its author, French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, is strongly
contested at home as it requires French homes to apply for
certificates to accommodate foreigners and inform police their
time of departure from France.
</P>
<P>
France opposes strengthening of the power of the European
Parliament in the process of renovation of the EU mechanism, while
Germany and several other European countries want to see a bigger
role to be played by the European Parliament, the only
democratically elected establishment of the EU.
</P>
<P>
France could seize this opportunity to reaffirm the priority of
national parliaments of European countries over the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
So far, the power of the European Parliament is limited to
approve the EU annual budget and control the activities of the
European Commission, the executive organ of the EU.

ABU DHABI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada will send a new frigate
to the Gulf in April to strengthen the presence of a U.S.-led

<HEADLINE> TUC Pledges to Limit Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Trade Union Congress
(TUC) today pledged itself to minimizing industrial disputes as a
plan to reduce its potential to embarrass the future government
due to be elected in May.
</P>
<P>
A document entitled "Partners for Progress" called for
employers and unions to work together to solve problems in the
field of employment, particularly in training.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to be adversarial in industrial relations,"
John Monks, TUC general secretary, said in an interview with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to avoid strikes and seek far greater involvement
of third parties in conciliation and arbitration," he added.
</P>
<P>
Monks wanted to create "an active agenda with employers" to
improve corporate performance through improved training and
increased investment.
</P>
<P>
"Inherent in the social partnership model outlined in this
report is the need to minimize industrial disputes," the document
said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the aim of the document
is to ensure that unions could not be blamed for any future
collapse of a Labor government.
</P>
<P>
"The background is that two out of the last three periods of
Labor in office ended after disputes with unions," Monks said.
</P>
<P>
Persistent strikes during the 1970s made the unions very
unpopular.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
granted Zambia 320,000 U.S. Dollars for the setting up of a
skills training center for street kids in Lusaka under an
agreement signed here today.
</P>
<P>
The street kids to be taken in will acquire income-generating
skills such as bricklaying and carpentry instead of receiving
food through donations.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony French Charge d'Affairs Renaud Guibert
said the HIV/AIDS pandemic has made thousands of Zambian children
become orphans and that such a project will enable these orphans
to become self sustaining.
</P>
<P>
The phase one of the center needs 330,000 Dollars and the
French government has provided 320,000 Dollars while the other
10,000 Dollars will come from non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The French diplomat expressed his hope that many
non-governmental organizations will be involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
About 200 street kids will be trained once the first phase of
the center became operational.

<HEADLINE> Deng Praised by Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to China's national
legislature and members of its top advisory body from Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan have expressed their heartfelt condolences for
Deng Xiaoping and asserted their confidence in China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) and
members of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from the three regions
have gathered in Beijing to attend the fifth session of the NPC
and the fifth session of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The principle of "One country, two systems" is a
crystallization of Mr. Deng Xiaoping's painstaking effort and
wisdom, said Ng Hong Mun, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin Chi, a member of the NPC Standing Committee and
chairman of Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, said that,
though Mr. Deng has passed away, his lofty moral qualities and
noble spirit will forever inspire him and other Hong Kong
compatriots to march forward.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland in more
than 100 days and all social circles in Hong Kong should unite as
one and make Hong Kong even more splendid, and this is the best
condolence for Mr. Deng," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hu Hung-lick, a member of the Standing Committee of the
CPPCC National Committee and a well-respected lawyer, recalled
that Deng Xiaoping talked of the Hong Kong issue when he was
hosting a dinner in honor of some Hong Kong guests on China's
National Day, October 1, 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Deng talked about finding a way to resolve the Hong Kong issue
that is welcome by Hong Kong people, and this demonstrated his
foresightedness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Realities over the past years have shown that Deng Xiaoping's
theory on the reunification of the motherland is entirely correct,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Deng's 'one country, two systems" principle has created a
solid foundation for the reunification of the motherland, though
he was unable to live to see it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tong Seng Chiu, President of General Association of Trade
Unions of Macao and an NPC deputy, said that compatriots in Macao
will always cherish the historic contributions made by Deng
Xiaoping and do all work well to accomplish Deng's unfulfilled
wish.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies of Taiwan origin said that they admire Deng's
theory of "one country, two systems" and vowed to carry on Deng's
behest and redouble their efforts to work for the reunification of
the motherland.

<HEADLINE> HK Makes Breakthrough in Treating Liver Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese University of
Hong Kong has achieved a breakthrough in early diagnosis and
treatment of liver cancer, a spokesman of the university said here
today.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing, Philip Johnson, chairman of the Department
of Clinical Oncology, said researchers in the university have
discovered a new method called isoelectric to determine the nature
of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in different kinds of diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson, the higher the AFP level, the more likely
the patient has the cancer.
</P>
<P>
He said the method helps diagnose liver cancer at the early
stage and in turn increase the chances of curing the disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers of the university found that AFPs from
different clinical conditions give different bands in the gels
under the electric field.
</P>
<P>
He said that by examining the bands instead of using
radiological methods which can not detect tumors less than one
centimeter in size, doctors can accurately diagnose the clinical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Primary liver cancer is the number-two killer among all cancers
in Hong Kong. Figures from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry show that
more than 1,500 new cases are found each year and last year 1,200
patients died of liver cancer in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Joseph W. Y. Lau, chairman of the Department of Surgery of the
university, said they have also made a breakthrough in the
treatment of liver cancer through selective internal radiation
therapy.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have found that the use of 43 technetium labeled
macroaggregated albumin and gamma scan can accurately simulate the
actual treatment of selective internal radiation, which has made
the treatment safer and more effective in treating liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
Lau said the treatment method is effective for liver cancer
patients in severe condition.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Deputy To NPC On Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- When he was three, he was
selected as the reincarnated soul boy of a living Buddha of
Tibetan Buddhism, but he grew up as an expert of Tibetan study and
managed to become a professor in a leading British university.
</P>
<P>
Tudeng Nyima, a deputy of Tibetan nationality to the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), returned to Beijing from London
to attend the top legislature's fifth session due to open on March
1.
</P>
<P>
"I went to study in England at my own expense in 1991, and now
teach at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the
University of London," said Nyima, 54.
</P>
<P>
He is also director of the Tibetology Center in Sichuan
Province, southwest China, and vice-president of the Sichuan
Provincial School of Tibetan Language.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Nyima said that he heard of Deng Xiaoping's
passing away on radio the day before he left London.
</P>
<P>
"I have been very sad since then," he said. "Comrade Deng
Xiaoping always showed great concern for ethnic and religious
affairs, and played a key role in the publication of the 'Grand
Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary' in the early 1980s, a great event for
Tibetan culture."
</P>
<P>
He recalled how Deng responded promptly to a letter from Zhaxi
Cering, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, and personally experienced the
compilation and publication of the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
"I am now collaborating with some international Tibetologists
to translate it into a Tibetan-English dictionary, which to date
has entered the phase of final editing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also thanks to Deng's efforts to restore the status of
intellectuals and develop ethnic culture and education after the
Cultural Revolution, he said, the Sichuan Provincial School of
Tibetan Language was founded in 1981, which helped foster a large
number of successors to Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that each time he returns home, he is
impressed by drastic improvements in people's life and cultural
prosperity among various ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, we have published so many books and magazines
in Tibetan language that even some people abroad with a hostile
attitude toward China have to admit that Tibetan culture is being
carried on and further developed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would put forth two proposals during the coming
NPC session. One concerns the need to send books and magazines
about China's ethnic minorities, especially about Tibetan culture,
abroad for sale, to help foreign scholars acquire a better
understanding of the development of Tibetology in China.
</P>
<P>
"I will also ask the government to arrange short-term lectures
abroad for scholars of different ages of the Tibetan ethnic group,
to help foreigners know the real Tibet, and widen the horizons of
young scholars," he added.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Investigation of Reported Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- France today called for an
international investigation into the reported genocide in the
rebel-controlled eastern region of Zaire, where half a million
Rwandan Hutu refugees were reported missing.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
the report, given by a Western witness in eastern Zaire and
published in Belgium earlier this week, "seems reliable."
</P>
<P>
The testimony on the massacres in eastern Zaire and the
discovery of mass graves there "seems reliable and has aroused a
very strong feeling," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"If the facts reported in the localities cited in this
testimony were effectively proved, it would be necessary to check
if these acts were generalized in the whole of Zaire and conducted
with a deliberate will," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the consequences to be drawn from the genocide
would be "evidently very grave" and that "only an international
inquiry with all the guarantee of objectivity could allow one to
establish truth in an inescapable way."

<HEADLINE> European SMEs Need More Financial Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in Europe need more support from bankers to
compete with companies around the world, said a EU report
published today.
</P>
<P>
Four out of every five SMEs rely on bank overdrafts and loans
as their primary source of funding, and most of the firms remain
under-capitalized all the time, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, published after one year's study by a team on how
to improve SME financing, examined bankers' best practices, such
as risk assessments, treatment of high-risk clients and incentives
for successful SMEs.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, responsible for enterprise
policy, said in his foreword to the report, "it not only
constitutes a valuable exchange of experience and opinion, but
that it succeeds in moving forward the whole dialogue between
banks and SMEs, providing a firm foundation for future work."
</P>
<P>
He added that only a genuine and long-term commitment on both
sides can help small companies to build a sound footing for their
financial affairs.

<HEADLINE> Deng's Memory Cherished by CPPCC National Committee Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- With profound grief over the
loss of Deng Xiaoping, members of China's top advisory body have
come to attend the annual session of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today.
</P>
<P>
But this time, when they stepped into the imposing Great Hall
of the People, they cherished all the more the memory of Deng
Xiaoping, the late venerable Chinese leader who was reputed as the
founder of CPPCC's work in the new historical period.
</P>
<P>
Many members, who had participated in the Fifth National
Committee of the CPPCC, could not helping recalling the First
Session of the Fifth CPPCC National Committee held in the spring
of 1978, at which Deng Xiaoping was elected chairman of the Fifth
National Committee. And a new historical period for the
development of the political consultative cause has since been
ushered in.
</P>
<P>
Fang Rongxin, member of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
CPPCC National Committee and vice-chairman of the Chinese Peasants
and workers Democratic Party, noted that Deng Xiaoping led the
work of the CPPCC quickly back onto the correct track after a
decade of turmoil and wrote a new chapter for the cause of the
CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Fang, also a a deputy secretary-general of the Fifth CPPCC
National Committee, added that Deng laid the foundation and
chartered the correct orientation for the CPPCC work.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old Wang Fu, a CPPCC National Committee member from
the educational circle, said with tears swelling in his eyes, that
he first met Deng at the first session of the Fifth CPPCC National
Committee. Deng was good at bringing their initiative into play,
and filled him with political enthusiasm, he said, adding that he
had subsequently set forth more than 20 proposals every year.
</P>
<P>
Ma Shigong, a CPPCC National Committee member donned in a
Moslem white hat, pledged to study Deng's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics assiduously, and took an
active part in discussion on government affairs and suggested ways
and means. Meanwhile, he said, he will work hard to uphold
national unity and promote the unity of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong member Annie Wu Suk-ching said she cherished deeply
the memory of Deng Xiaoping at the eve of the realization of his
framework of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
She said she will work hard to perform her duties well, so as
to contribute to China's economic development and opening-up
drive, as well as to Hong Kong's smooth return to the embrace of
the motherland as well as its prosperity and stability.

MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian
Development Bank today approved a 69-million-U.S.-dollar loan to
Vietnam for a water supply and sanitation project.
</P>
<P>
The project will help more than a million Vietnamese, mainly in
low and middle-income groups, and businesses and industries in
seven provincial towns get cleaner and more plentiful water.
</P>
<P>
Currently, less than half of Vietnam's urban population receive
piped water, much of which is of poor quality. Water-borne
diseases cause up to a third of all deaths and an even higher rate
of infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
While improving urban environment and health, the project will
also design an environmental education program to increase public

<HEADLINE> New College Students in 1997 to Pay Tuition Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China will abolish the system
of state financial aid for its college students in 1997, an
official from the top education organ said here today.
</P>
<P>
To reform the past practice, the state will no longer cover
tuition costs for college recruits, with the exception of those
enrolled by colleges and departments of teaching, agriculture,
forestry, mining, public security and other majors needed urgently
by the country, the official with the State Education Commission
(SEC) said.
</P>
<P>
To date, 60 percent of the students in China's 1,035
universities and colleges are required to pay their own tuition,
which is about one fifth of their total expenses during their
college years, according to SEC statistics released late last year.
</P>
<P>
China's universities and colleges will enroll a total of 1.01
million full-time students in 1997, 45,000 more than in 1996. In
addition, over 900,000 others, or 35,000 more than last year, are
expected to attend a variety of adult training schools of higher
learning, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese college students did not pay tuition or
even living expenses during their campus careers, but were
required to accept jobs allocated by governmental authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the number of students studying in universities or
colleges in China was only 5.68 million -- just a tiny fraction of
the country's 1.2 billion population.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the SEC plans to expand the nation's higher
education system by enrolling 6.3 million students, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Other SEC officials pointed out that immediate problems stand
in the way of the development of higher education, such as
excessive growth of universities and colleges, insufficient
funding and poor administrative setup.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also said the dates of college entrance examinations
will not be moved up, and will remain on July 7-9.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Voluntary Tree Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Voluntary tree planting, which
was initiated by the late leader Deng Xiaoping, will continue to
be carried out throughout China, a senior Chinese official has
told a national conference on afforestation.
</P>
<P>
"We will carry out the behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and push
forward the voluntary tree planting drive around the country,"
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun told the 16th Plenary Meeting of the
National Afforestation Committee (NAC), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who died at the age 93 on February 19, launched the drive
16 years ago. He earnestly practised what he advocated while he
was able.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also director of the NAC, said the voluntary drive has
made remarkable contributions to greening the country in the past
16 years.
</P>
<P>
China's forest coverage rate has risen to 13.9 percent from
12.7 percent in the 1980s, and almost all the barren hills and
mountains in 12 provinces and autonomous regions have been made
green.
</P>
<P>
The urban green-coverage rate increased to 23.8 percent from
19.2 percent in the same period, and the per capita public green
area has reached 5.7 sq m.
</P>
<P>
However, the task of afforestation in China is still an arduous
and protracted one, since the country has more than 2.6 million sq
km of desertificated land, which is expanding at a rate of 2,400
sq km each year, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Reckless lumbering in some areas of central and western China
also makes afforestation very difficult, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Desertification control in the central and western parts of
the country is very important for local economic development and
improvement of the whole country's ecological environment," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Various kinds of measures should be taken and the whole of
society should be mobilized to participate in the voluntary tree
planting drive," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Croatia to Strengthen Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Croatia agreed
today to apply counter-trade schemes to forge trade and economic
ties between the two countries, a senior Indonesian official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia is interested to import Indonesian coal, while
Indonesia wants to purchase fishing boats from the Balkan state,"
State Minister/Secretary Moerdiono said after President Soeharto
and Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa held talks at the
Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
"President Soeharto considers the counter-trade scheme as
beneficial to both sides," Moerdiono said, adding that Croatia
needs at least 1.5 million tons of coal per year.
</P>
<P>
On the trade sector, he said that Croatia offered to become
Indonesia's gateway for its products to East European countries.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono also said Indonesia is considering the possibility of
helping bring the Croatians living in Australia back to their
country.
</P>
<P>
"There are about 250,000 Croatians living in Australia wishing
to return to their homeland," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders today also witnessed the signing of agreements
on economic and technical cooperation and an aviation cooperation
agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Matesa arrived here Wednesday for a five-day state visit to
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> New Book on Gulf War to Be Published in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A new book on the Gulf
War and the Kuwaiti resistance against the Iraqi occupation in
1990 would be published here as well as in Australia in March,
author John Levins said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian-Irish author said that his book "Days of Fear"
which runs 672 pages was "a comprehensive tapestry" covering
numerous aspects of Kuwait's struggle against Iraqi occupation
forces during the period.
</P>
<P>
It is so far the most comprehensive writing by a foreign
writer on how Kuwait's armed forces and people resisted the
aggression against their country.
</P>
<P>
Levins was resident in Kuwait when the invasion occurred on
August 2, 1990, and remained here until late December 1990.
</P>
<P>
He added that his prime motive for writing the book was to
"put balance into the story, show how in many ways the Kuwaiti
people and armed forces were instrumental in their own defense
and liberation" and refute a myth created by some news media
that "Kuwaitis sat in Cairo Hotels and paid western soldiers to
liberate them."
</P>
<P>
He said the book documented many hitherto unreported details
on how Kuwaitis resisted, organized military operations and
collected intelligence for the allied forces.
</P>
<P>
Levins pointed out that "a lot of this intelligence is
probably still classified."
</P>
<P>
In the book, there are also well-researched facts on
international diplomacy associated with the events, as well as
what happened to Kuwaitis under occupation.
</P>
<P>
The book also covers stories of a number of Kuwaitis who are
still missing as prisons of war (POWs) and foreign residents in
Kuwait, including Westerners and Arabs as well as Asians.
</P>
<P>
Levins sumed up the aim of his book as "to provide balance and
fill a gap in history."

<HEADLINE> SSA Company Makes Successful Start In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The System Software Associates
Company (SSA) from the US claims to have made a splendid start in
China this year by winning eight major Chinese companies'
agreements to buy its business management software during its
first fiscal year, through January.
</P>
<P>
The eight companies include the Shenzhen-based Konka Electronic
Group, a Chinese color TV giant, and the Qilu Petrochemical
Company in East China's Shandong Province. SSA's BPCS
client/server is designed to help companies achieve coordinated
management of supply, production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xu, manager of the marketing department, attributed the
company's success to its efforts in creating a market for business
management software at a time when Chinese companies are trying to
adapt to the needs of the new market economy.
</P>
<P>
Another secret of SSA's success in China is that SSA (China)
Co., Ltd, has all Chinese nationals at managerial level, Zhang
said, adding that this is also one area where SSA is different
from other foreign companies in China.
</P>
<P>
SSA (China) oversees business on the Chinese mainland, and in
Taiwan and Hong Kong. Last year SSA moved its Asia and Pacific
headquarters to Beijing, further highlighting its awareness of the
importance of China.

<P>
SHENYANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Construction of Liaoyang
Efacec Electrical Equipment Co. (LEEEC), a Sino-Portuguese joint
venture, was completed Wednesday in the city of Liaoyang in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
LEEEC is the only Sino-Portuguese business in the province, and
also one of Portugal's most highly-financed ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Portuguese President Joroe Sampaio attended a
ribbon-cutting ceremony for the venture Wednesday.
</P>

Portugal, which is a comprehensive electrical and industrial
equipment conglomerate with advanced technology and management
expertise. The establishment of the joint venture, involving a
total investment of 22.6 million U.S. dollars, was first announced
in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
In addition to building closed workshops and an office building
of multiple uses, and rebuilding existing workshops, the new
company has also imported 331 sets of world-class transformer
manufacturing equipment from Portugal and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will adopt the modern management methods used
by the Portuguese company and will produce various kinds of
transformers in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will formally go into production in July.

MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The giant U.S. soft drink
company Coca-Cola today disclosed plans to expand its operations
in the Philippines with a total investment of 45 billion pesos
(1.72 billion U.S. dollars) for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Ivester, the Coca-Cola president who arrived in the
country to open a new bottling plant, made the announcement during
a courtesy call on President Fidel Ramos in the Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Ivester told Ramos that the Coca-Cola's expansion program is a
strong indication of the company's confidence in the Philippine
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramos welcomed the increased participation of Coca-Cola Company
in the country, adding that the firm's decision to expand its
operations came "at an opportune time".
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Ivester presented to Ramos a copy of the
Coca-Cola's commemorative book.
</P>
<P>
"Coca-Cola and the Philippines have had a very close
relationship. In 1981, our joint venture with San Miguel (Beer)
Corporation became the first between the Coca-Cola company and a
local bottler anywhere in the world," Ivester said.

<HEADLINE> German Rail Disrupted by Suspected Anti-Nuclear Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Suspected anti-nuclear activists
continued to disrupt Germany's rail transport today ahead of a
planned controversial transport of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that train services were seriously
affected in the northern German port city of Hamburg, with several
signal facilities being manipulated by people who, the police
said, had left behind leaflets mentioning the planned nuclear
transport.
</P>
<P>
In the state of Schleswig-Holstein, signal switch boxes at
railway crossings were fired, which disrupted commuter services to
nearby Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
The sabotages followed Tuesday attacks on overhead power lines
for electric trains in the states of Brandenburg, Berlin, Hesse,
Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, which stranded trains and
caused delays of up to three hours.
</P>
<P>
The latest nuclear transport is due to begin on Friday and to
reach a temporary underground storage depot at Gorleben, Lower
Saxony state, on March 2. The shipment includes four containers of
waste from nuclear power plants in southern Germany and three
others from the French nuclear recycling plant at La Hague.
</P>
<P>
The transport will be protected by 30,000 police and the
security cost is estimated around 100 million marks (60 million
U.S. dollars). The last such shipment costed 46 million marks
(27.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Violent protest over the planned nuclear transport has fueled
heated debate today in the parliament. Government parties accuse
the Greens Party of encouraging people against the rule of law and
as a result to undermine democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Greens warned against the possibly similar impact of the
1986 Chernobyl accident, saying nuclear radiation knew no
"borders."
</P>
<P>
The Greens and the Party of Democratic Socialism want a ban on
nuclear waste transports and have supported the recent mass
protest against the rail shipment of waste fuel rods from nuclear
power stations.

<HEADLINE> Britons Clone First Sheep Out of Frozen Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- British scientists created the
world's first cloned sheep out of frozen cells, which might lead
to recreating the dead from frozen tissue, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists cloned the sheep Dolly, the first animal
successfully created by non-sexual method, from frozen cells,
including a ewe's egg cell and a mammary gland cell taken from
another ewe, the firm sponsoring the research disclosed on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists conceded that human cells frozen in controlled
conditions and protected with certain chemicals could possibly be
cloned, thus replicating a person.
</P>
<P>
This means that people who were deep frozen after death may one
day be brought back to life, reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ian Wilmut, head of the research team, denied on
Tuesday that he has taken science to the brink of cloning humans,
saying they are still nowhere near doing that.
</P>
<P>
He said the technique would undoubtly benefit humanity,
bringing in new fronts in fighting genetic diseases, such as AIDs.
</P>
<P>
The genetic breakthrough had immediately touched off a
controversy on what unethnic scientists might do with the
technique, such as using it to copy humans.
</P>
<P>
Liberal democrat legislator David Alton on Wednesday called on
the government to halt cloning experiments and start a public
debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Agriculture Minister Tony Baldry dismissed claims that
the cloning of animals could lead to farmyard mutants or assembly
lines of humans, saying it would instead help developments in
breeding and conservation.
</P>
<P>
"The reason the work has been done is that it makes selective
breeding more rapid, efficient and cost effective," Baldry
said. "It will be possible to breed livestock better adapted to
changing environments more quickly than previously possible."

HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Record numbers of Hong Kong
manufacturers have participated in pavilions organized by the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) at major toy fairs in New
York, the United States, and Nuremberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
According to a TDC spokesman, 51 companies in Hong Kong's
pavilion at the 94th American International Toy Fair from February
14 to 17 in New York came away with total orders worth 18.4
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An 84-company Hong Kong delegation to the Nuremberg
International Toy Fair in early February did total business worth
24.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at the two fairs, Hong Kong had the
biggest overseas contingent, reflecting manufacturers' eagerness
to position themselves for an anticipated market revival.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total toy exports exceed 10 billion dollars per
year, with the United States as the top market, followed by Japan,
Britain, Germany, China, Canada, France, Italy and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Louis Ho, TDC's senior manager for trade promotion, said market
conditions are expected to be improved considerably in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the most impressive growth will probably be in selected
categories like electronic or educational playthings and toys that
inspire creativity.

<HEADLINE> HK's Trading Center Status to Remain Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's status as a
major trading center will not change in the near future and coming
years, said a report released by Standard Chartered Bank here
today.
</P>
<P>
It said the recent agreement between Taiwan and the Chinese
mainland to have direct shipping links between Fujian Province and
Kaohsiung will only have a very mild impact on Hong Kong's trade.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, it said, if direct cross-strait trade
between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is allowed, Hong Kong's
status as a major trading center will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that direct shipping links between Taiwan and
the Chinese mainland will divert more trade from Hong Kong. It is
estimated that overall cross-strait re-exports and transshipment
trade handled through Hong Kong accounts for about 7.5 percent of
Hong Kong's total trade.
</P>
<P>
In later January, the shipping sectors of the Chinese mainland
and Taiwan reached consensus on technical issues concerning direct
shipping between the two selected ports of Fuzhou and Xiamen of
the Chinese mainland and the Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Start of such shipping services may divert some of the
transshipment trade currently handled by Hong Kong to Kaohsiung in
the future. However, the trade that will be affected is estimated
to be small, as Xiamen and Fuzhou are relatively small ports.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, the report said, there will also be new
trading opportunities for Hong Kong as the vast central and
western provinces and regions on the Chinese mainland are growing
with a gradual shift in the Chinese government's preferential
policies toward the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
It said that for many of these provinces, Hong Kong is
geographically a more convenient port than most of the ports along
China's coasts.
</P>
<P>
It said the operation of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway will
further enhance Hong Kong's status as a trading center.

HONG KONG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang said today that Hong Kong's GDP is expected
to have a growth of 5.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his Budget Prelude Speech to the Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association, Tsang said Hong Kong would start life as a Special
Administrative Region of China in sound economic shape, with every
prospect of remaining the most attractive business location in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said the forecast GDP growth rate is about the right,
sustainable level for Hong Kong's mature economy.
</P>
<P>
"This would give us another year of solid economic performance,
with growth very much in line with our medium-term forecast of 5
percent."
</P>
<P>
He expected the economy to perform better in foreign trade and
the growth rate of private consumption expenditure to pick up to
5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment will remain low. Stronger earnings and a tighter
labor market will boost consumer confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's status as a Special Administrative Region
will create new trade and investment opportunities as the
modernization process continues to transform the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"We forecast that Hong Kong's exports of services will grow by
8 percent. Total exports of goods will grow by 8.5 percent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation for 1997 is expected to rise at a somewhat
higher rate than last year and an average increase of 7 percent is
forecast.

<HEADLINE> Mock Hijack to Test System: Indian Officials </HEADLINE>

NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian officials said today
that the reported hijacking of an Indian plane earlier in the day
was actually a "mock hijack" to test the security system.
</P>
<P>
The hijack turned out to be a "mock exercise" to test the
response of the security drill and the aircraft landed here safely

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Commentary To Mark Taiwan's "February 28 Uprising" (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary calls on the Chinese people to continue to
follow the basic principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one
country, two systems," and implement President Jiang Zemin's
eight-point proposal on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
During the struggle against separatism and "Taiwan
independence," the lifestyles of the Taiwan compatriots and their
desire to be their own masters were fully understood and respected.
</P>
<P>
It calls on the people to "still pin high hope on the Taiwan
people," strive to encourage the promotion of the relations across
the straits and make preparations for the realization of the
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
In total defiance of the desires of the compatriots on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits, the Taiwan authorities not only
continued their attempts to create in the international community
the concepts of "two Chinas" and "one China and one Taiwan," but
also tried to hinder the development of relations across the
straits.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, in an effort to deny Taiwan's status as one of
China's provinces and further create conditions for separating,
the Taiwan authorities convened the so-called Conference on
National Development, during which participants claimed to change
the administrative organization of the Taiwan province, an act
that moves dangerously toward the "nullification of the province,"
the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people firmly oppose the separatist activities of
"two Chinas" and "one China and one Taiwan" launched by the Taiwan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
It points out that all the Chinese people, including the Taiwan
compatriots, have reached a consensus on Taiwan's legal status as
a province of China's administrative division, and the fact that
it is part of China.
</P>
<P>
All this cannot be changed by the separatist powers, including
the "Taiwan independence" activists, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities act willfully against history and the
people, their actions will only be ignored by history and the
people.
</P>
<P>
On July 1 this year, China will resume its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong. This will have a significant and
profound influence on national spirit and will push forward the
process of reunifying the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The compatriots should continue to work for the reunification.
</P>
<P>
On the 50th anniversary of the "February 28 Uprising," the
commentary says, we express full respect for the uprising's
patriotic and democratic spirit and deeply understand the desire
of the Taiwan compatriots to be master of their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
We, together with the Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese,
should hold high the banner of patriotism and act with one heart
and mind to make historic contributions to the reunification of
the motherland and the overall rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation.

<HEADLINE> Discovery Shows Sophisticated Lifestyle in Northern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Three 400,000-year-old spears,
the oldest complete hunting weapons found to date, have been
unearthed in Germany, indicating the earliest northern Europeans
were sophisticated hunters.
</P>
<P>
The spruce spears, the largest of which is seven feet long and
about two inches wide, were surrounded by the butchered remains of
at least 14 horses, archaeologist Dr. Hartmut Thieme of the
Institute of Denkmalpflege reported in today's science journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
The site, now an open-cast coal mine, was probably a hunting
station at the edge of a lake where hunters sharpened their tools,
cut up the meat of horses and other large animals such as rhinos,
and possibly cooked it over rough hearths.
</P>
<P>
At the time, said Dr. Thieme, Europe was coming to the end of
an interglacial period and the climate would have been comparable
to that of central Norway today -- relatively cold with meadows and
forests.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the spears destroys current theories that the
first humans to colonize northern Europe were opportunistic
scavengers who were only capable of reacting to
circumstances. Until now, humans were thought to have had very
primitive lifestyles before the emergence of art and finely-honed
tools about 40,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But this new evidence suggests that, 10 times earlier than
that, they were planning hunting expeditions in advance and
meticulously crafting weapons.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and American
researchers have completed all conceptual designs for a one
million kilowatt pressed-water nuclear power plant, the first of
its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Qian Juexin, Engineer-in-Chief with the Shanghai
Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute who is also
responsible for the plans, the design work was done by Qian's
institute, together with the Shanghai Nuclear Power Office, East
China Electric Power Design Institute and Westinghouse of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese partners drafted plans for the nuclear island and
conventional island, while the U.S. was in charge of mapping out
the nuclear steam supply system.
</P>
<P>
Qian explained that the cooperation is aimed at making full use
of and effectively absorbing the world's advanced experience and
promoting widely-accepted commercial nuclear power stations which
will not only suit China's situations, but also require lower
production costs compared with similar nuclear stations elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the finished conceptual designs, Qian said,
China's million-kilowatt pressed water nuclear power plant will
approach the current world advanced standards.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Commentary To Mark Taiwan's "February 28 Uprising" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- A commentary to be carried in
Friday's People's Daily, marking the 50th anniversary of Taiwan's
"February 28 Uprising," calls on the Chinese people to carry
forward the patriotic and democratic spirit and promote the
peaceful reunification of the motherland,
</P>
<P>
The commentary expresses deep sorrow for those who died in the
uprising 50 years ago and extends warm regards to the broad masses
of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The "February 28 Uprising" was launched by the people of Taiwan
in 1947, in response to Chiang Kai-Shek's intransigence. The
action eventually led to an armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
The uprising was the first large-scale patriotic and democratic
movement initiated by the Taiwan people to resist the Kuomintang's
autocratic rule since the recovery of sovereignty over Taiwan in
1945, which followed the victory of the War of Resistance against
the Japanese Aggression. The uprising was also an important
component of the whole nation's opposition to the autocratic rule
of the Kuomintang government, it says.
</P>
<P>
The patriotic and democratic spirit displayed by the Taiwan
compatriots in the "February 28 Uprising" will last forever in the
Chinese history, it says, noting any fabrication of charges and
distortion against it are in vain.
</P>
<P>
Historical records of first-hand accounts of the uprising have
irrefutably proved that its main objective was to fight corruption
and demand democracy and autonomy, but there was no recorded
evidence to suggest the demand for establishing an independent
country, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
However, it says, in an attempt to crack down on the uprising,
the Kuomintang government invented a groundless charge that the
uprising was "revolting against the motherland." This is vicious
slander, it says.

<TEXT>
<P>
From then on, it notes, certain forces on the island that have
advocated the "independence of Taiwan" have tried every means to
label the uprising an "exclusive" or "Taiwan independence"
movement, alleging that the "February 28 Uprising" was the
beginning of the "Taiwan independence" movement.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sheer blasphemy and insult against the Taiwan
compatriots involved in the uprising and a wanton distortion of
the facts," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted, it says, that some of the Taiwan
authorities have allied themselves with the forces promoting
"Taiwan independence" by advocating the "doctrine of new
Taiwanese." Their purpose is to separate the interest of the
Taiwan people from that of the whole Chinese nation and create a
conflict between them, so as to mislead the Taiwan compatriots
down the road of splitting the island from China, the commentary
adds.
</P>
<P>
"But we firmly believe that the broad masses of the Taiwan
people are able to see through and fight the malicious political
plot," it says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party and government have always
understood, respected, trusted and relied on the Taiwan
compatriots, it says, adding that it is necessary to consult with
the Taiwan compatriots when handling the Taiwan issue, to take the
interest of the Taiwan people into consideration and to respect
their lifestyles and wish of "being real masters of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
After a peaceful reunification of the motherland in accordance
with the concept of "one country, two system," Taiwan will enjoy a
high degree of autonomy within the framework of China as one
country, it says.
</P>
<P>
This not only meets the demand for democracy and autonomy
expressed by the Taiwan people half a century ago, but also is in
line with the wish of the Taiwanese to become the real masters of
the island, the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand to Settle Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of
Malaysia and Thailand today agreed to solve their two countries'
problem of border demarcation within two months.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir Mohamad and visiting Chavalit Yongchaiyudh reached the
agreement during their talks here today, Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a news conference after the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The problem has been discussed at different levels, "but now
the principle has been established and the problem of border
demarcation will be resolved within two months or 60 days," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The principle is that in deciding this border demarcation
where you have the border involving rivers and the rivers keep
shifting because of floods, it is important to have a permanent
border not to be affected by the shifting of the rivers and there
should be a principle of No Gain No Loss, Win-Win situation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that there should be more activities
along the border and joint development approaches adopted to
benefit both countries, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
A land bridge linking the two countries also came up for
discussion between the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
They also touched on the sale of gas by a Malaysian company to
Thailand, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that there are very good relations between two
countries, the two prime ministers would like to see the bilateral
relations continue to improve especially in areas of trade and
mutual investment, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed therefore that a joint committee on trade and a
joint business council will be formed, hoping that they would
help increase trade between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Malaysia and Thailand has been growing steadily
from 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1994 to 4.9 billion dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about illegal immigration along the
Malaysian-Thai border, the foreign minister said the leaders did
not discuss this.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the enlargement of ASEAN, of which both
Malaysia and Thailand are members, Abdullah said there was no talk
on the issue between Mahathir and Chavalit.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit arrived here earlier today for a two-day official
visit to Malaysia at the invitation of Mahathir.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries have asked the
United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency session
to challenge Israel's new housing plan in East Jerusalem,
Palestinian U.N. representative Nasser al-Qodwa said today.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the Security Council are ready to confront
Israel's settlement activity, he told Voice of Arab radio of
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the Israeli decision to build new Jewish housing
units in East Jerusalem, the Palestinian official said Jerusalem
is an Arab city, which will "remain Arab eternally."
</P>
<P>
"Its status will never be determined by statements voiced by
Israel's Prime Minister (Binyamin Netanyahu)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs
approved Wednesday the construction of 6,500 housing units in
Har Homa settlement, a tree-covered hill taken by Israel in the
1967 Mideast War. Another 3,000 homes would be built for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdul-Meguid
Wednesday night denounced the measure, saying that it is aimed at
Judaizing the holy city and creating a fait accompli to preempt
the peace talks on final status in March.
</P>
<P>
He called for a unified Arab stance in the face of this
"dangerous" attitude of Israel, which he described as an act
defying the international community.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Vessels on Visit to Three Southeast Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese military ships
weighed anchor here this afternoon, on the start of visits to
Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The vessels, guided missile destroyer No. 113 and guided
missile corvette No. 542, were led by Vice Admiral Yang Yushu,
commander of the East China Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
This is the second overseas visit by the PLA navy within a
week. On February 20, a formation left for four American countries
of the United States, Mexico, Peru and Chile. The current journey
will cover a total of nearly 7,000 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
Prior to departure, Yang told reporters that Chinese naval
vessels have made trips to southeast Asian nations four times.
</P>
<P>
The "Zhenghe" ocean training ship of the PLA navy sailed to
Thailand in 1990 and 1993. The current trip marks the first time
for PLA navy vessels to visit Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the development of friendly relations with
neighboring nations has always been a priority of the Chinese
military's foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he said, the destination of the first official visit
of the PLA navy was three south Asian nations -- Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Yang said these visits increased the friendly relations and
understanding between these countries and China, as well as their
armed forces and the PLA.
</P>
<P>
The PLA naval vessels have made a total of 11 trips to 14
countries, eight of which are in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Vice Admiral Shi Yunsheng, commander of the PLA navy, and other
Chinese military and government officials saw Yang and his fleet
off.

<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's recent visit to China was helpful for
maintaining the development momentum of Sino-US relations, Chinese
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question at a routine press conference, Tang
said that during Albright's stay in China both sides deepened
their mutual understanding through discussions on Sino-US
relations, and international and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
"With joint efforts from both sides," he noted, "bilateral
relations have witnessed development recently."
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton defined the
principles for further improvement of Sino-US relations in Manila
in November last year, and the two leaders will exchange state
visits this year and next, according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, US Vice-President Al Gore will soon visit China at
the invitation of Premier Li Peng, and bilateral ties now face a
new opportunity for improvement, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to strengthen dialogue and co-operation with
the US," the spokesman said. "Meanwhile, China hopes that the US
side will strictly observe the principles set out in the three
Sino-US joint communiques, and handle the Taiwan issue in a
cautious and proper way so as to keep the development momentum of
bilateral ties."

<HEADLINE> Hussein, Arafat Talk on Jerusalem Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan, in a
telephone conversations today, exchanged views with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the Israeli decision to
construct new Jewish settlements in the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the impact of the Israeli approval of new
settlements on the Middle East peace process, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to follow up closely with the situation
in a bid to push forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government Wednesday formally approved the
construction of the Har Homa new Jewish settlement of some 6,500
housing units in East Jerusalem despite strong opposition by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and other Arab States.
</P>
<P>
Hussein has urged Israel to reconsider its decision on
approving the new housing plan in the controversial city, saying
that it would fuel anger which could threaten the peace
negotiations in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
recently, the Jordanian king said that the decision was bound to
shake the credibility of the peace process as a whole and fuel
anger which would create violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan considers East Jerusalem as a Palestinian
territory occupied by Israel and any change to its status
unilaterally before reaching a final agreement with the PNA
constitutes a real danger to peace.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Cashew Nut Delegation Set for India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will soon send a
delegation to India to promote its export of cashew nut, the
"Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the delegation comprising of government
officials and members of the Cashew Trade Association of Nigeria
(CASHTAN) will leave for India next month, before the start of
the new season.
</P>
<P>
India buys 95 percent of Nigeria's cashew nut exports.
However, the report said, Nigerian cashew nut has a reputation of
poor quality, so it can sell only at low prices at the
international market.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Nigerian cashew nut sold for only 500 to 600 U.S.
Dollars a ton on free-on-board terms, compared to 1,200 Dollars a
ton for those from Tanzania, Mozambique, Indonesia, Guinea Bissau
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
This led to a loss of one billion Naira (about 12.5 million
Dollars) to Nigerian exporters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the delegation will try to convince Indian
importers of the improved quality of Nigerian cashew nut and
secure immediate orders against the new season.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Made to Put Out Fire at Paradip Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Hectic efforts are being
made by Paradip Port Trust Authorities in India's eastern state of
Orissa to put out a big fire which has engulfed a huge stock of
coal near the cargo berth of the port, the Press Trust of India
(PTI) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-meter-high flames have so far consumed about 10,000
tons of coal and thick smoke has filled up the area for the last
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 tons of coal, kept in four piles, were to be
shipped to Tamil Nadu to meet the needs of the thermal power
station there.
</P>
<P>
The Paradip port had never piled up such a large quantity of
coal before. The arrival of more coal from the Talcher collieries
due to the availability of more railway wagons and a sharp
decrease in ships available for transporting the coal to Tamil
Nadu had resulted in the pileup, the PTI quoted the Port Trust
Authorities as saying.
</P>
<P>
No cause has been given for the fire.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Dispute in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of policemen have
been brought into Jerusalem today to deal with possible violence
stemming from the Israeli government's decision to build a new
Jewish neighborhood in the city.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial committee on Jerusalem, headed by Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, approved the controversial plan
Wednesday to build 6,500 Jewish homes, in addition to
construction of 3,015 units for Arabs in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the building plan,
saying the Israeli government's decision is a violation of law
and its agreements with the Palestinians, and has put the
peace process in danger.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
called on the UN Security Council and the Arab League to
help stop the construction in Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who returned from a meeting of the Higher Jerusalem
committee in Morocco Wednesday, said before his return, "The
attempt to settle on Jabal Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) is an
attempt to surround Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
PNA Secretary Ahmed Abud Rahman said that Arafat is very
worried about the peace process, warning that a new conflict over
Jerusalem could spark uncontrolled violence.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, PNA official on Jerusalem affairs, told
Israel Radio that what he smells in the air is Intifada
(uprising), the same as he did just after the opening of the
Western Wall tunnel exit last September.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tunnel had led to a serious violent
confrontation between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian policemen,
which left over 70 dead and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians are fearing that a Jewish-dominated Har Homa will
cut the link between the self-rule areas in the West Bank and Arab
sections in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Har Homa is located in the middle of the one large undeveloped
area of Jerusalem in the southeast, which links Bethlehem to Abu
Dis. But its location is described differently by the Israeli and
Palestinian sides to emphasize their own respective surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis is mentioned in an Israeli-Palestinian proposal as the
major part of a future sovereign Palestinian Jerusalem and
therefore is a crucial element in permanent status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli High Court of Justice rejected appeals by both Jewish
and Arab landowners and approved expropriations, and the Peace
Now, an Israeli left-wing group, has said that it will once again
challenge the construction in the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian objections to the Har Homa project go beyond the
simple fact that it is built on land Israel seized from Jordan in
the 1967 war and therefore constitutes in their eyes an illegal
settlement.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Har Homa is seen as one unit in a string of
Jewish neighborhoods planned across south Jerusalem, starting
north of Gilo with Givat Matos, east to Givat Arba, on to Har Homa
and continuing to Havat Mazmoriya.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the housing for Arabs is to be spread out
among 10 other neighborhoods which are not in politically crucial
locations.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish population in east Jerusalem is 165,000, according
to Israeli sources, while the Arab population is 161,000. "So if
Israel builds this big neighborhood we have a larger Jewish
majority there," said Halil Tufakji, a cartographer who advises
the PNA.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the final status Israel had in mind takes clear
shape with the Har Homa project.

NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has

depletion of valuable forest resources in many parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his ministry received 292 applications last
year from individuals who wanted to venture in the saw-milling
business, but only half of them were approved.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the high number of saw mills had
caused forests to "disappear at an alarming rate" without a
corresponding move to plant more trees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenyan farmers were directed to stop burning their
fields so as to reduce the high rate of forest fires which
have destroyed large tracts of forests in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, forest fires have been
raging in Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon, Keiyo and Makueni areas.
</P>
<P>
Fires in the northern part of Mount Kenya have caused damage
to vegetation stretching for about 20 square kilometers and
indigenous cedar and olive forests, hundreds of acres of softwood
plantation and manure trees have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
In Nakuru District, fierce fire is raging in Tiret, Neswit and
Marioshoni forests, destroying more than 500 hectares of forests
on the Menengai Hill and its environs near Nakuru Town, about 165
kilometers northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Government officials attributed the wide-spreading forest
fires in the country mainly to the burning of farm fields in
preparation for the coming planting season. enditem

<HEADLINE> PNA Condemns Israeli Decision on Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority issues a statement in Gaza Wednesday night strongly
condemning Israeli government's decision to go ahead with
construction of a new Jewish settlement at Har Homa in the Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released at the end of an urgent meeting
presided over by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, according
to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs decided
Wednesday evening to approve the construction of Har Homa
Settlement. Some 6,500 housing units will be built in the
settlement and the first stage will include some 2,500 units.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the decision constitutes a violation
of international law and of the Israel-PLO peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Cabinet Secretary, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, warned
that a new conflict over Jerusalem could spark uncontrollable
violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's senior aide Marwan Kalafani told reporters that
Arafat is upset by the Israeli decision and worried about the
future of the peace process. But he would do whatever he can to
get back the peace process on track.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held telephone consultations on the implications of
the Har Homa issue with King Hussein of Jordan and President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He also sent a letter to U.S. President
Bill Clinton on the issue, which is expected to be high on
agenda during his meeting with Clinton at the White House next
week.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. According to the Oslo Accords, the issue will be
discussed in the final stage talks. Neither side should take
unilateral steps to change the status quo before that.
</P>
<P>
As tensions are mounting, the Israeli army and police have
beefed up their forces in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the West
Bank. Some 500 extra police were sent to East Jerusalem to help
crack down any possible violent resistance from the
Palestinians, according to Israel Radio.

At 3:00 p.m., Li Ruihuan declared the meeting open. After the

Comrade Xiaoping passed away."
</P>
<P>
He said,"Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader whose
immense prestige is recognized by the whole Party, the whole army
and people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. He was a

consultative conference is an integral part of the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the
scientific guideline for the work of the people's political
consultative conference.
</P>
<P>
"The passing of Comrade Xiaoping was an immeasurable loss to
the Party, the army and people of all ethnic groups throughout

Deng Xiaoping's behest, rally still more closely around the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade
Jiang Zemin at the core, hold high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, adhere to the basic line of the Party, and carry
forward the great cause of socialist reform and opening-up and
modernization drive pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping."

</P>
<P>
In the past year, Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee has
achieved fruitful results in participating in the running of
political affairs, voicing the will of the people, promoting the
peaceful reunification of the motherland, expanding its
external relations and consolidating itself.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee will broaden
areas for its participation in the running of state affairs. The
committee, he said, will put forward proposals and policy
suggestions on some major subjects concerning national economic
and social development, and cultural and socialist ethical
progress.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the CPPCC National Committee will also actively work
for China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong in line with the principles of "one country, two systems,"
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy by encouraging members from Hong Kong and
Macao to play a more prominent role in participation in the
running of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman said the top advisory body will also
contribute to the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong
and Macao and the smooth transition of Macao. Ye said the CPPCC
National Committee will continue to develop friendly relations
with Taiwan compatriots by implementing the eight-point proposal
on promoting a peaceful reunification of the motherland put

<HEADLINE> Four Cambodian Parties Form Coalition Prior to Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Four Cambodian parties
today officially launched the National United Front (NUF) in
preparation for the legislative elections due to be held in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The political alliance groups the currently biggest ruling
FUNCINPEC Party led by First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, the
Khmer Neutral Party led by Bour Hel, the Khmer Nation Party (KNP)
led by Sam Rainsy and a faction of the split Buddhist Liberal
Democratic led by Son Sann.
</P>
<P>
"The NUF respects and defends the Monarchy, the Constitution of
1993 and its national motto: Nation, Religion, King," said a
program on NUF's political beliefs and objectives proclaimed at a
founding conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the NUF will establish legislative
state system, make administration and the armed forces stay
neutral, defend human rights, fight against dictatorship, promote
international cooperation, and absolutely defend the national
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The NUF will not create nor allow regional secession even
having lost the elections," the program declares.
</P>
<P>
The program also said that the NUF stands for having one prime
minister in the future government instead of having co-prime
ministers as at present.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the NUF is not against any other party or
political forces, but is aimed at regrouping patriotic
personalities from various parties to ensure the political
stability, said Ranariddh, who was elected president of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also said the NUF enjoyed full support from the
National Democratic United Movement headed by Ieng Sary who led a
splinter group from Khmer Rouge and change-over to the government
last August.
</P>
<P>
Son Sann, whose party has only one seat in the current
parliament, noted that each party within the front must keep its
own identity and independence.
</P>
<P>
KNP president Sam Rainsy appealed for close cooperation between
the four parties and indicated that every important decision by
the NUF must be made through the consensus system.
</P>
<P>
The biggest rival of the NUF is the second biggest ruling
Cambodian People's Party headed by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
who formed a coalition government with Ranariddh in 1993 after
U.N.-run elections.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Forces Destroy Drug Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian armed forces
uprooted large stretch of fields cultivated with bango and poppy
spread over 1,500 feddans (630 hectares) in the eastern Sinai
mountainous areas and valleys.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after an air survey conducted early February
spotted the illegal plantations, the Egyptian MENA news agency
quoted Major General Samir Youssef, commander of the border guard
forces, as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Field armies, the shock troops and chemical warfare units
alongside police forces, which were engaged in the operation
started on February 14, relied on different axes to destroy the
unlawful cultivations which would make a big produce.
</P>
<P>
Youssef said there were no clashes with the owners of the
farms, who had got the wind and fled the area.
</P>
<P>
The poppy, cultivated in November and harvested in March, is
used in making opium and heroin as well as morphine. Bango is
harvested four times during the year.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was decreed by Minister of Defense Field Marshal
Hussein Tantawi who instructed the authorities concerned to
continue the fight against the dirty trade of narcotics and
pursue moves to frustrate the schemes of drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
A similar campaign last year led to the destruction of 6,000
feddans (2,520 hectares) of poppy and 8,000 feddans (3,360
hectares) of bango.
</P>
<P>
Air survey indicated that these illegal plantations are
concentrated in 18 valleys in southern Sinai, the same locations
as last year's cultivations of poppy and bango.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces used highly-advanced equipment and certain
chemicals to destroy the plantations but these chemicals do not
harm the environment as the soil gets clean once rain falls, the
commander said.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far 924 poppy and 452 bango plantations at a
total area of 420 hectares, were destroyed. The operation will
continue until all the illegal plantations are routed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the forces have seized 274 kilograms of dried bango,
85 kilograms of bango seeds and 81 kilograms of poppy seeds
together with some explosives and rifles, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Action Against Migrants Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today called on government agencies and all sectors of
society to take action to eradicate illegal trafficking of
migrants.
</P>
<P>
In a proclamation released today, Ramos declared 1997 as the
Anti-Migrant Trafficking Year and asked government departments to
adopt measures and allocate resources to fight against illegal
trafficking of migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Overseas employment continues to be an alternative source of
income for more than 4 million overseas Filipino workers, Ramos

</P>
<P>
He added that in pursuit of overseas work, job seekers continue
to be victimized by illegal traffickers whose victims include
women and children.

for the first six months of 1995 to 3.47 billion dollars during
the same period in 1996.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Develops Video Games to Teach Patriotism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China is making efforts to
develop its own video games for eduction in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-made video games dominate 98 percent of the Chinese
market. Among the imported games, 70 percent advocate violence,
terrorism and greed, around five percent contain pornographic
material, and three percent promote Nazism and militarism, or
emphasize the superiority of western weapons, according to a
survey conducted on Chinese players by Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Tian Yong, president of the prestigious Beijing Fourth
Secondary School, says he worries that more and more urban
secondary school students have become addicted to video games. In
colleges and universities, many dormitories have bought computers,
the majority of which are used for recreational purposes such as
game-playing.
</P>
<P>
China's development of video game software is still in its
infancy, and such games have long been overlooked as an
educational tool that could promote cultural and ethical progress,
said one software designer.
</P>
<P>
"We grow up with books and movies, but children born since the
1980s have been educated partly by computers and video games,"
Tian said, adding that teachers and parents are worried that
children will be too easily influenced by what some Chinese
believe to be inappropriate material included in the games.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to prevent them from playing video games," he
said. "The best thing we can do is to provide them with good
games."
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, video enthusiasts nationwide have
been writing to the Optical Memory National Engineering Research
Center of Qinghua University, urging the facility to develop
interesting games that can instill patriotism in the users. The
center is a high-tech research base designed to solve the major
technological problems in the publication of optical discs.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, the center invested two million
yuan to develop video games with a patriotic theme. The first
group, including games titled "Opium War," "August 1 Fighting
Eagle," "Long March," will appear on the market later this year.
</P>
<P>
The game "Opium War" will be issued in recognition of the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland in July. The game simulates
the war between more than 40 Chinese and British military
officers, including Lin Zexu, whose ban on opium trade touched off
the historic Opium War between China and Britain from
1840-1842. The war resulted the ceding of Hong Kong to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Lu Da, vice director of the research center, said that though
China lost the war in history, players of the games can get a
sense of government corruption during the Qing Dynasty, and gain a
better understanding of the historical background of the Opium War
and the impact of the war on the development of modern China,
thereby inspiring patriotism for modern-day China.
</P>
<P>
"August 1 Fighting Eagle" represents the story of Wang Hai and
other Chinese pilots who downed more than 300 US fighter planes in
the Korean war.
</P>
<P>
The "Long March" game simulates the victory of the Long March
(1934-36) by the Red Army, which trekked through more than a dozen
provinces and cities, and helped to lay a solid foundation for the
founding of New China.

<HEADLINE> Funding for Three Gorges Project Guaranteed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Sufficient funding has been
arranged for the Three Gorges Project since it was launched in
1994, said a senior official involved with the project.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Construction Fund and the State Development
Bank loans have provided a stable financial guarantee for the
project's construction and the resettlement program, Guo Shuyan,
deputy director of the State Council's Three Gorges Project
Construction Commission, told reporters in Beijing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, investment in the project had reached 20.8
billion yuan, with 11.1 billion from the Three Gorges Construction
Fund, 8.9 billion from State Development Bank loans, and the
remaining 800 million from other resources.
</P>
<P>
"The appearance of the dam site and the reservoir area are
changing with each passing day," Guo said, adding that workers are
busy meeting the goal of damming the Yangtze the coming November,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, the largest capital construction
project in China, involves a static investment of 90.09 billion
yuan on May 1993 prices.
</P>
<P>
However, taking into account the factors of inflation and loan
interests, dynamic investment in the project could reach 146.8
billion yuan in the year 2005 and 203.4 billion yuan by the time
the project is complete in 2009, said Lu Youmei, president of the
China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation (CTGPC).
</P>
<P>
The project will mainly depend on domestic funding which is
composed of four parts, namely, the Three Gorges Construction
Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Power Plant, profits from the
Three Gorges Power Plant which will generate electricity beginning
in the year 2003, and State Development Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The domestic fund will meet the majority of the project's
financial needs, but a funding shortage still exists, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
To cover the shortfall, the CTGPC, proprietor of the project,
will moderately use foreign export credits, commercial loans and
issue bonds both at home and abroad at a certain time.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of bonds, totalling one billion yuan, will be
floated domestically from February 28 to March 18.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2005, ten generating units will produce
electricity, which will greatly increase the project's repayment
ability and give it a capital surplus.
</P>
<P>
Project spending this year is budgeted at 8.9 billion yuan
(about 1.1 billion US dollars), when the dam scheme will proceed
into its second phase of construction after the damming of
Yangtze.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Ban Foodstuff With British Cow Gelatin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) is to withdraw foodstuff and sweets containing beef gelatin
of British origin from local markets and ban the import of such
items, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ban was declared by the General Secretariat of UAE
Municipalities secretariat in its 46th session held in Sharjah,
one of the seven emirates of the country, Wednesday, according to
the "Khaleej Time" newspaper.

mad cow disease, is said to affect the human beings as the
Creutzfeld-Jakobs disease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the secretariat considers to lift ban on Irish beef
in accordance with the regulations and restrictions agreed upon
between the Irish authorities and the UAE, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Service Trade Generating More Added Value for North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The service trade
generated 109 billion yuan in added value for the north China
province of Hebei in 1996, a rise of 11 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Service trade has become a leading factor in advancing the
growth of the province's economy, said local officials. It has
offered jobs to seven million people, or 20 percent of the
province's total workforce.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the success of the past year to the
province's concerted efforts to make full use of its advantageous
location on the border of Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is now a transportation hub and an important center for
collection and distribution of commodities.
</P>
<P>
According to a development plan for the service trade during
the Ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000), the province will
construct 10 modern shopping plazas, each having a floor space of
50,000 sq m, as well as 100 medium-sized shopping markets by the
year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Guided by the plan, the province has already built a group of
wholesale markets for farm produce, industrial consumer products
and means of production.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to build 60 large circulation enterprise groups
involving in trading of commodities including cereals and oils,
petroleum and medicine.
</P>
<P>
While vigorously developing tourism and real estate, the
province will also earmark more money for the development of
information services and the establishment of a great number of
intermediary service organizations in the years to come, said
local officials.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Launch Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) will stage demonstrations across the
country on March 3 to mark the launching of its fresh agitation
against the eight-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
BNP Chairperson and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia announced
the plan at a huge public meeting in Feni City, 136 kilometers
southeast of the capital, Dhaka, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of our program. We are starting from
here, and it will continue all over the country," Zia told the
gathering of thousands of people of her paternal home district.
</P>
<P>
This was her first public meeting after the debacle of the BNP
in the parliamentary elections last June.
</P>
<P>
Though there was no incident at the meeting venue, a series of
acts of violence took place in different parts of the district, in
which more than 50 BNP activists were injured.
</P>
<P>
Zia warned her political opponents that whenever they launch
any attack, it would be resisted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's request not to
launch any agitation, the opposition leader said: "We have not
given any tough program, but will be compelled to go for it in
future."
</P>
<P>
She said that despite its willingness, her party could not
cooperate with the government which she charged was "selling out"
the country's interests and "violating" the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Let's save the country, its independence and sovereignty,
democracy, constitution, and people's life and property," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hasina warned early this month that the
opposition should seriously think before taking up any agitation
program.
</P>
<P>
"They might try to create some problem, even break some
vehicles, but won't succeed," she added.

SHENYANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- In 1996, Liaoning Province in
northeast China quickened its pace of optimizing the property
structure of local state-owned enterprises through annexation,
bankruptcy and listing, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The state firms involved had activated a large amount of
property worth 5.2 billion yuan and reduced losses valued at 2.2
billion yuan.

while 197,000 jobless workers were rehired through the
government's reemployment programs.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has met visiting Zairean rebel leader
Laurent-Desire Kabila discussed the situation in eastern Zaire,
said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his home in Johannesburg, where the
meeting was held on Wednesday night, Mandela said they also
discussed sensitive matters "where confidentiality is absolutely
essential".
</P>
<P>
Mandela returned from the Commonwealth African summit meeting
in Kasane, northern Botswana, on Wednesday to meet Kabila, who
arrived in the country secretly on Tuesday as part of continuing
multinational efforts to broker peace in eastern Zaire, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said after the meeting that he was ready to have direct
negotiations with the Zairean government of President Mobutu Sese
Seko, but a ceasefire was a way off.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said he was glad to have received advice from Mandela
and hoped negotiations would start soon.
</P>
<P>
"We must maybe assume that peace can be found here with the
regime of Mobutu," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kabila also held talks with South African
officials and representatives of the United States, the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity, said the source.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebel leader had not yet met Honore Ngbanda,
Mobutu's special envoy in South Africa for the multinatinal peace
talks, which started last week in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Tense situations are running high in eastern Zaire, where the
civil fighting between Kabila's rebel movement and Mobutu's
government force has caused a exodus of million of refugees in
the region.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Offshore Oilfield in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Shengli Oilfield, China's
second largest oil field, has made a major breakthrough in oil
exploration in the Bohai Sea, off the eastern part of China, by
setting up the Chengdao Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
The new field, which has an annual output of 1.05 million tons,
is the largest offshore oilfield in the Bohai Bay, and has huge
production potential.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC), the offshore oilfield was difficult to explore because of
its complicated geological structure. To develop the Chengdao
Field, Shengli has applied a large array of new technology that is
used for onshore purposes to offshore development, including a 3-D
seismic survey and oil reserve tracking technology.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai area now has an annual oil and gas output of 2.12
million tons and 367 million cubic meters respectively.
</P>
<P>
Oil officials say they expect greater progress this year in oil
and gas exploration in the Bohai area, with proven oil and gas
reserves forecast at 60 million tons and 10 billion cu m.

NAIROBI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Tkhe Kenyan agriculture minister
has said that enough food had been imported to feed those people
living in drought-stricken areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the annual conference of
the Kenya National Farmers Union on Wednesday, Darius Mbela,
Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing,
stated that imported food was coming to help cope with the
food crisis.
</P>
<P>
Several cargo ships discharged about 70,000 tons of
grain last week and two additional vessels arrived on February 24
and 25 to unload a further 28,000 tons of maize and wheat.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the meeting that his government had decided
to spend about 110 million U.S. Dollars to import enough food to
arrest the looming famine caused by the current severe drought in
most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the imported food did not interfere
with domestic production, adding that duty and VAT payable on
food imports would be re-introduced as soon as the required
amounts were imported.
</P>
<P>
Mbela urged farmers throughout the country to increase
domestic grain production to cope with the rising population now
standing at some 28 million.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, farmers were advised to plant traditional food
crops such as cassava, potatoes and beans because they are
drought resistant.

total of 2,498 proposals, 2,380 of which were accepted, a marked
increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The proposals were made by 1,620 members of the CPPCC National
Committee, 77 percent of the total, and provided important
reference to the Party and the government institutions for
decision-making procedures," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the CPPCC conducted varied activities to
help promote the motherland's reunification in accordance with the
principles of peaceful reunification and "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, "we have increased our ties with the
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and organized CPPCC
members from Hong Kong and Macao to visit the interior areas so as
to help acquaint themselves with the country's current situation
and its economic development and social progress."
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC also developed friendly relations with foreign
countries and international organizations extensively, and had
established links with 61 countries and 86 agencies under four
international organizations by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"During the past year, the Standing Committee sent eight
delegations to 15 countries, while inviting six foreign
delegations to China," Ye noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Standing Committee also hosted a number of
commemorative activities on important occasions to promote
patriotism, and made painstaking efforts in building a
standardized system of political consultation.
</P>
<P>
While marked progress has been made, he acknowledged, the work
of political consultation, democratic supervision, and
participation in the government and political affairs still needs
to be strengthened and further improved.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it is still necessary for us to further enhance the
democratic supervision, which is rather weak, and to explore into
further increasing the connections with various non-Communist
parties and the people's organizations," Vice-Chairman Ye Xuanping
said.

million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>

The most invested area last year was the mining and mineral
section, edging out tourism facilities which was placed second,
the Philippine News Agency today quoted Nengasca as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment, firms registered with the department's
Board of Investment contributed 293.6 million dollars while small

<HEADLINE> Iran May Expel Turkish Ambassador: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government intends
to expel Turkish diplomats, including its ambassador, Iran's
official daily Iran reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily said that Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Osman
Koruturk and the consul general to Orumiyeh, capital of West
Azarbaijan province, may be expelled.
</P>
<P>
The move is reportedly in retaliation for the attitude of
Ankara toward Iranian Ambassador to Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily said that the report has not yet been
confirmed by official sources.
</P>
<P>
Some sources said that the Iranian ambassador was asked to
leave Ankara because of his strong statement about Islam and
fundamentalism. This aroused anger from the Turkish authorities
and mass media. they said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the sources said, Baqeri has returned from Ankara
and has been still in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the relations between Iran and
Turkey would be turning cold again or getting worse if the two
countries expel ambassadors from the other side.
</P>
<P>
Last April Turkey and Iran had expelled four diplomats from
each side on charge of espionage activities.

<HEADLINE> China Imposes Stricter Controls on Explosives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police say they will
control production and use of explosives by small mines more
strictly with a nationwide safety study to be done during the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The illegal production and sale of explosives will be harshly
dealt with, according to a recent circular issued by the Ministry
of Public Security, which is calling for tighter controls on
explosives for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized dynamite production will be stopped, and equipment
and materials used in the process, as well as explosives, will be
destroyed, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry admits that controls on explosives are quite
chaotic or even out of control in some places, mainly because
people ignore the importance of safety.
</P>
<P>
"Illegally-produced dynamite or that stolen from units that
have permits to keep explosives are sometimes used by criminals,
greatly endangering public safety," said the circular, which
called on local police departments to form special teams to
carefully check the production, storage, and sale of explosives
and those units that have explosives, especially small coal or
other mines and rock quarries.
</P>
<P>
The perils associated with the use of explosives must be
removed within a certain amount of time, and mines and producers
that do not meet the safety standards should be closed, the
circular said.

JINAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The governor of east China's
Shandong province, recently addressing the fifth session of the
eighth provincial people's congress, said that the province will
open wider to the outside world this year.
</P>
<P>
Governor Li Chunting said that his province will try to
increase foreign trade, especially processed goods and those with
high added value.
</P>
<P>
The export of machinery, electronics, and processed farm
products, and the import of key technology and equipment, will be
given more attention, he added.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to encourage firms with good profits to
operate overseas. Foreign investment will be better controlled to
ensure that more funding goes into agriculture, basic industries,
and high-tech industries, said Li.
</P>
<P>
It will further improve its investment environment and provide
better services for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province last year had foreign trade
worth 17.8 billion US dollars and used foreign funds worth 3.2
billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Boosting Competition in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The arrival of foreign banks
and, especially, the recent decision by the Chinese central bank
to allow eight foreign banks to handle RMB yuan business have
further fueled the competition in Shanghai's banking market.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts hold that these foreign banks, normally with
higher credit ratings, have become more viable on the local
financial market after they were granted the right to deal in the
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The joining of these foreign banks in the competition has
opened more channels for acquiring credits for local clients, and
local Chinese banks are encountering bigger challenges, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, by the end of 1996 Shanghai had
46 foreign banking institutions and 147 representative offices set
up by foreign banking institutions, with assets totaling 13.55
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year foreign banks made up 30 percent of the city's total
international clearance and 15 percent of its foreign exchange
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In this largest metropolis in the country Chinese commercial
banks have remained the leading banking players in the local
financial market, but the growth of their loans and their market
share have declined steadily year by year, according to the
experts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state commercial banks have to issue a certain
amount of policy loans for the government, while they are still
trying to become commercialized through reforms. This has made it
difficult for Chinese state-owned banks to compete with foreign
banks, they say.
</P>
<P>
The experts explain that currently Chinese banks and their
foreign counterparts are competing to attract professional
persons, and more and more local banking professionals have been
lured to work in foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they say, these foreign banks will bring many new
banking services into the city, which will be more challenging to
local Chinese banks that are used to providing fewer service items
to local clients.
</P>
<P>
These experts believe that the arrival of foreign banks will
bolster the banking reform in Shanghai and it also means the
further opening-up of the country's banking sector to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
The competition will draw more international banking giants to
Shanghai and boost the economic development of the metropolis,
they expect, which will further speed up the pace of the city
becoming an international center of economy, finance and trade.

<HEADLINE> India Industry in Favor of Signing Infotech Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- India's industry is largely
in favor of the country signing the information technology
agreement, but it seeks a longer phase-out period for tariffs on
infotech products than will be applied to developed countries.
</P>
<P>
These are the key findings of a Department of Electronics
study, which sought the opinion of most industry associations on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
India will be entitled to "initial negotiating rights" if it
signs the agreement by March 31 this year. If it comes on board
after the date, it will still be eligible to join the agreement
but will lose these rights.
</P>
<P>
The agreement seeks to completely eliminate tariffs on
approximately 200 infotech product categories. Certain dates have
been proposed by which the tariffs are to be phased out, with the
process beginning in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The proposal covers mainly computer hardware products,
semiconductors and integrated circuits, computer software,
telecommunications equipment and other information technology
products.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was proposed and carried forward by the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries at
the World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting in Singapore in
December last year. With the United States and the European Union
finally settling their differences, almost 30 countries agreed to
sign the accord.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is to be on a most favored nation (MFN) basis.
The MFN clause would permit India to export its products at nil
duty to its signatories even if the country does not itself join
the agreement, industry sources said.

<HEADLINE> Central China Coal Mines Report Sideline Production Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Sideline production has
turned coal mines in central China's Hunan Province from monstrous
money losers into money-makers.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the provincial coal
administration, last year state-owned coal mines above the county
level generated 1.5 billion yuan in output value and sideline
production, and earned a profit of 35 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Mine conditions had been very poor in much of the province and,
because of high production costs a great number of mines suffered
severe economic losses for quite a long time. Later the central
government decided to lift the price ceiling on coal in 1993.
</P>
<P>
With the help of local and central governments, different coal
mines have developed reform measures to make their workers more
enthusiastic and to encourage surplus workers to engage in
sideline production to reduce production costs, especially in view
of the fact that resources are shrinking.
</P>
<P>
Surplus workers from coal mines have turned their hand to the
service trade, or to setting up power plants and cement factories,
or have even gotten into agricultural development, a move that
helped state-owned coal mines avoid 100 million yuan in losses in
1996.

SHIJIAZHUANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to reduce the
production scale of its textile industry by 10 million spindles
this year, following an earlier reduction of four million spindles
across China.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was proceeded by a year-long depression in the
industry, so a package of emergency measures have been started by
the central and local government to help rescue the industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry will place emphasis in the industrial readjustment
scheme on reducing the labor force and improving efficiency, said
Wu Wenying, president of the China National Textile Council,
during an inspection tour in Shijiazhuang and Handan cities.
</P>
<P>
The readjustment will be carried out in 38 cities which have a
concentration of textile mills, this year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is one of China's largest textile centers, and has
been urged to develop better technology and to produce name-brand
products. The central government is also revising policies on tax
refunds for exports and the purchase of raw materials in an effort
to help the industry out of its difficulties.

BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has collected 1.8
billion yuan (825 million U.S. dollars) in funds for housing for
1.9 million staff members and workers at municipal units.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Housing Fund Administrative Center, by

<HEADLINE> Opening Drive Helps Liaoning's Agricultural Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province, a major heavy industrial base, is enhancing agricultural
development by stepping up the opening up process.
</P>
<P>
The province previously suffered from poor agricultural
production, and grain and other farm product supplies were largely
brought in from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
But in the 1990s, the provincial government, seeing its
deficiencies, accelerated agricultural development by putting a
large amount of funding into farm projects. Various sources of
foreign funds have been used, and the province has used World Bank
loans of 86 million US dollars and set up 3,300 foreign-funded
firms involved in farming, with foreign funds of 2.2 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province also held two large fairs to woo foreign
investment in agriculture last year and is planning on holding
another later this year, along with neigbouring Jilin and
Heilongjiang provinces and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
One vice-governor says that the province will list planting,
animal husbandry, aquiculture, and forestry and special local
products as priorities of opening up in the next few
years.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil outscored Poland
4-2 in a soccer friendly in Goiania on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni scored two first-half goals before his Barcelona
teammate Ronaldo and Romario added a pair in the second period.
</P>
<P>
Kucharski and Citko, on a penalty kick, scored for Poland in
the final five minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
The friendly served as a warm-up for Brazil in the 1998 World
Cup wherein Brazil secured its automatic berth as reigning
champion.
</P>
<P>
While some 50,000 fans hoped both Romario, the Most Valuable
Player of the 1994 World Cup, and Ronaldo, the 1996 FIFA player of
the year, displayed their flair and forms, it was Giovanni that
stole the limelight.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth minute, Giovanni sliced apart the Poland's defense
from a pass off Ronaldo and scored the opener by tapping into the
corner.
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, he made it 2-0 on a play initiated by
Romario, who returned to the team after a two-year absence.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete
Sampras scored a first-round straight sets win at the ATP tennis
tournament in Philadelphia on Wednesday, keeping a winning streak
of 16 matches.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Sampras took 56 minutes to breeze past Marcelo
Filippini of Uruguay 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Second seed and defending champion Jim Courier followed the
fellow American to advance after beating 89th-ranked Guillaume
Raoux of France 6-3, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who has twice won this tournament, captured the first
set by breaking the 79th-ranked Filippini at 30-40 on a winning
forehand approach shot, after experiencing a shaky start.
</P>
<P>
He totally dominated the second set, allowing Filippini to hold
serve only once in the second game.
</P>
<P>
Courier, a former world number one who has slipped to 18 in the
world ranking, needed one hour and 33 minutes before routing the
hard-hitting Raoux.

<HEADLINE> India's Experts Call Rail Budget Inflationary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Railway Minister Ram V.
Pawan's railway budget for 1997-98 presented to parliament
Wednesday has been described as inflationary by economic experts
and industrialists in the country.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase freight charges by 12 percent over all
distances would increase production costs, which in turn would
raise the prices of bulk commodities, they said.
</P>
<P>
"The prices of products like cement and coal will rise and will
add to the prices of other commodities," economist D. H.
Paipanandikar said.
</P>
<P>
India's three apex chambers of industry have said that the hike
in fare and freight rates would lead to increased inflation.
</P>
<P>
President of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry
H. L. Somany said that the hikes in fare and freight rates would
increase production costs and fuel inflation.
</P>
<P>
Sekhar Datta, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry
said that a major cause for worry was the fact that the freight
target had not been met. The target of freight loading in 1997-98,
an increase of 10.3 percent over 1996-97, is considered low
against a backdrop of 9.8 percent industrial growth. Roads were
carrying a disproportionately high percentage of freight traffic
(60 percent) and the figure would reach 65 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
President of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry A.S. Kasliwal said that the cumulative impact of the
freight hike would work out to 23.2 percent if the hike in July is
also taken into account.
</P>
<P>
The three apex chambers of industry also said that the burden
on the common man could have been reduced by involving the private
sector more effectively in the functioning of the railways.

<HEADLINE> Low-Interest Loans for Thailand's Textile Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Virawan has approved an urgent proposal to grant 2 billion
baht (80 million US dollars) in low-interest loans to help revive
the troubled textile industry, according to an industry ministry
source.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand's garment exports dropped by 21.7 percent
and fabrics by 5.8 percent from 1995. In 1996 garments and fabrics
were among the country's major export categories, ranking second
and 14th respectively.
</P>
<P>
The government expects the measure will help boost the
competitiveness of textile manufacturers by improving the
efficiency of their production processes.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for borrowing, applicants must display financial
stability and good export performances and that the new machinery
they wish to buy must be highly efficient and suitable.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand, the Industrial Finance Corporation of
Thailand and the Export and Import Bank of Thailand will provide
the loans, at expected interest rates of 8 to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present the interest rate for prime customers is 13-14
percent and more than 15 percent for general customers.
</P>
<P>
Suchart Chantaranakakaracha, vice president of the Thai Garment
Manufacturers' Association, said it was good news for the industry
as money was needed to obtain more efficient machinery to produce
value-added products.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Current Account Deficit Down From 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's current account
deficit last year was lower than that for 1995 in terms of
percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The actual current account deficit for 1996 was 7.97 percent of
GDP, lower than the 8.2 percent as projected by the Bank of
Thailand, and also lower than the 1995 level of 8.1 percent,
according to data released by the Finance Ministry available
today.
</P>
<P>
The total current account deficit for 1996 amounted to 372.6
billion baht (14.9 billion dollars), lower than the central bank's
prediction of 384 billion baht (15.36 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Data of the Finance Ministry show that the improvement of the
current account deficit situation was in part attributable to
export growth and import decline in December last year.

<HEADLINE> Donors Press Dhaka for Petrol, Fertilizer Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Donors put forth a series of
suggestions for Bangladesh, including lifting of government
control on petroleum, gas and fertilizer prices, in an interim
meeting that ended here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Finance Minister Shah Asm Kibria, who
presided over the meeting and briefed 30 donor representatives on
the economic policies of the government.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the donors regarded the existing
prices of fuel oil, gas and fertilizer as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
"In their view, an upward adjustment of prices was necessary in
order to avoid burden on the budget and pressure on balance of
payments and to allow market forces to operate without hindrance,"
said Kibria.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted the very strong concern expressed by the donors
that the low prices of oil, urea and gas result in a heavy loss of
public revenue. The suggestion will be placed before the
government for consideration," Kibria was quoted by the local
press.
</P>
<P>
The donors also expressed concern over the slow pace of
privatization, said Kibria, adding that the government would make
a "comprehensive statement" on privatization soon to achieve the
target of disinvestment program of the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The interim meeting was significant as the donors would make
fresh aid commitment to Bangladesh after reviewing the country's
economic growth and reform progress, the finance minister added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, one of the most undeveloped countries, received a
commitment of 1.9 billion US dollars at the last aid club meeting
held in Paris last year.

MANAGUA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Economic cooperation between

During his speech at the forum, Montalvan stressed the need for
the EU to allow preferential access for Central American
agricultural and industrial products.
</P>
<P>
"That would stimulate the generation of jobs, one of the
priorities of the areas and the number one priority of the
Nicaraguan government led by President Arnoldo Aleman," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The EU's cooperation has helped us immensely, not only through
support to a large number of our development projects, but also
through actions that promote our trade as well as exports," he
noted.

Representatives from all the countries of the Central American
isthmus and the EU "troika", made up of Ireland, Luxemburg and
Holland, took part in the annual ministerial forum.

<P>
KATHMANDU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of Nepal
and the World Bank have been holding talks here on the
establishment of a fund for hydropower development in this
Himalayan state since last week, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank promised to set up the Power Development Fund
for Nepal when it withdrew financial support for a large-sized
hydropower project in East Nepal by citing huge environmental and
economic risks in 1995.
</P>
<P>
After scrapping the 402-megawatt Arun III project which the
World Bank had backed since the feasibility study over 10 years
ago, the Bank said that it would promote an alternative hydropower
strategy focusing on medium and small-sized projects in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The bank also pledged to set up a 175 million US dollar Power
Development Fund (PDF) with the amount originally earmarked for
the Arun III.
</P>
<P>
According to Nepali sources, a five-member task force from the
World Bank is in the capital for holding discussions with Water
Resources Ministry officials on the guidelines and legal structure
needed to regulate the PDF.
</P>
<P>
If the on-going discussions go smoothly, the PDF agenda could
formally be put for approval to the World Bank's board of
executive directors in Washington on June, 17, the sources said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh arrived here today for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, who came at the invitation of his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad, was met on arrival at the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport by Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's visit, in the context of a familiarization tour to
meet his ASEAN counterparts, is aimed at boosting the already good
ties between Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During his first official visit here since he assumed the post
two months ago, Chavalit is scheduled to have an audience with the
Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar before calling on Mahathir at his
office and attending the delegation meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Chavalit will hold discussions with
Mahathir on bilateral and regional matters.
</P>
<P>
Both Malaysia and Thailand are ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thailand's newly-appointed ambassador to Malaysia,
Suchitra Hiranprueck, said in an interview with Malaysia's
official news agency Bernama that Chavalit's visit would also be
an opportunity for leaders from both sides to look into ways to
resolve the few existing problems including those involving the
common border.
</P>
<P>
The discussions are also expected to center on better trade and
investment promotion between the countries, Suchitra said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is Thailand's second largest trading partner in ASEAN
with the total trade value accounting for four percent of
Thailand's total global trade in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade stood at 13.075 billion Ringgit (about 5.23
billion US dollars) from January to November last year, of which
Thailand's exports to Malaysia were 4.631 billion Ringgit (about

<HEADLINE> Parlatino to Meet in Costa Rica Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign debt, drug
trafficking and human rights are among the points to be discussed
when the Latin American parliament (Parlatino) meets here on March
13-15,
</P>
<P>
Rolando Gonzalez, who is an alternate secretary general of the
Parlatino, announced the session dates today.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez described the meeting as the most important of those
held every year by the institution. It would step up condemnation
of the United States Helms-Burton law and stand side-by-side with
European parliamentarians, who requested the World Trade
Organization to set up a panel to investigate the globally
denounced legislation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. legislation was imposed last year. It aims at
blockading Cuba by punishing foreign companies doing business with
the Caribbean island nation.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the meeting will also include a proposal to
create a Latin American Commonwealth, and different initiatives to
deal with the problem of foreign debt and the treatment of illegal
aliens.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 legislators from 22 Latin American countries will
attend the gathering of the Parlatino, which was set up 30 years
ago in Lima, Peru to promote Latin American integration.
</P>
<P>
The committees that will meet are those on women, human rights,
agriculture, energy and mines, drug trafficking and foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
As for the United States' decision regarding the anti-drug
performances of Latin American countries, Gonzalez did not rule
out the possibility that the matter could be dealt with by the
Parlatino.
</P>
<P>
One of the fundamental principles of the Latin American
parliament was to respect the sovereignty of its members. In that
case, the U.S. involvement would infringe upon the sovereignties
of the Parlatino nations, Gopzalez said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the creation of a Latin American Commonwealth,
Gonzalez, who is also deputy for the ruling National Liberation
Party (NLP) in Costa Rica, ruled out any intention of it becoming
a substitute for the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said the Parlatino was taking steps to go to the
international court of The Hague in consultation over the legality
of an "excessive increase in interest rates" as it affected
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The Parlatino asked Pope John Paul II to speak out about the
rise in interest rates which were strangling a good number of the
economies in the region, Gonzalez noted.
</P>
<P>
"There are nations asphyxiated by this injustice," he said,
numerous acts of corruption had occurred in external debt
matters.

<HEADLINE> UN Demands Arrest of Croat Policemen Over Mostar Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
international civilian mediator in Bosnia, Carl Bildt, today
demanded the sacking and arrest of the Bosnian Croat policemen
accused of shooting at Muslims in Mostar earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also gave a deadline of midnight tonight for the Bosnian
Croat authorities to punish the troublemakers, according to the UN
spokesman in Banjaluka, Robert Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
Bildt's demands came following the release of a UN police
report that blamed the Bosnian Croat police for firing shots into
a group of several hundred Muslim pilgrims seeking to visit a
cemetery in the Croat-controlled part of Mostar, which has been
divided between Muslims and Croats since early 1993.
</P>
<P>
The February 10 shooting, one of the worst incidents of ethnic
violence since the 1995 Dayton peace accord, left one Muslim dead
and 22 injured.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by a team of eight UN police officers and
released in Belgrade today, said that two Croat police officers
fired at the Muslim crowd and some 15 Croat police officers beat
them just before the shooting broke out.
</P>
<P>
Bildt's deputy, Michael Steiner, reportedly met last night with
leaders of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation and asked them to
accept the UN police report on the Mostar incident.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic has accepted the
report, but the Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak has rejected
it, saying that the UN should investigate the incident from all
sides.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Croat police in Mostar have sued 11
Muslim police officers in the town, accusing them of being
responsible for the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
The Multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Mostar has been
put on alert to deal with possible trouble.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A Lima court has begun
proceedings against Peruvian Second Vice-President Cesar Paredes
Canto who faces two charges of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Oscar Zevallos Palomino accused Canto, who was also
president of the National Assembly of university presidents, of
impeding the legal reorganization of the private San Martin de
Porres University.
</P>
<P>
Canto would be imprisoned for four years if found guilty in
this case, the local press quoted sources from the 21st criminal
court as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canto was asked to appear at the 21st criminal court on March 6
to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
He is also charged in the 27th criminal court with illegally
furthering his private interests by interceding in favor of Export
Air de Peru. The latter has been accused of selling arms to
Ecuador during the conflicts between the Peruvian and Ecuadoran
forces several years ago.
</P>
<P>
On the second charge, Canto, who took the office of second vice
president in July 1995, could get two years in prison or two-years
community service if found guilty.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Health Care Situation Is Grim, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Ukrainians are
chronically ill and the country's crumbling health care system is
unable to cope, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Minister of Public Health Andre Serdyuk has painted a
grim picture of the health of this nation of 52 million people.
</P>
<P>
Six million Ukrainians, or nearly one in nine of the
population, suffer from cardio-vascular diseases, 800,000 have
cancer and tumor-related diseases, 760,000 have tuberculosis and
700,000 are alcoholics, he said recently.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.2 million people are mentally ill and 1.2 million are
disabled. The number of people suffering sexually-transmitted
diseases and AIDS is also rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that thyroid diseases among the victims of the
Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 are increasing and more and
more children are suffering from congenital diseases, indicating a
worrying change in the population's genetic coding.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of sickness and poor health care have led to 1.2
million extra deaths over the last six years and experts warn a
further 1.2 million people will die if the health care system
is not improved.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one in four Ukrainians were classed as aged, the highest
rate in Europe, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
But the public health care system is starved of funds as the
government undertakes painful economic reform to transform the
country from a centrally planned economy into a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The public health ministry has drafted a law on medical
insurance to improve the system and is trying to raise funds for
health care to supplement the state's annual medical subsidies
equivalent to 19 U.S. dollars per person.
</P>
<P>
The law will also require employers to insure their staff for
medical care, but that will be tough order for employers, most of
whom haven't even paid out salaries for six months.
</P>
<P>
Serdyuk said that only a healthy economy could secure a sound
health care system. But President Leonid Kuchma has said that it
would take 15-20 years for Ukraine to fully recover from the
current economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Passes Nuclear Power Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives approved a draft bill on nuclear power at a
plenary session here Wednesday, but the government pledged not to
build a nuclear power plant in the near future.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie said at
the session that the government would have to go nuclear once
other energy sources failed to meet future needs.
</P>
<P>
"There are alternatives, like geothermal in Sumatra or
hydropower and natural gas. Going nuclear will be the government's
last step," he said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies costing 22 billion rupiah (9.5 million US
dollars), including feasibility research, on a nuclear power plant
have been underway near the dormant volcano Mt. Muria in Jepara,
Central Java, for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Habibie said that the government had yet to decide
whether to go ahead with the planned nuclear plant, which is
expected to produce 7,200 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's plenary meeting was marked by a demonstration of
protesters outside who called themselves the anti-nuclear society.
The group's spokesperson Agus Mahesa said the government must
consider the storage of nuclear waste and the maintenance of the
nuclear project.

<HEADLINE> EU Challenges Argentina on Leather Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
is challenging Argentina for severely limiting the export of cow
hides to the European Union, thereby choking off an essential
supply of raw material for European producers of high-quality
finished leather goods.
</P>
<P>
Following a complaint from the European tanning industry under
the Trade Barriers Regulation, the EC has decided to make an
in-depth analysis of a number of Argentinian practices, it was
learned here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The European tanning industry alleges that Argentina operates a
tacit export ban on raw cow hides by means of a 15 percent export
tax, as well as through the influence of the country's tanning
representatives in the customs control system.
</P>
<P>
This had enabled Argentina's leather industry to undercut its
European competitors on world markets, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The European tanning industry also claims that Argentina
applies discriminatory taxes to imports of finished leather
products into Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The EC's action is part of its new Market Access Strategy,
which aims at a more effective targeting of trade barriers that
hinder European exports.

Scalfaro, who is on an official visit to Macedonia, made the

December, 1995, to end the three-and-half-year civil war in the
former republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Boost Paddy Output in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has taken measures to
boost cultivation and production of paddy, which is the staple
crop of the country, beginning from 1997-98, the second fiscal
year of the present five year plan (1996-1997 to 2000-2001).
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with officials of the major paddy-cultivating
areas in different states and divisions here on Wednesday, Myanmar
Minister for Agriculture and Irrigation Myint Aung said that of
the 10.6 million acres (4.29 million hectares) which receive
suitable amounts of water and rain in the country, 6 million acres
(2.43 million hectares) have been selected for cultivation with an
average target of 75 baskets per acre (3.86 tons per hectare),
official daily The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Land preparation is to be made on the remaining areas according
to their geographical and soil conditions, and measures are to be
taken for an average yield of 50 baskets per acre (2.58 tons per
hectare), he urged.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, which is the mainstay of the country's
economy, accounts for about 38 percent of the total GDP and about
40 percent of foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics, Myanmar's paddy output in
the last 1995-96 fiscal year was recorded at 19 million tons,
while its rice export was at 353,100 tons. The target for the
1996-97 fiscal year is to produce 20 million tons of paddy and
export 1 million tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of Myanmar's agriculture in the last
four fiscal years from 1992-93 to 1995-96 stood at 8.8 percent and
is targeted at 5.4 per cent in the next five fiscal years from
1996-97 to 2000-2001.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Italy Look at Smaller Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Italy will improve
cooperation in the establishment of small- and medium-sized
businesses, which is essential for bilateral relations, the
visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Pavel Lazarenko,
Prodi also said that Italy is interested in importing raw
materials from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Heading a delegation of 60 businessmen, Prodi arrived in Kiev
on Tuesday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
There are now 172 Italian companies and 140 Italian-Ukrainian
joint ventures in this former Soviet republic, most of which are
food and manufacturing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Italy hopes to invest in Ukraine's agriculture,
which is a vital part of the Ukrainian economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade reached 663 million dollars in 1996, accounting
for nine percent of Ukraine's trade with European countries.
</P>
<P>
Italian investment in Ukraine totaled 25.9 million dollars late
last year. Lazarenko said he hopes that Italian investment would
also go into Ukraine's energy and transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a major problem. Lazarenko wished that
Ukraine's debts to Italy could be reduced or even written off
before 2004. He did not release figure of the debts.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko said he expects the Italian government to give
Ukraine loans of 100 billion Liras (about 88.5 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Prodi did not comment on the loans at a later press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy supports Ukraine's integration with the European
Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister suggested a transport corridor be
built to link Italy's Trieste and Kiev through Slovenia and
Hungary.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: Asia's Investment in Europe Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment (FDI)
flows from Asia into Europe soared from an average 100 million
U.S. dollars during 1989-1991 to an average 860 million dollars
during 1992-1994, a report released here today by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said.
</P>
<P>
In the report entitled "Sharing Asia's Dynamism: Asian Direct
Investment in the European Union (EU)", UNCTAD said that many
firms from Asia's newly industrializing economies (NIEs), such as
Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, increasingly find a
direct presence in the EU necessary to serve this large, wealthy
market.
</P>
<P>
Others are seeking access to advanced technology and skills,
research and development programs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Asian FDI in the EU accounted for only five percent of
the total FDI from the region in 1995, reflecting the fact that
"Asian firms are just at the beginning of their entry into
Europe", the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the United Kingdom is the most popular
destination for Asian NIEs' investment, which accounts for 40
percent of the FDI. Germany and the Netherlands followed with 30
percent and 20 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Asian transnational corporations have began
investing in Central and Eastern Europe, where they find a
low-cost production base and a good platform for relatively
unrestricted entry into the EU's internal market.

<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Darius Wosz scored a late
goal to pace Germany for a 1-0 win over Israel in a soccer
friendly in Tel Aviv on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his international debut, Wosz scored in the 85th minute from
a backheader off Israeli defender Gadi Brumer.
</P>
<P>
The lone goal was lucky enough for the European champion that
missed the target twice by hitting the framework of goalie Rafi
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
German coach Berti Vogts was in no mood to celebrate the
victory, saying "we only started playing with any power and
aggression after the break."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israeli coach Shlomo Sharf said he was
satisfied with the game as several key Israeli players were absent.
</P>
<P>
"Our national team played with few feelings of inferiority
against one of the world's top teams," he said, adding "a tie
would have reflected the game better."
</P>
<P>
Referee fished out three yellow cards against the German
nationals while the host only received one card.

<HEADLINE> All Habitats for Giant Pandas to Be Put Under State Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- All the existing wild habitats
for giant pandas in China will be put under state protection in
the next few years, according to a plan to be carried out soon.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, Vice-Minister of Forestry, said in an interview
with Xinhua News Agency that his ministry is now planning to
increase the current reserves for giant pandas from 14 to 28, in a
move to cover all the main habitats for giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
In order to do so, he said, a number of lumber mills that may
cause damage to the ecosystems of the habitats for the giant panda
will be closed.
</P>
<P>
He said that preliminary work on the project has begun, with 25
million yuan (three million US dollars) in special funding
allocated for the relocation and replacement of a lumber mill in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, one of the main habitats for
giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vice-Minister, however, the lack of funds is
blocking the smooth implementation of the plan.
</P>
<P>
"Together with other related departments, the ministry will
work to channel more funds and seek wide international
cooperation," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In 1962, China put the giant panda, a world famous rare animal
that only exists in the country, under the top state
protection. Only about 1,000 giant pandas now live in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1983, as many as 161 giant pandas
that suffered from hunger or disease have received medical
attention and recovered, and 120 were saved from near death.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, 16 giant pandas have been born as a result of
artificial insemination carried out by the research center for
giant pandas under the Ministry of Forestry, and 11 survived,
according to Wang.

<HEADLINE> Cape Town Apologises to Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A Cape Town committee backing the
South African city's bid to host the 2004 Olympics has apologised
to Rome's committee for suggestions that it was behind a campaign
to hurt Cape Town's chance, the Italian National Olympic Committee
(INOC) said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chris Ball, president of the committee promoting Cape Town's
bid, has personally apologised to the INOC president Mario
Pescante.
</P>
<P>
Ball's letter contained an "unconditional" apology but stressed
that his statements on an alleged knocking campaign had been
"misunderstood."
</P>
<P>
Ball was said to have voiced the hope that good relations
between all bidders for the Games could be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ball was reported to have charged that the Rome 2004
committee was behind reports in the Italian media highlighting the
alleged crime problems in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Media reports followed the release of an International Olympic
Committee (IOC) report assessing the eleven candidate cities for
the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
In that report, Rome and Athens came top but Cape Twon was also
rated among the front-runners along with Buenos Aires, with
Stockholm a shade behind.
</P>
<P>
Rome and Athens shared traffic problems, while Buenos Aires
might have funding problems, and Stockholm faced local
indifference to the Games, the report said. Cape Town's crime
problem was cited, as was Rio's.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Rome and Cape Town, the candidate cities are
Istanbul, Stockholm, Seville, Lille, San Juan, Rio De Janeiro,
Buesnos Aires, Athens, and St. Peterburg.
</P>
<P>
The IOC panel evaluating the candidates is expected to name
five finalists on March 7 and the winner will be announced on
September 7.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Industrial Exploration Promotes Anhui's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 27 (Xinhua) -- High-tech industrial projects
have been increasing rapidly and have become a new element in the
economic development of east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Anhui's high-tech businesses
generated 7.7 billion yuan (about 928 million U.S. dollars) of
total income in 1996, up 20.4 over the previous year, and produced
989 million yuan in profits and taxes, a rise of 21.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has a strong contingent of scientific and technological
personnel. The province has worked extensively to advance the
reform of its scientific and technological system, with the
purpose of transforming many scientific achievements into actual
productivity.
</P>
<P>
And provincial authorities have offered to organize joint
projects that will combine production, training and research.
</P>
<P>
The province has established high-tech industrial development
zones in Hefei, the provincial capital, and Wuhu and Bengbu cities
since 1993, when Anhui first formally announced its plan to adopt
the strategy of relying on scientific and technological progress
for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Since then, it has encouraged the establishment of large
high-tech industrial undertakings which enjoy privileges in
aspects including funds and taxation.
</P>
<P>
The three high-tech industrial development zones have made
headway in many ways since they were set up, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 255 high-tech industrial enterprises, which
have received recognition from the provincial committee of science
and technology. These firms now contribute five percent of the
province's total industrial output value each year.

<HEADLINE> Underground Barn Found in Chinese Emperor's Mausoleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- An underground barn with the
remains of pigs, goats, dogs, chickens, fish, soft-shelled
turtles, and crane-like birds has been found in the mausoleum of
Qin Shi Huang near Xi'an, the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The mausoleum, which is famous for its terracotta warriors and
horses serving as the nether world guards of Qin Shi Huang, the
founder of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), was added to the World
Heritage List in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The barn is one of the most important finds in the mausoleum in
recent years. It was discovered one meter underground, some 750 m
to the northeast of the outer wall of the mausoleum, leading the
archaeologists to re-think the mausoleum's layout. It is 23.5 m by
10 m with a six m long sloping passageway leading to it. Eight
rooms were built at each side of another passageway in the middle
of the barn.
</P>
<P>
The walls of the rooms were made of beaten earth and finely
made decorated planks were found on all sides of the rooms.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the barn is the first of its kind from the Qin
Dynasty or earlier to have been found, and is the most exquisite
underground building at the mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, although it was intended as a storage house for
animals to be used as sacrificial objects, it was burned during a
peasant rebellion at the end of the Qin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Among the remains of bones, scholars found evidence of more
than ten different animals. Iron weapons, bronze arrowheads,
coins, and fragments of painted pottery figures have also been
found.
</P>
<P>
they say that the painted pottery figures look similar to the
famous terracotta warriors.

<HEADLINE> China Trying to Save Cultural Relics At Dam Project Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars are trying
to minimize the damage to cultural relics from the Three Gorges
Area where China is building its largest water conservation
project.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale development has revealed some 830 underground
historical sites and 450 ancient buildings and stone carvings in
the area, where human activities can be traced back to at least
30,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A cultural relics conservation plan was completed last summer,
with suggestions for excavating major historical sites, move
important buildings and carvings, and protecting some special
monuments at the site.
</P>
<P>
A dam will be set up, as part of this, to protect Shibaozai, a
wooden structure building built along a mountainside in the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), while a temple from the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) and two groups of residential buildings will be moved
in their entirety, and an underwater museum estimated to cost 100
million yuan will be built to protect carvings in Baiheliang,
which was done during a period of more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, curator of the prestigious National Museum of
Chinese History, who is in charge of the conservation of cultural
relics in the Three Gorges Area, said that the water conservation
project ironically promoted the excavation and conservation of
cultural relics in the area.

JINAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Shandong, one of China's leading
grain producers, will increase efforts to develop its agriculture
this year, with the aim of repeating the record grain harvest last
year.
</P>
<P>
The province harvested 43.3 billion kg of grain in 1996, an all
time high, despite a serious drought in the spring and big floods
in the summer.
</P>
<P>
It plans to increase the annual grain output to 43.5 billion kg
and produce 4.4 billion kg of cotton and 32 billion kg of peanuts
this year. To do that, the local government plans to build 10
large and medium-sized reservoirs with a total additional water
storage capacity of 200 million cubic meters,
</P>
<P>
It will also speed up reclamation and soil improvement on the
Huaihe-Huanghe-Haihe plain, the Yellow River Delta, and at
Dongping and Nansi lakes.
</P>
<P>
Organizations that integrate agriculture with industry and
trade will be set up to help farmers develop a market-oriented
sense and pillar industries for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
With a "developing agriculture through science and education"
strategy, all rural areas are urged to develop fine strains, build
more experimental wheat, maize, cotton and vegetable plots, boost
high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture, and
raise the cultural level of farmers by running training
courses.

GUANGZHOU, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, one of the most
economically developed cities in China, discovered some 750
cultural relics last year at 54 ancient tombs and a kiln site.
</P>
<P>
Major finds in 1996 included building remains from the Han
Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), a dam site from the Song Dynasty
(960-1279), a neolithic site in an economic development zone, and
a group of tombs from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD).
</P>
<P>
One of China's historical cities, Guangzhou itself has 16
historical monuments and sites under state protection, including
the imperial palace site of the Nanyue Kingdom from some 2,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
That site dates from the same period as the Changle and Weiyang
imperial palaces of the Western Han Dynasty in Xi'an, but has
yielded even more cultural relics than those.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the Nanyue palaces was among the Top Ten
Chinese Archaeological Finds of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has spent some 100 million yuan in building an art
museum, and has decided to allocate a total of 11 million yuan for
cultural relics collection and conservation each year.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday dismissed two senior officials of the Rwanda
war crime tribunal following a U.N. report that the court was
riddled with mismanagement and financial waste.
</P>
<P>
The report released two weeks ago by karl Paschke, U.N.
insector-general, detailed administrative mismangement,
unqualified staff and legal chaos.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General decided that the continuation of two
officials of the tribunal in their posts would not be in the
interests of the United Nations and of the work of the tribunal in
a case involving human tragedy of incalculable proportion," U.N.
spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said.

He said Annan had accepted in the "best interests of the United
Nations and the tribunal" the resignation of the deputy
prosecutor, Honoure Rakotomanana of Madagascar, and the court's
register Andonico Adede of Kenya, who in effect served as chief
administrator.
</P>

UNITED NATIONS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Mohammed Sahnoun, a
U.N. envoy dealing with the crisis in Central Africa, on Wednesday
called for an immediate halt to escalating fighting in Eastern
Zaire between government troops and ethnic Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Sahnoun is gravely concerned about the escalation
of fighting in Eastern Zaire, including the air bombings," said
U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt at today's routine noon
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the fighting was worsening the plight of
the civilian population and of thousands of refugees, and impeding
the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The large dispersion into inhospitable terrain of the
inhabitants of Eastern Zaire fleeing the fighting and the reported
discovery of mass graves benefit no one and discredit all
protagonists, no matter how legitimate their cause might be," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Sahnoun calls, once again, on all the parties to
abide by Security Council resolution 1097 and cease hostilities
immediately," he said. In resolution 1097, the Security Council
endorsed a five-point peace plan for the region culminating in an
international conference.
</P>
<P>
A halt to the fighting would enable the international community
to "establish the facts and consider the practical modalities for
the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including mercenaries,"
Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
It would also promote the establishment of a durable peace
through dialogue, the electoral process and the proposed
international conference, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sultan Says No Rush for Probe into Dhahran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia would not rush
to any conclusion of the investigation into the Last year's June
25 truck bombing in Dhahran air base, which killed 19 U.S.
servicemen, even though some progress has been made, Saudi Arabian
Deputy Prime Minister Prince Sultan said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have not finished the investigation. We are not pointing
fingers yet at anybody," Prince Sultan told reporters during a
visit to the Pentagon when asked about the probe into the bomb
attack. "We are trying to make sure justice is seen to be done and
therefore we don't want to rush the investigation unnecessarily.
But there is progress."
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan's comments came as he was greeted by Defense
Secretary William Cohen for talks midway through a five-day visit
to Washington in a bid to patch a crack in relations between the
two countries, caused by U.S. alleged lace of cooperations in the
investigation into the truck bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has complained that Saudi Arabia was
not sharing enough information with the FBI in its probe of the
blast, and U.S. FBI investigators in Saudi Arabia felt frustrated
in making any advance in finding out who was responsible for the
Dhahran blast.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, however, said: "Our cooperation with our friends
is going in an excellent way and as soon as all the investigation
is complete we plan to reveal all the details."
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan met President Bill Clinton on Tuesday and will
hold talks with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday.
</P>

He and a delegation that includes the Saudi foreign, oil and
trade ministers will stay until Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Chilean Presidents Stress Hemispheric Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and visiting Chilean President Eduardo Frei met in the White House
today and they stressed their desire to expand free trade in the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The United States "cannot sit on the sidelines" while other
nations increase trade with Latin America, Clinton said at a joint
news conference with the Chilean president after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Our administration remains committed to concluding a
comprehensive free trade agreement with Chile," Clinton said,
adding that he wants to get so-called "fast track" trade
negotiation authority from Congress to conclude new trade
agreements that "open markets to America's products and that
advance our values."
</P>
<P>
President Frei told Clinton that trade within the Americas
should proceed "as if there were no frontiers."
</P>
<P>
Frei was here for a four-day visit in a task to bolster his
case for a reconstructed North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) that would include Chile.
</P>
<P>
Chile was invited to join the NAFTA, which links the United
States, Canada and Mexico, at the first Summit of the Americas in
Miami in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Chile has concluded agreements with Canada and Mexico and other
Latin American countries and is negotiating a deal with the
European Union. But the lack of fast track authority has delayed
negotiations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"At the crossroads of trade among the world's most dynamic
economies, Chile can be a cornerstone of the vibrant free-trade
area we are working to build in our hemisphere," Clinton said.
"The United States simply cannot sit on the sidelines while others
share in the fruits of Latin America's remarkable growth."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said unless Congress quickly renews his authority to
expand NAFTA, the United States risks losing to European and Asian
competitors already moving into America's economic back yard.
</P>
<P>
The president said he will send Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman to Chile to begin consultations on promoting trade in the
region. He also said the United States and Chile would begin
negotiating an aviation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Frei is to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reaffirms Opposition to WTO's Investigation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
reaffirmed its opposition to the investigation of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on a U.S.-European Union dispute over trading
with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a foreign trade dispute between the United States
and the European Union; it's a foreign policy difference," U.S.
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
WTO appointed three trade experts last week to set up a panel
to investigate the U.S.-EU dispute over the U.S. Helms-Burton law,
which is aimed at blocking Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The law, according to which, foreign companies will be punished
for trading with Cuba, was strongly criticized worldwide. EU
insists that it violates WTO's principles and submitted the case
to the organization.
</P>

<P>
NEW YORK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street fell
sharply today along with bonds, as more investors translating
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's latest remarks as
negative to the market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industry average fell 55.03 to 6,983.18, having
recovered from a nearly 123-point tumble in the afternoon. It made
an instant response to another warning by Greenspan at the
Congress that the market's quick rise poses an inflationary risk.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by more than a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaled 566.22
million shares up from 527.44 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 6.43 to 805.67, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 3.39 to 422.14.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.14 to 1,340.55, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.68 to 597.31.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan refused to rule out the possibility of an interest
rate hike by the U.S. central bank to slow down the economy to
ease inflationary pressures, which he said could be exacerbated by
the continuing run-up in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell immediately after Greenspan's remarks, pushing
the yield on the 30-year Treasury as high as 6.80 percent, up from
6.66 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dow component McDonald's was one of the big losers.

Dell Computer, which reported sharply higher earnings Tuesday
night, rose as the most active Nasdaq Stock Market issue.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Israel for Building Housing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday criticized Israel's decision to build new Jewish housing
in Arab East Jerusalem, saying such a move would not be conducive
to building trust in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. remarks came shortly after Israel approved the
construction of 6,500 homes in Arab East Jerusalem despite strong
Palestinians' opposition. The home will go up at a tree-covered
hill taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the project
as a move by Israel to alleviate a shortage of housing for Arabs
and Jews in the city. But the Palestinians see it as an attempt to
cement Israel's hold over all of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman David Johnson said: "The decision taken
today further complicates an already complicated situation."
</P>
<P>
Johnson said a deal on Hebron for Israeli troops to pull out of
the West Bank city had create an atmosphere in which to build
confidence and trust between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the decision was not "the type of actions we would believe
that would help build that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Population Hits 109 Million: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The population of Nigeria,
Africa's most populous country, hit 109.04 million in 1995, the
official News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said the figure comes from the 1996 edition of the "The
Progress of Nigerian Children", a bulletin jointly published by
the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) of Nigeria and the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The figure is 2.8 percent up from the 1994 figure of 106.33
million, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the United Nations put the population of
Nigeria at 115 million by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The joint publication of the FOS and UNICEF said Nigeria's
Gross National Products per capita declined 10 percent from 310
U.S. Dollars in 1993 to 280 U.S. Dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the average monthly household expenditure in
1992/93 stood at 1,150 Naira (about 14 U.S. Dollars), of which 76
percent were spent on food alone.
</P>
<P>
An average household virtually spent all their income every
month, with only eight percent left for savings, the bulletin
said.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the real income for Nigerian families
actually declined due to continued rise in prices, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's inflation stood at 73 percent, 16
percent up from that of 1994.
</P>
<P>
And nearly 16 percent of Nigeria's urban youths between the
age of 15 of 24 were out of work in 1995. The figure was 4.9
percent for rural youths and 6.7 percent for the national
average, the bulletin added.

<HEADLINE> PNA Condemns Israel for Jewish Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The permanent delegate of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to the Arab League (AL) today
denounced the Israeli government's plans for new Jewish
settlements in East Jerusalem and other Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sobeih, who is also a senior PNA official, said these
plans constitute a blow to the peace process and drive the area to
extremism and violence.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official called on the U.S. to adopt a decisive
stance as regards the settlement expansion "crime" committed by
Israel in East Jerusalem before "it is too late."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that
his government planned to build 2,000 apartments for Jews in Har
Homa area, located in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The project was included in a 43-million-U.S.-dollar
development plan approved by the Israeli cabinet on January 26 to
strengthen Israel's hold on East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will call a
meeting Thursday with all Palestinian factions to discuss the
issue of Jewish settlement and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said that the AL Council has held an emergency meeting
at the delegates' level regarding the Israeli settlement plans and
it is still open.
</P>
<P>
The AL, based on Cairo, is coordinating efforts in this respect
with the Arab, non-aligned and African groups at the U.N. Security
Council, he added.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid is conducting
intensified contacts with the permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council and Arab heads of state in this regard, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Netanyahu phoned Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak this afternoon on the establishment of the new
settlements in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned that Israel should avoid any act that may damage
the peace process and intensify tensions.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state says all of Jerusalem is its eternal and
undivided capital. But the Palestinians hope to make East
Jerusalem, which contains Judaism's holiest site and Islam's third
holiest shrine, capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan decided Tuesday to postpone a
visit to the Jewish state in reaction to the Israeli decision. He
put off a visit last fall after the opening of a tunnel in East
Jerusalem, an event leading to days of bloody clashes killing 61
Palestinians and 15 Israelis.

DAMASCUS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Syria today criticized a
decision taken by the Israeli government on building Jewish
settlements in Jebal Abu Ghneim, East Jerusalem, describing it as
flagrant challenge to international norms and laws.
</P>
<P>
Radio Damascus, in a political commentary, said the settlement
plans are an aggression against the Arab, Islamic and Christian
worlds.
</P>
<P>
The radio called on the Arab states to take a decisive stance
against the settlements in East Jerusalem and in other occupied
Arab territories, making Netanyahu realize that he was not only
challenging the Palestinians, but also the Arab and Islamic world
and international legitimacy as well.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that he who sides with peace, seeks peace
and exerts efforts for the success of the peace process, should
stand up to the current Israeli policy. It asserted that one
should not stand with folded arms in the face of the present
Israeli government's expansionist and settlement policies.
</P>
<P>
The commentary underscored that should Israel really want
peace, it will first have to cease settlement building, and pull
out from the Arab territories occupied in the 1967 Middle East
war.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Welcomes EU Call for N.Cyprus Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry
today welcomed a proposal by leading European Union (EU)
countries calling for northern Cyprus' participation in Cyprus' EU
membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told a regular press
conference that this showed that the EU had realized that
Cyprus consisted of both southern and northern parts, describing
it as a positive step.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since 1972 when
Turkish armed forces landed on the Mediterranean island to
protect Turkish Cypriots in the weak of a Greek Cypriot coup
seeking for union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long opposed EU's unilateral talks with the
Cypriot government over the island state's EU membership issue.
</P>
<P>
At a European Council meeting in Brussels on Tuesday,
Germany, Britain and France said that they wanted northern
Cyprus to participate in the membership discussion of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal has aroused strong opposition from the
Greek government, whose Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos called
it "a foolish behavior."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that Germany and Britain had presented a gift
to the Turkish but now they had to pay the bill, adding
that it would only block Cyprus' course towards Europe.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Greece would veto EU's enlargement program
to the east if Turkish Cypriots were allowed to be included
in the membership talks scheduled to start later this year.

<HEADLINE> Canada Ratifies Convention on International Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
announced the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection
of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which was finalized on May 29, 1993, and came
into force on May 1, 1995, seeks to establish safeguards so that
international adoptions are carried out in the best interests of
the children.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are approximately 20,000
intercountry adoptions around the world every year, of which 2,000
involve Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"The convention is an essential tool, as it sets out an
agreement to cooperate at the international level in order to
harmonize the practices of different countries. This cooperation
will help promote the rights of children in the world," said
Canadian Secretary of State Christine Stewart, who made the
announcement today.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, adoption falls within the jurisdiction of the
provinces and territories, which must pass legislation to apply
the convention.
</P>
<P>
To date, five provinces have passed implementing legislation.
They are British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward
Island and Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
The convention will come into force in these provinces on April
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> ECA, Nigeria Discussing Project Rationalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Commission of
Africa (ECA) and Nigeria are discussing ways for rationalizing
the commission's projects in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The move follows a request by the United Nations for a cut in
the number of such projects because of financial reasons, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The discussion, which began on Tuesday morning in the Nigeria
capital of Abuja, is being held behind closed door in the Federal
Ministry of Industry between ECA and ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Lt.-Gen. Balarabe Haladu was quoted by the
official news agency as saying that absolute privacy is needed
for more fruitful discussions.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the African Regional Center for Engineering
Design and Manufacturing are among the ECA team at the meeting on
the streamlining of the projects.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Responsibility for Canceled UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government today
denied the alleged responsibility for the canceled visit by a
delegation of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The government is satisfied that it had put in so much
toward the preparation for the joint mission and there is much
more to it than meetings with any particular individual to
warrant aborting or postponing it on account of lack of agreement
on such minor issues," said a government statement.
</P>
<P>
Param Comaraswany, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the
Judiciary and Independence of Judges, and Bakre W. Ndiaye, his
counterpart on extra-judicial and summary executions, were
scheduled to begin a 10-day visit to Nigeria last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But a row between them and the Nigerian government over the
mission's mandate and scope prevented their tour as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, a U.N. official in Geneva, Issac Bruto,
blamed the deadlock on the Nigerian government, saying it ruled
out the possibility for the special Rapporteur to see political
detainees, including opposition leader Moshood Abiola and others.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigeria argued it had at all points bent down to meet
the demands of the delegation which kept on putting obstacles
along the way.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have been attacking Nigeria on its human
rights situation. It reached its high tide when the Commonwealth
suspended Nigeria's membership following the government's
execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority activists in
1995.

<HEADLINE> French Information Pirate Costs Heavy Loss to FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A 21-year-old computer genius
was condemned to 18 months in jail in suspense and 50,000 francs
(9,000 U.S. dollars) of fines by a Paris court Tuesday for
disguising as FBI Paris chief to get free telecommunication
services.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Chris Zboralski, who proved himself a computer genius
when he was nine years old, cost the U.S. intelligence service
250,000 U.S. dollars by presenting himself as the FBI Paris chief,
Thomas Baker, to use free teleconference services of the France
Telecom state telecommunication company.
</P>
<P>
Imitating the voice of Mr. Baker, Anthony talked on the phone
and on computer with his friends around the world -- all of them
veteran information pirates -- and build a global information
empire of his own.
</P>
<P>
Anthony now has signed a contract with book publisher Calmann
Levy to tell his adventure story -- under the form of a
"manifesto."
</P>
<P>
He said that he had set up a firm, Immunis, which was
specialized in providing advices to enterprises on how to fight
information piracy, and claimed that he was opposed to the
monopoly by France Telecom of France's information world.
</P>
<P>
Judge Francis Bruty of the 12th Correctional Chamber of the
Great Investigation Tribunal of Paris said that although he was
impressed by the story, Anthony must be punished for "abuse of
false quality and disguising of voice."
