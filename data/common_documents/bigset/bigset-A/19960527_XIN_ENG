<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The most-famed German swimmer
Franziska van Almsick finally heaved a sigh of relief as winning
her speciality, the women's 200m freestyle, Sunday after suffered
two days of disappointment at the German national championships in
Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old clocked the world's best time this year, taking
the title with a convicing winning time of one minute 58.86
seconds, and also a berth in the German Olympic swimming team for
the upcoming Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Van Almsick, who swam below the qualifying time in the 100m
freestyle on Friday, lost her second chance in the 400m freestyle
on Saturday (finishing third), leaving herself just one chance to
race an indivudual event in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Van Almsick, winner of 11 European title-holder, had picked up
two silvers and two bronzes on her Olympic debut four years ago in
Barcelona.

team as he took both singles and doubles Sunday to lift
Switzerland to a 2-1 victory over the Czech Republic in the final

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wins 10th Thomas Cup Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia overcame the last
obstacle to their second straight Thomas Cup world men's badminton
team championships title by beating Denmark 5-0 in the finals
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Since their fellow countrywomen had taken the Uber Cup
Saturday, the Indonesians scored their second double victory in
the Thomas and Uber Cup finals so far.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the two trophies two years ago back in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's world number one Joko Suprianto took two straight
games in the first singles match against Dane Poul Erik
Hoyer-Larsen, ranked third in the world. Joko had led 9-3 in
their 12 previous encounters.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the Dane scored an upset win over China's world
number two Dong Jiong in the opening singles to inspire Denmark to
their first Thomas Cup finals since 1979. The Danes thus became
the only Europeans into the Cup finals in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, who displayed less of the lust with which he came
from behind to win from the Chinese ace 2-1, lost to the
Indonesian 18-14, 15-8 today.
</P>
<P>
Joko's victory paved the way for his team. Doubles players
Ricky Subagdja and Rexy Mainaky downed their Danish opponents Jon
Holst Christensen and Jim Laugesen 15-5, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
The second singles match saw Indonesia's world champion
Heryanto Arbi beat Thomas Stuer Lauridsen 15-8, 15-8 to bring
about an unassailable 3-0 lead over the Danes, which already
secured Indonesia of the team title.
</P>
<P>
Two remaining matches were played as stipulated by the rules of
the International Badminton Federation, the sport's world
governing body, although the results would not affect Indonesia's
victory.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians won again in the second doubles through the
strength of Gunawan and Bambang Suprianto who beat Danes Henrik
Svarrer and Michael Sogaard 15-7, 14-18, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
And Alan Budi Kusuma, one of Indonesia's best all-rounders,
sealed the Indonesian victory as he beat Peter Rasmussen 15-9,
15-6 in the closing singles.
</P>
<P>
Several Asian countries including Indonesia are said to have
expressed interest in hosting the next Cup finals in 1998. Since
no formal application has been presented and there are many
factors to be under consideration, the IBF has not yet come to any
decision on the 1998 venue.

<HEADLINE> 9,800 Offenders on Community Service in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has more than 9,800
convicted persons doing community service under a program
introduced in 1993, the Zimbabwean National News Agency ZIANA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Community services national coordinator Andrew Msengezi was
quoted as saying the program is helping curb congestion in
prisons.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe has 40 prisons with a total capacity of
16,000 but presently they hold more than 22,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"The community service program has an effect of reducing the
prison population and budget at a time when the prisons are
facing serious problems of under-staffing, inadequate funding and
high incidence of HIV infection among prisoners," said Msengezi.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success of the program to good assessment by
magistrates.
</P>
<P>
The success of the program has proved incarceration is not the
only solution because offenders themselves are appreciating the
community service program and in some cases being employed by the
same institutions upon completion of service, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asians Still Outshine Others in Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- With a win over Denmark to take
their second straight Thomas Cup world men's badminton team
championships title here this evening, Indonesia also completed a
feat of a second consecutive double victory in the Thomas and Uber
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Their women players won over China to take the Uber Cup
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the two trophies two years ago back in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
And today's was Indonesia's 10th Thomas Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Asians prove themselves as the leading force in
the world of badminton.
</P>
<P>
But the fact that Denmark entered the Thomas Cup finals for the
first time since 1979 sounded a meaningful warning that Europeans
are once again coming back onto the central stage.
</P>
<P>
Europeans have never won any of the sport's most coveted
trophies ever since the Cup events were introduced in 1948 and
1956 respectively.
</P>
<P>
But that did not stop European teams like Sweden and Denmark
from appearing strongly in such world-class events as the current
Cup Finals, Sudirman Cup world mixed team championships, world
championships and Grand Prix Finals.
</P>
<P>
It is the Danes who could now pose a real threat to the
long-standing Asian domination. Two days ago, Denmark, led by
world number three Poul Erik Hoyer-Larsen, scored an upset win
over world powerhouse China, to qualify for the Thomas Cup
finals. They were the only European side into the finals since
1979.
</P>
<P>
And the Danes' persistent efforts in the Thomas Cup finals
against the Indonesians show that they are not just one of the
finalists.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, with four victories so far, failed to achieve what
they had planned for this year's events, final for the men's team
and trophy for the women's.
</P>
<P>
Losing to a spirited Danish side was a sensational blow to the
Chinese who had come here to retake the Thomas Cup trophy they had
lost four years ago to the Malaysians. World number two Dong
Jiong was the first victim under the fierce attacks by
Hoyer-Larsen, ranked two places below him.
</P>
<P>
A more bitter blow came as the Chinese women's team lost to
their arch rivals Indonesians in a finals tie they were
overwhelmingly predicted to win.
</P>
<P>
Susi Susanti, Indonesia's ace and Olympic champion, opened the
way for her team as she came from a game down to beat China's
world number one Ye Zhaoying. The Indonesians went on to win the
finals 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that lack of mental training on the Chinese side
was one of the main reasons for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongbo, China's head coach, admitted: "We lost it due to
psychological weakness. It's the price we paid in a process of
bringing up the youngsters."
</P>
<P>
"We will still have a chance in the future, at the Atlanta
Olympic Games for example," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Attacks Iraq for Failure in Exchanging POWS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran said here today that no
progress was made in exchanging prisoners of war despite four
rounds of talks between Tehran and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Nagafi, head of the Special Commission for the
Prisoners of War (POWs), said that the two sides have already
reached agreement in three pages and seven points, but it has not
gone into effect yet.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official blamed the problem on Baghdad, saying
"absence of practical measures for implementing the accord lies in
lack of authority on the part of the Iraqi delegation."
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to hold negotiations on POWS with Iraq in light
of the importance Iran attaches to the war prisoners and those
missing in action, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hoped that the fifth round of talks would open
soon between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Najafi deplored that the Note Three of the United Nations
Resolution 598 concerning exchange of POWs has not been
implemented yet.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the report carried by the Iraqi media on escape of
100 Iraqi POWs from Iran and said after the exchange of the POWS
under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red
Cross, there is no place in Iran known as the POWs camp.
</P>
<P>
He said over 10,000 Iraqi POWs have already sought refuge in
the Islamic Republic and have been residing in Iran as refugees
after being interviewed by the ICRC representatives.
</P>
<P>
He said probably some of those refugees would return home
after the general amnesty announced by Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of POWs is one of the problems that blocks the
improvement of relations between Iran and Iraqi. The two
neighbors fought eight-year-war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Following the cease-fire between the two countries in August
1988, Iran and Iraq exchanged most of their POWs according to U.N.
Security Council Resolution 598.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran claimed that Iraq still holds more than 15,000
Iranian POWs according to the documents it has, while Iraq said that
there are some 5,000 Iraqi POWs still kept in ran.
</P>
<P>
Iran repeatedly attacked Iraq for its reluctance to cooperate
with Iran in the issue although it has unilaterally released
thousands of Iraqi POWs during the past years.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what Iran announced, the Iraqi side said that Iraq
holds only 64 Iranian prisoners, most of them were captured in
southern Iraq in 1990 and two of them were Iranian air force
officers captured in May 1993 when their aircraft were shut down
during their attack on the bases of Iranian outlawed Mujahideen
Khalq Organization (MKO) in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran did not reveal how many Iraqi POWs are still kept in
Iran, but it released 100 Iraqi POWs in August of 1995 as a
signal to Iraq for rapprochement between the two neighbors.

KAMPALA, May 26 (Xinhua)-- One soldier of the Uganda People's
Defence Forces (UPDF) was killed in an ambush by the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) rebels at Paicho, northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the victim was part of
a UPDF contigent transporting food to one of the army at
Gwero, northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A military source was quoted as saying the rebels targeted the
UPDF dry food rations but the UPDF soldiers managed to fight off
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The source said the rebels, who are reportedly experiencing
severe shortages of food, could be part of a group sent following
Thursday's UPDF offensive at their bases at Tegot Ato Hills,
northern Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), a radical Palestinian
group, have reached a draft agreement on suspension of attacks
against Israel, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat met with a Hamas delegation at the
weekend to put weight behind the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources were quoted as saying that the two sides
discussed, among other things, the call issued by the jailed Hamas
founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, for stopping attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published by a pro-PA Arabic newspaper in
East Jerusalem today, a draft agreement had been reached between
PA and Hamas as well as Islamic Jihad, another radical Palestinian
group.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft accord, both the Islamic fundamentalist groups,
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, pledge to stop violent attacks and to
oppose the Israeli-PLO peace agreement by political and democratic
means.
</P>
<P>
But Hamas leadership abroad has totally rejected the draft
agreement, saying that anti-Israeli attacks will continue.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Receive Shipments of Foodstuff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Transport Ministry has
said its facilities are ready to receive commercial vessels
carrying foodstuff to the country under the oil-for-food agreement
signed Monday by Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Murtadha Ahmed Khalil, minister of transport and
communications, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency today, said that
the facilities of the Arab Gulf port of Um Qasr in southern Iraq
are ready to unload some 30,000 tons of goods and foodstuff daily
at an average of 2,00 tons per dock.
</P>
<P>
He said that the technical department of his ministry has made
plans to receive commercial ships and oil tankers at the Gulf
ports in south Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Khalil expected that various shipments of foodstuff will arrive
in Iraq within few weeks. His ministry has prepared technical
staff to maintain trucks and railway cars to ensure an easy flow
of goods into the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the partial oil sale accord between
Iraq and the U.N., observers here believe that it will take at
least three months for foodstuff to reach Iraqis who have suffered
great hardship under the sanctions imposed on iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq still needs to do a lot of work to implement the oil
accord, which allows it to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil every six months to pay for foodstuff and medicine for its
people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that under the terms of the U.N.-Iraqi deal the
oil revenue can bring Iraqi individuals only 35 cents per day. The
U.N. offer can meet only part of what the Iraqis need in addition
to the rationing.

President Yasser Arafat today declined to endorse any candidate or
party in the Israeli elections which is due to be held on May 29.

Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat said: "I don't think it

</P>

Arafat explained that the peace agreement is not between

However, Palestinian officials are reported to have privately
said that if Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres wins he is
expected to speed up negotiations that will lead eventually to the

<HEADLINE> UK Beef War With Europe Backfires at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's beef war with Europe which
Prime Minister John Major launched last Tuesday backfires at home,
by failing to boost the Conservative party's popularity and
reopening new splits on Europe in the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Amid the beef ban row with the European Union (EU), Major lost
his patience last Tuesday and threatened to disrupt normal EU
business unless rapid progress was made on lifting the global ban
on British beef product exports.
</P>
<P>
But a special ICM poll for the Observer today, the first
opinion poll since the war began last Tuesday, dashed Tory hopes
that the beef war would boost the party's popularity.
</P>
<P>
It showed that by a margin of three to one, voters blamed the
government, rather than the EU, for the mad cow crisis which led
to the ban.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 percent said the government's actions last week made
them more likely to vote Conservatives at the next election and 18
percent were less likely to back them.
</P>
<P>
There is also widespread scepticism about the government's
motives, with more than half agreeing with the statement that "the
government's actions on the EU beef export ban are no more than a
cynical ploy to try and win votes here in Britain."
</P>
<P>
Conservative leaders had hoped the beef war with Europe would
appeal to anti-Europe sentiments in Britain and bring about a
long-awaited revival in the party's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
But local press reports today said that the strategy could
backfire, especially if the crisis ended in anything short of
outright victory for Britain, and Major was forced to choose
between prolonged conflict and early retreat.
</P>
<P>
Deep ministerial divisions over the handling of the beef crisis
was reported today.
</P>
<P>
While right-wing ministers are pressing for the toughest
possible line to be continued right up to the general election
with resignation threatenings, the left-wing are seeking a solution
at the earliest opportunities and mobilizing for a counter-attack
against "xenophobic hysteria."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accuses Sudan of Torturing Innocent Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Deputy Prime
Minister and Defence Minister Tamirat Layne accused Sudan of
"carrying out inciting and inflamatory propoganda campaigns
against Ethiopia, crossing the common border, killing and
torturing innocent Ethiopians residing near the frontier".
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held here Saturday to mark the
5th anniversary of the May 28 Liberation Day, Tamirat said,
"turning deaf ears to Ethiopia's repeated request to change its
adamant interventionist policy, the government in Khartoum is
trying to indulge in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries
thereby worsening relations with them."
</P>
<P>
"Sudan is harbouring and training out-lawed elements in a wishful
attempt to distablize the peace of the sub-region," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Sudan has resorted to forceful measures despite
Ethiopia's efforts to seek peaceful solutions and restore good
neighbourly relations strained as the result of the attempted
murder on the life of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "this does not mean that the two countries,
Ethiopia and Sudan, are in a state of war".  enditem

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Defends British Action Over Beef Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind has rejected claims made by European Union (EU) President
Jacques Santer that Britain mismanaged the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview this morning, Santer
issued a stark warning that Britain's non-cooperation with the EU
would prove counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
Santer noted that it would also counter-productive for the EU
to go as far as giving a clear timetable for lifting the global
ban on British beef product exports, because it would not gain the
confidence of the other EU member states.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that the EU Commission should have been
informed of the British action earlier.
</P>
<P>
Countering Santer's accusations, Rifkind told the BBC
television that the British government could not have such
information circulating in Brussels before parliament had been
informed.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind stressed that the British government would insist on
the EU agreeing to a timetable for lifting the ban on British beef
products by the EU summit to be held in Florence later next month.
</P>
<P>
If the go-ahead was given next week at the EU agriculture
ministers special conference to lift the ban on some British beef
by-product exports, the British government would seek start
exporting beef from grass-fed herds, free of BSE or mad cow
disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the beef war declared by British Prime Minister John
Major last Tuesday seems on the verge of backfiring at home with
some ruling Conservative MPs threatening to resign over the beef
war.
</P>
<P>
George Walden, Conservative MP, has said that he may consider
resigning the party whip, which will wipe out the majority at the
Commons.
</P>
<P>
Walden called the Government's non-cooperation with the EU over
the beef war a "cynical" move and he said that if the
confrontation worsened, he might be forced to detach himself from
the party, although he did not suggest he would force a
by-election.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the ban on March 27 when the British government
admitted that there were possible links between BSE and its human
equivalent Creutzdelft-Jacob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cabinet Meets Despite Coalition Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cabinet ministers
gathered in the southeastern province of Sanliurfa today amid
fierce quarreling that brought the two-party coalition to the
brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz chaired the meeting, described by
the local media as a showcase of the government's plan to develop
the region, hit by the Kurdish separatists conflict.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decided to carry out the necessary amendments to
some legislation in order to avoid any vacuum which the planned
gradual lifting of emergency rule in the southeast part of the
country may cause.
</P>
<P>
However, journalists covering the meeting seemed more
interested in the future of the coalition government between
Yilmaz's Motherland Party (ANAP) and Tansu Ciller's True Path
Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Ciller, facing corruption charges that
could finish her political career, has announced that her party's
alliance with ANAP "legally and practically finished."
</P>
<P>
In response to questions concerning the coalition crisis,
Yilmaz told reporters in Sanliurfa that he was determined to stay
in his post until a new government model was found or until
consensus for a new government was reached in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz also criticized Ciller for acting against the coalition
protocol.
</P>
<P>
He said the two parties had agreed on inquiry into any
corruption allegation, but when Ciller found herself the subject
of an inquiry, she broke her commitment made in the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Also today, President Suleyman Demirel who was inspecting the
same area, said that as long as the government was in place and
enjoying the confidence of parliament, it was not for him to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
"Suppose the government has resigned, it will continue until

<HEADLINE> Customs Duty on Tractors Slashed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)
has finally reduced customs duty on tractors by some 75 percent,
the latest issue of the local weekly "financial mail" reported.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU)
George Grey was quoted as saying that the customs on tractors and
other listed agriculture machinery which had been attracting 20
percent customs duty will now attract 5 percent as stipulated
earlier in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The ZRA caused an uproar early this year when it decided to
classify tractors as vehicles instead of being classified as
agricultural machinery which can attract less duty.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, customs duty on productive machinery
for agriculture and raw materials will be reduced from 20 percent
to 5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Unexpected rains which started on
Saturday have caused serious concern of Zambian farmers.
</P>
<P>
The government meteorological department headquarters in Lusaka
was this morning flooded with calls from farmers in various parts
of the country, who wanted to know the duration of the current
rains.
</P>
<P>
The farmers expressed fears that if the rains persisted it
would destroy their crops such as cotton and maize.
</P>
<P>
At present, the farmers are harvesting maize and cotton from
fields.
</P>
<P>
Senior forecast officer in the department Jacob Nkomoki
explained that although it was not a rainy season, the drizzle
the country was experiencing was a result of convergence of the
moist south westerlies and dry north easterlies from the equatorial
low pressure area.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow the country would expect more rainfall especially in
Eastern province, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Peres, Netanyahu Clash Head-on in Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's prime ministerial
candidates Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu today traded fires
with each other in a pre-election debate in last-ditch efforts to
woo the floating voters who may decide the outcome of the close
contest.
</P>
<P>
The half-hour televised debate, held at Peres' Labor party
headquarters in Tel Aviv, is a face-to-face showdown between
the two arch rivals who answered a variety of questions including
Jerusalem, terrorism, Oslo accords and the assassination of late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
But after all, the voters will possibly be left unimpressed as
neither of them put forward any new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Peres, the current prime minister, opened the debate with the
accusation that his Likud rival Netanyahu "organized in the past
three years a terrible libel" against him on the question of
dividing Jerusalem, Israel's self-declared "eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem will remain Israel's united capital for eternity,
and only the capital of Israel. We united Jerusalem, and we will
remain united behind it, " Peres said, adding that he will make
the political decision in a referendum "to ensure the unity of
the people."
</P>
<P>
When Channel 1 moderator Dan Margalit asked how he will keep
Jerusalem united as Palestinians also strongly demand it be the
capital of their future state, Peres pledged that he will not
make any compromise but the Palestinians will.
</P>
<P>
"I'm certain the Palestinians will also have to make
compromises, they will make the compromise concerning Jerusalem,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu, in his opening statement, returned fires
by attacking Peres on the question of terrorism, the central
issue in this year's close race for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Peres for placing the security of the Israelis
into the hands of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian National
Authority president whom he refused to meet.
</P>
<P>
"Peres brought neither peace nor security," the hard-line
Likud challenger claimed. "It brings us fear. Our children are
afraid to get on a bus, many of you who are watching us now are
getting up in the morning, and ask yourselves whether the next
attacks will happen today."
</P>
<P>
He is referring to the wave of suicide bombing attacks
launched by radical Palestinians from February 25 to March 4,
which killed at least 58 people and wounded over 150 others in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that, if elected, he will adopt a different
policy based on three principles: returning the responsibility for
security to the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli General
Security Service; proposing to the Palestinians a fair
arrangement of self-rule, but opposing a Palestinian state; and
conducting peace talks with all neighbors while ensuring security
in the Golan Heights and a united Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He promised he will lead Israel into the 21st century "toward
security, prosperity and a real peace with all our neighbors."

<HEADLINE> Peres, Netanyahu Clash Head-on in Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Netanyahu dodged the question about his intention to pour 400
million U.S. dollars into expanding Jewish settlements. Instead,
he once again blasted Peres for de facto dividing Jerusalem. He
added, however, that while respecting the created reality of the
current Israeli-Palestinian peace deals, or Oslo accords, he is
committed to "guarding our security and keeping a united
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
On the question of the Golan Heights, another key issue, Peres
tried to disperse the suspicion about his readiness to hand the
strategic plateau over to Syria by saying that he will "insist on
security arrangements, ensuring water sources, full normalization
(of relations with Syria)" and take a tough stance in negotiations
with the Syrians before reaching a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The TV channel moderator also raised the question of the age
difference between Peres, 73, and Netanyahu, 47. Peres said he did
not think his age a disadvantage, declaring himself to be "in
good condition, full of faith, full of a sense of mission."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was perhaps embarrassed when Margalit asked about
his extra-marital affairs which he admitted as "a mistake" that
hurt his wife and family. But, in answering the question he again
did not forget to take the chance to criticize Peres for "hurting
the whole people of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Rumors were rift before holding the debate that Netanyahu
would throw a political bomb by proposing forming a national
unity government with the Labor party. But, he did not.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the debate will likely have only limited
influence on the undecided voters. Opinion polls show that Peres
and Netanyahu are running neck-and-neck, though Peres is still
taking a wafer-thin lead of five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps confused by the game of words by the two candidates who
pledge to provide the nation with "peace with security" or
"security with peace," the percentage of the floating voters
remains considerably high at over 6 percent even three days away
from the elections.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 3.9 million Israeli voters will cast their votes
to directly elect the prime minister, for the first time, and the
120-member Knesset (Israel's parliament).
</P>
<P>
This means that the Israelis will have a direct say in deciding
the future of the nation and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Today's debate appears to be the culmination of the
three-month-long relatively dull and drowsy election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by the tragic Rabin's assassination and the
militants attacks early this year, Labor and Likud, the two
leading parties in the elections, both adopted a low-profile
campaign policy that avoided inciting demagogues, mass rallies and
violent street clashes that featured the previous Israeli
elections.
</P>
<P>
The police reported that they have registered only 275
election-related complaints involving mainly minor scuffles
between party activists, pasting over posters, threats and
arson. For financial and security reasons, Labor and Likud also
agreed this week to cancel the final party rallies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations fact-finding
group to Nigeria said today that the country's transition program
to civil rule seems genuine and warned against attempts to
interrupt or reverse the momentum being generated on it.
</P>
<P>
In a 24-page report, submitted to the UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the mission also warned against the
imposition of sanctions on the country "at this stage," saying it
could retard the progress toward positive improvement.
</P>
<P>
"Our meeting and discussion with General Sani Abacha and other
Nigerian leaders have given us the impression that the head of
state is sincere in his commitment to restore civil democratic
rule by October 1, l998," the mission said in the report.
</P>
<P>
The mission, which visited Nigeria from March 29 to April 13,
said there was a general opposition to any sanctions against
Nigeria, adding that "sanctions would hurt only ordinary people
and have a negative impact not only on the Nigerian society and
also on the whole west African region." enditem

<HEADLINE> China to Absorb Overseas Management Expertises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China should absorb experiences and
advanced management expertise from overseas to reform state-owned
enterprises, Zhang Haoruo, deputy director of the State Commission
for Restructuring the Economy, said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an enterprise management seminar here sponsored by
the Japanese Sumitomo Group, Zhang said that it is crucial for
China to continue reforms in the state-owned enterprises through
solving in-depth problems that have plagued some of the
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The state must, with concentrated efforts, succeed in the
reform and development of the 1,000 large state-owned enterprises
and enterprise groups in the near future, with about 800 of them
generating 74 percent of the country's industrial profits and
taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also noted that China should invigorate smaller
state-owned enterprises by re-organization, association, merger
into joint stock partnership, leasing, contractual operation or
sell-out, as their specific circumstances permit.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal of reforming state-owned enterprises,
China should absorb the advanced management expertise from
overseas, as a move to run well state-owned enterprises as a
whole, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
A total of ten Japanese experts in the fields of finance,
insurance and banking will give lectures on management
enterprises at the meeting, which was attended by Chinese
officials and enterprise representatives.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiyasu Sato, Japanese Ambassador to China, also attended the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Patten, Major Urged to Rebuff Negative Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven business associations in
Hong Kong jointly issued a statement here today calling on
Governor Chris Patten and British Prime Minister John Major to
take actions to rebuff negative reports about Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, the seven associations issued an open letter to John
 Major criticizing Patten's attacks on Hong Kong's business
community.
</P>
<P>
In the letter they expressed "profound disappointment" at
comments made by Patten during his North American tour,
specifically remarks in an interview with Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
Today's statement said that they are "disappointed at the prime
 minister's reply to the letter because "he has failed to respond
to the key issue raised in our letter, namely, the business
sector's concern over the negative image of Hong Kong generated by
recent international media reports."
</P>
<P>
"By making reference to 'serious skepticism about Hong Kong's
future', the prime minister has acknowledged that there is an
image problem for Hong Kong in the international arena," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that while there may be different points of view as to
how such skepticism was triggered, one would have expected the
most senior and highest-paid official of Hong Kong to put aside
such differences and to defend Hong Kong by projecting a proper
image of the territory, rather than making critical remarks about
a sector of Hong Kong with which the governor happens to disagree,
to the extent that such remarks has led to a reputable
international journal to infer that the business sector has
betrayed Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "In the interest of Hong Kong, we call on
the governor and the prime minister to act in rebuffing negative
reports such as in the Newsweek and not to allow the negative
image of Hong Kong to stick in the international arena."
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Federation of
Hong Kong Industries, the Chinese Manufacturers Association of
Hong Kong, Business and Professional Federation of Hong Kong, the
Hong Kong Exporters Association and New Territories Commercial and
Industrial General Association Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Second Runway Needed for Hong Kong's Unfinished Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A second runway for Hong Kong's new
unfinished airport will be needed to meet the increasing demands
for air travel, the Hong Kong Preparatory Committee's Economic
Panel said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came at the third session of the Economic Panel of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) that ended today in south China's coastal city of
Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
Work on the new Hong Kong airport is well advanced, with a
massive construction program. But before its first plane lands,
officials are now predicting that a second runway will be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Extending their appreciation to a briefing given by relevant
departments of the British Hong Kong government, members hoped the
British side will provide early details of the construction scheme
to the Sino-British Airport Committee for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a railway in the northwest part of the "New
Territories" was also discussed at the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The railway project strides across 1997 and will cost a large
sum of money, but its actual construction will start after the
establishment of the SAR. The Panel members suggested the British
side submit detailed documents of the project as soon as possible
to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group so that an overall
arrangement can be made.
</P>
<P>
They said that the costs of the construction of the railway
should not be a burden on Hong Kong citizens.
</P>
<P>
Contracts concerned with consultancy, design, construction,
credit of the rail project will all be recognized by the future
SAR government, they said.

PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Joint world number one Monica Seles
of the United States advanced into the second round in the women's
singles at the French Open tennis championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, 22, who is bidding for a fourth French Open crown after
her victories in 1990, 1991 and 1992, made an impressive retrun to
the Roland Garros Stadium after four-year absence by hammering out
a 6-1, 6-1 win over Caroline Dhenin of France in just 62 minutes.

<P>
Seeded to play her great rival Steffi Graf in the final, Seles
now plays either Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan or Katarzyna Nowak of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who is jointly seeded number-one with Graf, took charge
of the match against the powerful 168th-ranked wild-card entry
from the start -- and, apart from a 15-minute opening game in the
second-set, she never slowed up.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Students' Strike Continues in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The class boycott of the students
of Mozambique's biggest Eduard Mondlane University today entered
its eighth day with the door to reconciliation still closed.
</P>
<P>
Students guarding the main gate said today that the university
gate will not be opened until their demands for better food and
more allowances are met.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, President of the university Brazao Mazula issued a
ultimatum to the striking students, ordering them to open
university gates and remove their blockade to the university by
local time 17:00 on the day.
</P>
<P>
The students began their strike of class on May 20. They
locked all the university and classroom gates, placed road
barriers in the campus, leading to a standstill teaching,
researching, administration and logistical work in the
university.
</P>
<P>
On May 22, Mazula announced that the government has promised
to allocate 4.6 billion Meticais (about 410,000 US Dollars) to
the university, which can be used to improve food and raise the
minimum subsidies from the current 140,000 Meticais per month
(about 12.6 US Dollars) to a level ranging from 160,000 to
250,000 Meticias per month.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the president's reconciliatory proposal, the
students insist that the university observe a promise made early
this month to improve food and increase their allowances to
400,000 Meticais (about 36 US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Students' Association of the university declared an
indefinite boycott of class on May 22 after a failed round of
seven-hour talks between the students and University president
Mazula.
</P>
<P>
The striking students also requested to meet Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi or Finance Minister Tomaz Salomao.
</P>
<P>
On May 24, Mocumbi asked the students to take a responsible
move and end their class boycott, warning that the government's
prudence should not be misunderstood as tolerance to law
breaking.
</P>
<P>
So far, local radios, television stations, news agencies and
newspapers have been giving a full coverage of the class boycott.
There are few organizations and individuals who have clearly
indicated their support for the striking students.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest city, Shanghai, is
to reduce the strength of its traffic cop division by a seventh,
by relying on science and hi-tech to police its vast road network.
</P>
<P>
The use of science and technology will help the coastal city
improve traffic control, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The city is scheduled to reduce the number of its traffic
police by one-seventh in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's traffic flow, however, will increase by eight
percent by the end of the century, sources with the municipal
traffic control department revealed.
</P>
<P>
By then the city's roads will have to cater for 820,000 motor
vehicles and seven million bicycles and other non-motor vehicles,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic police in Shanghai are to introduce the most advanced
computer systems, and hi-tech telecommunication means to examine
traffic scenes, transmit information, and deal with accidents.
</P>
<P>
A computer network, which will cover the road system of the
whole municipality, is scheduled to be established by the year of
2000.
</P>
<P>
The network will be able to transmit information to every
command center and every intersection in the city, improving the
quick-response capability of the police.
</P>
<P>
The number of motor vehicles in Shanghai has raced forward by
62 percent during the 1992-1994 period, while the road space of
the city increased by 14 percent, lagging far behind the city's
needs.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Buy Chinese Locomotives for Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Nigeria
will soon import new locomotives from China to step up the pace
of streamlining its railway system, which will undergo a large
scale rehabilitation with the help of Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar Sabonbirni,the Deputy Director of Land
Transport in the Transport Ministry, the importation will begin
after the Chinese engineers repair some of the rail tracks in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the tracks, said the official, is to
enable expected locomotives to be put into meaningful use and
ensure their durability. And the number of locomotives to be
ordered at first would depend on the extent of repair on the rail
tracks.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lagos bureau of China Civil Engineering
Construction Corporation, which is in charge of the railway
rehabilitation project in Nigeria, about 200 Chinese experts are
now in the country assessing the rail tracks for repair in all
the railways' four divisions, while some of them are repairing
the coaches and wagons.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Chinese experts could finalize the
rail tracks assessment by August this year and then the
reactivation of the equipment would start.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria signed a technical agreement with China last December
for the restructuring of the railways. Under the agreement, 50
locomotives should be imported from China.
</P>
<P>
Some wagons and coaches are also to be imported from China
under the revitalization program, which is estimated to cost
about 200 million US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Eleven Criminals Executed for Large-Scale Stealing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Eleven thieves, described as
hardened criminals, have been executed in China as part of the
country's get-tough drive against rising crime.
</P>
<P>
The death sentences spell a warning to gangsters and compulsive
thieves that they will face the ultimate sentence for the misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
Families of young petty thieves were urged by state officials
to drive home the warning with the message "Stop the petty
thieving now - it could save your life."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court of China announced the executions at
a press conference in Beijing. It was announced that the 11
hardened criminals, all male, had been convicted in five cases of
large-scale stealing across the country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that among the eleven, three of the
convicted had records of re-education through labor or served
prison terms, including one escaped criminal.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, said
that the five cases are quite different in nature from common
theft.
</P>
<P>
"The criminals' sole purpose for stealing is to get enough
money for a luxurious life, while the victims are mostly
industrial enterprises, mines, stores, and state coffers," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that all the offences involved large amounts of money,
occurred repeatedly, continued over a long time, and covered vast
areas, while most of them were carried out by criminal groups with
the basic characteristics of underworld gangsters.
</P>
<P>
"We must deal resolutely and deliver a severe blow on these
criminals before they become more powerful and do more harm to our
society," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Tao Yibin, Lan Zhijun, and Chen Guofu, all peasants from
southwest China's Sichuan Province, were convicted of 21 thefts
from 19 work units in the capital city Chengdu and other places
from July to November in 1994, stealing items worth a total of
260,000 yuan (about 31,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Gao Zhiru, Sun Weicai, and Sun Chengyi, peasants from east
China's Shandong Province, were found guilty of 51 thefts in
Shandong and the neighboring Jiangsu Province from March 1994 to
May 1995, stealing 43 head of farm cattle and other property worth
126,000 yuan (15,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, a worker from the Lujiang County of east China's
Anhui Province, and Zhu Changshan and Lu Rongyue, both peasants
from the same county, committed 19 thefts in Shanghai and Jiangsu
Province from December 1994 to September 1995, netting 190,000
yuan in illicit money.

<TEXT>
<P>
A peasant from east China's Jiangxi Province, Zhang Zhenfeng
was sentenced to three years in prison in 1991 for robbery, and
escaped in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
From March 1993 to January 1995, he and several accomplices
carried out 74 thefts, among which he did 57 alone, and stole some
55,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
From November 1989 to February 1995, Li Quanzhan, a peasant
from Jiaozuo City in central China's Henan Province, led a group
of criminals on the run, in the thefts of 18 cars and tractors
worth over 175,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
All the 11 criminals, Liu said, were sentenced to death and
deprivation of political rights for the rest of their lives in the
first trials in accordance with China's Criminal Law and relevant
regulations by the NPC Standing Committee, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Eight of them refused to accept the sentence and made appeals,
which were rejected by the Higher People's Courts at provincial
level, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He announced that all death sentences had been carried out by
the Intermediate People's Courts in Chengdu in Sichuan Province,
Linyi in Shandong Province, Wuxi in Jiangsu Province, Ganzhou in
Jiangxi Province, and Jiaozuo in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Theft is the main crime in China today, accounting for 80
percent of all reported criminal cases. The stealing of bicycles
is rampant in cities, while more young people among thieves caught
by the police.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that most large-scale stealing and hardened
criminals evolved from small thefts and common thieves.
</P>
<P>
"The whole society must be on high alert against thefts, and
families of thieves should help them to give up their bad habit at
an early stage," Liu urged. "This could save their lives."

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Ceases to Appear in Public: Koljevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic will no longer appear in public "as requested by the
international community," said Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug today quoted Koljevic as saying
that the Serb state Republika Srpska has fulfilled all the
international community's demands and expressed hope that there
will be no reintroduction of sanctions against Yugoslavia and
Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic sacked his moderate Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic on
May 15, arousing indignations from the West.
</P>
<P>
Western countries have threatened to reimpose sanctions against
the Serb authorities if the twice-indicted Serb leader do not step
down.
</P>
<P>
Under strong international pressure, Karadzic gave most of his
power to Vice-President Biljana Plavsic 10 days ago, which was
viewed by international mediators in Bosnia as the beginning of
his final withdrawal from the public.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Karadzic should have stepped down
early this year and should be barred from running the upcoming
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Koljevic told a local radio in the Yugoslav city of Kragujevac
that the preparations for the forthcoming elections in Bosnia had
already been completed.
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming elections are expected to fully legitimize the
power institutions in Republika Srpska within the future Bosnia,"
the Serb vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
The first post-war elections in Bosnia, slated for
mid-September, will be organized and monitored by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe in line with the Dayton
peace accord. The elections are believed to be essential for the
peace of future Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
To make sure that the peace process in Bosnia remain on track,
the U.S. has called for a high-level conference in Geneva on June
2 to be attended by the signatories of the Dayton peace agreement
-- leaders of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia as well as
representatives of the five-nation Contact Group -- the United
State, Britain, Germany, France and Russia.

<HEADLINE> PA Confirms Contacts with Hamas, but No "Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority today
confirmed that it had held contacts with the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas), but not "official dialogue," according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudainah, the media adviser of PA President Yasser
Arafat, said in a statement, "We deny the media reports that
there is an official dialogue between the authority and
Hamas. There are only contacts with them and others on various
issues."
</P>
<P>
"The authority encourages all parties to respect the
law," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sayed Abu Musameh, a Hamas spokesman, Sunday also denied
that there is reconciliation agreement between Hamas and the
PA. He said that Hamas officials had resumed the meetings with PA
President Arafat that were interrupted by the suicide bombings in
February and March.
</P>
<P>
Musameh was responding to a report in the daily Hayat
al-Jadida, which said Hamas and the PA had reached a draft
agreement normalizing relations between them.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that he had been at a meeting with Arafat on Friday
night, that was also attended by Hamas officials Sheikh Hassan
Shama and Dr. Mahmoud Zahar, who was recently freed from Gaza
jail after he was arrested during a PA crackdown in March.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the three, who met earlier with Hamas
spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who is jailed in Israel,
delivered a letter from Yassin to Arafat giving his blessings to
the alleged the draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
In an Israel Television interview three weeks ago, Yassin
expressed his acceptance of Arafat's leadership. He also accepted
the Palestinian National Council's right to amend the Palestinian
Covenant, and said he could accept an agreement between Israel
and the PA that provided for two states.
</P>
<P>
"We should live next to Israel," he said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Chairmen of Two U.S. Oil Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today held
a meeting with the chairmen of two of the United States' leading
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li met Lawrence Fuller, chairman of Amoco and Frank
McPherson, chairman of Kerr-McGee at the Diaoyutai State Guest
House in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The two chairmen were in China to celebrate the start-up of
Liuhua 11-1 offshore oilfield which they developed jointly with
China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
Li extended congratulations on the start-up of the offshore oil
field, located in the Pearl River Mouth Basin, 190 km southeast of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese and U.S. oil sectors have a long history of
cooperation and have enjoyed mutual-trust relations," Li said
during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's economy has developed rapidly, giving
rise to greater demand for oil and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between China and the U.S. in the fields of
oil and petrochemicals is promising," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation is better than confrontation," Li said, and added
that China and U.S. businesses should become reliable cooperative
partners.
</P>
<P>
Fuller said the start-up of Liuhua 11-1 offshore oilfield was
of great significance. The U.S. and China should carry out
mutually-beneficial cooperation, instead of reciprocal sanctions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries should be based on
equality, he added.
</P>
<P>
McPherson said that successes have been achieved in oil
exploration and development as a result of teamwork between
U.S. and Chinese oil companies.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. business circles are looking forward to more fruitful
cooperation with the Chinese in the years ahead," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Liuhua 11-1, China's biggest offshore oil field jointly
developed with foreign oil companies, became operational on March
29, 1996. Its geographic oil reserves have been estimated at 200
million tons.

AMMAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti held talks here today with a visiting European Union
(EU) delegation headed by Ingo Fredrich who is a member of the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the relations between Jordan and the EU
and their cooperation in various fields, especially in the
parliamentary sector.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the latest development in the Middle East
peace process and Jordan's role in cementing regional stability.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member delegation, who arrived here Saturday on the
second-leg of its Middle East tour, Sunday held talks with
Jordanian Minister of Planning Rima Khalaf and discussed the
development in negotiations on the EU-Jordan association agreement
which is scheduled to be finalized mid-summer.
</P>

Jordan Times, an English-language daily.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process, which is one of the main aspects of the

formulate a common foreign policy to be able to play a more
powerful role in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the lack of a common foreign policy within the EU
had caused internal problems which impeded active European
involvement in the Middle East.

LUSAKA, May 27 (Xinhua)-- Long queues are stretching out at
some filling stations in Zambian capital Lusaka, where fuel is
available, while other stations are running out of petroleum
products as a fuel shortage has hit zambia since last week.
</P>
<P>
Rationing of petroleum products has been implemented in all
parts of the country in the past week.
</P>
<P>
the shortage, which has thrown motorists into panic, has been
caused by closure of the Ndola Indeni Oil Refinery recently, the
country's only refinery.
</P>
<P>
The Indeni management reportedly claimed that it stopped
production to prepare for maintenance works.
</P>
<P>
The business community expressed fears that the fuel shortage

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sets New Rules For Property Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
announced today new rules for private property purchases by civil
servants and public sector officials in an effort to maintain the
integrity of a good government.
</P>
<P>
The Government Public Service Division (PSD) said that with
immediate effect, civil servants and employees of statutory boards
will have to give full details of the terms of purchase of private
property.
</P>
<P>
They have to fill up a declaration form which must be submitted
to the permanent secretaries within a week of either signing of
the option or the sale and purchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
The new rules also stipulated that when buying private
property, civil servants cannot take up any discounts or
concessions, if they know the developer or seller in their
official capacity or if they and their departments have official
dealings with the developers or the sellers.
</P>
<P>
Property purchases by spouses and financially dependent
children must also be declared in a similar manner, according to
the new rules.
</P>
<P>
As for permanent secretaries, they have to declare their
transactions to the head of the Civil Service, who will in turn
declare the transactions to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The PSD also made it clear that civil servants need not seek
approval before making their purchases, be it at a soft or public
launch.
</P>
<P>
But they must maintain strict standards of personal conduct and
integrity in their dealings with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
If there are any subsequent queries, the civil servant has to
prove that his transactions are above board.
</P>
<P>
The PSD said the rules will be reviewed periodically to ensure
they are effective and remain relevant.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the new rules came in the wake of the
three-day parliament debate on the property purchases by Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son Deputy Prime Minster Lee Hsien
Loong.

standards by giving our outstanding musicians the opportunity to
practice on the best instruments available," Chen said at a
ceremony in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A number of Chinese art organizations have found that they are
in financial difficulties, as the market economy introduces fierce
competition and the government cuts subsidizes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the troupes are now being encouraged by the government
to seek funds from community and the private sector, following the
example set by their western world partners.
</P>
<P>
Today's donation ceremony was attended by Li Yuanchao, vice
minister of culture, and the Canadian Ambassador to China, Howard
Balloch, who both praised Nortel's kindness.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr.Philip Yu, chairman of Nortel's Chinese branch,
"Nortel has a tradition of support for the arts around the
world. It is only natural for us to extend this tradition to
China."
</P>
<P>
With 63,000 employees, Nortel is a global manufacturer and
trader of information, entertainment and communication
equipment. It has six joint ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
The donations are a Heckel-brand bassoon, a Fox-brand
contrabassoon, a Buffet-Prestige-brand bass clarinet, five Ludwig
custom-built Ringer timpani and 66 sets of strings for cello,
viola and violin.
</P>
<P>
The 100-member orchestra was established in 1955 under its old
name, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra of China. Now it is
re-constructing itself into a world grade one, with the help and
guidance of top Chinese leaders and the community.
</P>
<P>
Director Chen said that the government is still playing the
biggest role in supporting the orchestra by providing basic
salary, houses and training to the musicians. However, in the long
run, most of the operational budget will have to come from
non-government sources.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israeli Elections: Testing Time for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East peace process
will face the most fateful test on Wednesday when Israel hold
elections to elect, directly for the first time, its prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli voters will cast two separate ballots
simultaneously to elect the prime minister and the 120-member
Knesset (Israel's parliament).
</P>
<P>
The race for the Premiership features a two-man close contest
between the ruling Labor party's current Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and the opposition Likud's chairman Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Pre-election opinion polls showed that the two rivals are
running almost neck-and-neck, although Peres is holding a
wafer-thin five point lead over his Likud challenger. On Sunday,
both of them claimed victory after a face-to-face showdown in a
televised pre-election debate, but neither dropped a political
bomb by putting forward any new ideas to break the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Putting aside the Israeli politics, what at the highest stake
in the elections is the Middle East peace process which was
inaugurated by the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Israeli voters will choose between two
starkly different visions of future when they cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
"Israelis can choose peace or paralysis," said Thomas
Friedman, the New York Times foreign affairs writer in Tel Aviv,
Israel.
</P>
<P>
A victory by Peres, the chief architect of the ongoing peace
process, will likely give the Israeli-Arab peace a major boost
and widen the prospects for a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Peres' predecessor Yitzhak Rabin, who
was assassinated by a radical Jew last November, and Peres,
Israel has made peace with the Jordanians, signed an interim
peace pact with the Palestinians, and is forging ahead with peace
negotiations with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Peres, eager to win his own mandate from the Israeli public,
has promised that, if reelected, he will continue the peace
process, seeking to seal the final peace with the Palestinians,
to clinch a peace pact with Syria and Lebanon and to realize the
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by the looming Israeli general elections, the
Israeli-Palestinian final status talks began in early May but
soon hit a snag and were delayed until after the elections. A
final peace deal will pave the way for creating an independent
Palestinian state, a scenario strongly rejected by the hardline
Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Although the Likud party, facing the reality of the present
state of the peace process, also played a peace card in its
election campaign by promising to continue the process, many
doubt how it can achieve this by rejecting the principle of
land-for-peace enshrined in the Oslo accords, the cornerstone of
the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
The stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, vital to realizing the
comprehensive peace in the Middle East, also anxiously await the
results of the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Optimism arose early this year for a breakthrough in the
four-year intermittently Israeli-Syrian peace talks, but
disappeared soon as the Israeli side shifted its attention to the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that a win by the rightist challenger Netanyahu,
whose party vows never to abandon any land Israel has occupied
since the 1967 Middle East war, is set to slow down, or even kill
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Likud party has made clearly in its platform that, if
taking over power, it will freeze the implementation of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace deals, oppose the establishment of a
Palestinian state, expand Jewish settlements in the Palestinian
territories and refuse to relinquish the strategic Golan Heights
seized from Syria.
</P>
<P>
This will make it virtually impossible to continue the peace
process based on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The elections were originally scheduled in October, but Peres,
riding on a wave of sympathy spawned by the tragic assassination
of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, decided in February to
advance the polls.
</P>
<P>
However, a spate of suicide bombing attacks by the anti-peace
Islamic militant movement Hamas, which killed 58 people
from February 25 to March 4, erased Peres' comfortable
double-digit lead in opinion polls over Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Peres, aware that further terrorist attacks will mean his
election demise, ordered a crippling closure on the Palestinian
self-rule areas of Gaza Strip and West Bank, a massive crackdown
on the Islamic activists and a ferocious military operation
against the Hezbollah (Party of God) forces in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
These measures effectively reduced the terrorist attacks and
ensured Peres' slight lead over Netanyahu, who depends his
election fortune largely on his promises of protecting the
security of Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli pollsters predict that Peres could be guaranteed a
victory if he succeeds, at least before the elections, in
checking the terrorist activities, but nobody can be absolutely
certain until the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Clear Water Available to More Rural Population in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has made great strides in
the provision of adequate sanitation in the rural areas, where
over 70 percent of the population now has access to clean water
and sanitation, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Institute of Water and Sanitation
Development Paul Taylor said less than 25 percent of Zimbabwe's
rural population did not have access to good sanitation
facilities in the past, but great strides have been made in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Referring to sanitation conditions in Africa, he said that
because of the lack of adequate sanitation in most countries in
Africa, water-borne diseases have become highly prevalent and
accounted for a greater percentage of infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
He was particularly concerned at the deteriorating sanitation
in the urban areas due to rapid urban growth caused largely by
rural-urban migration.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Health and Child Welfare
Tsungirirayi Hungwe noted that intense population pressure, rapid
urbanization and lack of financial resources to develop and maintain
better sanitatin facilities have led to a dangerous deterioration in
many areas and cities' water supply and sanitation networks.

<HEADLINE> China To Have World Class Scientists: Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
in Beijing today that China must have scientists in the forefront
of world science by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the fifth
national congress of the China Association for Science and
Technology (CAST).
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 deputies from all walks of life from around the
country attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After 18 years of effort, Jiang said, China has enjoyed great
success in its reform and opening drive, and the overall strength
of the country has been greatly strengthened and the living
standards of people has markedly improved.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, China has been severely restricted in its
sustained development by relatively low-quality of the whole
national economy and problems related to resources, population and
environment.
</P>
<P>
"In the international economic competition and international
relations," he said, adding that "we are faced with both the
pressures of economic and scientific advantages from developed
Western countries, and pressures of hegemonism and power
politics. Whether we can accelerate our country's modernization
drive and obtain greater initiatives in international cooperation
and competition will determine our future position in the
international community."
</P>
<P>
"We must concentrate our strength on economy, give full play to
the role of science and technology, markedly improve the economic
strength and comprehensive national strength of our country, and
continuously develop and strengthen ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Science workers must always bear in mind the economic
construction, continuously strengthen the adoption and development
of science and technology, he said. They should also target their
main tasks on major science and technology issues in the national
economy and social development that need urgently to be solved.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that science researchers who are engaged in
basic research work must target the new scientific frontiers in
the world and make concerted efforts to ensure that China achieves
greater contributions so that the country can have the position it
deserves in world hi-tech areas.

"The science and technology workers must raise the banner of
patriotism high in their hands," he said, "foster the spirit of
science, resolutely fight against superstition and backward
customs, expose and resist all forms of pseudo-science and make
relentless efforts to raise the moral standards as well as the
scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation."
</P>
<P>
"Talents are crucial for the implementation of the strategy of
revitalizing the nation with science and education," he said.
</P>

"Talents are the most important and most precious of all social
resources. And party committees and governments at all levels must
always promote and give support to outstanding science workers in
all areas, cherish and make good use of them."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China must have a contingent of scientists who
can enter the world science forefront at the turn of the century,
a contingent of engineering technicians who can incessantly solve
problems in economic and social development, and a contingent of
experts who are both professionally capable and versed in the art
of leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CAST, as a member of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, should actively carry out its
functions of political consultation, supervision and involvement
in state affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the associations for science and technology at
all levels must continue to strengthen scholastic exchanges and
propagation of science knowledge, the education in science and
technology for the youth in particular, to raise the quality of
the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged science workers to be active scholastically, be
brave in exploring new fields and setting forth new theories and
conduct exchanges with counterparts with different views.
</P>
<P>
He also urged science workers to further strengthen connections
with foreign counterparts, actively develop international
nongovernmental science exchanges and cooperation and broaden
exchanges and cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to make
more contributions to the peace and development of the world and
realization of the reunification of China.

<HEADLINE> Head of PLO Political Department Visits Syria </HEADLINE>

<P>
DAMASCUS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Farouk Kaddoumi, the head of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Political Department, was
in Damascus for a several-day visit to Syria, Damascus Radio

</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Damascus International Airport Sunday

his homeland and the establishment of a comprehensive and just
peace in the Middle East.

Political observers said that Kaddoumi's current visit to Syria

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chaoyang, one of China's most
populated county-level cities in south China's Guangdong Province,
has recruited 5,300 technicians from home and abroad to greatly
accelerate its economic development.
</P>
<P>
With a population topping two million, the county's technicians
only account for a tiny fraction - just 0.057 percent - of its
population, an embarrassing percentage for such a populated county.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of China's reform and opening-up drive, the
shortage of technicians began to hit the smooth economic
development of the county.
</P>
<P>
Li Bingshui, director of the county's personnel department has
held talent markets in such cities as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing
and Guangzhou for several years in a move to recruit more talented
people for the county.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Xiashan Township, Chaoyang city, witnessed its
agricultural and industrial output value topping 1.7 billion yuan,
thanks to the 329 technicians recruited in recent years.

<HEADLINE> China to Host First Toilet Show in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Spending a penny in China has
always presented a problem, particularly for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Even officials admit that the country's public toilets are a
headache - not just for visitors, but for local people.
</P>
<P>
Now Beijing is preparing to lift the lid on the problem by
staging the country's first ever toilet show. The event will take
place in the Museum of Chinese Revolution on June 5, World
Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
Li Guangrong, director of the local environment sanitation
administration, told a press conference today that the show is
aimed at improving toilet facilities and increasing awareness
among the people for public hygiene and the quality life.
</P>
<P>
On show will be 1,200 pictures, 60 designs of public toilets
and 70 paintings, charting toilet history in China and in the rest
of the world, and the current toilet revolution in Beijing. It
will also feature very latest in toilet facilities.
</P>
<P>
Li said the capital has 58,000 public toilets, including 50,000
in the premises of various companies and institutions, and 8,000
street toilets, ranking the first place among the world's leading
cities.
</P>
<P>
But there are only 200 public toilets in the city's main
streets and commercial centers: one toilet for every 15,000 people
in main streets and just one for every 100,000 in busy commercial
centers such as Xi'dan, Wangfujing and Qianmen.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jingyuan, environment sanitation expert of the Ministry of
Construction, said a state-level sanitary city requires 30 public
toilets in every square kilometer, and one in every 200 meters in
busy streets.
</P>
<P>
However, China, with a population of 1.2 billion, has only
90,000 public toilets and the average toilet rate for urban
dwellers ranks bottom in the world.
</P>
<P>
The toilet shortage and low quality of such toilets have always
been a headache for overseas tourists and local residents, Liu
added.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Processing-on-Commission Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The processing-on-commission trade
between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) increased by 9.7 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The increase, according to the International Trade and Industry
Ministry here today, was over the same period of last year. And
the volume of the January-March trade was 6.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The so-called processing-on-commission trade means that the
South Korean raw materials are shipped to the DPRK for processing.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume nose-dived 60.8 percent in January from a year
earlier, but bounced back to 1.18 million dollars in February, and
then jumped to 4.59 million dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total volume of the inter-Korean commodity
exchanges approved in the first three months of the year totaled
50.8 million dollars, down 41.2 percent from the same period of
last year, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the inter-Korean processing-on-commission trade
registered 26 million dollars, up 56.9 percent over the previous
year, while the total volume of commodity exchanges stood at 310
million dollars on a approval basis, up 35 percent from 1994.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Stressing Lawyers' Role By Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawyers are expecting more
social prominence and legal protection following the passing of
the country's first law on the country's legal system.
</P>
<P>
The new law was passed recently at the Standing Committee of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
It is widely recognized that the eight-chapter law, which is
based on the 17-year implementation of Temporal Regulations on
Lawyers, has shown China's determination to complete its legal
system by giving a boost to the legal service sector.
</P>
<P>
The temporal regulations were formulated by the NPC in 1980,
one year after China's readoption of lawyers in its judicial
system following a 20-year break.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth of legal service markets, however, the
regulations have become increasingly outdated and the need for a
better and more complete law on lawyers was seen as urgent.
</P>
<P>
Among several draft laws passed by the 19th session of the NPC
Standing Committee, the law on lawyers was the only one to get a
full vote.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the new law, a Beijing lawyer said that he was most
impressed by two major changes.
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers are no longer defined as 'state law workers',
but 'practitioners providing legal services for society', and the
law has given lawyers permission to set up law firms in the forms
of cooperation or partnerships," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
China now has 7,200 law firms, among which more than 5,500 are
state-funded, 500 cooperative, and over 1,200 run in
partnerships. Scores of law firms named after some individual
lawyers have also been approved since 1994.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the quality of the lawyers, the law stipulated that
all applicants for lawyer's qualifications must possess higher
education degrees, and all except a few who "are engaged in law
research and education and have senior professional titles" must
pass a unified national examination given by the state judicial
departments.
</P>
<P>
Some law experts predicted that after the law's implementation,
China will give special tests or training to lawyers without
college degrees or records of national exams.
</P>
<P>
Some people held that since the Constitution has clearly
guaranteed the personal rights of each citizen, it seems to be
unnecessary for the law to include the article that "the personal
rights of lawyers in law practices should not be violated."
</P>
<P>
Responding to this doubt, Zhang Geng, vice-minister of justice,
said that this article is of "absolute necessity" in safeguarding
the rights of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"There have been many serious cases in violation of lawyer's
rights across the country," Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
Two other major breakthroughs under the new law are
stipulations on lawyers' associations and legal assistance. There
is only one article in the temporal regulations on lawyers
concerning the lawyer's association, which enjoys a whole chapter
in the new law.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Justice claimed that it is the
first time that legal assistance, a system under which the state
pays lawyers fees for poorer citizens in certain kinds of
lawsuits, has been written into the law.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry is carrying out this system in major
cities across the country, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Wuhan, Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province, and
Yinchuan, capital of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Nationality
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The law on lawyers is to come into effect and replace the
current temporal regulations on January 1 next year. The NPC,
Ministry of Justice, and Chinese legal circles have expressed full
confidence in it, saying they believe the new law will greatly
help Chinese lawyers and legal service sector to reach maturity.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's GDP Growth Bigger Than Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rate for the year's first quarter was bigger than the
previously projected 7.3 percent, the Bank of Korea said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said, the GDP amounted to 80 billion U.S. dollars in
the three-month period, up 7.9 percent from the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the higher-than-projected growth to brisk
exports, bustling construction activities and robust private
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports in the first three months of the year
amounted to 31.83 billion dollars, up 21.5 percent from the same
period of last year, while imports stood at 35.62 billion dollars,
up 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector grew 9.3 percent in the period, thanks
to public works projects which resulted in a 17.2-percent growth
in government investment from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industries grew 10.8 percent, buoyed by increasing
exports, but light industries suffered a 2-percent decline,
widening the growth gap between the two sectors.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications industry enjoyed a whopping 20.9-percent
expansion on the strength of the ever-expanding cellular phone,
electronic paging (beeper) and international telephone services
networks, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's GDP is expected to grow 7.2 percent this year,
compared with the 9-percent growth last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Official Calls for Long-term Global Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Malaysian official
today called for the launch of a major international effort to
ensure a bright future for global food security.
</P>
<P>
Deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim made the appeal at the
opening here of the International Conference on Food Neglect:
Implications on Political and Social Stability of Nations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, organized by the Agricultural Institute of
Malaysia, is attended by some 300 people from 10 countries, who
have presented 12 papers for discussions.
</P>
<P>
Global food security is a topic for panel discussion at the
ongoing gathering.
</P>
<P>
Despite the obvious limitations of the world's current
agricultural system, Anwar noted, the prospect for maintaining the
global food supply remains bright.
</P>
<P>
He cited, among others, dwindling global reserves of grains and
unused land, resource degradation and population growth as factors
that are threatening the food security.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said that to overcome the
limitations, expanded efforts and new investments are required,
besides new forms of sustainable intensification, to achieve the
desired agricultural output growth.
</P>
<P>
As a means to achieve food security, Anwar suggested that food
assistance must continue to be provided to the undernourished,
whose number will be about 730 million people in 2010.
</P>
<P>
A major step must be taken, he said, to boost food output in
low-income food deficit countries and increase the income of the
poor so that increased output is matched by increasing purchasing
power.

oil every six months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people
means the first step to lift the U.N. sanctions on the country, he
said that this is "in no way lessens the requirements on the part
of Iraq to fulfill all relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations clamped comprehensive sanctions on Iraq,
including a ban on its oil exports, as punishment for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili arrived here Sunday to inspect the American
forces stationed in the Gulf. He held talks with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and met Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he left Kuwait with a reassurance that "our
relationship is on a very sound footing and that we will continue
to work together" on various matters concerned. Kuwait is his
first stop on a Middle East tour which will also take him to Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the United States are linked by a defense agreement
signed in 1992, a year after U.S.-led forces liberated Kuwait from
seven months of Iraqi occupation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Social Security System Helps State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Social Security System
now covers high percentages of benefits for employees and retired
workers, greatly relieving the state enterprises of financial
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The system covers 90 percent of old-age pensions and 95 percent
of unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
With the current focus on state enterprises' reform, state
authorities are beginning to realize that the social security
system, including old-age pension, unemployment insurance, as well
as medicare system, can monetarily assist the state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the city's old-age pension system shouldered 130
million yuan for 13,000 workers in 82 financially unstable and 14
bankrupt enterprises. All of these employees retired in advance.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's textile industry is represented by 373,000 workers
and 300,000 retirees.
</P>
<P>
The situation improved considerably during the past two years
due to the old-age pension system which had provided over 300
million yuan annually for the industry.

<HEADLINE> China to Become WTO Member "Sooner or Later": Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu
Yi today told Norway's Minister of Trade and Shipping Grete
Knudsen that China will become a member of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) "sooner or later."
</P>
<P>
China will not change its policies of reform and opening up to
the outside world no matter when it joins the organization, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Knudsen said that it is time now for China's access to the WTO,
and the WTO will be not complete without the membership of China,
which has a huge population and is increasingly opening.
</P>
<P>
Wu, agreeing with Knudsen's view, said that it is absolutely
unreasonable to keep a major trading country like China outside
the WTO for such a long time.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the WTO Secretariat, China ranked
11th last year in the list of the world major trading countries
and areas in terms of foreign trade. China has maintained its
place for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986 when China first applied to restore its contracting
party status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, China
has made great efforts to the end, and such efforts have been
universally acknowledged, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wu said, certain countries, especially the United
States, has politicized the issue of China's access to the WTO,
and proposed excessive demands, complicating the issue.
</P>
<P>
Wu reiterated that China is determined to become a member of
the WTO, and this has been well demonstrated by the fact that
China had fully participated in the Uruguay Round of Talks and
signed the final act.
</P>
<P>
Yet, she said, China's access can only be realised on the basis
of the Uruguay Round Agreement with developing country status as
its prerequisite and the obligations suitable to China's economic
development level.
</P>
<P>
Any demand for China's access disregarding China's status as a
developing country will be refused.
</P>
<P>
Knudsen said that Norwegian government is willing to take
concrete measures to support China's early access to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two ministers also exchanged views on
furthering trade and economic cooperation between Norway and China.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting they co-chaired the open session of the
11th meeting of the Sino-Norwegian Mixed Committee on Trade and
Economy.

<HEADLINE> Cooperative Economy Encouraged in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The development of cooperative
economy in all branches and sectors has been encouraged in
Vietnam, according to an official press report here Monday quoting
an instruction of the Vietnamese Communist Party central committee.
</P>
<P>
The instruction issued last week was made in line with a
resolution of the Party's Political Bureau in February and the Law
on Cooperatives adopted by the National Assembly in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The instruction underlines the cooperative economy as an
"objective demand and indispensable tendency" in the process of
developing the multi-sectoral socialist-oriented commodity economy.
</P>
<P>
"The party stands for the development of a multi-sectoral
commodity economy of which the cooperative economy is an important
part, together with the state-owned economy, gradually becoming a
basis of the economy and also a socio-political foundation of the
country on the way to achieving the goal of a prosperous people, a
strong country and an equitable and civilized society," the
instruction said.
</P>
<P>
Party organisations at all levels should contribute to the
development of the cooperative economy.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative economy in Vietnam must be developed vigorously
from low to high levels and in different forms. Cooperatives
should be set up in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, industry,
small industry and handicrafts, construction, transport, trade and
services as well as credit, said the instruction.
</P>
<P>
The instruction stressed that the government addresses a
unified state management towards all cooperatives on the national
scale.
</P>
<P>
There are currently about 25,000 cooperatives in
Vietnam.

<P>
FUZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official in east
China's Fujian Province - separated from Taiwan only by the Taiwan
Strait - has called for creating necessary conditions and easing
up in the atmosphere for development of relations across the
Taiwan straits.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should return to the "one China"
principle not only in words but also in deeds, said Xi Jinping,
deputy-secretary of the provincial Communist Party Committee, at a
working conference on Taiwan that ended May 21.
</P>
<P>
He added that "Fujian Province will promote economic and trade
co-operation, making preparations for exchange of trade, mail,
shipping and air services between the two sides across the strait.
</P>
<P>
"We will improve the investment environment, making intensive
efforts to draw more investment from Taiwan," he went on to say,
noting that the province will go on improving a soft investment
environment, attaching great importance to simplifying
formalities, increasing efficiency, and strengthening inspection
on law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Offices dealing with complaints from Taiwan-funded enterprises
have gone into operation in Fuzhou and Xiamen. Similar offices
will also be established in other coastal cities in the province.
</P>
<P>
"We should uphold and implement the principle of "placing more
hopes on the Taiwan people and strengthen the publicity campaign
to help increase the people's awareness of the country's policies
and principles toward the island province, so as to contribute
more to the great cause of achieving peaceful reunification for
the motherland," Xi said.

<HEADLINE> ZCCM Retrenchment Talks Bog Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations between Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and the Mineworkers Union of
Zambia (MUZ) on retrenching 2,000 workers have broken down after
the two sides disagreed on final packages for retrenched workers.
</P>
<P>
Sources at ZCCM revealed here today that due to financial
problems, the retrenchment talks have been suspended
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM and the trade union vehemently differed over how much the
miners would be paid and whether they would be given the money on
June 1 when the retrenchment exercise would have taken place,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
"The talks which have been going on for sometime were
abandoned late last week, no new date has been agreed and it
looks like the suspension will take quite sometime," the sources
said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Technology-intensive Enterprises Snowballing in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in Shanghai are
planning to establish investment and risk funds to give a boost to
nongovernment-run technology-intensive enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Nongovernment-run technology-intensive enterprises came into
being in Shanghai a decade ago as a product of the country's
opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 7,000 such enterprises in Shanghai, making
it the city with the largest number. Last year the enterprises
produced 17.7 billion yuan worth of output value, an increase of
nearly 40 percent compared with the previous year. Twenty
enterprises reported an annual output value of more than 100
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year per capita profits and taxes surpassed 10,000 yuan
for the enterprises, higher than the city's average level.
</P>
<P>
Many of the enterprises are seeking expansion through absorbing
idle social funds and joining forces with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The largest problem facing the enterprises is insufficient
production funds, experts noted. Once the problem is solved, the
nongovernment-run enterprises will emit more energy, they said.

<HEADLINE> Round-The-Clock Vigil For Ailing Veteran Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zoo keepers are maintaining a
round-the-clock vigil in a bid to help ailing male giant panda
Yingying, one of the world's oldest giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Yingying, who is suffering from a serious lung disease, is
being treated at the Zoo of Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Veterinaries and giant panda keepers are providing
day-and-night attentive care to 25 years old Yingying, trying to
help the venerably-aged giant panda to survive.
</P>
<P>
The panda has suffered from a nasal cavity disease since last
year, and the recent hot weather made his illness serious,
explained the zoo keepers. They expect the giant panda to finally
recover from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Yingying is regarded as one of the oldest pandas in the world
since usually giant pandas only live for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old female giant panda "Peipei" at the same zoo is
said to be still healthy, but has been separated from Yingying.
</P>
<P>
The giant pandas under the top state protection are facing
extinction form the earth mainly because of their low reproductive
capacity. There are merely about 1,000 pandas living in the wild,
zoos and research centers in China,
</P>
<P>
Experts form the China Giant Panda Breeding Technology
Committee have announced plans to cultivate a new method within
five years to save the endangered species -- by breeding test-tube
pandas.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Holds 10th Trial of Two Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Seoul District Court
opened today the 10th trial session on mutiny and treason charges
involving former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun, Roh and Chun's 11 fellow
generals and colonels.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, defense lawyers questioned the 11 defendants
on their roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979, and in
the bloody crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in
Kwangju, capital of South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
The defendants who were queried included Yoo Hak-seong, former
deputy defense minister for logistics, Hwang Young-si, former
first army corps commander, and Lee Hak-bong, Hur Sam-soo and Hur
Hwa-pyong, the so-called "gang of three from the Defense Security
Command."
</P>
<P>
Defendants Yoo and Hwang insisted that they had mobilized
troops in self-defense against attempted preemptive strike by
loyal generals in December 1979.
</P>
<P>
Lee and the two Hurs claimed that it was necessary to detain
then Army Chief of Staff Chung Seung-hwa to investigate his
involvement in the assassination of President Park Chung-hee at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' cross-questioning on former presidents Chun and Roh
was finished in the previous trial session.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers, including Chun
and Roh, have been indicted for mutiny and treason for their roles
in the 1979 military revolt and the 1980 military crackdown of the
Kwangju civil uprising.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan, who loomed large as the army strongman after the
1979 military revolt, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled
the nation until February 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Roh Tae-woo, who stepped down in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the mutiny and treason charges, the two
ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted for graft charges as they received huge bribes from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have already stood trial three times each on the
graft charges separately.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Motors to Set Up New Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is planning
to set up a new line for mass-producing automatic transmissions in
the summer next year, Kyodo News Service quoted a company official
as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new line will be set up at its Kyoto factory at a cost of
around 10 billion yen, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The move will ensure that operations at the factory will not be
reduced after the company stops manufacturing engines for the
U.S. automaker Chrysler Corp., the official said. The contract
with the U.S. automaker ends in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto factory currently has the world's largest
engine-production capacity, turning out 1.8 million engines a
year, with 430,000 shipped to Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
The company will aim to turn out approximately 120,000
transmissions in the first year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the automaker will reduce purchases of auto
parts and make more of its own, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The facility where engines for Chrysler are being manufactured
will be producing engines for commercial vehicles in the Asian
market, he said.

<P>
Phnom Penh, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States and France
have upgraded security warnings given to their citizens now living
or traveling in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the "Cambodia Daily" today, the French
and U.S. embassies announced the new consular warnings last Friday
in light of a recent upsurge in crime against foreigners in this
capital city.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 foreigners, mostly expatriate residents, have been
robbed at gunpoint by bandits in the past week in a series of
increasingly violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
Among lastest incidents, an Australian man was robbed and
assaulted last Saturday, and a Canadian was fired upon but
unharmed late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh restaurants and nightspots catering to foreigners
have reported a significant downturn in business since the
beginning of the month, when the number of robberies began to
soar.
</P>
<P>
"For the past three days, we have been telling people to avoid
taking motorcycle taxis at night," said a French embassy
spokesman, who stressed that no mandatory security measures were
being considered.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. embassy stated in its guidelines that it
"advises its personnel to avoid traveling alone or in remote areas
of the city, especially after dark."
</P>
<P>
The embassy also encourages U.S. citizens "to take considerable
caution" while traveling by road outside of urban areas, or after
dark in areas such as the northwest of Phnom Penh.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (UNWFP) office here has been forced to buy maize for
refugees outside Uganda because there are limited quantities
available in the country for export.
</P>
<P>
The UNWFP office, according to the local daily "The New
Vision" here today, has obtained less than half of the tendered
quantities of maize.
</P>
<P>
The UNWFP officials were quoted as saying that they have
tendered for 5,000 metric tons of maize, but they got offers for
2,000 tons only from their suppliers at about 210 US Dollars per
ton.
</P>
<P>
The maize crop in January and February this year has
reportedly not been as good as expected in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The UNWEP officials said that although there are limited quantities
of maize for export, the local market is not in any undue crisis.
</P>
<P>
They said as a policy, the UNWFP is not willing to
pay higher prices than the prevailing local prices, adding that
they are here to solve the problems of refugees, but not to cause

<P>
SHENYANG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The northeast China city of Dalian
has been providing governmental relief funds for low-income
families as of January last year.
</P>
<P>
The effort of Dalian, the first of its kind in China, has so
far benefitted a total of 16,000 people, at a cost of more than
one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year the city offered more than five million yuan to
households with less than 145 yuan in per capita monthly income.

<P>
About 70 percent of the relief fund is provided by the city
government, and the rest by the district governments, officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
Though considered a relatively developed coastal city in China,
Dalian still has 15,000 citizens, or 10 percent of its population,
below the government-set lowest living standard.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee the normal lives of the poverty-stricken
population, Dalian City came up with the program, which is being

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Land used for construction in
south China's Guangdong Province, one of the economic powerhouses
in the country, has shrunk markedly, local land administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year the amount of land used for
non-agricultural purposes in Guangdong dropped 40 percent from one
year earlier to reach 1,380 ha, the latest statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the sharp decrease to the influence of the
country's overall economic climate, the strengthened protection of
cultivated land and the stern control of land for non-agricultural
purposes, especially the control of real estate development.
</P>
<P>
Land for real estate development totalled 246 ha, a drop of
more than 60 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land for key projects and industry has also seen
a considerable decrease.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, land used for energy projects jumped 38 percent,
while land for transportation projects and civic works was the
same as in the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> China is Capable of Eliminating Poverty by 2000: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China has created favorable
conditions to eliminate poverty in the last few years of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1993, the number of absolute impoverished people
in China reduced from 250 million to 80 million, according to an
article in the current issue of monthly "Outlook." The figure has
slipped to some 70 million so far this year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The judgement was supported by three factors: rapid growth of
national economy since 1978, a widening gap in the income between
urbanites and rural residents and a change from nationwide
absolute poverty to regional ones.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Kang Xiaoguang, an associate research
fellow with the national condition analysis group under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China's effort to help 170 million poor get out of poverty
within 15 years is an achievement of historical significance in
the world, Kang said.
</P>
<P>
The "Anti-poverty drive" is not only an economic issue but also
a political one, he said. An important obligation of the central
government is to promote the overall development of socialist
economic development and narrow the differences in incomes of
different social groups.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate poverty before the year 2000, Kang said, China
should switch from conventional moral support to concrete actions,
replace relief funds and materials with government aids for
developing local natural resources and change the method of
providing assistance to poor areas to individual families.
</P>
<P>
In Kang's opinion, poverty-stricken areas should exploit their
untapped rich natural resources and develop rural industry, raise
the cultural level of ordinary farmers and train technical
personnel. He wants to build a social security system in rural
areas and improve anti-poverty management.
</P>
<P>
However, eliminating poverty in China is an arduous
task. National statistics of impoverished population exclude the
12 million urban residents living under the poverty line. To this
end, government financial assistance is limited.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The District Court and
Magistrate's Court of Sri Lanka's Jaffna city resumed sittings
today as part of the government's rehabilitation program after its
recapture of the former base of Tamil rebels, media sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The massive rehabilitation program aims to reestablish civil
administration in the Jaffna peninsula, which had been controlled
by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in its fighting for
a separate Tamil state in the northwest of the country since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the High Court of Jaffna, as well as the
District Court and Magistrate's Courts of Kayts, Mallakam,
Chavakachcheri and Point Pedro in the peninsula will also resume
sittings soon.
</P>
<P>
After three military operations starting last October, the
government troops recaptured the whole peninsular -- an area of
2,500 square kilometers with a population of 900,000 people,
predominantly Tamils who are descendants of south Indian settlers.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have reportedly retreated into jungle hideouts
in the peninsula and to Kilinochchi and Mulativu on the mainland
after the armed forces' Operation Riviresa III.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mayors Urge Faster Housing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Mayors of China's major cities have
thrown their collective weight behind plans to completely reform
the country's housing system by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
It will spell the end to China's days of cheap housing for
millions of people. Rent levels will gradually increase from five
percent of their pay to 15 percent, and more families will buy
their homes instead of renting.
</P>
<P>
One mayor summed up the key reason for the reform - housing
costs have become an unbearable burden for the country.
</P>
<P>
The mayors have called for a quicker pace to be taken in
housing reform nationwide to establish a new housing system by the
year 2000, with the focus on selling and enhancing rents of the
state-owned housing property.
</P>
<P>
Rents will be further raised to a ratio accounting for 15
percent of a household's monthly salaries from the existing five
percent, according to the mayors of major Chinese cities who
attended a recent national conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
State-owned apartments will also be sold to residents at prices
that reflect their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Under the new housing system, the state will no longer
undertake investments for housing construction alone. Instead
housing developments will be shared by the state, enterprises and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
"It is an unbearable burden for both the country and the
enterprises to undertake residential housing for residents under
the existing housing system," said Song Chunhua, mayor of
Changchun city in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, the State has by now provided three
billion square meters of public-owned housing for urban residents
nationwide and the depreciation charges for these state-offered
houses top 21 billion yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
The state will also spend seven or eight billion yuan annually
for the maintenance of the houses.
</P>
<P>
Deputy mayor of Shanghai Xia Keqiang noted that the
establishment of public accumulation funds for housing is an
important component of the on-going housing reform, which
comprises both individual savings and the financial assistance
offered by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The funds will help residents to buy houses and channel more
funds into housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Xia added that Shanghai has so far collected 6.8 billion yuan
for public housing funds and some one fourth of the city's total
housing construction investment comes annually from the funds.
</P>
<P>
Taking the country as a whole, 35 large and medium-sized cities
as well as over 100 cities at prefecture level have set up the
housing accumulation funds and pooled a total of 11 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jin, deputy mayor of Shenyang in northeast China, stressed
that the system of low housing rents can no longer be allowed to
continue.
</P>
<P>
Rents for housing nationwide have gradually been enhanced from
0.3 yuan per sq m to 0.6 and 1.2 yuan per sq m, accounting for
about 5 percent of a household's monthly income.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate housing reforms, particularly the selling of
public-owned housing property, the State government ruled that all
the housing property owners can keep the turnover of housing sales
for themselves instead of handing it over to state revenues.
</P>
<P>
Yao Yunde, deputy-director of the State Council's Housing
Reform Office, said the "comfortable housing project" launched
nationwide targets at heralding the housing reforms.
</P>
<P>
And the houses built under the "project" will be sold to low
and medium-income earners at cost prices in light of lines of
demarcation between residents' incomes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the method of drawing lines between residents'
incomes will also be introduced to the selling and leasing of the
public-owned houses.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Score Rapid Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region has
drawn up an ambitious plan that will bring it more wealth and
success in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the plan is to score a ten percent increase in the
region's gross domestic product (GDP) each year until the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
It means the per-capita GDP (the value of goods and services
produced) in Tibet in the year 2000 will be four times the 1980
figure, in accordance with the Ninth Five-Year Plan for Tibet's
economic and social development that has been adopted by the
Regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's GDP in 2010 is projected to double the 2000 figure with
the per-capital GDP approaching the nation's average in 2010,
according to Tibet's long-range objective for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has drawn up an action programme to help the region
attain its goals:
</P>
<P>
- Tibet will strengthen its farming sector as the foundation of
its economy by increasing investment, advancing scientific and
technological progress and increasing the incomes of farmers and
herdsmen.
</P>

<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Five young farmers from Yongji
County in northeast China's Jilin province entered the local county
government building recently as public servants.
</P>
<P>
They were selected from the 605 participants who attended an
examination for selecting public servants across the province at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Twentysix-year-old farmer Wang Limin, formerly a teacher, was
selected to work at Yongji County's People's Procuratorate with
the top examination mark.

<P>
AMMAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Britain signed an
agreement here Sunday under which London will grant Jordan 285,000
pounds (427,500 U.S. dollars) in technical aid to help the kingdom
improve its water resources.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which was signed by Jordanian Minister of Planning
Rima Khalaf and British Ambassador to Jordan Peter Hinchcliffe,
falls within the framework of the Ground Water Assessment Project
which will take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to introduce new techniques to Jordan,
which will help provide accurate information on the environmental
conditions affecting the Aquifer basin.
</P>
<P>
The aid is being offered as part of the British government's
financial support for this project under the Overseas Development
Administration's Technical Cooperation program, said the
English-language daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The British ambassador was quoted by Jordan News Agency,
Petra, as saying after the signing of the deal that the project is
part of a 4-million-pound (about 6 million dollars) grant pledged
by Britain to Jordan over four years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, Britain will provide 1-million-pound
(about 1.5 million dollars) to finance a project undertaken by
the Jordanian Ministry of Social Development to boost the
performance and efficiency of its employees.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Zhejiang Province Tackles Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province has
given top priority to tackling the problem of the growing water
shortage.
</P>
<P>
This might come as quite a surprise since the coastal province
to the south of the Yangtze River delta has always been known for
the numerous water courses, and long enjoyed the fame of being the
area with the richest water resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, lack of a proper environmental protection strategy, in
addition to a surging population as well as fast economic
development, has made water shortage an ever-worsening problem in
this one of China's most developed provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the local water conservancy department, half of
the province's 70 cities and counties are plagued by severe water
shortages, and one fourth of its water plants have moved or are
moving to other sites because of contaminated water sources.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage has become a major cause of losses in both
industrial and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
To fight water pollution the province has issued over 600 laws
and regulations on the use of water, and implements the systems of
license for industrial water use and examination of construction
projects concerning rivers. Violations are severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has also focused on the establishment of a special
body to manage water resources and one to impose water use
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Several major water-conservancy projects are being undertaken
in Wenzhou, Ningbo and Jinhua cities to develop new sources of
water and improve water supply for both economic production and
people's living.
</P>
<P>
To curb waste of water and pollution, some 100 water-saving and
sewage-treatment techniques have been introduced to every part of
the province. In the meantime, water-saving and pollution-free
businesses enjoy preference in the local economic development
strategy, while those that cannot solve their pollution problems
will have to close down.
</P>
<P>
Price adjustment has also been adopted to help save water. For
example, by raising the cost of extracted groundwater, people are
encouraged to use river and lake water for daily use and
industrial and agricultural production, and groundwater is
exclusively used as drinking water.

<HEADLINE> "Dump Rao" Campaign Starts India's in Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of senior Congress
leaders is reported to have planned to requisition a meeting of
All-India Congress Committee (AICC) if P.V. Narasimha Rao does not
agree to give up the presidentship of the party.
</P>
<P>
The group has also wanted those who had left the party to
return to the fold once Rao is out of the way. They decided not to
press the demand for Rao to quit until after the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) government has been defeated and a new government
installed, informed sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The group, which met here over dinner at AICC General Secretary
Ahmed Patel's residence last Saturday, spoke of asking Rao to quit
at another meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the
party's highest policy making body, after the change of government
has taken place.
</P>
<P>
Rao's loyalists are reported to have sought to contain the
situation by keeping in touch with MPs in the past couple of days.
Their strategy is to build on Rao's strength in the Congress
Parliamentary Party (CPP), since even rebel leaders acknowledge
that he has the unstinted support of at least half the 136 new Lok
Sabha (lower house) Congress members.

<HEADLINE> Troops to Be Deployed at Trouble Polling Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
identified about 9,000 trouble spots where violence may erupt
during the June 12 elections and the army troops are likely to be
deployed there for peaceful polling, according to a competent
source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that according to intelligence reports, about
16,000 polling centers had been spotted where trouble may take
place during the voting, and about 9,000 of these centers are
vulnerable to serious violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that police and other paramilitary forces would be
quite inadequate to maintain law and order in all the 25,950
polling centers of the country. "Army has to be deployed at least
at vulnerable points," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the caretaker government was formed on March 30, the
major political parties, including the former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party and its biggest rival Awami League, have been
demanding recovery of illegal arms to ensure a peaceful polling.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 2,885 pieces of illegal firearms have been
recovered and 34,270 people, suspected users of unauthorized
weapons, have been arrested till Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Indian House to Take Up Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The countdown to the voting out
of the A.B. Vajpayee government will begin here today when the Lok
Sabha (lower house) takes up the government-sponsored vote of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the single largest party in
the 11th Lok Sabha, was asked by the Indian president to form the
next government on May 15 and show its majority in the parliament
by May 31.
</P>
<P>
The battle lines between the government and the non-BJP
opposition have been sharply drawn with the Congress Party and the
United Front, which have a combined strength of 313 seats in the
house, remaining firm in toppling the Vajpayee government. The BJP
and its allies, so far, have managed to officially get the support
of only 193 MPs.
</P>
<P>
Even as the prime minister on Sunday made an appeal to all
political parties to give up their negative approach towards his
government, BJP President L.K. Advani admitted that his party was
not confident and was prepared for failure in the confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
While the BJP would prefer the voting to take place on Tuesday
after a proper debate, the United Front made it clear that it
would like the BJP government to go on Monday. With former prime
minister Chandrasekhar and two of his close confidants remaining
firm in their decision not to support the BJP government, the
pro-government vote is expected to come down to less than 193.
</P>
<P>
The BJP government, however, wants to utilize the debate to
launch its election campaign for an inevitable mid-term poll,
politicians here said.

disposal systems are in some cases not working properly after

The ministry believes that strict regulations are also needed
on bonded warehouses to prevent manufacturers from misusing the
zones to produce cheap items for illegal sales on the domestic
market, damaging the interests of companies outside the zones.

YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- First Secretary of Myanmar State Law
and Order Restoration Council Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt Sunday charged
the Western powers with interfering in Myanmar's internal affairs,
the official New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
His remarks coincided with a meeting of the National League for
Democracy (NLD) that started here Sunday at the residence of NLD
chief Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, attended by diplomats of the United
States, Britain, Japan and France, is reportedly aimed at laying
down future action plans for the NLD.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt noted that some people in Myanmar are being swayed
by "a big nation" that is attempting to bring the country under
its influence on the pretext of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Despite attempts of the West bloc to bring Myanmar under its
control because of her strategic location in Southeast Asia,
Myanmar adheres to the five principles of peaceful co-existence,
maintaining friendly relations and cooperation with other nations
including neighbors and ASEAN members," he said at a donation
ceremony of the Yangon University.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Encourages Private Investment in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government encourages
the participation of the private sector in the development of the
country's telecommunication system, Minister for State Sarad Singh
Bhandari said at an industry seminar Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a result of the government's liberalization
policy, new communication services like wireless, mobile phone and
radio paging would be soon initiated in Nepal by the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Under a national communication policy adopted in 1992, modern
technologies are to be used and conducive environment is to be
created for private investment to expand the nationwide telecom
network.
</P>
<P>
The government has pledged to provide basic telephone access to
every village of the country by 2000, Bhandari said.
</P>
<P>
Telephone service now reaches 71 of Nepal's 75 districts and
every 100 people in the country have only 0.5 telephone on
average, one of the lowest rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Nepal Telecom Corporation (NTC) said the
company was confident of achieving the government's goal to
provide at least one telephone for every 100 people by next year.
</P>
<P>
Bhandari noted that the state-run NTC lacks technological
expertise while telecom operators lack managerial skills.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors also seem to be interested in the almost
untapped telecom market in Nepal. A group of Japanese investors
recently decided to invest 18 million US dollars in Nepal's
telecom sector within the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Children's March Planned to Highlight Their Plight in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 organizations
are joining the Children's Defense Fund in sponsoring the Stand
for Children rally on May 25 at the Lincoln Memorial here.
</P>
<P>
"We want this day to be for children what the 1963 march did
for civil rights and what Earth Day did for the environment,
because it is time," Marian Wright Edelman, president and founder
of the fund, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics gathered by the fund, every 32 seconds
a child is born into poverty in the States; every 15 minutes a
baby dies and gunfire claims a youngster's life every two hours.
</P>
<P>
The rally will feature a day of activities for children and
families, including music and dance, reading circles, sing-alongs
and exhibits.
</P>
<P>
A highlight will be a children's march to the memorial,
orchestrated to encourage a deeper public commitment to protecting
the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, school organizations, churches, synagogues,
scouting groups and other community groups are reportedly being
urged to get their members out.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed Stand for Children
and earlier this month the mayors from more than five dozen cities
said they had issued or plan to issue proclamations declaring
Saturday as Stand for Children Day.
</P>
<P>
The defense fund's 1996 yearbook paints a sad portrait of life
as a child in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the yearbook, every day in the United States:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Men's Clothing Consumption Higher Than Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese men have become dedicated
followers of fashion, a "what You wear" survey in seven major
cities has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Women are no longer the biggest buyers of clothes in China
where fashion-conscious men have dramatically surpassed females
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
A survey report covering seven cities, including Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Dalian, shows that the Chinese man spends
an average of 2,064 yuan (about 250 US dollars) on clothes
annually, 35 per cent more than the 1,526 yuan that woman spends.
</P>
<P>
The difference in prices for individual items of mens and
womens clothing is one of the major reasons behind the gap,
according to China Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese marketplaces the price for a man's coat is 858 yuan
on average, three percentage points higher than a female design.
And there is also a gap of 27 yuan between men's casual wear and
women's.
</P>
<P>
Among the garments sold in China, the share of men's formal
attire accounts for 14.3 per cent, one percentage higher than the
women's.
</P>
<P>
This means the Chinese men, long proud of their casual style in
dressing, now pay more attention to their appearance.
</P>
<P>
The national survey was launched by China People's University.

<HEADLINE> Albanian General Election Underway, Opposition Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Albanians went to the polls Sunday
to choose a new parliament, but the election turned into chaos
after most opposition parties withdrew their candidates midway
through the voting.
</P>
<P>
About 2.2 million voters were selecting 140 parliament members
from 1,180 candidates belonging to 24 parties and nine
independents.
</P>
<P>
Nine opposition parties, including the main opposition
Socialist Party, the center-left Social Democratic Party and the
center-right Democratic Alliance, announced midway through the
voting that they were withdrawing their candidates and election
officials after accusing the ruling Democratic Party of
manipulation and harassment.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Central Electoral Committee, the leftist
Socialist, Agrarian and National Unity Parties said they would not
recognize the results of the election and demanded that the
Committee and the Constitutional Court annul Sunday's voting and
hold a new poll under democratic conditions.
</P>
<P>
They complained that the representatives of the opposition
parties could not monitor the voting owing to intimidation by the
police and the ruling conservative Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The authorities did not allow them to deploy observers at
polling stations and obstructed their entry into electoral
committees at various levels, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also alleged that police beat opposition representatives
in the electoral committees.
</P>
<P>
President Sali Berisha told a TV station the opposition move
was not surprising because they were facing a heavy defeat.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election was the third after the major political
changes in the country in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Present Report to UN on Child Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nepalese government will
present another report to the UN office in Geneva this week on the
country's latest child rights developments after its first report
two years ago, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
A National Planning Commission official said Sunday the new
report would include information on facts and activities of child
rights protection and child development in Nepal in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
The report will also comprise additional issues related to
child rights that need to be addressed in the changed context, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Nepal ratified the UN Convention on
Child Rights in 1990 but no concrete steps on safeguarding child
rights had been taken due to frequent political changes in the
country during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, child welfare centers have been set up in cities and
the problem of street children has drawn the government's concern,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
A Nepali delegation is scheduled to leave today for Geneva to
submit the new report to the UN Commission on Child Rights.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Miners Benefit from Aid-the-Poor Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Two years ago, 39-year-old He
Heping borrowed 5,000 yuan (about 610 US dollars) from an
aid-the-poor foundation of the Anyuan Coal Mine, East China's
Jiangxi Province, and started a family breeding farm.
</P>
<P>
Today his farm has total assets valued at 70,000 yuan, which is
a striking contrast to his previous life struggling on a monthly
pay of 360 yuan.
</P>
<P>
China has established many aid-the-poor foundations in coal
mining areas to help its 300,000 poor coal miners make a better
life through financial support.
</P>
<P>
A poverty-relief meeting recently held in the Pingxiang Coal
Mine Administrative Bureau in Jiangxi Province disclosed that with
hard efforts made over the past few years, the losses in 93 key
national coal mines have dropped dramatically with each passing
year.
</P>
<P>
The total wages in these mines, the meeting heard, soared to
21.02 billion yuan in 1995, as against 13.62 billion yuan in 1992,
and the average annual income of the coal miners shot up to 6,443
yuan in 1995 from 3,864 yuan in 1992.
</P>
<P>
China has 300,000 coal miners and 240,000 coal-mining
households living below the poverty line, which is a hard nut to
crack compared with other sectors.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Coal Industry vowed to end
poverty for coal miners in the next five years through every
possible means.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Cockpit Voice Recorder on Crashed Plane Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Investigators today found the
cockpit voice recorder of ValuJet Flight 592, which crashed on May
11 into the Florida Everglades, killing all 110 people aboard,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A crew found the equipment in the murky waters of the
Everglades, the U.S. National Transportation and Safety Board
(NTSB) officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The voice recorder could provide important clues as to why the
DC-9 crashed.
</P>
<P>
The recorder would be shipped on a 5:30 p.m. flight to the
headquarters of the NTSB in Washington for analysis, NTSB
spokesman Mike Benson said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, NTSB officials said that investigators have
found evidence of actual fire on board the ValuJet DC-9.
</P>
<P>
"There was evidence of fire, soot and smoke damage to the
outside of electrical bundles, including the central one where the
steering cables are located, but there's no evidence there was any
sort of burn-through of the aircraft's control system," said Greg
Feith, lead investigator of the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
According to local TV reports, searchers have recovered 35 to
40 percent of the aircraft wreckage, including all the tires
stored in the DC-9's cargo hold. But they have found only two
oxygen generator canisters.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of suspicion that the 119 oxygen generators
in the cargo hold might be the source of a fire or explosion that
led to the crash. The canisters were labeled "empty,, but
questions remained whether they were still fully charged and may
have exploded in the hold, sparking a fire in the aircraft's
belly.
</P>
<P>
Feith was quoted by local media reports as saying that there
was increasing evidence of fire aboard the plane, including the
discovery of burnt cargo liner material and a seat bracket to
which molten aluminum had been fused. But investigators were
unable yet to identify where in cabin the bracket might have
originated.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Aleka Papariga was today unanimously
reelected to the post of general secretary of the Communist Party
of Greece (KKE).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, towards the end of the party's 15th congress,
delegates elected the KKE's new Central Committee, comprised of 75
members, and the party's Central Auditing Committee with seven
members.
</P>
<P>
The congress approved the party's charter, its program and its
political decisions with an overwhelming majority Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the KKE's cooperation with other parties were also
discussed at the congress which started last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the congress, Papariga categorically excluded any
possibility of such cooperation, adding however "we cannot be
categorical as well for future political forces," which might
appear on the country's political scene.
</P>
<P>
According to the position developed by Papariga in her speech,
the KKE's stance is that if alliances with other parties exist in
the future, they will occur on specific issues and on condition
that the views held will coincide with those of the KKE.
</P>
<P>
Papariga said that even in the case of cooperation, the KKE
will not negotiate the party's autonomy.
