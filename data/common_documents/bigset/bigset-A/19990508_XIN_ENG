<HEADLINE> Clinton Says No Change to Policy on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Friday that Western allies should not change their formula for a
settlement and must neither add nor subtract from the basic
conditions raised by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn at the White House,
Clinton suggested that the peacekeeping plan adopted in Bosnia
might be a model for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"What we did in Bosnia was functional," Clinton said. In
Bosnia, the command was divided three ways, with the United States
and Russia in charge of one geographic area, Britain in another
and France in a third.
</P>
<P>
"There may be some other way to do it in Kosovo," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said any peace deal must follow the conditions set by
NATO for the withdrawal of Serb forces, the return of refugees,
political autonomy for ethnic Albanians and the deployment of an
international security force led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important for the United States and our allies
neither to add nor subtract from the basic conditions that we have
said all along are essential to make this work," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the State Department announced that U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott would go to Moscow next week to
begin negotiations with Russia on the details of a framework to
settle the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Talbott would hold
talks on Tuesday and Wednesday in Moscow "to get down to the
serious business of fleshing out the principles" of the agreement
on Kosovo reached Thursday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is due to meet
here Friday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the
newly energized diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Appeals for Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa said
Friday that Tanzania's debt should be relieved or even cancelled
so that social services could be improved.
</P>
<P>
During discussions here with the visiting Japanese State
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Keizo Takemi, Mkapa said that debt
relief for Tanzania will contribute to the improvement of social
services in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate your efforts and let me assure you that we are
very much committed to improving and rebuilding our health,
education, water supply system and economic infrastructure," a
press release from the State House quoted Mkapa as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But this will only be possible after the debt cancellation,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed gratitude to Japan's participation in the
international debt relief grant program for Tanzania and other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Takemi, who paid a courtesy call on Mkapa, said Japan is still
hopeful that the program is realized so that Tanzania and other
highly indebted countries can rebuild their social and economic
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's social services, especially in education and health
sectors, have deteriorated with the growth of external debt year
by year. By March this year, this east African country's external
debt rose to 8.295 billion U.S. dollars, up 4.7 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister expressed his appreciation on
Mkapa's efforts dedicated to the restoration of peace in the Great
Lakes region, especially in the war-torn Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), adding that Japan is ready to cooperate and help in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa stressed that negotiation is the only solution to peace
in the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said he strongly appreciated Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba's efforts in solving the problem, the Libya agreement
reached last month and Tanzanian former President Julius Nyerere's
initiative in negotiating Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the East African Cooperation (EAC), consisting
of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, Mkapa said, "We three are very
committed to renewing the cooperation and we want this new
cooperation to be very strong."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Endorses Plan for East Timor Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Friday endorsed the agreements signed between Indonesia
and Portugal on a popular consultation through direct ballot on
East Timor's future.
</P>
<P>
The council adopted a resolution welcoming U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's intention to establish a U.N.
presence in East Timor to assist in the implementation of the
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested that Annan keep the council informed
of the situation in East Timor and provide a report by May 24 with
details of the polling process and recommendations on the mandate,
size and structure of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
The accords signed on Wednesday include East Timor's autonomy
package and security arrangements and procedures for a
U.N-organized vote on August 8.
</P>
<P>
If the popular consultation results in the approval of the
autonomy by a majority of the East Timorese, Indonesia would
initiate the constitutional measures for the implementation of the
autonomy framework, according to the pacts.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, on its part, would initiate the procedures for the
removal of East Timor from the list of Non-Self-Governing
Territories, now numbering 17 in the world, and the detention of
the question of East Timor from the U.N. agenda.
</P>
<P>
If the majority rejects the proposed autonomy, Indonesia would
take the constitutional steps to terminate its links with East
Timor and restore the status the territory held prior to 1976.
</P>
<P>
Then Indonesia and Portugal would make arrangements for a
peaceful and orderly transfer of authority in East Timor to the
U.N. which would initiate a process enabling it to begin a
transition towards independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of 800,000 and an area of more
than 18,800 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until
1975 when a civil rift induced Indonesian occupation. In 1976
Indonesia annexed it and the U.N. has since been seeking a
solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
In the process of negotiations to determine the territory's
future, Indonesia came up with an autonomy proposal in January
1999 and said if the majority of East Timorese rejects the plan,
it would offer independence to them. (nc)

<HEADLINE> COMESA Continues Its Advance Cargo Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has decided to continue implementing the
Advance Cargo Information System (ACIS) project in some member
states.
</P>
<P>
In a draft report of the second meeting of the Consultative
Forum for ACIS Beneficiary Countries, which was ended in Lusaka
Friday, COMESA called upon all stake-holders to play their various
roles, in ensuring successful installation and utilization of the
ACIS system.
</P>
<P>
The system should be fully implemented because it would provide
service providers and users with on-line information to enable
them to conduct their businesses in a more efficient and cost
effective manner, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It stated that ACIS was one of the trade facilitation
instruments, which would enable COMESA to reach its goal of
achieving a free trade area by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the sub-regional support activities, the report
said, COMESA computer experts would continue providing technical
support to all six project countries, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
On the training policy, the report noted that the main
elements of the policy were to provide criteria for selecting
trainees, preparation of training materials, use of existing
institutions for delivery of training, retention of trained
personnel and the sustainability of the training activities.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that training was indeed crucial in order to
ensure that all parties using the ACIS system understand it and
utilize it optimally.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the financing of the training function, it noted
that COMESA would meet the cost of training the initial group of
trainers and provide some nucleus equipment in terms of computers.
</P>
<P>
Two training sessions for rail tracker technical supervisors
and trainers had so far been conducted and about 147 railway
managers had been trained in all the five railways in the project
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
But training in port tracker has not yet been done, due to the
incompleteness of software development and installation, it added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the beneficiaries should be involved
in the preparation of the work program. In this regard, it was
agreed that the technical committee should meet to ensure that the
proposed work program was in line with their requirements and
priorities.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was attended by representatives from all six
project countries and representatives of the European Commission
and the ACIS User Group.
</P>
<P>
The First meeting of the Consultative Forum was held in
Mombasa, Kenya in August, 1998.

<HEADLINE> WHO Study Finds Regional Differences Among Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Men living in North Karelia of
Finland, Glasgow of the United Kingdom, Kuopio of Finland and
Belfast of the United Kingdom have the highest average rates of
heart disease, according to a study by the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Women living in Glasgow, Belfast, Newcastle of Australia and
Warsaw of Poland have the highest average rates of heart disease,
said the WHO in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings from a WHO-sponsored project
called "MONICA" (from MONItoring CArdiovascular disease), which
studied 170,000 heart attacks in 37 countries from the mid-1980s
to the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the lowest average heart attack rates
in men occurred in Beijing of China, Catalonia of Spain,
Vaud-Fribourg of Switzerland and Toulouse of France. Rates of
heart disease in North Karelia were 10 times higher than those in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As for women, according to the study, the lowest average heart
attack rates occurred in Catalonia, Beijing, Toulouse, and Brianza
of Italy. Women's heart attack rates in Glasgow were eight times
higher than those in Catalonia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ten-year study noted, the greatest fall in
coronary event rates in men occurred in three north European
regions: North Karelia (which had the highest levels at the start
of the study), Kuopio, and northern Sweden. The increase in
coronary event rates in men occurred mainly in central and eastern
Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Among women, the populations experiencing significant increases
were predominantly in central and eastern Europe and Asia,but the
general pattern of increases and decreases appeared to be less
consistent.

<HEADLINE> Angola, Zambia Urged to Overcome Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Secretary- General Salim Ahmed Salim Friday urged Angola and
Zambia to make joint efforts to overcome the current crisis
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Salim said after concluding a two-day visit in Angola that the
key to overcome the crisis is to eliminate mutual "distrust and
misunderstanding".
</P>
<P>
The OAU is willing to mediate in the crisis so that presidents
of Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Frederick Chiluba of Zambia
would have a direct meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Salim also admitted that consultations and dialogs are needed
before the two heads of state meet.
</P>
<P>
The OAU leader had met with Chiluba in Zambian capital Lusaka
before his visit in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government has been repeatedly accusing Zambia of
providing arms to its opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), which was firmly denied by the
Zambian side, leading to tension in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, South African President Nelson Mandela
suggested the two presidents hold face-to-face talks, but was
dismissed by the Angolan president.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in central and southern Africa, Salim said the
OAU will, through various initiatives, be engaged actively in
resolving the conflicts in Angola and the Democratic Republic of
Congo so as to restore peace and stability in the region as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Salim also admitted that some African countries are still
supporting UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in his war operation,
defying U.N. resolutions on the sanctioning of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
"As OAU Secretary-General, I want to remind all members of
implementing the resolutions made by yourselves and safeguarding
the honor of our continent," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) has pledged to play a bigger part
in the post-conflict reconstruction of Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the annual report adopted at the end of its 54th session
here Thursday, the UN/ECE said that activities should be properly
coordinated between all the organizations and institutions
involved in the reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day meeting, it was recognized that the UN/ECE
had expertise in a number of areas of relevance to the
reconstruction in Southeast Europe and that such expertise should
be drawn upon wherever possible to assist in the coordinated
reconstruction of the region.
</P>
<P>
As there appeared to be political progress as indicated by the
news that Russia and NATO had agreed on a Kosovo peace plan, the
UN/ECE said that it had to mobilize itself in order to make a
useful contribution at the technical level to the recovery of the
region as a whole and to help those who had suffered the most.

BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's jobless rate in April dropped
to 10.7 percent from 11.1 percent the month before, the Federal
Labor Office reported Friday in Nuremberg.
</P>
<P>
Totally there were 4,145,300 people out of work in April, down
by 143,200 from March and 275,400 from the same month of year
1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The figure showed eastern German unemployment rate of 17.8
percent was nearly twice the level as that in West, 9.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, president of the office, said the jobless
decline in April was much more due to the seasonal factors and the
government than the economy.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's program to reduce youth unemployment was making
progress, he said, quoting that over 100,000 youths had taken part
in job training courses.
</P>
<P>
A hopeful sign for the job market was the strong rise in new
job offerings, which were 397,100 in this April and 55,300 more
than in April, 1998, Jagoda said.

<HEADLINE> Wars Affect Investments In Africa: British Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- United Kingdom's statutory body, the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), said the resurgence of
hostilities and the devaluation of the currencies in various
African states last year impacted significantly on its
investments.
</P>
<P>
In its report for 1998 released here Friday, the British
company said the year under review was very difficult for many
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities cited included the war in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the resurgence of
civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The major currency devaluations particularly hit southern
African countries of Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We have significant investments in these countries and, as a
result, our equity valuations and returns have been adversely
affected," the company said.
</P>
<P>
The CDC has 170 investments and loans totalling 443 million
British pounds in 20 African countries.

Despite these difficulties, it said it would focus this year on
 equity opportunities in the key sectors of agro-business,
telecommunications, power, mining, property and the financial
sector.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada Friday called for the transfer of science and technology to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at a meeting organized by the Rotary
International here in the Ethiopian capital, Negasso noted that
the 20th century has made much advances in science and technology
which has changed the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the fruit derived from science and technology
has not equally or evenly benefited the whole of mankind.
</P>
<P>
After citing the differences between rich and poor in the
world, Negasso said, "we should all rise and affirm in one voice
that this discrepancy among mankind cannot be accepted in the new
millennium."
</P>
<P>
"We in the developing nations have all the resources we need,"
he said, adding that "what we lack is the know-how to develop them
for our own use."
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the most important agenda for us in the developing world
must be the acquisition of knowledge," he said, insisting that the
river of knowledge must flow freely without hindrance or
precondition.
</P>
<P>
Rotarians from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are
attending the three-day meeting.

<P>
The Council underlined the necessity for the parties to
achieve an early and comprehensive political settlement, which
includes a settlement on the political status of Abkhazia
within the state of Georgia, which fully respects the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its
internationally recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
The Council reaffirmed the unacceptability of the
demographic changes resulting from the conflict and the
imprescriptible right of all refugees and displaced persons
affected by the conflict to return to their homes in secure
conditions and called on the parties to address this issue urgently by
agreeing on and implementing effective measures.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its deep concern at the failure of the
parties to reach an agreement on the terms for the return of
refugees and displaced persons to the Gali region and measures
for economic rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The Council demanded that the parties exercise great restraint
in their response to any incidents arising on the ground and to
take concrete steps to improve their cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council welcomed the continued contribution
that the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) and the
Collective Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of
Independent States had made to stabilizing the situation in the
zone of conflict.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed the importance it attached to the Security of
UNOMIG and of all international personnel and recalled the
obligation of both sides in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Apes, Wild Pigs Die Mysteriously in S. Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 apes and an
unspecified number of wild pigs have been found dead in mysterious
circumstances at the uninhabited rugged terrain of Golelcha
Woreda, in Bale Zone of Southern Oromiya State, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ashebir Zewdie, a local zonal official in
charge of agriculture, as saying that the apes met their deaths at
the thickly wooden massif stretching between Buria and Bulala
areas in an enigmatic pestilential animal disease.
</P>
<P>
Ashebir said the wild pigs died after preying on the carcasses
of the infected apes and the number of dead pigs could not be
established due to the inaccessible terrain.
</P>
<P>
He said the apes before their death showed such symptoms as
dysentery, insatiable thirst for water, blood vomiting, hair
withering and loss of weight.
</P>
<P>
He said the zonal agricultural department has notified the
problem to the state agricultural bureau and indicated the urgent
need to solve the problem, as the area is a major tourist site.
</P>
<P>
The Golelcha Woreda is home to over 19 herds of apes each
having 500- 1000 family members, according to the report.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the two strong
earthquakes in southern Iran has reached 20 and the number of the
injured reached 80 by Friday noon, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The quakes measuring at 6.8 and 5.9 degrees at the open-ended
Richter scale rocked villages 50 kilometers south of Shiraz, the
Far province Friday morning at 3:30, 3:41 am local time (2300 and

</P>
<P>
Head of the natural disaster headquarters in Far province

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Expand Cocoa Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIBOBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's cocoa output is expected to
increase from the last six years' average of 335,000 tons to about
500,000 tons by the year 2004/2005.
</P>
<P>
The output is expected to hit 700,000 tons around the year 2010
and be sustained at that level, according to a government document
on cocoa sector development strategy, obtained Friday by the Ghana
News Agency in Accra, the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
The government's "Cocoa Sector Development Strategy" includes
production, research, extension, infrastructure and financing.
The document also addresses financing, internal and external
marketing, processing, pricing and taxation.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the projected increases in production, farmers will
be assisted to rehabilitate and replant old, abandoned or
destroyed farms in the traditional cocoa growing areas with high
yielding hybrid varieties.
</P>
<P>
These will be planted through projects supported by government
and donors with active farmer participation in design and
implementation. Besides, incentives will be provided through
higher producer prices to ensure adequate farm maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The document says that the government will institute a Cocoa
Credit Revolving Fund with stakeholders -- farmers, Ghana Cocoa
Board, government, banks and local buying companies -- as
subscribers.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Defense Minister Says UNITA Forces Very </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Kundi
Paihama revealed here Friday that the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has a strong military force
of at least 60,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Its final goal is to take over power through force, he said
when briefing the National Assembly on the current military
situation in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"The (Jonas) Savimbi group has formed an army of about 60,000
troops, excluding a large number of mercenaries," said Paihama.
</P>
<P>
The latest number disclosed by the Angolan government has far
surpassed its estimate issued at the early stage of the renewed
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the headquarters of the general staff of
Angolan armed forces estimated in its battlefield report that
UNITA had a total of 41,000 forces, in which 21,000 are regular
army, while the rest are militiamen. The number matches that when
the Lusaka Protocol was signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The forces, said the minister, are equipped with fairly
advanced weaponry such as T-62, T-64 tanks, BMP-2 armored
personnel vehicle, long- range rocket gun and ground-to-air
missiles, which were absent in UNITA's former warfares.
</P>
<P>
According to Paihama, the government army was mostly on the
defensive side in previous fightings, mainly out of insufficient
estimates on the strength of UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the army is ready to give "the armed bandits a
decisive answer," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noticed that the Angolan government is
recruiting new hands all over the country and purchasing from
abroad advanced fighters, armored vehicles and anti-tank missiles
to replace its outdated Russian made weaponry.
</P>
<P>
With the dry season approaching, a decisive war of
unprecedented scale will take place on the land of Angola, they
said.

ATHENS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek equity prices hit new records
Friday with the general index on the Athens Stock Exchange
breaking the 4,000 barrier for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The general index ended 1.88 percent higher to 4,037.02 points,
its 25th record this year. It now stands 47.47 percent up from the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE/ASE 20 index also increased 2.19 percent to 2,494.54
points.
</P>
<P>
The Athens Stock Exchange enjoyed a heavy trading with turnover
being 233.356 billion drachmas (about 778 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Advancers led decliners by 167 to 117 with another 12 issues
unchanged. Leasing led the rising stock market by jumping 5.63
percent, with investment and banks increasing 4.12 percent and
2.01 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed Friday's rise in the stock market to the
positive developments in the Yugoslav war after a G8's agreement
on a peace strategy in the region.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Party Demands NATO Air Strike Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The leadership of Germany's Greens
Party said Friday the party would at next week's special congress
pass a resolution that urges the NATO to halt for 48 hours its air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Greens Party is the junior partner in Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's coalition cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that a working majority for a bill will be
achieved at the federal delegates congress," said Reinhard
Buetikofer, the party's federal manager.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire that the party demands will be linked with the
withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, and the NATO should
extend the ceasefire if the withdrawal actually begins, Buetikofer
said.
</P>
<P>
By now the party executive has received from its regional
divisions 54 more radical bills, including demands for an
immediate and permanent halt to NATO strikes and accusations that
NATO has launched an aggressive war.
</P>
<P>
The demands are clearly deferent from the position of a key
Greens member, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who sticks to the cabinet's line of participating in
NATO air war, has said he would quit the Greens if the party did
not support NATO.
</P>
<P>
There inside the party are also demands for Fischer's
resignation, Buetikofer said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Greens, traditionally a pacifist party, might
bring down Schroeder's cabinet if the party emerged so divided on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
And Schroeder has said he would look for another partner to
replace the Greens if the party could not back the government.

WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The NBA, with that low-scoring,
bad-shooting, lockout-shortened regular season safely behind it,
finally is ready for its big dance.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Lakers say they are bringing a new attitude to
the party, the San Antonio Spurs are riding high as the best team
going in and the razzle-dazzle Sacramento Kings will try to keep
their miracle working.
</P>
<P>
Those are only a few of the stories going into the anybody-can-

four more Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, the highest-scoring team in the league and the only
NBA team to average more than 100 points a game this season,
features rookie point guard Jason Williams.
</P>
<P>
The Kings get the Utah Jazz, runners-up to the champion Chicago
Bulls the last two seasons, in an intriguing first-round matchup
Saturday: All three regular-season games between the two went into
overtime with the Jazz winning two of them.
</P>
<P>

frontcourt of three of the 50 greatest players of all-time --
Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen -- and their
all-rookie backcourt.

on the final day of the regular season, will lead Philadelphia
against the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
No quarter is expected to be given in the New York-Miami series
as those teams that simply don't lkie each other square off in
their best-of-five series Saturday at Miami.
</P>
<P>
San Antonio and Utah shared the best regular-season record at
37-13, but the Spurs are the top seed after winning the season
series with the Jazz two games to one.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs go into the playoffs loaded with confidence. "They
should have confidence," Utah coach Jerry Sloan says. "They are
big, long and quick, and that's a bad combination to have to play
against."
</P>
<P>
The Spurs, who closed the season winning their last five games
and 31 of their final 36, have never advanced past the conference
finals. The upstart Sacramento Kings won 10 of their last 11 games
and the Los Angeles Lakers, winners of their last four, might be
the other hottest teams into the post season
</P>
<P>
Though the Chicago Bulls are nowhere to be found, Miami,
Indiana Orlando and Atlanta in the East feel they are ready to go
all the way.
</P>
<P>
The first-round series all are best-of-five, and all subsequent
rounds are best-of-seven.
</P>
<P>
Expect Utah and San Antonio to meet in the Western Conference
final, and Miami and Indiana to go at it in the East. The Spurs
will upend the Pacers and win it all in both teams' first trip to
the NBA Finals.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Bus Drivers Urged to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan bus drivers, especially
those going upcountry, have been urged to fight terrorism and
observe traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
Grace Turyagumanawe, assistant commissioner of police in charge
of traffic and road safety, made the appeal at a function in
Kibuli police training school here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua in a telephone interview that the course
attended by bus drivers is a sensitization effort to educate
drivers of buses going upcountry.
</P>
<P>
"We ask them to observe traffic sign boards and time tables
especially during night to reduce traffic accidents and bus
robberies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The police officers at the function which were attended by more
than 50 bus drivers gave bus drivers some tips on how to deal with
terrorists on their way to upcountry destinations.
</P>
<P>
Buses are often the targets of the terrorists who want to rob
and send waves of panic among passengers. Last year, several
buses were attacked by rebels fighting the government. Some
passengers were robbed of valuables while others abducted.

<HEADLINE> New Politics Ushered in by Devolution in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A new political era has emerged as
parts of Britain look set to be governed by the politics of
coalition for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The final results published on Friday afternoon showed that
Labor had 56 of the 129 seats in the Scottish parliament. The
Scottish National Party (SNP) took 35, the Conservatives 18, the
Liberal Democrats 17 and other small parties 3.
</P>
<P>
Although Labor is the biggest party in both Scotland and Wales,
it failed to win an overall majority in either assemblies and need
to form a coalition with other parties.
</P>
<P>
Nationalist parties, at the same time, will form the official
opposition in both devolved assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Coalition negotiations between Labor and the Lib Dems in both
Scotland and Wales are expected to begin shortly.
</P>
<P>
Coalition negotiations between Labor and the Liberal Democrats
in both regions are expected to begin shortly. But Scottish
Secretary Donald Dewar -- poised to become leader of the new
parliament - remained tight-lipped over details of any possible
pact.
</P>
<P>
But Scots Lib Dem leader Jim Wallace, who now enjoys the role
of powerbroker, said he expected to enter talks in the next few
days after consulting with his new MSP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"No party will have the right in this parliament to have it all
its own way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the new style of politics where parties are going to
have to co-operate."
</P>
<P>
SNP leader Alex Salmond, whose party favors an independence of
Scotland, said the nationalists would now be "a cracker of an
opposition" in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Oppositions of course tend to become governments at the next
election," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Captures Pro-Israeli Militiaman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Muslim Shiite group
Hezbollah Friday captured a member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) in south Lebanon, the official National News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The group captured the militiaman when he was driving at
a high speed on a road in Jezzine, a predominantly Christian
town just outside the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon which has long been policed by the SLA.
</P>
<P>
The SLA later admitted the capture through a statement
broadcast by its official radio Voice of the South.
</P>
<P>
This is the second SLA member in the past 10 days to be
captured around Jezzine by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, which is fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
its ally SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
In another development in the day, a SLA militiaman was
wounded during attacks in south Lebanon launched by Lebanon's
another Muslim military group Amal, which is led by House Speaker
Nabih Berri.

<HEADLINE> NATO Should Not Block a Political Solution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A British committee on Friday accused
NATO of blocking a negotiated solution to its war with Yugoslavia
by continuing its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, chaired by Alice Mahon,
a member in the House of Commons, said in a statement that the
main obstacle to a political settlement in Kosovo is NATO's
demand.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement between Russia and the Group of Seven
industrialized countries on principles for resolving the Kosovo
crisis, and the statement by (Yugoslav President) Slobodan
Milosevic that Yugoslavia would accept an international force in
Kosovo under the auspices of the UN, showed that a negotiated
solution to the conflict is achievable," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The main obstacle to a settlement is the British and U.S.
government's demand that NATO must form the core of any
international force in Kosovo, transforming the region into a NATO
colony, while continuing a bombing campaign which has killed
hundreds of innocent civilians." the committee pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with protecting refugees. NATO is
seeking to establish its right to overrule the UN and unilaterally
use overwhelming military force wherever U.S. strategic interests
dictate," the statement went on.
</P>
<P>
"If NATO were genuinely interested in solving the humanitarian
crisis in Kosovo and the rest of Yugoslavia, rather than simply
asserting its own might, it would immediately stop the bombing and
ask the UN to convene negotiations to achieve a peaceful
settlement, " the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged NATO to stop the war and seek a negotiated
solution through the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The committee for Peace in Balkans was founded early this
decade to promote peace and reconciliation in the Balkan
countries. It strongly condemned NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
A number of British Parliament Members are working in the
committee.

<HEADLINE> Africa Faces Challenges of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Friday that Africa is
facing the challenge of the large number of refugees and
internally displaced persons during its economic development.
</P>
<P>
In its information note to the on-going three-day joint
conference of African ministers of finance, economic planning and
development, the UNHCR said Africa still remains one of the
continents with the largest number of refugees and internally
displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
"Today, more than 20 countries on the continent are engaged in
conflicts,

or affected by them," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. agency, there are some 7.2 million
persons of concern to UNHCR and an estimated eight to ten million
internally displaced people in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR noted that the impact of large-scale forced
population movements on the development of both countries of
asylum and return is dramatic and costly.
</P>
<P>
If Africa intends to reach its target of reducing the poverty
level by half by 2015, then Africa and its partners will also need
to address the impact of conflict on development and the challenge
of sustaining the return and reintegration of refugees and other
displaced persons in post- conflict situations.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR believed that the on-going conference has provided a
unique opportunity to strengthen dialog and find solutions to the
impact of conflicts and population displacement on the economic
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR suggested the conference to consider three steps:
</P>
<P>
-- firstly, promoting and supporting the effective
participation of African states, as well as African regional and
sub-regional organizations, in the on-going deliberations on
countries emerging from conflict to ensure full ownership and
create a conducive environment for investment and development;
</P>
<P>
-- secondly, undertaking an in-depth study on the impact of
conflicts and population displacement on economic development in
Africa, and recommending specific strategies to address the
challenge of bridging the gap between humanitarian assistance and
development; and
</P>
<P>
-- thirdly, strengthening and making optimal use of existing
mechanisms at the bilateral and multi-lateral levels, such as the
World Bank consultative group meeting, United Nations Development
Program round table, and the European Union, as vehicles for
mobilizing the required support and resources.

PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of Guinea Bissau Friday burnt
down the French embassy in Bissau and forced the members of the
French mission to take shelter in the Portuguese embassy, said
reports from Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman of the French Foreign Ministry, Anne
Gazeau-Secret, confirmed that the 20 members of the French
mission, including 10 French militarymen, had been forced to leave
their office building set on fire by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's Lusa News Agency said on Friday that the rebels
seemed to be in control of Guinea Bissau after the troops loyal to
President Joao Bernardo Vieira surrendered.
</P>
<P>
The French spokeswoman said that the situation in Guinea Bissau
was very confusing and there were difficulties to get in contact
with the French diplomats in that country.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source in Dakar, Senegal, said earlier that rebels
briefly arrested the French diplomats and disarmed the French
commando soldiers in charge of protecting them Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The rebels burnt down the French cultural center, which served
as the French embassy, after attacking it with rockets and machine
guns, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have accused France of supporting President Vieira.

<HEADLINE> High Inflation Hinders Investment in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Investment Center said
on Friday the high inflation rate, now pegged at 52.8 percent, and
the general negative perception by investors on emerging markets
are militating against investment drive in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Ncube, the center's director, told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that the collapse of the emerging markets, like the east
Asian markets last year, made some investors believe that they
were not good for business.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important for investors to know that the
economic hardships facing Zimbabwe were temporary.
</P>
<P>
"These are frictional problems of an economy in transformation
from a controlled economy to that determined by market forces," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry in Zimbabwe, he said, is the fastest
growing sector with an annual growth rate of about 25 percent
while contributing five percent to the country's GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
Ncube said this is partly because of the abundance of tourist
attraction centers like Victoria Falls and the general political
stability in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the manufacturing sector has been the worst
affected in terms of growth because investors were reluctant to
invest in it due to the prevailing economic conditions like high
interest rates of 45 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Disagrees with Parliament on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said Friday that he disagrees with the Parliament on a decision by
the European Union (EU) to enforce an oil embargo against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus parliament Thursday approved a resolution calling on
the government to reverse its decision on enforcing an oil embargo
against Yugoslavia, which has been under NATO air strikes since
March 24.
</P>
<P>
The parliament considers the EU oil embargo "devoid of
legality because it is contrary to the paragraphs 53, 39 and 41 of
the U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Charter Article 53 stipulates that "no enforcement
action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional
agencies without the authorization of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The parliament believes that the government has "no legal,
political or moral obligation to respond to the relevant
directive of Brussels and participate in any manner in the
enforcement of a decision deprived of legality."
</P>
<P>
It said that "every decision and every political act by the
Republic of Cyprus must be in the framework of the international
law and order" as this is the only means to serve Cyprus' national
interest.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said that the government is not bound by
parliament resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said if the parliament sought to change the decisions
of the government, he would use the right of veto without
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Constitution gives the President the
right of veto over any cabinet or parliament decision, if he
disagrees with them on foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time this decision does not help Cyprus' EU
accession course either," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> G. Bissau Presidential Guards Surrender to Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 600 guards of the presidential
palace in Guinea-Bissau have surrendered Friday morning after the
rebels surrounded President Joao Bernardo Vieira's palace, reports
reaching here Friday said.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Chief of Staff Brigadier Humberto Gomes
said that "taking account of the deteriorating situation and the
interests of the country, and that enough human life has been
sacrificed, the chiefs of staff of the armed forces, forces loyal
to the Republic, declare their surrender."
</P>
<P>
Guinea-Bissau's presidential palace has been set on fire after
coming under attack from rebels led by the dismissed army chief
General Ansumane Mane, the reports said, adding the French embassy
and cultural center in capital Bissau were also set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
President Vieira who had first fled to the French embassy, is
now said to be in the Portuguese embassy and to have requested
asylum in Portugal, the former colonial power.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the rebels and government troops broke out
Thursday when heavy exchanges of gun and mortar fire took place in
several areas of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The fighting shattered a three-month cease-fire agreement
reached in February in Nigeria's capital of Abuja between the
Vieira government and the rebels in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a national unity government had been sworn
in and Senegalese troops who had been supporting Vieira had left
the country, replaced by 600 west African peace-keeping force of
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
But, the rebels are reported to have been angered by the
failure of ECOMOG to disarm the presidential guards. The current
tense situation came after an ultimatum by General Mane demanding
the disarmament of 600 presidential guards.

<HEADLINE> UN Role Will Help Make Peace Acceptable in Kosovo, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A resolution from the United Nations
(UN) Security Council will make it easier for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept the terms for a cease-fire in Kosovo,
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in the Italian Senate, Dini said that a
resolution from the Security Council "will transform today's
confrontation between Yugoslavia and NATO into one between
Yugoslavia and the international community and this will make the
conditions for a cease-fire to the conflict more acceptable for
Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
The consequences of this conflict, Dini said, "are very heavy"
and "there is much ruin in Kosovo and in Serbia."
</P>
<P>
For this reason the "task of economic, social and psychological
reconstruction will be enormous, a great reconstruction plan is
needed," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He then went on to confirm that Rugova, who arrived Wednesday
in Italy from Yugoslavia, did not bring "any message from the
Yugoslav government." He added that his arrival should be seen as
a sign that "Belgrade is seeking a way to find a political
solution."

<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the Irish Republican
Army's political wing Sinn Fein on Friday urged the British and
Irish governments to set a deadline for the talks aimed at pushing
forward Northern Ireland's stalled peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The British government and the Irish government need to put a
deadline in place because there are elements in this process who
would talk forever and put off the day of actually honoring the
commitments which they have made," Gerry Adams told reporters in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Adams did not specify a time limit, but with the province
poised for what could be a stormy period of controversial
Protestant parades, a spokesman said Sinn Fein was "thinking in
terms of days."
</P>
<P>
He also said Sinn Fein would meet the pro-British Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) on Monday in a fresh bid to end a stalemate
that has delayed the new institutions.
</P>
<P>
The protestants refuse to sit in a ruling coalition cabinet for
the province until the Irish Republican Army disarms. But Sinn
Fein insists it would not deliver the IRA weapons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italy Highlights Russia's Position in Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's agreement with major western
powers on a peace plan for Kosovo brought the prospects of an end
to the Balkans conflict closer, a statement released by the
Italian premier's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement summed up the recent diplomatic efforts to end
the war over Kosovo, referring in particular to Thursday's Group
of Eight meeting in Bonn, and confirming Italy's full backing of
NATO policies.
</P>
<P>
It said that "The support of Russia confirms the backing of the
international community and thereby increases the prospects of a
solution to the crisis," although it warned that this could still
take a considerable amount of time.
</P>
<P>
It said that the G8 meeting "allowed significant progress to be
made in the search for a negotiated solution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Regarding an international presence in the province to
guarantee the safety of the Kosovars, the statement said that "the
main element to emerge from the G8 meeting was agreement on the
need to deploy an efficient international civilian and security
presence in Kosovo, under the auspices of the U.N. with NATO's
decisive participation, as well as that of Russia and other states
outside the Alliance."

<HEADLINE> UN Decides to Investigate Violations of Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Deploring the deteriorating
situation in Angola, the United Nations Security Council on Friday
decided to establish expert panels to investigate reported
violations of measures imposed against Angola's National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
By unanimously adopted resolution 1237 (1999), the Security
Council decided that the expert panels, through visits to
countries concerned, would also identify parties aiding and
abetting those violations, and recommend measures to end such
violations and to improve the implementation of the measures
imposed against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon the Governments of the States in
which the expert panels would carry out their mandate to respond
positively to panels' requests for security, assistance, and
access in pursuing their investigations.
</P>
<P>
The Council condemned the continued, indiscriminate attacks
by UNITA against the civilian population and reiterated its call
upon all concerned to cooperate with United Nations humanitarian
assistance activities on the basis of the principles of
neutrality and non-discrimination to facilitate the delivery of
humanitarian assistance to all those in need and to guarantee
unconditionally the security and freedom of movement of
humanitarian personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has imposed a series sanctions against
UNITA including oil and arms embargo since 1993, but these
measures have not achieved its aim as expected.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Continue Cost-cutting Measures: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong said Saturday that the country must carry on its
cost-cutting measures despite upbeat signs of recovering economic
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a community event at his constituency this evening,
Lee said that the region's stock markets, including Singapore's,
have gone up.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time I think we should be careful not to
congratulate ourselves too early and declare victory too early,"
Lee noted, adding that there are still uncertainties in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the cost-cutting measures taken last November
only took effect a few months ago in January.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government last November announced a
10-billion-Singapore-dollar cost-saving package, including wage
and government taxes cuts, to reduce business costs and to enhance
the country's economic competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We have to press on to get to a proper recovery, it may be
next year or the year after depending on how the region goes and
depending on how the measures take effect," Lee added.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the recovery is definitely not within one or two
months, Lee encouraged Singaporeans to persevere with the measures
in order to allow the country to fully come out of the
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> No Additional Measures Needed for Thailand: IMF Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of International Monetary
Fund (IMF) officials in Thailand has confirmed that it is not
necessary for the Thai government to introduce additional
financial and fiscal measures to spur the economy, a senior Thai
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kiatichai Sopasathienpong, director of the Department of
Financial Institution Policy, said that a group of IMF officials
was visiting Thailand, starting from May 6, to review and assess
the overall prospect and development of the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
The group will also see whether the economy had achieved
targeted goals set in the seventh letter of intent submitted to
the IMF earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The officials later expressed their satisfaction with
Thailand's economic recovery process, saying they considered it
would be no longer necessary for the government to introduce and
implement additional financial and fiscal strategies because the
measures having been implemented so far were bearing very good
fruits, Kiatichai said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials said that key problems, namely non-performing
loans, had been much corrected and the economic trend was
up-turning and coming back on the right track, he added.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17.2-billion-U.S. dollar bail-out package pledged by the
IMF after the financial crisis in mid 1997, some 12 billion
dollars have been disbursed to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Given the sound prospect of the Thai economy, the IMF would
disburse the remaining 5.2 billion dollars to Bangkok without
asking for any letters of intent, Kiatichai quoted the officials
as saying.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Reduce Poverty for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- African states have been urged
to reduce poverty and mobilize resources for sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
"It is now appropriate to restore poverty reduction as the
focus of our development," the three-day joint conference of
African Ministers of Finance and Ministers of Economic Planning
and Development said in a statement here Saturday
</P>
<P>
A.W. Etuk-Udo Mni, chairman of the conference and Nigerian
Minister of State for Finance, said in his closing speech that it
is very important "to free African economies from the 'poverty
trap' characterized by a cycle of low savings, low investment and
low income."
</P>
<P>
He urged African countries to have a collective long-term
vision of self- reliance as Africans enter a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"African countries must strive to attract more foreign
investment, obtain official development assistance on better terms
and conditions, as well as achieve greater aid effectiveness,
expand their export base, and enhance their efforts at domestic
resources mobilization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The challenges of financing development in Africa have
highlighted not only the constraints but also the opportunities
that African countries would face in the task of mobilizing
resources for the development of their countries, said Mni.
</P>
<P>
However, the joint statement, adopted at the end of the
conference sponsored by the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa,
pointed out that "Africa's economic recovery is fragile and
requires major efforts, particularly to expand exports and create
an environment that is more conductive to investment."
</P>
<P>
"While the majority of African states are carrying out economic
reforms, and many need to continue the process, they must
simultaneously pay major attention to human capital development
and to building the requisite institutions and infrastructure," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
African countries must obtain an average of economic growth of
severn percent per year to implement the poverty reduction plan
which will reduce half number of poverty people in Africa by the
year 2015, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 participants, including ministers and central bank
governors from 53 African countries, as well as representatives
from U.N. agencies, inter-governmental and non-governmental
organizations and donor countries, attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has provided yet another opportunity for African
countries to exchange views on various aspects of their
development experience, dialog with Africa's development partners,
and articulate a common position on various issues.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
tonight expressed sympathy and condolences to China over the
casualties and damage to the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, capital
of Yugoslavia, caused by the U.S.-led NATO missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov delivered the message in a phone call to his Chinese
counterpart Tang Jiaxuan, according to a source at the Foreign
Ministry here.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed gratitude for the sympathy and condolences
expressed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister
Ivanov following the NATO bombing, and expounded the solemn stand
of the Chinese side on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that NATO's brutal act was an encroachment on
China's sovereignty and a random trampling of norms of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
"NATO, headed by the U.S., should bear all the responsibilities
arising therefrom," Tang said, quoted by the source.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov condemned NATO's provocative act, saying that it again
demonstrated that only after the immediate halt of aggression can
a political solution to the Kosovo issue be promptly found.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that under the circumstances, two points should be
taken into consideration to resolve the Kosovo crisis. First, the
prerequisite of any solution is that NATO stop the bombing. No
political solution can be expected under conditions of wanton
bombardment. Second, any solution should take fully into account
the sovereignty of Yugoslavia. No agreement without the approval
of Yugoslavia can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to continue consultation and cooperation
on the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Condemns NATo's Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO's bombing at the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade was a gross violation of the sovereignty of
China, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as well as
the basic norms of international relations, China stressed here
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Qin Huasun, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, at the United Nations
Security Council's open debate.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said the Chinese Government and people expressed
the utmost indignation and severe condemnation against this
barbaric activity and raised the strongest protest.
</P>
<P>
Qin said NATO, headed by the United States, must assume all
responsibilities for this action and the Chinese Government
reserves the right for taking further measures.
</P>
<P>
NATO's 45-day long bombing against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia had already resulted in severe casualties of innocent
civilians and now it had gone so far to violate the diplomatic
mission and this was really shocking, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Qin once again strongly demanded that NATO immediately and
unconditionally end the air strikes against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll From Poisonous Alcohol Hits 54 in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Death toll from the deadly home-brewed
alcohol in Bangladesh rose to 54 on Saturday, with a dozen more
critically ill at hospitals, the official BSS news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our emergency service, we fear most of the hooch
victims could not survive," said Professor Ferdous Ara, a senior
doctor at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), where most of
the patients were receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
The death figure is rising with one succumbing after another,
as most of the seriously sick persons have been transferred to
Dhaka from Narsingdi district, 36 kilometers northeast of here,
where nearly 100 people drank what turned out to be methylated
spirits Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the toxic alcohol slowly poisoned the victims with
most of them beginning complaining on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Until late night Friday, the toll was 36, including two sellers
of the drink.
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients were dying of "respiratory paralysis"
suddenly, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Some more victims could have been saved had there been adequate
logistics and if they had come to hospital earlier, according to a
young doctor, who was extending extra-time voluntary service along
with several of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested four persons for selling the poisonous
liquor, and investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
The hooch tragedy came a year after some 90 people died of
poisoning from home brewed liquor in the country, where the sale
of alcohol is strictly controlled and only a small number of shops
with official licenses can sell alcoholic drinks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand people from all
walks of life demonstrated in London on Saturday against NATO's
military assault on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators marched to show their opposition to NATO's
bombing and demanded peace in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The protest began from Victoria Embankment near the Thames
River and wound through central London to a rally in Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
The placards in the demonstration read "NATO out of the Balkans
", "Accept a UN-led Peace Plan" and "Sorry is not enough".
</P>
<P>
NATO air strikes on hospitals and the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade showed that NATO was following a strategy of increasingly
indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets, in an attempt to
obliterate the economic and social infrastructure of Yugoslavia
and terrorize the civilian population, said the group which
organized the demonstration, the Committee for Peace in the
Balkans, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that NATO should stop the bombing and try to
find a negotiated political solution.
</P>
<P>
Several British Members of Parliament joined Saturday's
demonstration. Among them were Labour MPs Tony Benn, Tam Dalyell
and Alice Mahon and MPs from the Conservative Party and the Green
Party.

<HEADLINE> Edmund Ho Questioned by Macao SAR Selection Committee Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, candidate for the
office of the first chief executive of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR), vowed today that, if selected, he
would do what he can to ensure the implementation of the principle
of "one country, two systems" and build a clean and efficient
government.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho made this pledge while answering questions from
members of the Selection Committee for the first SAR government
during the Second Plenary Session of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao to the motherland, scheduled for December
20 this year, is being carried out in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems" and the most important
responsibility of the chief executive is to ensure the smooth
implementation and realization of the principle in Macao, Edmund
Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is critical to observe the Macao Basic Law, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The practices of "Macao people governing Macao" and a "high
degree of autonomy" under the principle of "one country, two
systems" will bring about positive changes in the public
administration in Macao, the candidate said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a permanent Chinese resident in Macao will act as
chief executive of the future Macao SAR government and the
localization of senior civil servants, for instance, will increase
transparency in government administration and increase direct
contact between senior officials and ordinary residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions on how to improve administrative
efficiency and reform administrative practices, Edmund Ho said
that the government of the future SAR will heed the wish of the
people for stricter law enforcement by the government.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will check whether the law has any room to
be improved, reduce and eliminate institutional and personnel
overlapping, simplify administrative formalities, and enhance
training and retraining of civil servants, he said.
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of anti-corruption task should not be
underestimated and the fight against corruption should be
persisted for long time in the SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on how to improve public order in Macao,
Edmund Ho said that the presence of gangs in the Macao economy and
society is a historical phenomenon whose causes are very
complicated.
</P>
<P>
Gangs are by themselves illegal in Macao and they must be
punished by law, he pointed out, adding that the future SAR
government will strike against gangs from the perspective of
maintaining overall social stability in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho also said that efforts will be made to explore ways
to comprehensively reduce the negative effects of gambling to
strive for a significant improvement in the social order in Macao.
</P>
<P>
On economic development and industrial policies, he said that
Macao should give priority to tourism while increasing economic
cooperation with the Chinese inland and develop high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that, if selected as chief executive of the SAR, he
would like to hear advice from the industrial and commercial
communities and from experts and scholars, and draw the
experiences of the neighboring areas to formulate a complete
development program.
</P>
<P>
The candidate also aired his views on youth affairs, education,
social welfare, medical care, and environmental protection in the
four-hour question-answer meeting that broke into two parts in the
morning and afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Au Outlines Concepts of Running for Macao SAR Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Stanley Au Chong Kit, candidate for
the first chief executive of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said here today that if he could be
selected, he would strive to govern Macao by law and carry out a
series of reforms to revitalize the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Au made the statement while answering questions raised
by members of the Selection Committee for the first government of
the Macao SAR which will be established on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
In about four hours of meeting this morning and afternoon, he
answered questions put by 47 Selection Committee members. The
questions were related to public security, economy, administration,
law, culture, education and gambling, among others.
</P>
<P>
With the fact that public security has been a common concern
among Macao residents in recent years, Stanley Au said that the
SAR government must exert great efforts to improve public security
and punish criminals in order to keep Macao's social stability.
</P>
<P>
"The morale of the police force and their competence to deal
with criminal cases must be raised," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the SAR government should uphold the principle
of governing Macao by law while combating corruption and enhance
administrative efficiency. Only in this way, the hotbed for
underground gangs and organized crimes can be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his plan to boost the local economy, Stanley Au
said that the SAR government should take it as a pressing task to
check the current economic slowdown, noting that gambling, which
acts as the main source of government revenue, must undergo
reforms so that tourism, entertainment and vacationing can be
developed together with gambling.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the SAR government should map out favorable
policies to improve investment environment so as to attract more
funds from outside, said Stanley Au, who serves as chairman of the
Delta Asia Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
With regard to restructuring government organs to achieve
efficient and honest administration, the banker said that the
concepts and practices in business management can also be applied
to administration.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that civil servants of the SAR government will have
a greater sense of responsibility and do more efficient work after
December 20," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the development of science and education, he
advocated that adult education and vocational training should be
strengthened. The annual budget for education in the SAR should be
raised from the current ten percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
What's more, Macao should introduce talented people from
outside, especially professionals from China's mainland areas and
Hong Kong, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
left Amman Saturday for London on a four-nation tour that includes
stops in Germany, Britain, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Abdullah will hold talks with leaders of these
countries on bilateral relations as well as regional and
international issues of common interests, Jordan`s official news
agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The king was accompanied by Chief of Royal Court Abdul Karim
Kabariti, Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib, Minister of
Planning Rima Khalaf and other senior Jordanian officials.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah`s European and North American tour was apparently
aimed at rallying economic support for his cash-strapped kingdom
and rescheduling the payment of part of its foreign debts of some
6.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the monarch`s agenda will be the stalled Middle
East peace process, analysts in Amman said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has visited Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Libya and Syria to coordinate Arab stands on the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He took the Jordanian throne on February 7, hours after his
father King Hussein Ibn Talal died of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Committed to Reduce Tension with India: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz Saturday reiterated Pakistan's commitment to reduce tension
with India but linked progress in their bilateral relations with
the settlement of the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"Both Pakistan and India faced similar problems and it was
imperative for them to avoid an arms race and instead divert their
resources towards economic and social development," he told a
visiting delegation of the Bengal Initiative, an Indian think tank
based in Calcutta comprising parliamentarians, journalists and
academics.
</P>
<P>
Without the solution of the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir, he
said, "progress in bilateral relations would not be possible."
</P>
<P>
Aziz underscored the Pakistani government's commitment "to
reduction of tensions and promotion of good neighborly relations
with India through resolution of all outstanding issues including
the core issue of Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Lahore Declaration signed by Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee in February, he said, "In order to sustain the momentum
of these developments, it was necessary to translate commitments
into deeds."
</P>
<P>
Aziz's remarks were welcomed by the members of the Indian
delegation who expressed their hope that the new Indian
government, which will come into power in an election scheduled
for September and October, would continue the dialogue with
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Millennium Year Launched Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Under the slogan of "the Power of
Humanity", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies launched the Red Cross and Red Crescent
Millennium Year Saturday worldwide, a source of its regional
delegation here said.
</P>
<P>
Al Panico, head of the Nairobi regional delegation of the
societies, said that "in the 12 months from now to May 8, 2000,
we will promote our network of 175 national societies and the work
of their 105 million members and volunteers."
</P>
<P>
On May 8, the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day, the
societies organized many events in over 130 countries, including
the sale of a Red Cross pin to mark the launch of the millennium
year and to raise funds for national societies in the world's
largest humanitarian network.
</P>
<P>
"Known around the world for its response in times of conflict
and disaster, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement will
continue to prepare for disasters and prevent violence, as well as
to rebuild and rehabilitate after disasters and conflicts, to help
people back on their feet again", Panico said.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Year will also promote the significance of the
emblem and the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions in
August, the Red Cross official said, adding that his movement will
discuss how to reposition itself to meet the humanitarian
challenges of a rapidly changing world.
</P>
<P>
Panico pointed out that among the African challenges is the
alarming spread of various infectious diseases by the continuing
erosion of health systems and infrastructure, disruption by
warfare, and poverty and urban problems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in Kenya with 52 percent of its population living
in poverty and urban swelling, its people are more vulnerable to
such disasters as famine, drought, disease and others, saying that
much Red Cross attention in the year will focus on street
children, a manifestation of urban ills.

confirms that the very fundamentals of NATO's new approach are
wrong."

international community have been emphasizing from the very
beginning that a solution to the problems relating to the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia is to be found only in means others than
the military.
</P>

The Indian minister said that continuous aerial bombardment, in
the name of humanitarian issues, resulting in the loss of innocent

concerned about the overall human tragedy that continued to be
witnessed in the region.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Host "Dhow Culture" Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar plans to host an
international film festival next month to celebrate and promote
the "Dhow culture" shared by people in the Indian Ocean rim
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Festival of the Dhow Countries 1999, the second of its
kind, will take place during July 2-10. It will also be a
festival of video, local and international music, visual arts,
theater and acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
The opening day will feature a traditional dhow (a kind of
boat), or "ngalawa" race in the harbor, the organizer, the
Zanzibar International Film Festival, told a press conference in
Dar es Salaam Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The best feature films and documentaries will be judged by an
international jury. Among the prizes will be the prestigious
Golden Dhow Award of 5,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, which lies off the east coast of mainland Tanzania,
boasts some of Africa's finest beaches, forests and historical
sites.
</P>
<P>
People from both Unguja and Pemba islands of Zanzibar will
enjoy and participate in this year's festival.
</P>
<P>
A special Children's Panorama is also organized to show
children's films from the Dhow countries in the historic Stone
Town and more than 40 villages.
</P>
<P>
Dhow is a historical symbol of journeys made by people from 36
countries bordering the Indian Ocean, facilitating trade and
travel between common but diverse cultures.
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 100 films from Egypt, Iran, India and other
countries were shown to more than 100,000 residents and visitors
during a similar festival in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
It proved to be a successful event, rivalling the other African
film festivals like CARTHAGE (Tunisia), SAFF(Zimbabwe) and FESPACO
(Burkina Faso) .
</P>
<P>
Film promoters are striving even harder this year and if
funding keeps pace with their aspirations, they hope to reach even
more people than that did with last year's debut extravaganza,
said Emerson D. Skeens, Chairman of of the organizing group, a
non-profit and non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
Although contributors are still unconfirmed, film buffs can
look forward to the likes of "Divorce Iranian Style," a
documentary, the controversial Pakistani feature film "Jinnah"
starring Christopher Lee as the founding father of Pakistan, and
"When the Stars Meet the Sea," among others.
</P>
<P>
Skeens said the festival this year will feature prominent
newcomers to the world of motion picture, as they relate to "The
Dhow Countries" or "Dhow Culture" in general, at the same time
offering film makers a creative forum for the exchange of skills,
experience and networking.

NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian ambassador to Cyprus Georgi
Mouradov Saturday expressed hope that the terrible war against
Yugoslavia will be stopped and those who are responsible will be
punished for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Chinese ambassador to Cyprus Yin Zuojin,
Mouradov said it is with great sorrow and outrage that "we learned
about the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last night,
the death and numerous injuries of its staff-members."
</P>
<P>
At least three people, including Xinhua correspondent Shao
Yunhuan, were killed and more than 20 others wounded in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Nothing can justify these barbarian actions by NATO and the
U.S., he said, adding that the Russian Federation strongly
condemns the blood war unfolded by the western military alliance
on the territory of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador also said "we value the firm position
of the People's Republic of China regarding the tragic events in
Yugoslavia and appreciate its contribution to the cession of this
horrible crime against humanity."
</P>
<P>
Mouradov expressed deepest condolences with regards to the
death of Chinese and members of their families and the destruction

<HEADLINE> NATO Urged to Halt Military Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (U.N.)
Security Council ended its formal emergency meeting early Saturday
morning with a call on NATO by most participants to immediately
stop its military actions in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour meeting followed three hours of informal
consultations. Both were held at China's request after three NATO
missiles hit its embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 19 countries expressed their shock and
distress at the tragedy, in which three people were killed and
dozens of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
China's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun was the
first to condemn the NATO bombing. He said that it was a war crime
to target diplomatic missions and should be punished.
</P>
<P>
"NATO should be responsible for all the consequences and we
reserve our right to take further actions," said Ambassador Qin on
behalf of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"We once again ask NATO to halt its airstrikes immediately and
unconditionally," the Chinese diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin was echoed by representatives of Russia, Namibia,
Argentina, Bahrain, Malaysia, Belarus, Iraq, Cuba and India. They
called on the U.N. Security Council to actively involve itself in
seeking a political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov termed the bombing of
Yugoslavia and the Chinese embassy in particular as a "barbaric
act", urging NATO to cease its military actions and instead to
seek a political solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Ambassador Fernando Enrique Petrella said that one
could not remain silent in the face of huge human losses and
tremendous property damages.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Ambassador Martin Andjaba warned against possible
escalation of conflict in the wake of serious NATO bombing of the
Chinese embassy, asking the Security Council to take prompt
actions to avoid further disasters.
</P>
<P>
"The pain and suffering inflicted on the innocent and
unsuspecting Chinese diplomats as well as other innocent civilians
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia could have been avoided if
there were political will for a political solution," Ambassador
Andjaba said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador Saeed Hasan, whose country has been constantly
under U.S. air attacks in the past years, asked if the NATO was
unchecked in its military actions, who will be the next victim?
</P>
<P>
Cuban Representative Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla urged the
Security Council to act immediately in a bid to find a political
solution to the Balkan crisis. Otherwise the international order
will be inevitably in peril, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Indian Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma said that any attack on
foreign missions, intended or unintended, is deplorable. "NATO's
new approach is wrong," he stressed, referring to NATO's newly-
adopted strategy of involvement worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun said that the bombing was nothing
but a "blatant trampling on the international law."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ambassador presented a draft of Security Council
presidential statement, which will probably be discussed sometime
next week.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that NATO is investigating the bombing of the
Chinese embassy, which has been strongly condemned also in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is on a trip to
Washington, has expressed his shock and distress at the strikes of
the Chinese embassy. He pledged to try to seek a peaceful end to
the Kosovo problem.

<P>
Among them, Minister for Health and Water Resources Pradip

</P>
<P>
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, prime ministerial candidate of the
Nepali Congress, and Bam Dev Gautam, general secretary of the

Elections to the House of Representatives were conducted in 35
districts including five constituencies in Kathmandu on May 3,

LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
confirmed Saturday that Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov had
canceled a planned visit to Britain after NATO missiles hit

Ivanov would not be coming to Britain.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Veteran Diplomats, Generals Strongly Condemn NATO Bombing (more) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Tens of veteran generals, diplomats
and scholars on international issues gathered here today to
strongly condemn the U.S.-led NATO's bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia which killed three and injured twenty
embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO concocts such a fallacy that "human rights
are above sovereignty" and bombed wantonly the sovereign state of
Yugoslavia, resulting in the casualty of a large number of Serb
civilians and civilians of the Albanian ethnic group. "This bloody
fact serves as a sound slap given by the US and NATO to themselves.
"
</P>
<P>
Participants at the gathering noted that the NATO led by the U.
S. wantonly infringes upon the UN Charter and bullies the weak, an
act that fully reveals its nature of hegemony.
</P>
<P>
All participants expressed support to the solemn statement
issued by the Chinese government, and emphasized that the
barbarian act of the U.S.-led NATO constitutes a gross violation
of Chinese sovereignty, and a wanton violation of the Vienna
Conventions on Diplomatic Relations and the norms of international
relations.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore express our utmost indignation and severe
condemnation of the barbarian act," the participants agreed,
adding that "the U.S.-led NATO must bear all the responsibilities
arising therefrom."
</P>
<P>
They noted that the Kosovo issue should be resolved in a just
and reasonable way through negotiations on the precondition that
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia be
respected, and legitimate rights of all ethnic groups in Kosovo be
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO must halt its bombing immediately, and
bring the issue of Kosovo back to the track of political
settlement."

<P>
LAGOS May 8 (Xinhua) -- The in-coming civilian government of
Nigeria has rejected conditions for its debt relief, saying that
it would not accept a permanent mission in either the Ministry of
Finance or the Central Bank of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Britain said that it would only support a debt
relief for Nigeria if the Nigerian government allowed a permanent
mission at the Finance Ministry, the Central Bank of Nigeria and
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the British proposal, Vice President-elect Alhaji
Atiku Abubakar told the London correspondent of the News Agency of
Nigeria Friday that the Nigerian situation was not that bad as to
warrant the appointment of a permanent monitoring mission to the
Finance Ministry, the central bank and the national petroleum
corporation.
</P>
<P>
Atiku, who is in London to attend a seminar on Nigeria, noted
that Nigeria had competent economists and experts in formulation
of economic and other policies to formulate and execute whatever
economic reforms the government would like to undertake.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic reforms is not directed toward satisfying the IMF
 (International Monetary Fund). I don't look at it on what the IMF
want Nigeria to do," the vice president-elect stressed.
</P>
<P>
But "we will negotiate everything with the IMF," he added.
</P>
<P>
Atiku said that the new Nigerian government would carry out
economic reforms in order to "revitalize our economy and bring
prosperity to our people."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that "we cannot sit down and allow a
restructuring of our economy in which we have a stake by an
outsider."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt. Cancels Extra-budgetary Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has cancelled extra-budgetary spendings on
projects proposed by some ministries before the hand-over of power
on May 29, This Day newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The head of state told a meeting of the Federal Executive
Council last Wednesday that he was halting any further expenditure
unless it related to the hand-over of the power in three weeks
time.
</P>
<P>
He noted that only expenditures on projects that have to do
with the transition program such as the national assembly complex
and quarters would be entertained by the administration.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, the Nigerian government set up a
committee headed by Minister of National Planning Chief Rasheed
Gbadamosi to appraise earlier requests from various ministries to
spend a sum of 200 billion naira (about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars)
on new and on-going projects.
</P>
<P>
The committee trimmed the ministries' request from 200 billion
naira to 63 billion naira (about 663 million dollars) which was
tabled to the Federal Executive Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
After much debate on the proposed expenditure, General Abubakar
ordered all extra-budgetary spending stopped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President-elect Alhaji Atiku who is in London
to attend a seminar on Nigeria said that the in-coming civilian
government of Olusegun Obasanjo would review extra-budgetary
spendings by the out-going military government.
</P>
<P>
"We have made it clear that we do not support new
extra-budgetary spendings. If they (extra-budgetary spendings)
are still on at the time we take office, we'll review them," said
the vice president-elect.
</P>
<P>
According to This Day newspaper reports, "General Abubakar was
under pressure from all manner of contractors, jobbers, even high
administrative officials and serving generals seeking to get the
last juicy deals" and the head of state is trying to resist the
pressure.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Asks Iran to Minimize Cost of Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has asked Iran to
minimize the cost of the proposed gas pipeline project linking the
two countries to make it affordable, official sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Nisar
Ali Khan, during his meeting with a high-level Iranian delegation,
emphasized the need to minimize the cost of the project for making
the delivered gas affordable to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries opened talks on the proposed gas pipeline
project Friday as the Iranian delegation arrived here and they had
detailed discussions, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the proposed pipeline, 1,638 kilometers in
length and 56 inches in diameter, is estimated to cost the two
countries 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, which will pose a heavy burden
to Pakistan's economy.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, with a planned transportation capacity of 1.6
billion cubic feet of gas per day, will carry gas from the Iranian
gas field Assaluya to Gaddani coastal area in Pakistan's
southwestern province of Balochistan and is believed to fulfill a
quarter of the country's requirement for gas.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is simultaneously negotiating on two other gas
pipeline projects, separately from Turkmenistan and Qatar to
Pakistan, in a bid to import gas on the basis of "lowest price and
earliest delivery time," according to Nisar.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang
Yingfan urgently summoned U.S. ambassador to China James Sasser
this afternoon and lodged,as ordered,the strongest protest against
the U.S.-led NATO missile attacks of the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Wang said:"U.S.-led NATO brazenly used three missiles from
different angles to attack the Embassy of the People's Republic of
China in Yugoslavia at 5:45 (Beijing Time) on May 8. Up till now,
two had been confirmed dead,two others were missing while more
than 20 were injured. The building of the embassy was seriously
damaged. I hereby lodge as ordered the strongest protest to NATO
led by the United States."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that U.S.-led NATO missile attacks against the
Chinese embassy have violated the U.N. Charter, have trampled the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally
Protected Persons Including Diplomatic Agents, as well as the
basic norms of the international relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the gross violation of Chinese sovereignty is a
rare action in the diplomatic history."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people express their utmost
indignation and strong condemnation of the barbarous act, Wang
said,adding that U.S.-led NATO must bear all the responsibilities
arising thereby.

<P>
Wang stressed that regardless the U.N. Charter and the warning
by the international community including China, the U.S.-led NATO
openly invaded the sovereign state of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been condemning the U.S.-led NATO's
air strikes from the very beginning and urged an immediately halt
of the NATO military act against Yugoslavia in a bid to bring the
Kosovo issue back to the track of political solution, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S.-led NATO bombing against Yugoslavia during
the past 40-odd days escalated step by step, Wang point out. "Now
there are even attacks against diplomatic missions, a move that
has further deteriorated the regional situation and has further
worsened the Kosovo crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Chinese government and people strongly
demand that the U.S.-led NATO immediately stop its aggression and
bombing.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S.-led NATO clings obstinately to its aggression and
bombing and goes against the tide of history, it will surely
continue to be condemned and opposed by people worldwide,
including those of the United States and member states of NATO,"
Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wang finally said that the Chinese government reserves the
right to take further measures in this regard.

<P>
Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who is now in Stockholm for

<HEADLINE> HK Fares Well From Policing Perspective in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong fared much better in
1998 from a policing perspective despite a very eventful economic
situation, the Commissioner of Police, Eddie Hui Ki-on, said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In his Forward in the "Police Review '98" published Saturday,
Hui said that policing in Hong Kong remained fair, impartial and
professional while facilitating more public meetings and public
processions in 1998 than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Hui said that although both the overall and violent crime rates
rose slightly by 6.8 percent respectively in 1998, the number of
violent crimes such as robbery with firearms, homicide and serious
narcotics offenses continued to decrease.
</P>
<P>
With the 60 fully operational video interview rooms being set
up at various crime units and divisional stations by the end of
1998, Hui said, the facility would greatly enhance investigation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong police forces have, in close cooperation with
Mainland and overseas law enforcement agencies, successfully dealt
with a series of drug trafficking, kidnapping and counterfeiting
cases during the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned, in particular, two major successful policing
operations in 1998: the first anniversary celebrations of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and the relocation of the
airport to Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, Hui said Hong Kong police will make the
best use of the rapidly developing information technology in the
next century to enhance their service to the public.

<HEADLINE> At Least 3 Killed by Missile Attack at Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were killed
by NATO missile attacks against the Belgrade-based Chinese embassy
late Friday, with one still missing in the rubbles.
</P>
<P>
The deaths were caused by three missile explosions that took
place around midnight. More than 20 others were wounded in the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
One missile hit the roof and another damaged one wing of the
embassy building and still another destroyed the back facade by
causing further explosions of gas tanks and diesel oil tanks that
were stored in the basement for the central heating system.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Chinese embassy told the press that the
first missile fell at around 11:45 Friday night and was followed
by two quick successive hits.
</P>
<P>
The shock waves were so strong that they blew off the window
panes and door glasses from the buildings located 300 meters away
opposite the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
During Friday night, NATO warplanes launched attacks against at
least six spots in Belgrade. The hit targets also included the
federal interior ministry building, the defense ministry building,
the general staff of the army building, the Yugoslav Hotel and
other places.
</P>
<P>
Loud explosions could be heard for over two hours and anti-
aircraft fires by the Yugoslav army often lit up the night skies
to the south of the city.
</P>
<P>
NATO air raids have so far hit such non-military targets as
civilian residence, factories, highway and railway bridges. The
Chinese embassy was the first foreign asset to be hit by NATO
missiles and bombs ever since its air strikes started on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President to Sign Y2K Bill Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
is set to sign into law next week a bill requiring all sectors to
prepare for the Y2K, or millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Saturday, Amable Aguiluz V,
presidential consultant on computer education, said the signing
into law of the Y2K Readiness Act is welcome news to sectors using
computers systems to effectively perform their functions.
</P>
<P>
"This is good news because Congress passed the bill last
Monday. The president is likely to sign into law next week,"
Aguiluz said.
</P>
<P>
Aguiluz said that one of the bill's main features is to require
all concerned sectors to disclose the extent of their preparations
for the Y2K.
</P>
<P>
The bill also calls for agencies to submit to a government
commission respective contingency plans in case disruption occurs
in public sector due to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in old computer systems
that, if not corrected, may cause problems in date-sensitive
functions.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The two candidates for the first chief
executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) on
Saturday answered questions raised by the members of the Selection
Committee for the first government of the future SAR.
</P>
<P>
The 199 Selection Committee members, with a few of them absent,
were divided into two groups in accordance with the different
social sectors which they come from.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah and Stanley Au Chong Kit were given two hours
on Saturday morning and afternoon respectively to face one group
of Selection Committee members.
</P>
<P>
During the whole day, 61 persons put questions to Edmund Ho and
47 members questioned Stanley Au.
</P>
<P>
The second-day conferences of the second plenary meeting of the
Selection Committee were scheduled to start at 10:00 a.m.. Many
members began to file in around half past nine.
</P>
<P>
In front of the gates to the two conference rooms, Selection
Committee members tucked pieces of papers containing their
questions into identical envelops and dropped the envelopes into
the boxes nearby. One member was required to write only one
question.
</P>
<P>
As the question-and-answer conferences began, the presider of
each conference randomly picked up an envelop, took out the piece
of paper in it, gave the question to the candidate for him to make
preparations for the answer.
</P>
<P>
And then the piece of paper would be returned to the writer,
who read his or her own question in public. On most occasions, the
candidates answered in Cantonese, the language most local
residents use. Chinese Mandarin was used very rarely on demand of
only a few question raisers.
</P>
<P>
The questions covered a wide range of subjects on the future
outlook of Macao, including "one country, two systems" principle,
education, tourism, culture, gambling, taxation, finance,
manufacturing transformation, high-tech business, real estate,
public security, civil servants, an efficient and clean government,
anti-corruption, law-enforcement, and personnel training, among
others.

Yingfan urgently summoned U.S. ambassador to China James Sasser
this afternoon and lodged,as ordered,the strongest protest against
the U.S.-led NATO missile attacks of the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Wang said:"U.S.-led NATO brazenly used three missiles from
different angles to attack the Embassy of the People's Republic of
China in Yugoslavia at 5:45 (Beijing Time) on May 8. Up till now,
two had been confirmed dead,two others were missing while more
than 20 were injured. The building of the embassy was seriously
damaged. I hereby lodge as ordered the strongest protest to NATO
led by the United States."
</P>
<P>

Chinese embassy have violated the U.N. Charter, have trampled the

Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally
Protected Persons Including Diplomatic Agents, as well as the
basic norms of the international relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the gross violation of Chinese sovereignty is a
rare action in the diplomatic history."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Agriculture Crops Hit by Epidemics: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Epidemics and agricultural diseases
have hit 50-80 percent of Iraq's agricultural crops and fruits,
said an Iraqi Agriculture Ministry report.
</P>
<P>
The report, carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Saturday, said
the spread of epidemics and agricultural diseases were "unfamiliar
before the imposition of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in August,
1990."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Sanctions Committee has turned down 27
contracts in the field of agriculture signed under the fourth
phase of the oil-for-food program, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the committee transferred those contracts to the
fifth phase of the oil-for-food deal, but has not given its
approval so far.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which came into force in December
1996, allows Iraq to export limited amount of oil every six months
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 22
million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the program, which began in June
1998, the ceiling has been raised to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the sagging prices on world oil markets and the
severe shortages of oil equipment and spare parts in its oil
sector, Iraq was just able to export some 3 billion dollars in the
fourth phase.
</P>
<P>
Epidemics are also rampant among Iraq's cattle and sheep, with
a large number of cattle and sheep reportedly being infected by
the fatal foot and mouth disease (FMD).
</P>
<P>
Iraqi media have reported that over 1 million of cattle and
sheep have died of FMD so far this year.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanian Leader Rugova's Close Aide Found Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Fehmi Agani, a close aide of
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, was killed by the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), the state-run Yugoslav Tanjug news agency
Saturday quoted the police of Pristina as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said Agani's body was found by police in the village of
Lipjan about 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of the Kosovo capital
of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Agani, who was in his 70s, was a member of the Kosovo Albanian
delegation at February's failed peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
"Agani was held in isolation by the so-called KLA in order to
be prevented from participating in talks between Ibrahim Rugova
and the Serb government," Tanjug said. "Since Rugova went to Rome,
the terrorists obviously lost interest in keeping him alive and
they executed him."
</P>
<P>
Agani was one of the founders of Rugova's League of Democratic
Kosovo.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Journalists
Association today strongly condemned the killing of Chinese
embassy staff and correspondents in Belgrade, in the NATO attack
of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The association expressed utmost indignation and condemnation
against the U.S.-led NATO attack of the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia, in which one of the Xinhua correspondents was killed.
</P>
<P>
During the 40-strong days of NATO's air raids of Yugoslavia,
Chinese journalists, as messengers of peace, worked hard at the
frontier and braved the air raids, who have been closely concerned
and highly praised by Chinese and foreign audience with correct,
timely and clear coverage of the truth.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the association said the journalists behaved
with justice and NATO's savage act against them aroused utmost
indignation of their colleagues, and the association expressed
deep condolences over the death of the correspondents and sincere
sympathy to their relatives and the injured.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the U.S.-led NATO's barbarous action is a
violation of Chinese sovereignty and wantonly trampling of the U.N.
Charter, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the
basic norms of international relations.
</P>
<P>
The association, on behalf of 550,000 Chinese journalists,
firmly demanded U.S.-led NATO immediately stop their military
action and should be fully responsible for the severe consequences
of the attack on the Chinese embassy and killing of Chinese
correspondents.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Namibia on Saturday called
for an immediate end to NATO bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by its Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Ambassador Martin Andjaba at the Security Council open
debate over the issue of May 7 NATO bombing at the Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The pain and suffering inflicted on the innocent and
unsuspecting Chinese diplomats as well as other innocent civilians
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia could have been avoided if
there were political will for a political solution," Andjaba said.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that the Security Council becomes actively
involved in the search for a political solution to the Balkan
crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Namibia's view that only when NATO immediately
ends its bombing in Yugoslavia, can diplomacy be meaningfully
pursued.
</P>
<P>
Andjaba expressed Namibia's sympathy for the bombing victims.
At least three Chinese were confirmed killed and over 20 others
injured in the NATO air raid during which three NATO missiles hit
the embassy from different directions. One was still missing.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place when the NATO war against Yugoslavia
was entering its 45th day, with a humanitarian disaster causing a
large number of civilian casualties.

<HEADLINE> NATO Raids to Go On Despite Embassy Incident: Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said on Saturday the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia
would go on in spite of the damages to the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade during an air raid.
</P>
<P>
Cook said in an interview with BBC that he did not believe the
incident would disrupt NATO-Russian dialogue over an international
security force in Kosovo, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to maintain this campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
China called U.N. Security Council members to hold an
emergency session early on Saturday to condemn the bombing of its
Belgrade embassy, which killed at least three people and injured
21.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the NATO countries would try to persuade the Chinese
there was no question of the alliance targeting their embassy.
</P>
<P>
"We will be, most certainly, seeking to convince the Chinese
that there was no possibility, no question of us deliberately
targeting their embassy," he said. "This should not and need not
mark any change in our strategic relationship with China."
</P>
<P>
China has strongly condemned the bombing of the embassy as a
barbaric action, saying it was a war crime that should be
punished.
</P>
<P>
It is a "crime of war," and the "U.S.-led NATO should bear all
responsibilities arising from this," China's U.N. ambassador Qin
Huasun told an open debate of the Security Council in the U.N.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO had launched air strikes against the embassy by
firing three missiles from different directions into the five-
story building, killing at least three people.

<HEADLINE> Russia: NATO Bombing at Chinese Embassy Violates U.N. Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO's bombing at the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade was a flagrant violation of the United Nations
Charter, Russia said on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Sergey Lavrov, Russia's Ambassador
to the United Nations, at the Security Council's open debate on
NATO's bombing at Chinese embassy late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said Russia was really disturbed and outraged at this
barbaric action, and Russia demanded immediate investigation of
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council could not let this go without any
consequences, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
It was clear that NATO's military adventurism had absolutely no
relations to the efforts to protect the civilians in Kosovo and to
prevent the humanitarian crisis, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, the humanitarian slogan had been used to cover
up and conceal the attempts by NATO to destroy the present world
order which was based on the international law and the Charter of
the United Nations, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
"How many people must be killed, how many people must be
homeless and how many countries must be destabilized in order to
punish that one single person?" Lavrov asked.
</P>
<P>
It was essential immediately to shift to a political settlement
of the Kosovo crisis within the context of the United Nations
which Russia had advocated at the very beginning of the crisis,
Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
This goal could and must be reached, and however the necessary
prerequisite was the immediate halt of NATO's strikes against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, he added.

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Gordon Brown was accused Friday night of trying to take
Britain into the European single currency by stealth after
surprising the City with an announcement that he was selling more
than half of the country's gold reserves, leaving Britain the
lowest bullion holdings of any major country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair has been confronted with the first serious
consequences of Labor's sweeping constitutional reforms when final
results of this week's devolution elections unexpectedly forced
the governing party into coalition talks in Wales as well as in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's AIDS Nightmare Has Begun: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in history,
deaths have exceeded births in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
This shocking disclosure is confirmation that the country's
AIDS nightmare has already begun, Saturday Star newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Karen Michaels, a researcher of the department of demographics
in the University of Natal, found out that KwaZulu-Natal was
starting to experience negative population growth, ahead of the
other provinces, because the HIV/AIDS epidemic had reached
alarming levels in this province.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that negative population growth will soon become
the reality throughout South Africa as younger mothers die as a
consequence of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is experiencing one of the most rapidly
progressing HIV and AIDS epidemics in the world, with
KwaZulu-Natal the worst," said Michaels.
</P>
<P>
If current trends continued, about five million adults would be
infected by HIV by 2005, Michaels said, adding that this would
result in a steep rise in the adult and infant mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 1,500 new HIV infections every
day in South Africa and 3.2 million people are currently living
with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Human Development Report stated that the hardest hit
sector was men aged between 20 and 40 years of age and women
between 15 and 35, who are of child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, nearly a quarter of women attending
antenatal clinics were found HIV positive last year.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 report predicted that only 13 percent of South
Africa's 40- million population would reach the age of 40 by the
year 2005. The life expectancy of South Africans will be reduced
by 20 years by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Models projecting the future size of the population show that
by 2010 about half of the general population will be HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the life expectancy for South Africans dropped from
65 to 55, Michaels revealed.
</P>
<P>
Researchers predicted that as a result of AIDS, 900,000
children will be orphaned to face social and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic will have a negative effect on the economic
position of South Africa as most of the skilled people in public
industries and services become HIV positive.

<HEADLINE> E.African Passports to Be Issued Next Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Uganda citizens will start
being issued with the east African passport from next Tuesday, the
East African Cooperation secretariat said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had already started issuing the new passport as part
of the efforts to speed up the integration in the east Africa
region, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Participants from the three east African countries at the12th
meeting of the Permanent Tripartite Commission in Arusha, northern
Tanzanian, noted that their countries had reduced their tariffs
by 80 percent as required under the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
For the implementation of zero tariff (except for specified
items to be subjected to a maximum 10 percent surcharge) among the
three countries with effect from July 1, 1999, the commission had
established a high-level task force comprising at least five
senior officials from each member state.
</P>
<P>
Other issues discussed at the meeting included member states to
have designated border crossing points which will be manned 24
hours to facilitate movement of goods or persons except for
commercial vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The commission also set up a tripartite steering committee for
the preparations for the signing of the treaty for the
establishment of the East African Community (EAC), scheduled for
July 30.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's State Secretary Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's State Secretary/Minister
Akbar Tanjung announced Saturday resigning from his post, saying
this would enable him to concentrate as general chairman of the
ruling Functional Group (Golkar).
</P>
<P>
"I have expressed my request to resign from my post to the
president. He fully understands it and has agreed and accepted my
decision," Tanjung said in Kediri, East Java province.
</P>
<P>
The official Antara News Agency said the decision of Tanjung's
resignation was made during a Golkar leadership meeting Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
"I will fully carry my tasks as party leader," he added.
</P>
<P>
On who will replace him as state secretary, described as
spokesman of the president, Tanjung said he returned the authority
to the president who has the right to choose the minister's
successor.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said the ruling Golkar party will meet on May 13-14 to
decide on the party's presidential candidate for the June 7
general election.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the candidate would be incumbent President
B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The General Election Commission (KPU) in its plenary meeting
Friday said it stands by its decision to ban government officials,
including ministers, from campaigning for their respective
parties.
</P>
<P>
"After considering all factors, including the KPU decision, I
decided to resign," Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which had won six general elections when former
president Soeharto was in power, is facing fierce challenges from
other political parties contesting the forthcoming election.
</P>
<P>
The June 7 general election will be the first multi-party
election in the country in the last 30 years. Forty-eight parties
will compete in the poll.
</P>
<P>
In the past six general elections, only three parties were
allowed to contest. They are the United Development Party, the
Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party.

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Condemns NATO's Bombing of Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO's bombing at the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade was a gross violation of the sovereignty of
China, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as well as
the basic norms of international relations, said China's Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun.
</P>
<P>
Qin said this at the Security Council's open debate. He said: "
the Chinese government and people express the utmost indignation
and severe condemnation against this barbaric activity and raise
the strongest protest."
</P>
<P>
He added that the NATO, headed by the United States, must
assume all responsibilities for this action and the Chinese
Government reserves the right for taking further measures.
</P>
<P>
NATO's 45-day long bombing against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia had already resulted in severe casualties of innocent
civilians and now it had gone so far as to violate the diplomatic
mission and this was really shocking, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Qin once again strongly demanded that NATO immediately and
unconditionally end the air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> NATO Raid of Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia Strongly Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- At least three were confirmed killed
in the NATO air raid on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade late
Friday, with one identified as Shao Yunhuan, 48, a female
correspondent of China's state news agency of Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Over twenty others were injured and one still missing, widely
feared dead.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a foreign embassy in Yugoslavia was
attacked since NATO launched air bombing against Yugoslavia on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
The five-story embassy building was hit by three missiles from
different directions, which dropped straight down to the basement.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Yugoslavia Pan Zhanlin angrily said this
raid was "an attack against the People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government issued a statement immediately after the
attack, condemning it as a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan also issued a statement, saying
he was "shocked and distressed."
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council called for an emergency meeting at the
request of the Chinese Mission.
</P>
<P>
China's UN Permanent Representative Qin Huasun said, "We
strongly condemn NATO's act and would express our indignation.
NATO's barbarian act is a gross violation of the UN Charter,
international law and norms governing international relations.
NATO should be responsible for all the consequences."
</P>
<P>
"It is also a violation of the Geneva Convention. We call on
NATO to stop immediately its military actions so as to avoid
further humanitarian disasters. The Chinese side will make further
reaction, as we try to learn the details of the bombing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency lodged a its strongest protest against NATO
and condemned the act as a random violation of the Vienna
Convention as well as a serious trampling of the right of
journalists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov canceled his trip to
Britain, because of NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade. Ivanov had been scheduled to fly to Edinburgh Saturday
for talks with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on the Kosovo
crisis at the start of a three-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the NATO atrocity, Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic said an embassy area is extra-territorial
protected by international law and NATO bombing of the area is a
bombing on diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Now it is the high moment that the international community stop
NATO's policy of destruction, said Ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of Yugoslavia's Permanent Mission to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Peter Burleigh expressed
regret and apologized for the bombing. However, he held the
Yugoslav leaders responsible for the raid.
</P>
<P>
He said "If this is the result of the NATO bombing, we deeply
regret it. It is obvious something we deeply regret and apologize
for."
</P>
<P>
Before the raid, NATO had repeatedly hit civilian targets
including a train, buses, hospitals and residence areas, resulting
in at least 1,000 civilian deaths, which NATO claimed were by
accident.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has
been firmly opposed to NATO military action against sovereign
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people express their utmost
indignation and severe condemnation of the barbarian act and lodge
the strongest protest," the Chinese government said in its
statement.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO should bear all responsibilities arising
therefrom. The Chinese government reserves the right to take
further action on the matter," it said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, some 300 Chinese civilians went to the U.S.
embassy in Beijing to protest against the U.S.-led NATO attack of
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
At press time, more people, including university students, are
on the way to join the protesters.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Coffee Export Decreases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia exported 59,920 tons of
coffee during the nine months of the current fiscal year (from
July 8, 1998 to July 7, 1999), down by 25 percent and 23 percent
compared with the same periods of 1996/97 and 1997/98 fiscal years
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Trade and Industry, Brook Debebe,
said lately that the coffee export earned the Horn of Africa
country 170.8 million U.S. dollars, down by 21 percent and 38
percent compared with the same periods of the past two fiscal
years.
</P>
<P>
Brook attributed the decrease of coffee export earning to the
falling price of Arabica coffee from 3,919 dollars per ton in 1998
to 2,715 US dollars per ton in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the fall of world coffee price is the result of
increase in global coffee production.
</P>
<P>
"The 1998/99 coffee production mounted to 6.5 million tons, one
million over the actual global demand," Ethiopian Herald newspaper
Saturday quoted Brook as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some 11,000 tons of coffee are still believed to
be in hands of coffee traders.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia exported 118,000 tons of coffee in the 1996/97 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the country's foreign currency earnings
comes from coffee export.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- About 600,000 Zambian youths will
receive education over radio as a pilot educational program for
out-of-school learners starting this year, Zambian Minister of
Education Godfrey Miyanda said.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Norwegian Ambassador Jon Lomoy here
Friday, Miyanda said that his government, in collaboration with
Norway, would ensure as many children as possible got free
education through radio.
</P>
<P>
"This project is one of several of my ministry's initiatives
aimed at increasing access to and improving the quality of
education," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Handing over a consultancy report on the issue to the Norwegian
envoy, Miyanda said that lessons in various subjects would be
given on radio and examinations based on the same lessons at
various levels would be offered afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"It is our desire to start broadcasting the programs well
before the end of the year as soon as the equipment is installed,
mentors trained and actual programs produced," the Times of
Zambia newspaper Saturday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The program would complement other avenues currently in place
for distance education. And the youths from poor families are
targeted, the minister added.

Statistics provided by the minister show that more than
100,000, or 45 percent seven-year-old children are denied
admission to primary school education each year due to the lack of
places and more than 250,000, or 15 percent children aged seven to
13 years old are not attending school.

On the current situation in Yugoslavia, he said that the U.S.-
led NATO savage aggression on sovereign country Yugoslavia has
been lasting for more than 40 days. Invaders created only
destruction and suffering, huge humanitarian catastrophe with
targets at civilian lives and properties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only reason is that Yugoslavia wants to defend its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and does not want to allow
foreign troops to occupy any part of our country," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
More, he said that Yugoslavia was always ready for negotiations
and political solution that will respect its sovereignty and
integrity.
</P>
<P>
"When naked and criminal aggression is stopped, there will be
conditions for the only way of solution -- dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Direct negotiations with representatives of Albanian minority
and other ethnic groups in Kosovo and Metohija will enable high
level of autonomy for Kosovo province that will protect the
legitimate interest of its all citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "it seems that those who started aggression don't want
to stop their crimes and they are even creating more pain and evil
because peace is not their first interest," he said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Expects Solution to PAL Woes in A Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said here Saturday that his administration can draw up before the
end of this month a solution that would infuse capital into
Philippine Airlines (PAL) to keep it flying.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio program, Estrada said that his economic
managers are now studying proposals by at least two Middle
East-based groups interested in taking over PAL.
</P>
<P>
"We are now studying the proposals of two groups from the
Middle East which have expressed interest in managing PAL. But we
are being careful here because we want to make sure that they are
capable of sustaining PAL's operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the government's primary concern is to make
sure that PAL continues to operate, regardless of who takes over
the debt-ridden airline.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the government could come up with a solution to PAL'
s financial woes, the president said it has to be before the June
4 deadline set by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
supervises PAL's rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president said the permanent shutdown of PAL, the
national flag carrier, would give the country a bad image abroad.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of PAL's services to sectors
heavily dependent on air transport, such as small farmers and
fishermen who rely on the airline to transport their produce and
catch to other points in the country.
</P>
<P>
PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to repay more over
2.2 billion U.S. dollars of debt, owed largely to U.S. and
European creditors.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is helping PAL looking for investors
who could pump in the 200 million dollars required by the
rehabilitation plan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Hybrid Rice Performs Best in Bangladesh: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sonarbangla, a hybrid rice of Chinese
origin, has been acclaimed to be the best variety in the first
official demonstration farming in Bangladesh during the current
paddy season, The Independent daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Impressed by the grain quality, the demonstration farmers and
their neighbors in Narsingdi and Kishoreganj districts, in
northeast Bangladesh, were expecting a yield of about 10 tons per
hectare against the national average yield of 1.84 tons per
hectare.
</P>
<P>
"I an expecting nine maunds of hybrid rice in my decimal plot
of land," said Anwar Hossain, a farmer in Narsingdi, who planted
Sonarbangla and three other imported hybrid varieties under the
demonstration program.
</P>
<P>
Khoka Mia, another farmer, who cultivated Sonarbangla and
BIRI-29, the best of the local high-yielding rice varieties, also
gave similar impressions.
</P>
<P>
Private seed dealers imported three Indian varieties of hybrid
paddy, and a Chinese variety for cultivation in the irrigational
season this year, following the government's permission allowing
the private sector to import 2,200 tons of hybrid rice seeds after
the devastating floods hitting the country last year.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Advisory Society, a non-governmental
organization, was assigned to evaluate the performance of the
imported varieties in demonstration farms.
</P>
<P>
Sonarbangla developed no disease and its grain was found bold
indicating a high yield, said agro-scientists after visiting the
demonstration farms in the two districts last week. And a leading
rice breeder of BRRI evaluated Sonarbangla to be the best
performing variety.
</P>
<P>
"The flag leaf of Sonarbangla remains steady and green till the
grains ripe," he said, adding that the flag leaf was responsible
for 30 percent contribution to the grain, and the green leaf
helped the photo-synthesis giving more nutrient.

Guinea-Bissau's presidential palace has been set on fire after
coming under attack from rebels led by the dismissed army chief
General Ansumane Mane, the reports said, adding the French embassy
and cultural center in capital Bissau were also set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
President Vieira who had first fled to the French embassy, is
now said to be in the Portuguese embassy and to have requested
asylum in Portugal, the former colonial power.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the rebels and government troops broke out
Thursday when heavy exchanges of gun and mortar fire took place in
several areas of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The fighting shattered a three-month cease-fire agreement
reached in February in Nigeria's capital of Abuja between the
Vieira government and the rebels in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a national unity government had been sworn
in and Senegalese troops who had been supporting Vieira had left
the country, replaced by 600 west African peace-keeping force of
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
But, the rebels are reported to have been angered by the
failure of ECOMOG to disarm the presidential guards. The current
tense situation came after an ultimatum by General Mane demanding
the disarmament of 600 presidential guards.

<HEADLINE> Apes, Wild Pigs Die Mysteriously in S. Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 apes and an
unspecified number of wild pigs have been found dead in mysterious
circumstances at the uninhabited rugged terrain of Golelcha
Woreda, in Bale Zone of Southern Oromiya State, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ashebir Zewdie, a local zonal official in
charge of agriculture, as saying that the apes met their deaths at
the thickly wooden massif stretching between Buria and Bulala
areas in an enigmatic pestilential animal disease.
</P>
<P>
Ashebir said the wild pigs died after preying on the carcasses
of the infected apes and the number of dead pigs could not be
established due to the inaccessible terrain.
</P>
<P>
He said the apes before their death showed such symptoms as
dysentery, insatiable thirst for water, blood vomiting, hair
withering and loss of weight.
</P>
<P>
He said the zonal agricultural department has notified the
problem to the state agricultural bureau and indicated the urgent
need to solve the problem, as the area is a major tourist site.
</P>
<P>
The Golelcha Woreda is home to over 19 herds of apes each
having 500- 1000 family members, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> International Land Mine Conference Ends in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five-day meeting which has has drawn about 1,200
participants from 102 countries and some international
organizations, referred the anti- personnel mines to an insidious
instrument of war and terror, and said in the declaration that
states parties to the convention agreed that the use of the mines
exacerbate tensions and impede diplomatic efforts to find peaceful
solutions to conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on international community for any
possible assistance, be it financial or technical, to end the use
of anti-personnel mines around the world, so as to alleviate the
humanitarian crisis caused by them.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao
who chaired the meeting told a press conference that he hoped all
United Nations members would become signatories of the Ottawa
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries,
74 of which have ratified it. Its ambitious goal is to clear all
the mines on the earth, which is estimated to be over 300 million,
before the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
A report of the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines said
there are more than 100 million anti-personnel land mines planted
around the world, and that at least 108 countries are stocking
some 250 million anti- personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that more than 30 countries have
removed and destroyed 12 million such mines while 12 countries
have totally destroyed their land mine stocks.
</P>
<P>
Now, eight of the 12 big producers have signed on the Ottawa
convention on banning the use, stock, production and transfer of
anti-personnel land mines, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Abolishes Anti-Chinese Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has issued an instruction to lift an almost three-decade-old ban
on the use and teaching of the Mandarin language and the
discriminative citizenship requirement for Indonesians of Chinese
origin.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential decree No. 4 dated May 5, the president
ordered ministers, heads of state agencies, governors, mayors and
regents to follow up his earlier instruction barring government
agencies and officials from discriminating against Indonesians
based on their origins, the Jakarta Post daily reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the new instruction, he ordered the officials "based on
presidential decree No. 26, 1998, to immediately review all
regulations which ban or restrict Mandarin courses."
</P>
<P>
Noted lawyer Frans Hendra Winarta, a Chinese-Indonesian,
praised Habibie's decision as a breakthrough in eliminating
discriminative regulations against Indonesian citizens.
</P>
<P>
After former president Soeharto took power from Indonesia's
first president Soekarno in 1967, several regulations
discriminating Chinese-Indonesians were drawn up and realized,
including banning Chinese schools and the use and teaching of
Mandarin, the main Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
In the past 32 years when Soeharto was in power, many cases of
violence against Chinese-Indonesians have taken place, including
last year's May 13-15 riots in Jakarta and other cities in which
more than 1,200 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
A rule issued in 1996 by former president Soeharto on
citizenship rendered invalid the special requirement for
citizenship documents (SKBRI), which in practice discriminated
against the ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Frans said the continuing necessity for the SKBRI document
showed that the issuance of a regulation or a law did not
automatically stop discriminative practices.
</P>
<P>
In last September's decree, the president ordered all
government officials to administer equal treatment and services to
all Indonesian citizens "and to remove discrimination in any form,
nature or level, to all Indonesian citizens, be it based on
tribal, religious, racial affiliations or origins."
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Presidential Palace said on Friday that
Habibie issued the additional order because the implementation of
his previous order had not been fully realized by government
officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of the People's
Republic of China issued a statement here this morning on the NATO
bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the statement:
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO dropped three missiles from different angles on
the embassy of the People's Republic of China in Yugoslavia at
midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
The building of the embassy was seriously damaged. Up till now,
two had been confirmed dead while more than 20 were injured with
two others missing.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO has been wantonly bombing Yugoslavia for more
than 40 days, killing and wounding large numbers of innocent
civilians and now it even launched airstrike against the Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
The action is a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty and a
random violation of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations
and the norms of international relations. This is rare in
diplomatic history.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people express their utmost
indignation and severe condemnation of the barbarian act and lodge
the strongest protest.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO should bear all responsibilities arising
therefrom.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government reserves the right to take further
action on the matter.

UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A Yugoslav diplomat on Friday
called on the international community to stand up and request the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to stop bombing and
policy of destruction.
</P>
<P>
Now it is the high moment that the international community
should do so, said Ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic, charge
d'affaires of Yugoslavia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment before the U.N. Security Council's
emergency meeting called by the Chinese Mission to the United
Nations following the NATO bombing on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade on Friday night local time. The act caused a large number
of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Describing NATO bombing on the Chinese Embassy as an act of
crime, he said an embassy area is extra-territorial protected by
international law.
</P>
<P>
"It is sufficient for perpetrators to be held accountable as
war criminals," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO should resume dialogue because the political means
is the only acceptable means for settling the Kosovo conflict.

<HEADLINE> Thai Property Market Expects No Quick Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The property market in Thailand will
see no quick recovery despite lower interest rates, the Bangkok
Post Saturday reported, quoting Kitti Patpong-pibul, deputy
governor of Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had seen no indications that a market recovery
was under way, said Kitti, a former president of the Government
Housing Bank, as the country's stock market had rallied by some 10
percent in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The property sector has hit rock-bottom and would stay there
for a while, he said.
</P>
<P>
Property loans totaled 523 billion baht (14.3 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first quarter of this year, compared with 530
billion baht (14.5 billion dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Land purchases, housing loans and granted development permits
in January and February all recorded a decline compared to the
same period last year or the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Developers and potential home-buyers were still short of cash,
so there was no new investment to lift the market, Kitti said.
</P>
<P>
The Condominium Trade Association said the property crisis had
been created by many factors, including an oversupply of houses, a
drop in consumer buying power, price-cutting by developers anxious
to create a cash-flow and pay debts, and the weak response to
asset auctions by the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Government Housing Bank also found in a recent survey that
Bangkok has a surplus of 150,000 housing units, of which 54,953
were still owned by developers.

WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday
Praised Macao for its succeeding in maintaining relative financial
stability, moderate inflation and a strong external payments
position in face of stagnant economic activity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"This owed much to the Macao government's success in
maintaining a cautious fiscal stance, and defending the pegged
exchange rate regime in the face of the deepening adverse impact
of the Asian crisis in 1997-98," the IMF said in an annual report
on Macau's economy.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Asian crisis, Macao's real gross domestic
product did not grow in 1997 and declined by an estimated 3.5
percent in 1998. Inflation declined from about 5 percent in 1996
to 3.5 percent in 1997 and further to about 0.25 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Meets After NATO Bombs Hit Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council is now meeting for informal consultation at the request of
China following NATO strikes at its embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of the council member states opened the emergency
meeting amid reports that two persons were killed, four injured
and two others still missing after three NATO missiles hit the
Chinese Embassy building.
</P>
<P>
China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun stopped before reporters to read a statement which strongly
condemns NATO's "barbarian act."
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly shocked by the reports of NATO's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
large casualties as a result of the bombing," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He added "We strongly condemn NATO's act and would express our
indignation. NATO's barbarian act is a gross violation of the U.N.
Charter international law and norms governing international
relations. NATO should be responsible for all the consequences."
</P>
<P>
"It is also a violation of the Geneva Convention. We call on
NATO to stop immediately its military actions so as to avoid
further humanitarian disasters. The Chinese side will make further
reaction, as we try to learn the details of the bombing," the
Chinese diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh expressed regret and apologized
for the bombing. However, he held the Yugoslav leaders responsible.
</P>
<P>
"If this is the result of the NATO bombing, we deeply regret it.
It is obvious something we deeply regret and apologize for," said
the U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that NATO aircraft "never target the civilians and
never target embassy," he said it was Slobodan Milosevic who
prompted NATO to take military actions.
</P>
<P>
He is the first U.S. official to respond. U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was said to have tried to convey her
message of regret to her Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic condemned the NATO
bombing and called on the international community to act promptly
to stop what he called NATO's "brutal aggression."
</P>
<P>
The informal Security Council consultation is expected to
continue until early Saturday. It could be followed by a formal
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has been
firmly opposed to the NATO military actions against sovereign
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also issued a strongly-worded
statement in Beijing condemning the NATO missile strikes. It was
confirmed that one of the two victims is a Xinhua correspondent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Realistic Target in Sudirman Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's deputy team manager
Christian Hadinata said the national squad must set a realistic
target in the Sudirman Cup, due to its weak women's singles and
doubles' players.
</P>
<P>
None of the women's singles and doubles shuttlers are expected
to win points for the Indonesian squad, Hadinata said.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting this pessimism, the Badminton Association of
Indonesia decided not to send women's coaches Liang Chiusia and
Imelda Wigoena to the event.
</P>
<P>
The decision was "based on the reality and our limited funds",
Hadinata said after arriving in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cindana, Lidya Djaelawidjaja and Ellen Angelina have been named
the women's singles choices, while Deyana Lomban, Indarti
Issoliana, Carmelita, Etty Tantri and Cynthia Tuwanakotta will
compete in the doubles.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata said Mia Audina's absence from the squad was expected
to boost Cindana's fighting spirit.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for her to prove she can be our number one women's
shuttler. She's not Mia's shadow anymore," he was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mia declined an offer to join the squad after her mother died
on April 28.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Toughen Drug Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Public Health Ministry
has proposed that the drug law be given more teeth by drafting
tougher amendments, a ministry report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Anyone caught with 25 amphetamine pills or 20 grams of heroine
or any other hard drugs will be charged with trafficking under
proposed amendments.
</P>
<P>
Production, import, export or possession of 20 grams or more of
hard drugs will be considered possession with intent to sell, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
For possession of 100 grams of hard drugs, the penalty will be
between four years and life in prison, and a fine of
100,000-500,000 baht (2,740-13,700 U.S. dollars). It is between
five years and life in jail and a fine of 50,000-500,000 baht
(1,370-13,700 dollars) under the current law.
</P>
<P>
The penalty will be death or life imprisonment and a fine of
between 800,000 baht (21,920 dollars) and 2 million baht (54,800
dollars) for possessing more than 10,000 pills or over 100 grams.
</P>
<P>
Possessing fewer than 25 pills, or less than 500 milligrams,
carries a penalty of between three and 10 years in prison and a
fine of 60,000-200,000 baht (1,640-5,480 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Possessing for sale more than 25 but fewer than 1,000 pills, or
more than 500 milligrams but less than 20 grams, is punishable by
a jail term of between five and 20 years, and a fine of
100,000-400,000 baht (2,740-10,960 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The penalty for possessing from 1,000 to 10,000 amphetamine
pills, or from over 20 grams but less than 100 grams, ranges from
20 years to life in jail, and a fine of between 400,000 and two
million baht (10,960-54,800 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments also seek to empower authorities to
subject suspected drug users to tests. Refusal to take such tests
could lead to a 1,000 baht (27.4 dollar) fine.

<HEADLINE> One Out of Four S.Lankans to Be Over 60 By 2025 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of Sri Lankans over 60
years, now making up 10 percent of the population, will surge up
to 25 percent by 2025, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The average life span of a male and a female, which ranged
between 61 and 54 in 1961, has now reached 72 for a male and 74
for a female, HelpAge Sri Lanka Executive Director N.W.E.
Wijewantha told the official Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankans live longer as 10 epidemic diseases in the country
have been fully eradicated, thanks to the combined efforts of the
government, HelpAge Sri Lanka and community-based organizations,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
But the situation also dictates the need for an action plan
which assists the elderly. The implementation of health campaigns
to treat diseases which are common among elders is a timely need,
Wijewantha said.
</P>
<P>
He said the majority of elders in the country are neglected and
the social service measures rendered by the public and
non-government sector are not adequate to cater to their needs.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Sri Lanka, HelpAge has distributed an
"Ayurvedic (indigenous) Medicine Pack" among the elders' homes.
</P>
<P>
"This pack contains eight kinds of ayurvedic medicine which
treat common diseases of the elderly. HelpAge will launch this as
a pilot project to assist needy elders," he said.
</P>
<P>
An endeavor has to be made to protect them from diseases by
primary health care, he said. The United Nations has declared 1999
as the International Year of Older Persons to cater to the welfare
of elders worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Recapitalize 12 Provincial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to recapitalize 12 provincial development banks in order
to lift the banks' capital adequacy ratios (CAR) to eight percent,
a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The move would involve a total of 1.54 trillion rupiah (192.25
million U.S. dollars), leading newspapers Saturday quoted Finance
Minister Bambang Subianto as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Provincial development banks have to be strengthen because
they play an important role in supporting small-scale businesses
throughout the country," Bambang said Friday at a signing ceremony
with the 12 banks.
</P>
<P>
The government has said it will meet 80 percent of the cost of
recapitalization, with the remaining 20 percent to be put forward
by the 12 provincial administrations, which own the banks.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 27 provincial development banks. But Bambang said
the remaining 15 banks had capital adequacy ratios above eight
percent and did not need to be recapitalized.
</P>
<P>
The capital adequacy ratio is the ratio between capital and
risk-weighted assets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia (central bank) Governor Sjahril
Sabirin said the Asian Development Bank would provide technical
assistance to help rectify internal problems in the banks.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo Joyosumarto, a central bank director, said that bad
debts on the loan portfolios of the country's 27 provincial
development banks stood at 2.02 trillion rupiah (253 million U.S.
dollars) at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The government has also agreed to provide 80 percent of the
funds required to recapitalize nine private banks and all of the
funds required to recapitalize seven state banks and 11 private
banks under government control.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the bank recapitalization program is expected
to be 500 trillion (62.5 billion U.S. dollars). The government
will begin issuing bonds to fund the program next week.
</P>
<P>
The ailing banking sector has been blamed for the country's
prolonged economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Survey of Child Labor to Be Conducted in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A countrywide survey of child labor
will be conducted by the Sri Lankan government as part of a series
of actions against the abuse, official sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, to be conducted by the Ministry of Labor and
Vocational Training in collaboration with the Planning, Census and
Statistics Department, will focus on the nature and magnitude of
child labor in the country, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The lack of a census of child laborers in the country has been
considered a great impediment to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be based on a questionnaire on a target group
of householders and children.
</P>
<P>
New programs and policies for the elimination of child labor
will be implemented based on the findings of the survey. The
proposed programs are also intended to ensure the protection of
working children at local, sectoral and industry level.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Labor Organization, there are
nearly 500,000 child laborers in Sri Lanka. The common forms of
child labor in the country are domestic employment, involuntary
begging on the streets, child prostitution, work in the informal
sector and labor in the tourist, fishing and gemming industry.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Asked to Seek Funds for SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda has been asked by the Industry Ministry to seek
funds to support the restructuring of the country's small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a source from the Industry
Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Industry Ministry Spokesman's Office
confirmed that Tarrin had promised to seek funding sources for the
SMEs after holding talks with Industry Minister Suwat Liptapallop
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the finance for supporting SMEs via the fund will
be sought entirely from domestic sources, such as Central Pension
Fund, the Labor Compensation Fund, and the Government Savings
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Loans from these bodies will be at a five-percent interest
rate, while loans from the Small Industrial Finance Corp will be
allocated at a low rate not exceeding 10 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced earlier that during the first
quarter of this year, SMEs had received loans totaling 5.91
billion baht (161.9 million U.S. dollars), or only 16.9 percent of
the total 35 billion baht (960 million dollars) slated for the
sector this year.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Minister said credit extension to SMEs was still
slow since it was at an early stage, but he hoped the situation
would improve soon, particularly when the SME fund was ready to
function.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce More Non-Toxic Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's agricultural vice-minister
Liu Jian called for production of more environmentally friendly
farm chemicals and promotion of safe and scientific use of these
chemicals, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
China uses an average of 250,000 tons of agricultural chemicals
a year.
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly low efficiency rate of agrochemicals, 40
percent in many regions, means some of them are wasted or find
their way into water and soil, leading to pollution or sometimes
to the death of animals and fish. In addition, the number of
accidents caused by toxic agrochemical is increasing in some rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
in the light of this situation, the country should focus on the
development and use of more safe and high-efficiency agricultural
chemicals and phase out outdated chemicals and those with a high
toxic content, said Zhou Jitang, an official of the ministry's
Institute for the Control of Agrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture is promoting the use of chemical
pesticides, herbicides and bactericides with a low toxic content.
It is also encouraging farmers to use biological pesticides, which
cause less pollution to the environment and are less harmful to
people's health.
</P>
<P>
The ministry intends to draw up detailed measures to help
implement the Agrochemical Management Provisions. The
agrotechnical agencies at various levels are to intensify
dissemination of information on the scientific use of
agrochemicals.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's second biggest
guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), Friday
announced the start of releasing the remaining 32 passengers of a
commercial airliner hijacked on April 12.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group requested the authorities to withdraw their

</P>
<P>
The ELN said it would start the hostage handover on Friday, but
did not specify when it would end.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 32 passengers have been released so far.
</P>

Five ELN guerrilla members, claiming to be passengers, hijacked
on April 12 an airliner en route from Bucaramanga, in the
Santander department, to Santafe de Bogota, and forced the plane
to land in the northern district of Simiti.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas took the hostages to a mountainous area in the
department of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
The ELN initially released nine of the passengers, including a
child and five elderly persons.
</P>
<P>

Friday that negotiations to solve the Balkan crisis should be
carried on "without any letup."
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his Balkans envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin discussed the Bonn meeting of Russia and the
Group of Seven industrialized countries and the possibility of
NATO's stepping up air wars against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Valentin Sergeyev, a Chernomyrdin aide, said the conversation
also touched upon the decision of U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to appoint a special envoy to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said he would increase cooperation with the
Russian Foreign Ministry and take new steps within his authority
to prevent the escalation of the Balkan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He said he supported the agreement reached by the G7 and
Russian foreign ministers in Bonn on Thursday, hoping that the G8
proposal would serve as a basis for a coming U.N. Security Council
resolution on the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Chernomyrdin said at the headquarters of his
party "Russia Is Our Home" that Moscow would not get involved in
the Balkan war, neither would it stand by with folded arms, but
would seek a solution to the conflicts and uphold justice.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the negotiation process could not be delayed
any more as "innocent civilians are being killed and the war is
being escalated."

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Willing to Help Build Peace in Yugoslavia: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Since NATO's bombing on Yugoslavia has
become a "calamity" world-wide and directly involved Ukraine's
national interests, Ukraine cannot look on as a bystander,
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said Friday.
</P>
<P>
While meeting representatives of veterans on the 54th
anniversary of the former Soviet Union's victory over Nazi German
troops, Kuchma reiterated his country's opposition to NATO's use
of force against Yugoslavia and called for a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Noting NATO's use of force has put the center of Europe under
the threat of a large-scale war, the president said his country is
willing to join peace-keeping forces in Yugoslavia to help restore
peace there.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also pointed out with regret that 54 years after the
Soviet Union's victory over Nazi German troops, the issue of
maintaining peace has once again become an acute question.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma awarded 40 veterans of the anti-Nazi wars medals to
honor their contribution to the defense of the country and the
maintaining of peace.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven million Ukrainian servicemen joined the anti-
Nazi war from 1941 to 1945 and half of them lost their lives on
the battlefield.

<HEADLINE> Report Reveals Emerging Threats to American Children's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Unintentional injury, homicide
and suicide are top three causes in death in American children
aged between one and 19, according to a new report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States is not adequately addressing these emerging
threats to children's health, said the report by the Public Health
Policy Advisory Board, an independent organization designed to
advance science-based policy making in public health. The report
is part of a year-long project examining the leading causes and
contributing risk factors of mortality among children.
</P>
<P>
Adolescent homicides and suicides have increased dramatically
in the past few decades, said the report. These and unintentional
injury represent 63 percent of all deaths in the 1-19 group.
</P>
<P>
Violence is a predominant cause of death for American youth.
One out of every three deaths among older adolescents is due to
homicide or suicide, according to the report. Among older male
adolescents, one out of every 2.7 deaths are caused by firearms.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several decades, the report said, the suicide
rate for adolescents aged 15 to 19 has approximately doubled every
20 years.
</P>
<P>
The increase in homicide and suicide among African-American
teenagers is "at epidemic proportions," the report said. Homicide
rate among black adolescent males is eight times higher than the
rate for whites.
</P>
<P>
With respect to threats from firearms, one study cited in the
report revealed that nearly eight percent of teenagers in grades 9-
12 have brought a gun to school in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent shooting at Columbine High School,
Colorado, where 12 children were killed, the organization's
chairman Maria New said that while children in the United States
once faced the greatest threats from diseases like polio and small
pox, threats to children's health now relate more to social,
cultural and behavioral changes in the society.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Price Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan crude average price
for the week that ended Friday was 14.90 U.S. dollars a barrel, 0.
62 dollars above the average price for the previous week, said the
Mines and Energy Ministry (MEM).
</P>
<P>
This rise puts the yearly average price at 10.82 dollars, a
figure that surpasses for the first time in 1999 the 10.63 dollars
for 1998, although it is still far from the 16.32 dollars of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the prices in April seems to be
consolidating in May with a monthly average of 14.90 dollars,
against the 13.56 dollars of April, the 11.00 dollars of March,
the 8.43 dollars of February, and the 9.21 dollars of January.
</P>
<P>
The MEM attributed the rise to "the draining of crudes and
byproducts inventories in the United States for the third week in
a row."
</P>
<P>
Another factor that influences the prices recovery, according
to the MEM, "is the evidence that oil producers, including members
and non-members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) are complying with the output cuts agreed on last
March."
</P>
<P>
Oil is 70 percent of Venezuelan exports and contributes to more
than 50 percent of its national budget income.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan treasury obtains or misses approximately one
billion dollars a year for each dollar the barrel of oil price
goes up or down, said official sources.

<HEADLINE> Sepa Warns Against TV, Radio Radiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Radio and television have become
another major source of urban pollution through the powerful
impact of electromagnetic radiation, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The warning was based on the results of the latest national
investigation conducted by the State Environmental Protection
Administration (Sepa) over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of wireless communication, high-voltage
power grids and the ever-increasing volume of electronic products
used at home or in offices and hospitals have exposed the public
to a large quantity of electromagnetic waves, according to Sepa
Minister Xie Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
Xie has called for the introduction of legislative measures to
limit radiations to their lowest possible level.
</P>
<P>
Electromagnetic pollution control should become a major concern
in China's environmental protection program, and be listed on the
work agenda of local governments, Xie said yesterday at a national
meeting in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
All electrical products are artificial sources of
electromagnetic waves. When this radiation becomes too powerful,
it can harm people's health, said Zhao Yamin, an official with
Sepa.
</P>
<P>
The impact of environmental electromagnetic radiation is still
within international standards in most parts of China, and has not
yet become a serious environmental risk, said Zhang Zhigang, a
Sepa expert.
</P>
<P>
The two-year (1997-98) investigation has found that the country
currently has a total of 10,235 television and radio broadcasting
transmitters, with a total capacity of 130,000 kilowatts.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Southwest China Protecting Herons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Wang Shiguo and his brothers, who
live in southwest China's Sichuan Province, have been making an
effort for the past 17 years to protect over 10,000 herons that
live in the bamboo forest behind their house.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the farmers planted a half-hectare area in bamboo to
use it to make a living. But, 2 years later, herons began flying
to the bamboo forest and began to breed there.
</P>
<P>
So, to protect the birds and give them a good home, the young
farmers decided to give up the idea of making a living from the
bamboo and took to patrolling the forest to make certain that the
birds were not frightened by tourists or killed by hunters.
</P>
<P>
And, thanks to their work and the help of villagers, the birds
live a peaceful life and have grown from several dozen to 10,000,
which has in turn attracted thousands of visitors every year.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Making Arrangements For College Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region is
making arrangements to find jobs for 3,600 students who are
expected to graduate from colleges and secondary schools this
summer.
</P>
<P>
A local education bureau official says that the autonomous
regional government has issued a circular calling on employers to
help the graduates find jobs in the new market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Tibet this year is encouraging the students to look beyond job
vacancies in government departments and state-owned enterprises
for jobs in non-government businesses or privately-run enterprises,
according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
To improve social and economic development in poverty-stricken
areas, the regional personnel bureau is trying to get some of the
large number of graduates to play a greater role in remote grass-
roots organizations, the official says.
</P>
<P>
College students had no problems finding jobs until the early
1990s when China began changing its old practice of assigning jobs
to graduates.

<HEADLINE> Knicks and Heat Get Ready to Fight Third Straight Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- For the third straight year, the
New York Knicks and Miami Heat step to the center of the ring for
a playoff bout Saturday in the Game 1 of a first-round series.
</P>
<P>
"The first two series, I guess it was a boxing match -- a
rumble in the jungle, or whatever it was," Knicks guard Chris
Childs said. "It's hard to play a basketball game when you've got
bodies on bodies without getting into a skirmish, but I think
cooler heads will prevail."
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, it was Heat forward P.J. Brown and New York
guard Charlie Ward, a mismatch on the court that led to an even
bigger mismatch away from it when four Knicks were suspended for
leaving the bench. Miami won that series in seven games.
</P>
<P>
Last year it was Miami's Alonzo Mourning and New York's Larry
Johnson, a blood feud that goes back to the days when they were
teammates in Charlotte. Without Mourning attacking in the middle,
New York won the series in five.
</P>
<P>
"Guys should have learned their lessons and how suspensions
hurt their seasons, "Brown said. "I'd be very surprised if there
was any that stupid stuff going on."
</P>
<P>
But things have not been changed much this season. When the
teams last met at Miami Arena, a tussle for position between New
York's Kurt Thomas and the Heat's Jamal Mashburm would up with
their forearms near each other's throats. They were separated
before things deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Heat coach Pat Riley doesn't expect another fight to break out.
"I wouldn't be surprised if there was a physical confrontation,"
he said. "But I'd be surprised if it went beyond that."

<HEADLINE> EBank Completes Merger with China Investment Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The China Everbright Bank (EBank)
announced today that is has completed the take-over of the assets,
liabilities, equity and 137 business institutions of the former
China Investment Bank (CIB).
</P>
<P>
EBank held a grand ceremony here this morning to mark the
opening of its Tianningsi Branch, which was taken over from the
CIB.
</P>
<P>
EBank is a national shareholding commercial bank. Since it was
founded six years ago, it has set up 18 branches and 108 business
institutions in coastal areas and major cities. By the end of 1998,
its assets totaled 74.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
EBank began to merge the CIB on March 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of EBank Zhu Xiaohua said that the restructuring
brings EBank's assets to 150 billion yuan and the number of
business institutions to 245, making it the sixth largest
commercial bank in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the merger integrates EBank and the CIB into one
legal entity, largely increasing EBank's market share and laying a
solid foundation for EBank's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
He said that EBank has designed a long-term strategic
restructuring plan to make the merger highly effective. By the end
of 2000, the two computer networks will be unified.
</P>
<P>
He projected that by 2000, EBank's profits will reach two
billion yuan, compared with 1.31 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
EBank has specific measures to deal with the non-performing
assets it has taken from the CIB, he said.

China is indignant at the fact that numerous innocent civilians
in Yugoslavia have been deprived of the most basic right -- the
right to life -- since NATO began military actions against
Yugoslavia, said spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Zhu
Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
China demands that NATO stop military interference and bombing
in Yugoslavia immediately, so as to create the conditions for a
political solution to the Kosovo issue, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Severe injuries and deaths inflicted on Yugoslav civilians
have happened many times since NATO began air strikes against
Yugoslavia more than 40 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Inclusion of Taiwan into TMD Opposed
</P>
<P>
China expressed strong displeasure with and resolute
opposition to the incorporation of Taiwan into the U.S. Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) system.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark when
asked to comment on a recent report submitted by the U.S. Defense
Department to the U.S. Congress on TMD Architecture Options for
the Asia-Pacific Region, in which it "researches" the
incorporation of Taiwan into the TMD.
</P>
<P>
"The move has violated the principles set forth in the China-U.
S. August 17 Communique, and constituted a serious interference in
China's internal affairs," he said, adding that the move is also
detrimental to stability across the Taiwan Straits.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champions Czech Republic
suffered a surprising 6-1 defeat to Russia at the world pool A ice
hockey championship in Norway on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Yashin scored two goals and an assist for Russia in the
group F second round match in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs, unbeaten in the first round of the tournament,
opened the scoring just 70 seconds into the game when Roman
Simicek found Tomas Vlasak in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
Yashin equalized with a deflection midway through the first
period and two minutes later set up Ravil Gusmanov, who put Russia
in front.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Petrenko made it 3-1 just before the end of the first
period. After a goalless second period, Russia extended their lead
with five minutes gone in the third period when Maxim Souchinsky's
blast from the top of the face-off circle found the back of the
net.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Prokopiev's unassisted power play goal made it 5-1
and then Yashin broke in alone on Czech back-up goalie Milan
Hnilicka and scored after a spectacular fake.
</P>
<P>
In the other group F game, defending champions Sweden edged
Slovakia 2-1.
</P>
<P>
In group E in Hamar, Finland edged the United States 4-3 and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oklahoma Tornadoes Destroy 10,000 Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 houses were destroyed
by last week's killer tornadoes in Oklahoma State of the United
States, a staggering disaster that will take months if not years
to overcome, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tornadoes roared across Oklahoma and Kansas States of the
Untied States on May 3, killing 43 people and injuring 669 others.
</P>
<P>
As storm-torn neighborhoods around Oklahoma City, capital of
Oklahoma State, prepared for a visit from President Bill Clinton
Saturday, the scale of the devastation continued to stun residents
and relief workers alike.
</P>
<P>
Buddy Young, regional director for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), said it appeared that far more homes
were destroyed by Monday's flock of twisters than earlier
believed.
</P>
<P>
"The state insurance commissioner said in his report based on
his adjusters that there are 10,000 homes that are unlivable,"
Young told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
That number was some five times higher than earlier estimates.
One insurance group has already said it expected the insured
losses around Oklahoma City alone to reach as much as 500 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will fly over the most damaged areas around Oklahoma
City on Saturday and will meet families in one devastated
neighbourhood, Young said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Searches Anti-drug Bases after Panama Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on Friday
that it was searching for new bases to fight drug trafficking from
South America after losing its base in Panama at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Woodrow Wilson Center here, White House drug
policy director Gen. Barry McCaffrey said that the U.S. is facing
serious problems in the fight against drug trafficking after the
hand-over of Panama Canal to Panama's government.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the illegal drug flow into the United
States comes through Central America and across the Mexican
border, and 30 percent comes across the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
U.S. capability to control the trafficking will be reduced
after the closure of U.S. bases in Panama. Under the 1977 treaty,
the U.S. military must withdraw by December 31, ending a presence
that started in 1903.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration tried to gain a continued military
presence in Panama through the creation of a Multinational
Counternarcotics Center.
</P>
<P>
However, negotiations failed in 1998 when Panama refused to
accept a multipurpose U.S. military presence. The Pentagon wanted
a 12-year agreement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts to Visit DPRK Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. experts will visit an
underground building site in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) on May 20 to check out whether it is part of a
revived nuclear weapons program, the State Department said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"May 20 is the targeted date for the visit to the site," a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has alleged that the site at Kumchang-li was part of
the revived nuclear weapons program and threatened to halt the
implementation of the 1994 agreement, under which the DPRK
promised to make a change of its nuclear reactor with a U.S.
promise of some $5 billion in new nuclear power technology,
alternative energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang flatly denied the U.S. allegation, calling it an
excuse for Washington to strengthen its military presence in the
area.
</P>
<P>
After negotiations, the two sides agreed to allow U.S.
experts to visit the site so that Pyongyang will vindicate
itself from the groundless allegation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Charles kartman, who negotiated the
agreement, will visit Pyongyang on May 13 and 14 to make
last-minute arrangements and U.S. technical experts will arrive
in the country on May 18 in advance of the visit.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Macao for Its Maintaining Fiscal Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Friday Praised Macao for its succeeding in maintaining
relative financial stability, moderate inflation and a strong
external payments position in face of stagnant economic activity
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"This owed much to the Macao government's success in
maintaining a cautious fiscal stance, and defending the pegged
exchange rate regime in the face of the deepening adverse impact
of the Asian crisis in 1997-98," the IMF said in an annual report
on Macau's economy.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Asian crisis, Macao's real gross domestic
product did not grow in 1997 and declined by an estimated 3.5
percent in 1998. Inflation declined from about 5 percent in 1996
to 3.5 percent in 1997 and further to about 0.25 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite total exports declined by 2.5 percent in 1998, Macao's
external current account remained in large surplus. Official
international reserves stood at 2.5 billion U.S. dollars at
end-1998, equivalent to about 12 months of imports of goods and
nonfactor services.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the prospects for recovery for Macao's economy in
1999 would depend on recovery in the region, particularly in China
and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said Macao's government should increase spending if its
economy does not show signs of recovery. Over the medium-term, the
IMF advised the authorities to broaden its narrow tax base by
expanding income and sales tax bases.
</P>
<P>
It said improved productivity and a broader economic base were
needed for sustainable long-term growth and that keeping business
taxes low was crucial for the territory's prospects.
</P>
<P>
The IMF praised Macao's emphasis on upgrading workers' skills
and further developing its services sector, but urged increased
banking supervision -- particularly of banks with high exposure to
the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Macao, a Chinese territory under Portuguese administration will
become a Special Administrative Region of China on December 20,
1999 under a joint declaration signed between China and Portugal
in 1987.

<HEADLINE> IFC Finances Argentine Cement Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Financial
Corporation (IFC) announced on Friday that it has invested 114
million U.S. dollars in Juan Minetti, one of Argentina's major
cement companies.
</P>
<P>
The investment will support the construction of a clinker
grinding plant in Campana to produce one of the main ingredients
in cement, which will supply the Buenos Aires market, said the
IFC, a member of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes environmental and technical
improvements, working capital investments, and restructuring of
short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
IFC has been working with Minetti since 1978, financing earlier
expansions at its plants in Cordoba and Jujuy. The turmoil in the
financial market led Minetti to ask IFC for help in securing the
long-term competitive financing that it needed.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing consists of two loans amounting to 44 million
dollars for IFC's won account and a syndicated loan of 70 million
dollars for the account of participating commercial banks and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
IFC director for Latin America, Karl Voltaire, said that the
project would support the growth of other industries, as well as
indirectly contribute to housing, infrastructure and other
initiatives relateed to the construction sector.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says To Probe Another Civilian Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A NATO military spokesman said here
Friday that NATO will be conducting a investigation into a possible
bombing damage of civilians in Nis, Yugoslavia, during their 44th day
air operation when some reports said that a hospital and a market
place were bombed, causing civilian damage.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, at least 10 civilian people were killed
and more than 10 people injured when a market place and a nearby
hospital were bombed by NATO aircraft this morning in Nis, the third
largest city of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are checking, because we just got the reports a few hours
ago, very deeply and as always searching to see if something is
happened, but for sure I can tell you that we did not target civilian
hospitals and we do not target any civilian targets whatsoever,"
Walter Jertz, the spokesman, told reporters this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The German general also said that the NATO bombing operation
during last 24 hours in Nis targeted an airfield and "other military
assets as well as a radio relay station.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved higher
Friday as the Labor Department's job report eased investors'
worries about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 84.77 at
11,031.59, surpassing the record closing high of 11,014.69 set
on Monday. The technology heavy Nasdaq index rose 31.34 at
2503.62 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 12.95 at
1,345.00.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment
rate rose 0.1 percent to 4.3 percent in April from 4.2 percent
in March while jobs were created only by 7,000 from the March
level to 234,000 in April, the weakest monthly increase
in more than three years. Average hourly wages rose just 0.2
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The report eased investors' worries that the Federal Reserve
might raise interest rates to cool off the economy. Worries
spread Thursday after the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan warned that the tight labor market and rising
wages could lead to rising inflation and higher interests rates
and his remarks flattened the stock market that day.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index was up 5.02 at 641.24 but the
American Stock Exchange index was down 0.52 at 787.29. The

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume declined to 813.27
million shares from 873.70 million in the previous session.

The seven-man military jury deliberated four hours before
reaching the verdict in the trial of Ashby in a military
courtroom at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

"This jury finds you guilty of all charges," the jury
president, a Marine colonel, said.
</P>
<P>
Ashby, 32, could face up to 10 years in prison as a result of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says No U.N. Military Role in Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on Friday
that the United Nations will play a prominent role in Kosovo
peacemaking but not in military operations in the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the regular press briefing, State Department
spokesman James Rubin said that U.N. officials may be involved
with the police and civilians and the Security Council would be
asked to authorize the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "on the military force no one envisages the
U.N. having a role."
</P>
<P>
He also said the force probably would be larger than the 29,000
troops initially anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that
Western allies should not change their formula for a settlement
and must neither add nor subtract from the basic conditions raised
by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn at the White House,
Clinton suggested that the peacekeeping plan adopted in Bosnia
might be a model for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"What we did in Bosnia was functional," Clinton said. In
Bosnia, the command was divided three ways, with the United States
and Russia in charge of one geographic area, Britain in another
and France in a third.
