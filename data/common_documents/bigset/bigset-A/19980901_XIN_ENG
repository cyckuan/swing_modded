<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Sell Nearly Half of State-Owned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- State-owned Swisscom and the
Swiss Finance Ministry have submitted a draft prospectus for the
issue of its initial public offering (IPO) to exchange authorities
Monday and the subscription and bookbuilding process will begin on
September 16.
</P>
<P>
Swisscom and the Finance Ministry made the announcement Monday
in a joint statement after the Swiss government said it has
planned to float up to 49.9 percent of Swisscom in October.
</P>
<P>
Details on the size and pricing of the issue will not be
available until mid-September. A spokesman for the Swiss Finance
Ministry said the size would depend in part on the situation in
global equity markets.
</P>
<P>
A priority retail subscription period for Swiss investors ends
on September 30 and the general retail subscription period ends on
October 2.
</P>
<P>
Share price and allocations will be determined on October 3 and
4, listing on the Zurich Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange
takes place on October 5 and settlement is scheduled for October
8, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have estimated that the Swisscom IPO, expected to be
the largest in Europe this year, could be worth around 15 billion
Swiss francs (about 10 billion U.S. dollars) if the government
decides to float the full 49.9 percent. They said the price could
be between 380 and 660 francs per share.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Proposal for Confederation of Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday rejected the
proposal made by Turkey and northern Cyprus concerning the
establishment of a confederation of two states on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued after Monday's talks
between Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and Turkish-Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot
communities on Cyprus should exist as two states under the
umbrella of a confederation, with Athens and Ankara acting as
respective security guarantors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposal, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said that the position adopted by Turkey and the
Turkish-Cypriots proves that Turkey's policy runs "completely
contrary" to the direction expected by the international community
and simply confirmed the provocativeness and aggressiveness
associated with the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to help seek ways of
resolving the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
If it was really interested in securing the conditions for a
settlement of the Cyprus issue, it should undertake initiative in
this direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus recognized only by Turkey, against the
internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, Cyprus declared its independence from an 82-year
British colonial rule, and Greece, Turkey and Britain became the
three guarantors.
</P>
<P>
Believing the essence of the Cyprus problem remains a problem
of invasion and illegal occupation by Turkey, which currently
has more than 35,000 troops stationed in northern Cyprus, Greece
called on the international community to continue its efforts
towards a resumption of inter-communal dialogue on the divided
island and the commencement of a dialogue on reducing arms and the
island's demilitarization.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Still Plans to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said after his defeat in the State Duma voting
on Monday that he still plans to form a government, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The country cannot go without a government," Chernomyrdin was
quoted by the Russian news agency as saying while leaving the
State Duma building after the voting on his nomination.
</P>
<P>
He will propose a cabinet line-up to President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma (the lower house of parliament) overwhelmingly
voted against Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's candidate for prime
minister, after heated debates.
</P>
<P>
Only 94 deputies voted for Chernomyrdin, way below the
required 226 votes from 450 lawmakers. Of the 345 deputies who
cast votes 251 voted against, with no abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The rejection would certainly push Russia into further
political stand-off between the Duma and Yeltsin, who is likely
to Chernomyrdin's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, the largest
opposition faction with 133 of the 450 seats, said Chernomyrdin
"does not possess a single quality necessary for leading the
government."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov blasted the government's performance in the past seven
years, both under Chernomyrdin from 1992 until March this year,
and under Sergei Kiriyenko, who was dismissed abruptly August 23.
</P>
<P>
"What has been going on in the country for seven years under
the disguise of economic reforms is now lying in ruin," Zyuganov
said. "The main cause is the (cabinet's) policy, the absence of
basic governance and a total lack of responsibility among the
country's rulers."
</P>
<P>
Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky accused Chernomyrdin of
creating "an extremely inefficient economic system, a
semi-criminal one" during his previous term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, of the nationalist Liberal Democratic
Party, simply nominated himself as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that my candidature may be confirmed at the
next session if President Yeltsin and I take the necessary
measures and make the right conclusions from today's discussions,"
Zhirinovsky said.
</P>
<P>
The Agrarians, another opposition faction, said they did not
trust Chernomyrdin and they "have no confidence whatsoever" that
even if confirmed he would be able to remedy the situation in
agriculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada Monday called for the renovation of Moyale-Isiolo road in
a bid to strengthen the Ethio-Kenyan relations especially in the
sphere of trade.
</P>
<P>
President Negasso made the remarks here when he was meeting
the outgoing Kenyan Ambassador to Ethiopia, Geoffrey K. Muriithi,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Negasso said that renovating the road will
facilitate the smooth conduct of trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Ambassador Muriithi on his part expressed
his country's willingness to renovate the Moyale-Isiolo road.
</P>
<P>
The over-500-kilometer-long Moyale-Isiolo road which links
Ethiopia's southern border town of Moyale with Kenya's town of
Isiolo, is a south-north main road linking the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The renovation of the Moyale-Isiolo road will strengthen the
road transport between the two countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian president also expressed sympathy over the death
of innocent people in Kenya by the terrorist bomb and indicated
the need for neighboring countries to join hands in fighting
against such acts of terrorism, it added.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Water

development and rehabilitation projects will be launched in 25
towns across the country in this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Yohannes Gebre-Medhin, head of Drinking Water and Sewerage
Department of the ministry, told reporters that the survey and
design work to be carried out in the 25 towns will take 24

<HEADLINE> Taliban Promises to Free Captured Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia on
Monday promised to free all captured Iranians at an appropriate
time in order to build good relations with Iran, the official
Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Mullah Hassan Qalcheie, a close aide to the Taliban leader
Mulla Omar, told the IRNA in Dubai of the United Arab Emirates
that 11 Iranian diplomats and IRNA's reporter Mahmoud Saremi had
been safely transferred to a prison near Qandahar.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian diplomats were from the Iranian Consulate in Mazari
Sharif in northern Afghanistan, which was taken over by the Taliban
forces on August 8 from the hands of the Iranian-backed Northern
Alliance led by the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a senior Taliban official
has admitted the capture of the Iranian diplomats and reporter.
</P>
<P>
During the past three weeks, the Taliban has repeatedly denied
knowing the whereabouts of the group of Iranians, saying that
the Iranian Consulate in Mazari Sharif was evacuated when its
forces reached it.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran has been insisting that it has solid evidence to
prove that the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA reporter were in the
hands of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Qalcheie said the Taliban would show its goodwill for
improvement of relations with Iran by freeing the captured
Iranians at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say when the Iranian nationals would be freed,
adding that "the Taliban want good neighborly relations with the
Islamic Republic of Iran."
</P>
<P>
Although the Taliban forces have taken control over most of
Afghanistan, Iran refuses to recognize the Taliban government and
continues to support the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has warned that it would resort to "any means" to
secure the release of all captured Iranians.
</P>
<P>
To flex its military muscle, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps have announced to hold a massive maneuver in the
northeastern province of Khorasan bordering Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Japan Protests at DPRK's Missile Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan filed a protest Monday with
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) at its test
firing of a ballistic missile into the Pacific over Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said in a
statement that the Japanese government made the protest to a DPRK
deputy permanent representative at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the firing is extremely regrettable from
Japan's viewpoints on security, peace and stability in Northeast
Asia and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi also said that
Japan would protest the firing to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"Once we find out about the details, we will probably make our
protest to Pyongyang in one form or other, notwithstanding the
lack of diplomatic relations," Obuchi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK reportedly fired a ballistic missile Monday that
overflew northeastern Japan and fell into international waters in
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Defense Agency officials said the missile had a cruising
range of 1,300 kilometers and the first stage rocket fell into the Sea
of Japan, adding that a warhead fell into the Pacific.
</P>

The DPRK has not confirmed the test firing.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel of Balking at U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Monday accused Israel of balking at a U.S. proposal calling for
Israeli withdrawal from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is "still placing
hurdles in the way of the American proposal," Arafat told a press
conference jointly held with Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan after
their meeting here.
</P>
<P>
"We stick to the American proposal," Arafat said, adding that
the Palestinians remain committed to the peace process as "a
strategic option."
</P>
<P>
Hassan nodded in consent while Arafat was speaking.
</P>
<P>
But both refused to say whether they would accept the changes
to the proposal made by Netanyahu last week, under which Israel
pledges to hand over 10 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians but turn the rest into so-called "nature reserves"
where the Palestinians would have restricted powers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have already accepted the widely-reported but
yet to be unveiled initiative, which was introduced by the U.S. in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has refrained from publicly endorsing it, citing
security concerns. But signs emerged recently that Israel has
decided to accept the U.S. initiative, provided that the
Palestinian side meet certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hassan reiterated Jordan's readiness to help the Palestinians
in their struggle to establish an independent state by using its
influence with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country to seal peace with Israel after
Egypt, has maintained warm relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hassan is deputizing for King Hussein, who is in the U.S. for
cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Hassan, Arafat returned to the West Bank
city of Ramallah after the talks en route to South Africa to
attend summit of The Non-Aligned Movement.

ISLAMABAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Monday declared
that it will not sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
under a coercive atmosphere caused by the economic sanctions of
the West.
</P>
<P>
In a foreign policy statement in the National Assembly,
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju made it
clear that Islamabad "cannot sign the treaty, or for that matter,
accept any measure under duress or pressure."

"We alone will determine our course of action. We will maintain
the nuclear deterrence that we have already established," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "our voluntary moratorium and even accession to
CTBT, if we so decide in our national interest, will not erode our
nuclear deterrence capability."
</P>
<P>
He said that no country can contemplate aggression against
Pakistan. "However, our nuclear deterrent capability is meant for
peace and stability and not for conflict or war."
</P>
<P>
Islamabad, Kanju said, has delinked its position on CTBT from
that of India and declared that Pakistan would decide on the
treaty in the best interest of the country.

<HEADLINE> French Football Star Launches Anti-Mine Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- French football star David
Ginola arrived here Monday afternoon to launch an anti-mine
campaign and to help those land mine victims in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The world-class star, accompanied by the delegate from the
International Commission of Red Cross (ICRC), told reporters that
"I want to bring hope to the Angolan children."
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell them," said Ginola, "with artificial limbs,
you still can take part in physical exercises and play football."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that during the three days of his stay here, he can
organize an international football match to raise fund for the
ICRC to help those land mine victims.
</P>
<P>
The football star pledged that he will exert his effort to
help end the disasters created by land mines.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had brought with him footballs and other
sports equipments and he had come here to show football skills to
the land mine victims. There are up to 150,000 people victimized
by various land mines scattered in the war-torn southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the British Princess Diana who was killed in a car
crash on August 31 last year, Ginola said that "the great cause
she was committed to should be carried on" and that the princess
had demonstrated the serious problem poised by the land mines.
</P>
<P>
The late princess was active in campaigning for the ban on the
use of lethal mines across the world. For this purpose, she paid
a visit from January 13 to 16, 1997, to Angola which is among the
countries having the most land mines in the world.
</P>
<P>
Ginola participated in various international games for 17
times representing France.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Renominates Chernomyrdin as Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday renominated Viktor Chernomyrdin as the country's prime
minister, hours after the nomination was rejected by the lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Only 94 deputies voted for Chernomyrdin, way below the required
226 votes from 450 lawmakers of the State Duma. Of the 345
deputies who cast votes 251 voted against, with no abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The vote, originally scheduled for 18:00 local time (1400 GMT),
was taken one hour later to allow deputies to vent, for the most
part, their anger at the government and President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, the largest
opposition faction with 133 of the 450 seats, said Chernomyrdin
"does not possess a single quality necessary for leading the
government."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov blasted the government's performance in the past seven
years, both under Chernomyrdin from 1992 until March this year,
and under Sergei Kiriyenko, who was dismissed abruptly on August
23.
</P>
<P>
"What has been going on in the country for seven years under
the disguise of economic reforms is now lying in ruin," Zyuganov
said. "The main cause is the (cabinet's) policy, the absence of
basic governance and a total lack of responsibility among the
country's rulers."
</P>
<P>
Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky accused Chernomyrdin of
creating "an extremely inefficient economic system, a
semi-criminal one" during his previous term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, of the nationalist Liberal Democratic
Party, simply nominated himself as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that my candidature may be confirmed at the
next session if President Yeltsin and I take the necessary
measures and make the right conclusions from today's discussions,"
Zhirinovsky said.
</P>
<P>
The Agrarians, another opposition faction, said they did not
trust Chernomyrdin and they "have no confidence whatsoever" that
even if confirmed he would be able to remedy the situation in
agriculture.

<P>
MAPUTO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi officiated the 34th annual Maputo International
Fair in an enthusiastic atmosphere Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the director of the International Fair Maputo
'98, Americo Magaia, 11 countries or regions from Europe, Asia
and Africa participated in the fair. China, France and Tanzania
have retuned to the theater after many years.
</P>
<P>
The director said that private enterprises from Zimbabwe,
Malaysia, Spain, Ghana, Zambia, Portugal and South Africa also
took part in the event.
</P>
<P>
Some 160 Mozambican companies from agriculture, industry,
transport and service sectors attended the show.
</P>
<P>
Magaia attributed the large participation to the political
peace, improved security and the stability of local currency and
prices in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the event will bring a profit of some
200,000 U.S. Dollars since 55,000 people will visit the
400,000-U.S.-Dollar exhibition near the Indian Ocean port of
Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Among the 300 dignitaries who attended the opening ceremony
were Mozambican Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism Oldemiro
Baloi, General Secretary of the ruling Mozambique Liberation

<HEADLINE> Uganda Supports Peace Solution to DRC Conflict: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Deputy Prime Minister
Eriya Kategaya said here Monday that his government supports
South African President Nelson Mandela's peace initiative in
regard to the on-going conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Kategaya, who is here to participate in the 12th Non-Aligned
Movement summit, told a press conference that his country fully
supports cease-fire proposed by Mandela early this month.
</P>
<P>
He said if Uganda was called to defuse the conflict between
the DRC government troops of President Laurent Kabila and the
rebel forces, the Ugandan government would provide positive
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya, also foreign minister, accused the DRC government
troops of attacking Ugandan civilian people at the border between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It must be guaranteed the 180-kilometer common border never
be used by bandits to attack civilian people," said Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
Referring to military support to the Kabila government given
by some member states of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), Kategaya said that it was a mistake for
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola to offer military support to Kabila
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the people of the DRC had never enjoyed their
legal right to vote since late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko took
power of former Zaire in 1965.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu was overthr by Kabila's troops in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Calling for general elections in the DRC, Kategaya stressed
that the rebel forces must be included in the future elections,
which, he said, is the only way to bring peace back to the
central African country.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of refugees
flowing into Tanzania from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
has surpassed 1,800, a United Nations refugee agency official
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
Kigoma sub-office head, J.F.Durieux said that as time goes on,
the number of refugees fleeing civil strife in the DRC keeps
rising, reaching 1,823 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The refugees crossed Lake Tanganyika by boat into Kigoma in
west Tanzania after the Tutsi-led rebels took up arms in Goma of
the eastern DRC.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UNHCR officials said that the influx of refugees is
manageable, as they are capable of handling even 1,000 new
arrivals a day.
</P>
<P>
All the refugees UNHCR has received are civilians and no
rebellion soldiers are among them, said Durieux.
</P>
<P>
The DRC refugees are being sheltered at Nyarugusu camp in the
Kasulu district while 1,148 Burundian refugees received this
month are sheltered at Nduta camp, Kibondo district, he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves for Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
hoping to repair his scandal-stained image, is leaving here Monday
for Moscow, where he is to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin
who was wounded by a deepening economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
As both Clinton and Yeltsin have been wounded at home, analysts
believe that nothing substantial could be achieved during their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The reason I'm going to Russia," Clinton said shortly before
leaving, "is because we have learned the hard way that problems
that develop beyond our borders sooner or later find their way to
our doorstep unless we help our friends and our neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday for their
first full-scale summit since March 1997. Since then, they have
met briefly a few times, most recently in May, when both were in
Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
The two will focus on security and Russia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Russia can count on American support so long as it
stays the course to reform.
</P>
<P>
"If they will stay on the path of reform, to stabilize their
society and to strengthen their economy and to get growth back,
then I believe America and the rest of the Western nations with
strong economies should help them and indeed have an obligation to
help them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton offered two reasons for sticking with Russia: Russia
still has the second-largest nuclear arsenal in the world;
terrorists are trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction; and
without strong central control, Russian weaponry or know-how could
end up in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will travel to Ireland and the British province of
Northern Ireland after his trip to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Denktash's Proposal for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides Monday flatly rejected a proposal put forward by Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for establishing a Cyprus
Confederation, the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued from South Africa, where he is
attending the Non-Aligned Movement summit, Clerides said the
intention behind Denktash's proposal was to render an independent
sovereign state into two protectorates, governed by unacceptable
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
He denounced Denktash's proposal as "new Turkish provocative
action" and urged the international community to respond directly
to it.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, speaking earlier Monday at a joint press conference
with visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem in Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of Nicosia, put forward a
five-point proposal on setting up a confederation of equal states
in order to end the 24-year-old division of the eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said the confederation he proposed was the "only
structure" that would safeguard the security, identity and well
being of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
But Clerides stressed that "under no circumstances can Mr
Denktash's proposal form a basis for talks as it is unacceptable
right from the start."
</P>
<P>
"It is also contrary to and contemptuous of the very
resolutions of the U.N. on Cyprus and the high-level agreements
which Mr. Denktash himself has signed," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal also contravened "the substance and the
spirit of international law and all the international
organizations which have deplored the Turkish side's attempt to
question the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the National Council, a top advisory body to the
president on the the Cyprus problem, will be convened next Monday
to discuss its reaction to Denktash's action.
</P>
<P>
Greece, closest ally of the the Clerides-led Greek Cypriot
government, on Monday also rejected Denktash's proposal for the
establishment of a Cyprus Confederation.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Demetris Reppas was quoted as
saying in Athens that the proposal "reaffirms the provocative
and aggressive attitude our neighboring country (Turkey) has
adopted."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Situation in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Monday expressed deep
concern over the continuing clashes in Afghanistan, describing
them as "fratricide."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey regrets the continuation of the armed conflict in
Afghanistan and believes in the establishment of peace and
stability in the country," a statement issued by the Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The problems in Afghanistan should be solved through peaceful
means instead of resorting to force, it said, adding that forming
a broad-based government is the best way to achieve peace and
stability in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings have been continuing between the opposition
Northern Alliance and the Taliban forces, which have won control
over most areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey condemned the human rights violations committed by the
Taliban forces in northern Afghanistan, saying that it would
continue to watch closely the developments there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement rejected claims in the Pakistani press
that Turkey is trying to exert influence on Afghanistan for
consideration of energy.
</P>
<P>
"It is not realistic to postulate a similarity between
Turkey's policy on Afghanistan and oil and gas pipelines," it said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly urged Pakistan, Taliban's strong
supporter, to prevent the militia from harming civilians and
innocent people.

<HEADLINE> More Embassy Bombing Suspects to Be Sent to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
arranged more suspects in the bomb attacks at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania to be sent to New York later this week for
trail, federal law enforcement officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FBI has issued a warning to U.S. corporations
with overseas offices to be on alert for possible terrorist
attacks against Americans, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects -- Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-Owhali and Mohamed
Sadeek Odeh -- were already sent last week from Kenya to New York
for trial.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects have been linked in court documents to exiled
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden, who was said to have
masterminded the two bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed more than 260 people, including 12
Americans, and injured over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The United States retaliated the bombings by firing cruise
missiles on Aug. 20 at a Sundanese pharmaceutical factory and
several targets in Afghanistan, both of which Washington alleged
were "terrorist-related" bases, funded by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has strongly denied the charges and
asked the United Nations to make a probe into the U.S. "criminal"
action.
</P>
<P>
One of the officials explained the FBI had issued alert warning
to U.S. corporations because "since the military strikes, the
potential for retaliation has existed."
</P>
<P>
"We are not aware of any specific threat, but we have received
relevant information," he said.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said in its alert warning, which was sent last
Thursday, that unnamed terrorists in Afghanistan allegedly were
offering bounties of "thousands of dollars" to other terrorist
groups to kill Americans in retaliation for the U.S. military
strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Political Crisis in Haiti Has Corrosive Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Monday the political crisis in Haiti is having an
insidious and corrosive effect on the authority of the state and
institutional behavior.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the situation of democracy and human
rights in Haiti, Annan painted a picture of increased lawlessness
and armed crime, a surge in drug trafficking as well as sporadic
incidents of civil disturbance.
</P>
<P>
While complaints of inappropriate behavior by off-duty police
appear to have decreased, incidents of ill-treatment and brutality
are reported all too regularly in some of the country's main
police stations, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report, which documents the work of the Organization of
American States/United Nations International Civilian Mission in
Haiti (MICIVIH), said that during the first five months of the
year, MICIVIH received 150 reports of beating of suspected
criminals, many of which were corroborated through interviews and
physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general expressed particular concern about
cases of ill-treatment involving cigarette burns, simultaneously
slaps on both ears which can damage the ear drums, blindfolding in
interrogation and, in one case, a finger allegedly crushed with
pliers.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general pointed to a number of irregularities in
the prison system, including the detention of individuals even
after their sentences had expired.
</P>
<P>
Annan concluded that the continuation of the political crisis
would create a climate increasingly inimical to the development
and consolidation of institutions charged with maintaining law and
order and with guaranteeing respect for human rights and the rule
of law.

ANKARA -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash Monday proposed
a confederation composed of the Greek and Turkish communities in
Cyprus to end the 24-year-old division of the island.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Turkish Cypriot regime reaching here
termed the proposal as "a final effort" to achieve a mutually
acceptable lasting solution in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the proposal for the confederation of "two
peoples and two states" at a press conference in Nicosia with the
presense of visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
The condition Denktash set to the negotiations for the
confederation is the acknowledgement of the Turkish Cypriot side
as a "sovereign and equal" state as the Greek Cypriot side.

In a written statement issued from South Africa, where he is
attending the Non-Aligned Movement summit, Clerides said the
intention behind Denktash's proposal was to render an independent
sovereign state into two protectorates, governed by unacceptable
restrictions.

<P>
He denounced Denktash's proposal as "new Turkish provocative
action" and urged the international community to respond directly
to it. (BC-Cyprus-Denktash-Proposal)

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves for Moscow (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left here Monday for Moscow, where he is to meet Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Clinton departed Andrews Air Force Base near Washington at 3:10
p.m. local time by Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
As both Clinton and Yeltsin have been wounded at home, analysts
believe that nothing substantial could be achieved during their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The reason I'm going to Russia," Clinton said shortly before
leaving, "is because we have learned the hard way that problems
that develop beyond our borders sooner or later find their way to
our doorstep unless we help our friends and our neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday for their
first full-scale summit since March 1997. Since then, they have
met briefly a few times, most recently in May, when both were in
Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
The two will focus on security and Russia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Russia can count on American support so long as it
stays the course to reform.
</P>
<P>
"If they will stay on the path of reform, to stabilize their
society and to strengthen their economy and to get growth back,
then I believe America and the rest of the Western nations with
strong economies should help them and indeed have an obligation to
help them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton offered two reasons for sticking with Russia: Russia
still has the second-largest nuclear arsenal in the world;
terrorists are trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and
without strong central control, Russian weaponry or know-how could
end up in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will travel to Ireland and the British province of
Northern Ireland after his trip to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Extends Flight Cancellation Due to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Northwest Airlines
extended another day of its flight cancellations Monday and will
keep adding a day for each day of the strike as there was no sign
of resuming talks with the striking pilot union.
</P>
<P>
Domestic flights are now canceled through Wednesday and
international flights through Thursday, according to the company.
Even a settlement is reached, the fourth largest U.S. airline said
it would need two to three days to resume operations.
</P>
<P>
About 6,200 pilots represented by the Air Line Pilots
Association struck early Saturday after two years of negotiations
failed to resolve their wage and job security issues.
</P>
<P>
The strike affected thousands of passengers travelling although
the airline has helped passengers rebook on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
The airlines averaged about 1,700 flights that takes about
150,000 passengers a day. It carries about 80 percent of the
passengers in its hub airports in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Memphis
and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
The strike, the first by Northwest's pilots in 20 years, costs
the company 27 million U.S. dollars in loss of revenue each day.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the worst work stoppage at a major airline since
Eastern Airlines was brought to a halt in 1989. A strike by
American Airlines last year was halted by U.S. President Bill
Clinton soon after it started, but the White House said Clinton
will not intervene in the Northwest strike.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence To Theory of Snowball Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at Harvard
University and the University of Maryland have found new evidence
supporting a controversial theory that Earth was completely
covered in ice during a series of extreme glacial periods about
700 million years ago that almost completely snuffed out life on
the planet, according to the latest Science.
</P>
<P>
Paul F. Hoffman of Harvard university and colleagues studied
rock dating back between about 750 million years ago from what
is now Namibia in southwest Africa. Based on the composition of
the rock, the researchers conclude Earth experienced four deep
ice ages, each of which lasted millions of years.
</P>
<P>
The most likely explanation for this "collapse" would be
"global glaciation", the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to imagine any other mechanism that would
shut down productivity on that scale other than global
glaciation," Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
No one knows why this would have occurred, but the
researchers speculate that this icy period may have ended when
volcanic activity caused the globe to warm again, allowing
whatever life that survived to begin to flourish again.

<HEADLINE> Police Blows Up Suspicious Parcels Near NAM </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
DURBAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- South African police bomb squad
Monday blew up two suspected parcels in controlled explosions in
central Durban where the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit
has been held since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two pieces of suspicious parcels, found in two different
streets not far away from the conference site, were later proved
to have only contained clothing, sand and cement, police
spokesman Vishnu Naidoo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said that police received at least six telephone calls
Monday about suspicious parcels and bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
One of anonymous calls warning of bomb explosions was
apparently made by a woman, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of policemen, military troops and security guards
were reportedly mobilized and deployed around the International
Conference Center, which has been provided for the six-day summit
since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) and the South
African Communist Party (SACP) have condemned the spate of bomb
threats.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said in a statement that unscrupulous elements were
attempting to divert the attention of the world from the agenda
of the NAM summit.
</P>
<P>
The SACP described the bomb threats as the work of
undemocratic elements trying to intimidate delegates and
undermine the struggle of the developing world.

<P>
LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States government has
announced the indefinite closure of its embassy in Accra and all
other official installations in Ghana with effect from Monday,
following "increased threats to its installations," a report from
Accra said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said in a statement that similar threats have been
received regarding U.S. installations in Togo.
</P>
<P>
It advised the public to stay clear of all official American
facilities unless it is absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
The embassy will offer services in emergency cases, it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed on August
7, resulting in the death of over 250 people with more than 5,000
others injured.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local radio station, Bruce Leliof,
information officer at the U.S. embassy in Accra, said that the
American installations in Accra and Lome are likely to remain
closed until Wednesday, when the situation might be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the threats "in our view are credible enough and
we do not want to risk the lives of our nationals or Ghanaians
working or visiting us for any reason."
</P>
<P>
"All U.S. installations at the moment are out of bounds," he
said. "The closure has nothing to do with Ghana-U.S. relations or
with Africa-American relations. Terrorism has no limits and
strikes sometimes at unexpected places."

LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Monday told Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the Group of
Seven (G7) industrial countries are ready to help Russia, but
urged Russia to stick to its reform program.

G7 and the EU to help, but equally their clear agreement that any
help must be tied to the economic reform process continuing," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister was assured Russia understood the
importance of the economic reform program. It was in everyone's
interest that the (Russian) political situation stabilizes soon,"

<HEADLINE> Feature: Fun Can Also Go to Security Council Chair  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Monday usually stands for
the beginning of a working day in a week. But Monday of this week,
which falls on August 31, will see the exit of Danilo Turk as the
president of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
His news briefing, if not the last, turned to be an easy one,
as his humorous remarks were greeted with smiling faces and
laughters from his journalistic audience.
</P>
<P>
"Talking to you (reporters) at the end of the month is much
easier than the beginning of the month," Turk said here a few
hours before his end of the monthly rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
It is "an interesting thing" to look at the U.N. Security
Council from the position of the president, and it is different
from what one can see simply from the seat of a council member,
Turk said.
</P>
<P>
The other interesting thing is "to watch body language on the
table," the outgoing council president said.
</P>
<P>
"It really helps, and you can sense what people really feel
about a thing" by watching their body language, Turk, the Security
Council president in August, told reporters only a few hours
before he leaves the presidency.
</P>
<P>
For an example, "people show their will to agree by encouraging
the president, not using words, but using their body language,"
Turk, Slovenian permanent representative to the United Nations,
said, "so you can see a lot of encouragement coming by the way
people look at you and by the way they move their hands."
</P>
<P>
"After all, the Security Council is rather a small forum,
(with) 15 members plus their advisors, who sometimes have a lot of
fun with what they hear from their bosses," he said.
</P>
<P>
On what surprised him the most in the passing month, Turk said,
"All you can see in the consultation room, the wish to come to
consensus is relatively strong, and that helps a lot if you have
to chair such meetings."
</P>
<P>
He said that it helps a lot if Security Council members are
willing to work on consensus.
</P>
<P>
"He is so charming and handsome," a female correspondent
commented before leaving the press conference hall in the U.N.
building.
</P>
<P>
Before he hands over the presidency to his successor, Turk is
expected to announce on Monday afternoon a presidential statement
on the situation of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has
been plunged into a civil war since early this month.

<P>
DURBAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki met Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge here
Monday and exchanged views over the on-going civil war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Mbeki's top aide Ricky Naidoo told
Xinhua that Mbeki and Mudenge, who is here to participate in
foreign ministers' meeting of the 12th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
summit, also talked about issues concerning differences among
member states of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC).
</P>
<P>
Naidoo declined to give more details about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and neighboring Zimbabwe reportedly have
different ideas over the settlement of the DRC conflict, which
has resulted in increasing tension between President Nelson
Mandela and his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, together with Namibia and Angola, have sent troops
and arms to help DRC President Laurent Kabila quell rebel forces
in his country, while South Africa believes military intervention
is short-sighted and favors a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, NAM Secretary-General Aziz Pahad played down
suggestions of growing division between some African member
states of the NAM about the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general commitment to contribute to finding a
solution to the conflict that has erupted in central Africa.
Discussions are continuing and I don't believe they are
antagonistic," Pahad told reporters.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday called for
U.N. investigation into operations of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq'a weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq
accused UNSCOM of spying by taking orders form the United States
and coordinating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon you, as well as the Security Council, to put
an end to this charade which goes on under the cover of the
United Nations and the Security Council," said the letter by
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Aziz cited newspaper reports that the United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler to hold off inspecting certain sites
to avoid creating a standoff with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz claimed the resignation of U.S. weapons inspector Scott
Ritter was to divert attention from the inspectors' refusal to
acknowledge Iraq's achievements in eliminating its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also accused UNSCOM of deliberately prolonging its work
of identifying and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
 Iraq demands a serious investigation of all these facts,
said the letter, adding UNSCOM should be made "an honest
international body, not an intelligence unit for a member
country."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Relax Control on Hard Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of
Ethiopia announced Monday that commercial and private banks have
taken over the responsibility to issue import and export trade
license save for coffee, in addition to the management of hard
currency allocation and revenue administration.
</P>
<P>
Teklewold Atinafu, governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia,
told Ethiopian journalists here that commercial banks are allowed
as of Monday to buy and sell hard currency according to market
prices.
</P>
<P>
Teklewold said a foreign exchange auction, at which commercial
banks, licensed investors and organizations will take part for a
purchase to be effected with over 500,000 U.S. Dollars, will be
launched on September 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
These measures taken by the Ethiopian government are aimed at
relaxing control on hard currency in a bid to promote foreign
trade in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted the governor as saying that
measures taken include liberalizing centralized allocation of
hard currency and overcoming administrative procedures regarding
revenue and foreign trade current account payments in hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
Teklewold said, a directive was issued allowing exporters to
deposit in their account 10 percent of the hard currency they
earn and use it at their discretion.
</P>
<P>
He said that businessmen were also granted the right to change
90 percent of the hard currency with the local tender in a period
of four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The new measures also allowed expatriates residing in Ethiopia
to send abroad hard currency of the equivalent to their net
salaries.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, the economic reform in the
financial sector were made in line with agreements reached
between the Ethiopian government and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The measures which will boost the country's capacity to earn
more hard currency are testimonies to its commitment to adhering
to the principles of the free market economy, the governor added.

NEW YORK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrials
suffered their second-biggest point loss ever Monday, amid news of
a parliamentary showdown in Russia.

Unity (OAU), will do everything in its capacity to avert the
situation in that central African country.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call For Wetlands Protection (1) by Yin Huidi, Nie Xiaoyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Heavy flooding along China's
Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua rivers have been caused, at least
in part, by the continuing degeneration of wetlands resulting from
reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The assertion was made by 80 experts on the Special Committee
of Wetland Ecology under the Chinese Society of Ecology in an open
letter issued today.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the exploitation of wetlands along rivers
should be immediately prohibited. Efforts should be made to
strengthen education related to the functions and to enhance
public awareness of the need for expanded protection of the
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, the natural ecological systems often referred to as
the earth's "kidneys", play an extremely important role in water
conservation and the prevention of erosion and flooding.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the State Forestry Administration, Ministry of
Water Resources, State General Administration of Environmental
Protection and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as related
colleges, universities and institutes, point out that the
increasing population and economic development have also
contributed to the continued deterioration of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
"The reclamation of lakes has led to the loss of 32.5 billion
cu.m. of storage capacity nationwide, with said figure equalling
one and a half of the storage capacity for the Three Gorges Dam
Project, the world's largest water conservation project currently
under construction," according to the experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the General
Office of the State Council today issued a circular calling for
frugal economic practices during the ongoing flood control and
relief effort.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged governments and departments at all levels to
practice thrift and eliminate waste in order to make greater
contributions to the nation's economic developments and capacity
to help more flood victims resume normal lives at the earliest
possible date.
</P>
<P>
"Flood victims urgently need large sums of money to rebuild
their homes and the entire nation is working around the clock to
realize the eight percent growth target for gross domestic product
(GDP). Public funds should not be squandered on costly
recreational activities," said the circular.
</P>
<P>
The circular prohibited government institutions from
constructing new office buildings, purchasing expensive
automobiles or mobile phones, and holding meetings in popular
tourism areas.
</P>
<P>
"Government officials should visit grass roots units and help
flood victims solve real problems, and no institution or
individual will be allowed to misappropriate relief funds," said
the circular.

They added that the storage capacity for Poyang Lake, China's
largest freshwater lake, has dropped by 4.52 billion cu.m., or a
volume equal to a major flood diversion area along the Yangtze
River. The storage capacity for Dongting Lake, the nation's second
largest freshwater lake, has been reduced by 40 percent, while the
capacities for Honghu Lake and a large number of other lakes in
the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have dropped by as much as
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Related activities have, to a large extent, increased the
severity of flooding," according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
The silting rate in Dongting Lake has reached 75 percent and
the lake bed has continued to rise by 3.7 millimeters annually,
with the silting rate for Poyang Lake standing at 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
The letter indicates that numerous residential areas and
factories can be found in major flood diversion areas along the
Yangtze. Disruptions in the natural functions of many wetlands
along the Yangtze have greater pressure on the mainstream of the
river.
</P>
<P>
"Similar problems can be found along the Nenjiang and
Songhua rivers," according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
"Silting has also raised riverbeds and the construction of dams
has disrupted the hydrological patterns of lakes, rivers and
wetlands which have in turn increased flow rates and the frequency
of floods," according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
The experts pointed out that China is formulating a plan for
action concerning wetlands protection. Experts appealed for "the
implementation of the plan at the earliest possible date, and for
greater stress on the research and protection of wetlands."

DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A 33-member Bangladeshi team is
scheduled to leave here Wednesday for Malaysia to take part in
the 16th Commonwealth games which will begin on September 11 in
Kuala Lumpur, the official BSS news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi team will take part in only two sports of
cricket and shooting, instead of the original five. Bangladesh
first planned to send an 84-member team to take part in the
games, but since the country has been seriously hit by
devastating flood, the scale of the team reduced to only 33
members to save funds under the directive of Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member shooting team includes four women shooters.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh would have a chance to get a medal in shooting,
officials of the Bangladesh Shooting Federation (BSF) hoped,
since BSF had invited well-known German shooting coach who came
here in mid-August to train Bangladeshi shooters.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned its first ever gold medal in shooting in the
14th Commonwealth Games held in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi cricket team is comprised of 14 cricketers,
and they will play their first matches against Babados, South
Africa and North Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Proposal for Confederation on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday condemned the
idea of a confederation of two states on Cyprus proposed by Turkey
and the Turkish Cypriots, saying that this was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday by the Greek Foreign Ministry,
spokesman Theodoros Theodorou said that the idea was an indication
that the Turkish side continued to insist on extreme positions.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece rejected the proposal because it continued
to reject U.N. Security Council resolutions on the Cyprus issue
for talks as a basis for the settlement of the protracted Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was raised Monday by Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, was
anticipating the outcome of any talks, with the Turkish proposal
being presented as an ultimatum, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the development was a clear attempt by the
Turkish side to succeed in having northern Cyprus recognized and
to undermine Cyprus' entry into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities on Cyprus should exist as two states under the
umbrella of a confederation, with Athens and Ankara acting as
respective security guarantors.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek-Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Goes Up to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. construction
spending rose 0.4 percent in July to a record high, the Commerce
Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A big increase in residential building more than offset
commercial declines and essentially flat government outlays which
brought total construction spending to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 650.4 billion U.S. dollars, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Demand for new homes has been particularly strong this year as
plentiful jobs have boosted family incomes. Construction spending
is also being spurred by low interest rates and competition among
banks eager to finance real estate investment.
</P>
<P>
Residential construction spending rose 1.4 percent in July to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 296.3 billion dollars. Spending
rose on construction of single-family homes and remodeling, but
was flat for apartments.
</P>
<P>
The spending on commercial construction projects in July
dropped 1.2 percent to 166.2 billion dollars. Declines in spending
on factories and offices more than offset increases in other
areas, including hotels and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Government construction spending held relatively stable in
July, rising a tiny 0.07 percent to 145.4 billion dollars.
Spending increased on sewer and water supply systems, hospitals,
military facilities and other public buildings such as prisons,
police and fire stations and courthouses. But construction of
schools and highways and streets dipped.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call For Wetlands Protection (1) by Yin Huidi, Nie Xiaoyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Heavy flooding along China's
Yangtze, Nenjiang, and Songhua rivers have been caused, at least
in part, by the continuing degeneration of wetlands resulting from
reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The assertion was made by 80 experts on the Special Committee
of Wetland Ecology under the Chinese Society of Ecology in an open
letter issued today.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the exploitation of wetlands along rivers
should be immediately prohibited. Efforts should be made to
strengthen education related to the functions and value of
wetlands and to enhance public awareness of the need for expanded
protection of the natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, the natural ecological systems often referred to as
the earth's "kidneys", play an extremely important role in water
conservation and the prevention of erosion and flooding.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the State Forestry Administration, Ministry of
Water Resources, State General Administration of Environmental
Protection and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as related
colleges, universities and institutes, point out that the
increasing population and economic development have also
contributed to the continued deterioration of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
"The reclamation of lakes has led to the loss of 32.5 billion
cu.m. of storage capacity nationwide, with said figure equalling
half of the storage capacity for the Three Gorges Dam Project, the
world's largest water conservation project currently under
construction," according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
They added that the storage capacity for Poyang Lake, China's
largest freshwater lake, has dropped by 452 million cu.m., or a
volume equal to a major flood diversion area along the Yangtze
River. The storage capacity for Dongting Lake, the nation's second
largest lake, has been reduced by 40 percent, while the capacities
for Honghu Lake and a large number of lakes in the middle reaches
of the Yangtze River have dropped by as much as 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Opposition Loses Control of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korean opposition the
Grand National Party (GNP) Tuesday lost its control of the
National Assembly, or parliament, as three members defected to the
ruling camp.
</P>
<P>
The defection helped the ruling camp, the National Congress for
New Politics and the United Liberal Democrats respectively led by
President Kim Dae-jung and Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, increase
its seats to 147 in the 299-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
It reduced the number of the opposition's seats in the
unicameral National Assembly from 150 to 147.
</P>
<P>
The defection is believed to have dealt a heavy blow to Lee
Hoi-chang, who won the GNP presidency over three other competitors
at the party national convention Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, who has repeatedly accused the GNP of preventing
his reform bills from passing through the National Assembly since
he took office in February, has vowed to forge a majority by
recruiting opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, paralyzed for more than five months, resumed
operations last month after the opposition ended its parliamentary
boycott to vote on Kim Dae-jung's appointment of Kim Jong-pil as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary dispute frustrated the government's drive to
tide over economic crisis caused by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions late last year.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Reaffirms Significance of Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, today
affirmed the necessity for the Three Gorges Dam Project and
stressed the hydropower project will play a major role in reducing
floods by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Li exchanged views with hydrologists and experts concerning
accelerated efforts to construct more water conservancy projects
following this year's wide-spread flooding.
</P>
<P>
This summer's devastating floods along the Yangtze River, and
the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in northeastern China, have killed
an estimated 3,000 people and caused economic losses of well over
166 billion yuan (20.7 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li said the law on flood control promulgated last year stresses
the establishment of a comprehensive flood prevention network of
reservoirs and dams for storing and discharging flood waters, as
well as for reinforcing river embankments and levees, and
constructing additional water and soil conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
He said detailed rules and regulations related to the law
should be introduced at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Experts praised this year's flood control efforts and call for
increased investments in water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangdou, a professor at Qinghua University, said it is
unrealistic to attempt to control floods along Yangtze River by
simply raising the heights of levees and reinforcing related
structure. He said diverting flood waters at the proper locations
and appropriate time would be both workable and effective.
</P>
<P>
Lin Bingnan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
expressed his disagreement with certain people's assertions that
silting in rivers has raised water levels and was a major factor
in this year's catastrophic flooding.
</P>
<P>
Data gathered over the past 40-odd years fails to indicate a
tendency for the Yangtze riverbed to rise or fall, said Lin,
adding that silting affects some sections, but is far from a
common phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
A number of the experts tabled suggestions for future flood
prevention and control programs.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Security Agreement May be Enhanced: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have said a
satisfactory second Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank means a
chance for an enhanced security cooperation with Israel, the
Haaretz newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources close to the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations as making the remark following talks between the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station chief in Tel Aviv
and top Palestinian security officials last week.
</P>
<P>
The talks, reported for the first time Tuesday, were held with
an aim to help the Israelis and the Palestinians reach an
agreement on a CIA-brokered memorandum of understanding (MOU) on
security cooperation, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
The MOU, which dealt with a wide variety of security issues,
was drawn up last December by representatives of the CIA and the
Israeli and Palestinian security establishments.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, Israel acknowledges that it also has
terrorists and agrees to deal with them in the same way as it
demands that the Palestinians deal with theirs.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected it for
equating Israelis with the Palestinians as a potential source of
terror. Senior Israeli officials detailed in June its concerns
on incorporating new aspects to the MOU.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz quoted the unnamed sources as saying that the
Palestinians have rejected a draft agreement prepared by
Washington in early July because "it was dictated to them by the
U.S. without consultation."
</P>
<P>
But the sources said the Palestinians are now hopeful that
common ground would be found for an enhanced security cooperation
agreement if the issue of a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
One of the remaining issues regarding the redeployment is how
long the 3 percent of land to be designated as a Palestinian
nature reserve in the West Bank would exist under Israeli
restrictions, and when it would be transferred to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonoth, the largest circulated newspaper in Israel,
disclosed Monday for the first time that Israel has sent the
Palestinians an agreement defining the nature of the 3 percent
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Israel would maintain overriding
security responsibility in these areas which would be designated
as "Green Areas" or "Nature Reserves," and "there will be no
construction or inhabitation in these areas during the interim
period and until the permanent status agreement is reached."

DACCA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will dispatch a
reduced delegation to compete in the 16th Commonwealth Games in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, officials here said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 33-member Bangladesh delegation will leave here on

Originally, Bangladesh was schedueled to send an 84-member
delegation to compete in six sports of athletics, cricket, field
hockey, swimming, shooting and weightlifting, but had to cancel
other sports due to floods disaster.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangladesh still pinns its medal hopes in the
sharpshooters by recruiting German coaches for its 11
participants.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Stricken Northeast China Areas Face Threat of Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The basically stable situation
concerning epidemic control in flooded areas throughout northeast
China continuous to face mounting danger from a possible major
outbreak of epidemics, according to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
A ministry investigation team recently reported a 51.78 jump in
reported cases of infectious diseases in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province over the same period last year. The majority
of cases involved typhoid fever and dysentery.
</P>
<P>
Reports for neighboring Jilin Province show a 14.4 percent
decline in reported cases compared with the same period of 1997,
with only 82 cases of typhoid and 317 cases of hemorrhagic fever.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the high population density and poor
sanitary conditions in temporary enclaves of flood victims, as
well as other factors such as the arrival of cold weather in
northeast China, will increase possibilities for an outbreak of
infectious diseases or even epidemics in flood-ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
Floods have caused serious damage to a number of medical
facilities in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces. More than 1,100
Heilongjiang medical institutions have sustained damage, with
losses of facilities, medical supplies and equipment surpassing 74
million yuan (nine million US dollars). More than 100 medical
institutions in Jilin have sustained losses totalling 10 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Health note the most important
work at the moment centers on disinfecting and sanitizing
residential areas in order to prevent the spread of germs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said Tuesday that a proposed emergency summit meeting of the G-7
group of seven Western industrialized nations would offer little
help at the moment given the unsolved Russian government crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Bonn, Kohl said that he would support
such a summit provided that it could achieve concrete results.
</P>
<P>
"But now we even do not know who will be prime minister in
Moscow," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Western leaders were staying in close
contact with each other following the development in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The message to Moscow must be: Stay cool and do nothing to go
back to the past," Kohl said, adding that otherwise it would be
difficult for Western nations to offer moral support.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for an emergency G-7 summit meeting was made by
Japanese officials on Sunday but has not yet got any warm response
from other members.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi reportedly said Sunday that
he would favor a summit provided "we have a G-7 agreement on a

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Pledges to Continue Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin told his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton on Tuesday that his
country will stick to the course of reforms.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no retreat from what the reforms have
achieved," Yeltsin was quoted as saying in the first round of
talks with Clinton in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's press secretary, told the
Russian Public Television Station that the two leaders extended
their planned meeting in a narrow format to "cover the agenda in
a more dynamic manner."
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin replied in detail all Clinton's questions, and
evoked a positive reaction from Clinton, who stressed "absolute
commitment to principles of democracy, market economy and
expressed confidence that Russia will find the way out of the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also spoke of Washington's unconditional support to
Russia's course along that line and its readiness to consider
various forms of assistance, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
As widely expected, Clinton did not speak about any specific
forms of financial and economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president is scheduled to have more meetings with
Yeltsin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with other major political players of Russia
Wednesday, including speakers of both houses of parliament, Moscow
mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Krasnoyarsk region governor Alexander Lebed,
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, Our Home is Russia leader
Alexander Shokhin and Grigory Yavlinsky of Yabolo, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton came at a difficult time for Russia, which is
confronting a full-blown financial crisis and without a fully
functional government.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, on Monday
overwhelmingly rejected Yeltsin's nominee for premiership, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, in the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has renominated Chernomyrdin again, but Duma speaker
Gennady Seleznyov said the nomination will most likely be
rejected again in the second round of voting scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the Duma blocks the
premier's nomination three times, the president will have to
select a new nominee or dissolve the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
A political agreement aimed at averting such a scenario,
signed by representatives of the president, the government and
both houses of parliament, was wrecked at the last minute when
major opposition parties balked.
</P>
<P>
Despite rejection of his nomination on Monday, Chernomyrdin is
expected to submit a roster of the new government to Yeltsin later
today. Bosses of key ministries, such as defense, foreign affairs,
interior, will retain their posts.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was appointed acting prime minister August 24 when
Yeltsin abruptly fired the four-month-old cabinet of Sergei
Kiriyenko, after an effective devaluation of the ruble and a de
facto default on Russia's foreign debts that sent prices rocketing
and securities diving to record lows.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Security Agreement May be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have said a
satisfactory second Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank means a
chance for an enhanced security cooperation with Israel, the
Haaretz newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources close to the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations as making the remark following talks between the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station chief in Tel Aviv
and top Palestinian security officials last week.
</P>
<P>
The talks, reported for the first time Tuesday, were held with
an aim to help the Israelis and the Palestinians reach an
agreement on a CIA-brokered memorandum of understanding (MOU) on
security cooperation, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
The MOU, which dealt with a wide variety of security issues,
was drawn up last December by representatives of the CIA and the
Israeli and Palestinian security establishments.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, Israel acknowledges that it also has
terrorists and agrees to deal with them in the same way as it
demands that the Palestinians deal with theirs.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected it for
equating Israelis with the Palestinians as a potential source of
terror. Senior Israeli officials detailed in June its concerns
on incorporating new aspects to the MOU.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz quoted the unnamed sources as saying that the
Palestinians have rejected a draft agreement prepared by
Washington in early July because "it was dictated to them by the
U.S. without consultation."
</P>
<P>
But the sources said the Palestinians are now hopeful that
common ground would be found for an enhanced security cooperation
agreement if the issue of a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
One of the remaining issues regarding the redeployment is how
long the 3 percent of land to be designated as a Palestinian
nature reserve in the West Bank would exist under Israeli
restrictions, and when it would be transferred to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonoth, the largest circulated newspaper in Israel,
disclosed Monday for the first time that Israel has sent the
Palestinians an agreement defining the nature of the 3 percent
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Israel would maintain overriding
security responsibility in these areas which would be designated
as "Green Areas" or "Nature Reserves," and "there will be no
construction or inhabitation in these areas during the interim
period and until the permanent status agreement is reached."

<HEADLINE> Premier Urges Tree Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Zhu Rongji
today called for accelerated efforts to plant more trees to
improve environment.
</P>
<P>
The premier said torrential rains combined with abnormal
weather conditions have caused heavy flooding in both the southern
and northern part of the nation. However, according to Zhu, the
disaster has, at least in part, been due to rampant deforestation
which led to serious erosion and in turn silting which raised
water levels and blocked the normal flow in river channels.
</P>
<P>
"The Party and central government have attached great
importance to forestation and both water and soil
conservation. Unfortunately, implementation of related policies
has been far from satisfactory," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin recently quoted Engles as saying that
people should not be intoxicated with their triumphs over nature,
since nature takes revenge on human beings for each of their
success, which would in turn offest the success, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He cited numerous worldwide examples of the destruction of
forests for the expansion of farmland eventually yielding nothing
but barren land.
</P>
<P>
The State Council announced a 1997 decision to ban logging in
the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, with the ban
set for gradual implementation throughout northeast China.
</P>
<P>
China can supplement the reduced timber output by increasing
less expensive imports of timber products, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during his fact-finding tour of
flood-ravaged areas in northeast China. The remarks came during a
meeting with Ma Yongshun, a national model worker. Ma, a retired
model lumberjack, felled 36,000 trees prior to his retirement in
1982. He and his family have since won honors for planting 46,500
trees.
</P>
<P>
Zhu praised Ma for his contributions while urging people of the
entire nation to follow his example and plant more trees to ensure
the well-being of future generations.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Hospital
Authority (HA) endorsed its working planning for 1999 to 2002
after discussions during its board meeting here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the HA's planning are to "sustain quality
improvement and monitor service delivery" and "ensure its
accountability to the stakeholders" with an output and
outcome-based resource allocation.
</P>
<P>
It will focus its planning on further strengthening its core
basic services using the tools developed in recent years, such as
clinical audit, risk management, quality improvement with process
indicators in the delivery of care and evidenced-based clinical
practice.
</P>
<P>
The HA will also maintain close liaison with the government
policy bureaus on health care reforms and systems so as to ensure
the formulation of the appropriate corporate strategies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the members were updated on the progress of HA's
business support initiatives and discussed the way forward in
facilitating hospitals to implement changes in supporting services
to enhance quality of patient care.
</P>
<P>
Now, a total of 17 public hospitals have completed their
phasing-out program of ozone depleting substances. The current
schedule is for all HA hospitals to be free of identified sources
of ozone depleting substances by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Work has been undertaken in the past several years to improve
overall security management. Each hospital has now designated a
security officer or established a Security Steering Committee to
address security issues.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Non-Emergency Ambulance Transfer Service provides
 on average 1,600 patient-trips on a weekday. This workload
represents an increase of about 40 percent as compared to that of
1994.

Carlos Alberto Parreira has been sought by the South African

</P>
<P>
Beside the Brazil, the association also talked to English
managers Ron Atkinson and Howard Wilkinson to gauge their

Jordaan said Wilkinson, the former Leeds United manager and

Parreira coached Brazil to the 1994 World Cup title and but
became the first coach to be fired during the World Cup finals as
Saudi Arabia lost their first two games this summer.

<P>
After its early exit from the World Cup finals, South Africa
has published advertisements for the coaching position but had a

"We were forced to ask FIFA to help us with a list of suitable
names because of the dismal response," Jordaan said.

HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government said Tuesday that its recent
intervention into the stocks and futures markets is "to deter
manipulation in these markets by speculators who are attacking the
Hong Kong dollar at the same time."
</P>
<P>
"Our long-standing policy of non-intervention in the stocks and

</P>
<P>
Describing the S&AMP;P's decision as "unjustified," the statement

particular level."

<P>
"As a responsible government we must take all necessary steps
to protect the stability and integrity of our currency and
financial markets when they are under speculative attack. Our aim
is to ensure a level playing field for market practitioners and to

started on August 14, and, in the ten trading days till August 28,
boosted the Hang Seng Index by some 1,200 points or 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government said: "As the speculative attacks are still
ongoing, it is not possible for us to disclose the size of our
asset switch. Nevertheless, what we have acquired are all
good-quality assets which we will hold for the long term."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government noted, "S&AMP;P's estimates of
our deficit reaching three percent of our GDP, or about 40 billion
HK dollars (5.1 billion U.S. dollars), is way above our
estimates."
</P>
<P>
"In any case, our fiscal deficit this year is unlikely to have
a significant negative impact on the strong foreign currency
reserve position of Hong Kong. Our reserves stood at more than
eight times the Hong Kong dollar notes issued," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The government also stressed that Hong Kong banks, highly
capitalized and well managed, are in a strong position to weather
the slowdown of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Raises Price of Tap Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing began raising the
price of tap water by an average of 32.6 percent today in a bid to
arouse public awareness of the importance of saving water.
</P>
<P>
The price of water for daily use for local residents has
increased from 0.7 yuan to one yuan (12 U.S. cents) per cubic
meter, and the price of water for industrial, commercial, and
administrative units has been raised from one yuan to 1.3 yuan per
cubic meter. And water used by hotels now costs 2.4 yuan per cubic
meter, 0.4 yuan more than yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has long had a policy of keeping water prices low, and
this has resulted in a serious water shortage and poor
water-saving awareness on the part of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing Municipal Tap-water Company show
that Beijing residents used a total of 150.84 million cubic
meters water in 1992, and that by 1997 this figure hit 214.71
million cubic meters, up 42.34 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
With the increased cost of water processing, the Beijing
Municipal Tap-Water Company, the only water supplier for the
Chinese capital, has been in the red since 1989. The municipal
government contributed subsidies of 187 million yuan to make up
the loss last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents use only one-seventh of the average per
capita water use in China, and only one-twenty-fifth of the
world's per capita average use. Observers say the price increase
is the best way to ease the contradiction between water supply and
need in the city.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the increase in the price of water will not
have much effect on local residents. Concerned departments
estimate that it will cost only one more yuan per month for each
urban resident.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Security Agreement May be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have said a
satisfactory second Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank means a
chance for an enhanced security cooperation with Israel, the
Haaretz newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources close to the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations as making the remark following talks between the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station chief in Tel Aviv
and top Palestinian security officials last week.
</P>
<P>
The talks, reported for the first time Tuesday, were held with
an aim to help the Israelis and the Palestinians reach an
agreement on a CIA-brokered memorandum of understanding (MOU) on
security cooperation, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
The MOU, which dealt with a wide variety of security issues,
was drawn up last December by representatives of the CIA and the
Israeli and Palestinian security establishments.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, Israel acknowledges that it also has
terrorists and agrees to deal with them in the same way as it
demands that the Palestinians deal with theirs.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected it for
equating Israelis with the Palestinians as a potential source of
terror. Senior Israeli officials detailed in June its concerns
on incorporating new aspects to the MOU.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz quoted the unnamed sources as saying that the
Palestinians have rejected a draft agreement prepared by
Washington in early July because "it was dictated to them by the
U.S. without consultation."
</P>
<P>
But the sources said the Palestinians are now hopeful that
common ground would be found for an enhanced security cooperation
agreement if the issue of a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
One of the remaining issues regarding the redeployment is how
long the 3 percent of land to be designated as a Palestinian
nature reserve in the West Bank would exist under Israeli
restrictions, and when it would be transferred to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonoth, the largest circulated newspaper in Israel,
disclosed Monday for the first time that Israel has sent the
Palestinians an agreement defining the nature of the 3 percent
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Israel would maintain overriding
security responsibility in these areas which would be designated
as "Green Areas" or "Nature Reserves," and "there will be no
construction or inhabitation in these areas during the interim
period and until the permanent status agreement is reached."

<P>
BONN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany cherished its cash boost
to bid for the 2006 World Cup as Chancellor Helmut Kohl pledged
on Tuesday to financially back for efforts to bring stadiums up
to modern standards in former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said Berlin and Leipzig would get 100 million marks (57
million US dollars) each to help with renovation and rebuilding
projects for their stadiums.
</P>
<P>
"It was clear from the start that Berlin and Leipzig could not
apply to be World Cup venues without the help of the federal
government," the chancellor said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced the German Soccer Federation will present a
persuasive application to FIFA," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Stadium in Berlin and Leipzig's main stadium are
currently far from the standards of a modern venue and Berlin
authorities plan a complete overhaul of the Olympic stadium while
the Leipzig venue is likely to be totally rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
England, South Africa, Australia and Brazil have all announced
their intention to bid for the 2006 World Cup and FIFA will vote
for the venue in 2000.

<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao met here today with Mario Michel, first deputy leader of
the St. Lucian Labor Party (SLP) and deputy prime minister of
St. Lucia.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said the SLP is the oldest party in St. Lucia, and China
appreciates the foresight and sagacity that caused the SLP to cut
its so-called "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan, and forged
diplomatic ties with China after the SLP became the ruling party
of St. Lucia last year.
</P>
<P>
The SLP and the CPC formally set up friendly relations during
this visit, Hu noted, adding that he believes the friendly
exchanges between the two parties will certainly deepen mutual
understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two
countries and promote Sino-St. Lucian relations.
</P>
<P>
Hu also briefed the visitors on China's current anti-flood and
relief work.
</P>
<P>
Michel expressed sympathy for the serious floods now hitting
parts of China, and said he believes China will finally overcome
the difficulties brought on by the floods.
</P>
<P>
On relations between St. Lucia and China and the two
parties, Michel said St. Lucia-China relations have been
developing well even though the two nations forged diplomatic
ties only a year ago.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes both sides will continue to make efforts to
deepen the friendly relations between the two countries and the
two parties.

<HEADLINE> Civil Affairs Ministry Calls for Donations to Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs
has urged economically developed provinces and municipalities
which have escaped this year's ravaging floods to provide
emergency aid to flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Nonaffected areas are required to provide disaster relief
items, especially badly needed quilts and winter clothing, to
flood-ravaged areas, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called on Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, and
Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong provinces to collect cotton clothing
and quilts for areas along the Nen and Songhua rivers in
Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Said areas have already collected 16,135 pieces of clothing and
quilts, including over 8.3 million cotton items. The bulk of the
relief materials will be distributed in northeast China, with a
small portion earmarked for distribution in areas along the
Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Taliban Responsible for Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran warned the Afghan Taliban
militia Tuesday not to evade responsibility for the fate and
safety of the Iranian diplomats allegedly kidnaped by the group.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi made the warning
after the Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar denied Monday night
having information about the whereabouts of 11 captured Iranian
diplomats and a reporter of the official IRNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, one of Omar's close aides Mullah Hassan
Qalchei said in Dubai that the captured Iranians "are in good
health and kept in a prison near Qandahar in southern
Afghanistan," the IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Such contradictory and ambiguous remarks are not acceptable to
the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mohammadi said, Tehran holds the
Taliban responsible for the safety of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Such remarks also run counter to what Pakistani officials have
told Iranian authorities on behalf of the Taliban, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is widely believed in support of the Taliban, a
student militia, which seized the capital Kabul in 1996 and has
gained control of most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that prior to the capture of Mazari Sharif in
northern Afghanistan, where the Iranian diplomats were captured,
the Pakistani government has informed the Taliban of the presence
of the Iranian diplomats in Iran's consulate general.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials have also assured Iran of the safety of the
Iranian diplomats, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iran has called on the United Nations
and the International Committee of the Red Cross to dispatch a
fact-finding mission to Afghanistan to get information about the
whereabouts of the Iranian nationals.

ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian cyclist Francesco
Casagrande was banned for six months after two positive doping
tests, the Italian Cycling Federation said in Milan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Casagrande, 28, was caught of unreasonable amount of

The Italian who won the San Sebastian Classic and ranked fifth

due to natural causes.

"I took six or seven tests and they weren't always positive.
That means that my natural level of testosterone is variable," he

To justify his innocence, Casagrande was willing to abide the
call of UCI, the sport's world governing body, to undergo

<HEADLINE> Iran Kicks off Military Maneuvers Near Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) began its maneuvers near Iranian-Afghan border
Tuesday morning to warn against the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 70,000 soldiers participated in the war game, which
is being held in Iran's northern Khorasan province, some 50
kilometers away from the Afghan border, the official IRNA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, codenamed "Ashura-3," were held amid a spiraling
tension between Iran and the Taliban over the fate of missing
Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats were allegedly kidnaped by the Afghan
fundamentalist group from Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan on
August 8 when the militia took control of the city.
</P>
<P>
Mullah Hassan Qalcheie, a close aide of the Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammad Omar, admitted Monday the captivity of Iranian
diplomats in a prison near Qandahar.
</P>
<P>
But Omar himself denied knowing the whereabouts of the Iranian
diplomats later in the day.
</P>
<P>
At the kick-off ceremony, the IRGC Commander Yahya Rahim Safavi
said that Iran is a peace-seeking state and does not seek
aggression against any country.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Tehran will not tolerate mischievous acts
and disturbances on its borders by any country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope our friends have got the message and the enemies pay
heed to our advises," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim nation of Iran, armed with their Islamic might and
under the leadership of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
will repel any aggressions against the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander also stated that Iran's policy in the
Middle East, Central Asia and Caucasus is to seek strengthened
Islam, peace and reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Adams Blasts Hoddle's World Cup Blunders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Former England captain Tony
Adams has slammed England coach Glenn Hoddle for World Cup
mistakes, four days before England's opening European
championship qualifier against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In the opening extracts from his book "Addicted" which is
being serialised in The Sun newspaper, Adams accused Hoddle of
four big errors as England crashed out of France 98.
</P>
<P>
Adams said Hoddle was wrong to pick Alan Shearer as captain
ahead of him; he was wrong to humiliate David Beckham in front of
the players at training; he was wrong for treating the players as
kids in training and he was wrong to encourage Paul Gascoigne to
drink the night before dropping him from the final World Cup
squad.
</P>
<P>
It is an unprecedented attack by a senior England player on a
serving manager.
</P>
<P>
"I believe I should have been England skipper at the World
Cup," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
"Not only did I lead us during Euro 96 but after a decade as
England captain -- and three league championships -- I feel I
have proved myself and have the respect of my peers."
</P>
<P>
Adams said Hoddle had criticised Beckham while the team was
practising a free-kick routine, saying: "Obviously you are not
good enough to do that skill."
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal skipper said Hoddle's training sessions had been
too intense.
</P>
<P>
"I felt we were too regimented, treated like kids and expected
to do too much in training. It was too intense, a lot of the boys
were going berserk."
</P>
<P>
He also felt Hoddle was wrong to encourage the players,
including Gascoigne to drink the night before announcing his
final squad.
</P>
<P>
"Gazza was an ill man and Glenn did not properly understand
the illness of addiction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams balances his criticism by praising Hoddle as an
"excellent technical coach" who had revealed a "human caring
side" after the second round defeat to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"He redeemed himself in many ways and showed himself a
promising international coach," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams, a recovering alcoholic, also graphically describes his
own drinking, saying he would drink 20 pints of Guinness in a
session followed by two bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
The book is being serialised in The Sun this week, the tabloid
newspaper which ran extracts from Hoddle's controversial World
Cup diary.

<HEADLINE> Final Verdict In Taiwan Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal Higher
People's Court today made the decision to uphold the original
judgement on four Taiwanese charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
On August 12, 1998, the Beijing Municipal No.1 Intermediate
People's Court made a ruling of first instance in the case of
four Taiwanese who were found to be working for the Taiwan
Military Intelligence Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Kou Jianming was sentenced to four years imprisonment and
deprived of political rights for two years. The other three --
Chen Shaoyu, Han Yueting and Zhou Changming -- were also
identified as having engaged in the crime of espionage, but were
exempted from criminal punishment.
</P>
<P>
Kou, Han and Zhou disagreed with the ruling and appealed to the
Municipal Higher People's Court, which then formed a collegiate
court to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the case, the collegiate court held that the
four Taiwanese were entrusted by the Taiwan intelligence
organization to collect political, economic and military
information in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Their espionage activities all seriously endangered China's
state security and they should be punished in accordance with law,
said the collegiate court.
</P>
<P>
It also said the original judgement was correct and in
accordance with law and should be upheld.

 reaction to Wall Street's 510-point overnight plunge.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was also discouraged by Malaysia's
statement that the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) won't
recognize trades on CLOB International -- Singapore's
over-the-counter market for mainly Malaysian equities.
</P>
<P>
To discourage the trading of local stocks offshore, the KLSE
Monday announced that all dealings in Malaysian shares must be
done through the KLSE or by an exchange recognized by the KLSE.
But the CLOB which was set up in 1990 was excluded from its
recognition.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE also threatened punitive actions against those
Malaysian stockbroking firms which engage in indirect off-market
transactions and this rattled investors on market.
</P>
<P>
Selling further accelerated on Singapore market following a
speech by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in which he
said that central bank currency trading measures rendered the
Malaysia ringgit "meaningless" outside Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China Youth Development
Foundation, which has worked for nine years to help school
dropouts, today received nine million HK dollars from two Hong
Kong TV corporations, which will be used to help students in the
flooded areas continue their studies.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese schools begin the new semester today.
</P>
<P>
Since early this summer, a dozen provinces in the Yangtze River
Basin and along northeast China's Nenjiang and Songhua River
Basins have suffered the worst flooding in decades.
</P>
<P>
Schools in the flood-stricken areas were seriously
damaged. Latest statistics show that in the 10 provinces most
severely hit by the floods, such as Hunan Province, nearly 45,000
schools have been ravaged and about 8.5 million students are
without normal school facilities.
</P>
<P>
About three million square meters of schoolhouses collapsed,
and another 7.47 million square meters were declared unsafe after
the flooding.
</P>
<P>
The direct losses to all of these schools are estimated at some
7.6 billion RMB yuan (nearly one billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM: Ringgit to Be Pegged at Fixed Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ringgit will
be pegged by Bank Negara (State Bank) to a fixed rate very soon,
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With a fixed rate, people will know the real value of the
ringgit and "once we regain control of our exchange rate, we can
lower our interest rates and nobody else control our interest
rates," Mahathir said during a special interview on the country's
economic situation over radio and television which was telecast
live.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said a fixed ringgit might affect transaction costs
but with fixed rates, there was no need to hedge while the
transaction cost will not be subject to devaluation or revaluation
if paid at a later date, and also it would enable interest rates
to be lowered.
</P>
<P>
But the rate will be decided by market forces for the time
being, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that these are part of the "shocking" measures he
had mentioned before.
</P>
<P>
He said that the work of speculators was threatening to
impoverish the nation and that more measures would be announced
such as those amending laws related to stock market.
</P>
<P>
On foreign exchange control measures announced by Bank Negara
earlier Tuesday to curb speculation in the ringgit, Mahathir said
the capital controls would also enable the authorities to lower
interest rates, which in turn would make loans cheaper and
generate greater business activity.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit will no longer be a legal tender or have value
outside the country, Mahathir said, adding "However, as we know
that there is ringgit outside Malaysia, we will allow such ringgit
to be repatriated for a period of one month from today."
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia will continue to encourage genuine long
term investors while those already here would be able to continue
repatriating their profits.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investors wanting to set up production
facilities will be encouraged to come here as with a fixed
exchange rate they have a very good chance of making profits with
a minimal of costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, stock market speculators who destroy
companies will be discouraged as asset stripping is not something
we want. Both locals and foreigners who buy shares will have to
hold them for one year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the measures to control foreign exchange
announced by Bank Negara will continue until Malaysia is sure that
there are profound and fundamental changes in the international
financial systems.
</P>
<P>
The measures announced Tuesday were decisions made by the
government and not the central bank, he said, adding the measures
could be considered as a last resort and can be permanent.
</P>
<P>
"What we have done is to freeze ringgit in external accounts,
the ringgit is no longer legal tender overseas but is only legal
domestically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, Mahathir chaired a special Cabinet meeting
which, according to Malaysia's national news agency, discussed
measures to tackle the economic downturn faced by the country.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Ruling Party Wins Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National
Election Committee (NEC) published on Tuesday the final official
results of July 26 Assembly election after the Constitutional
Council finished its hearing on poll complaints Monday.
</P>
<P>
The final official results and the allocation of seats was
announced Tuesday evening on TVK, the national television.
</P>
<P>
The NEC announced that ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
has won the election with more than 2.03 million votes, while
Funcinpec of Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) of Sam
Rainsy gained about 1.55 million and 700,000 votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
The result was just the same as the preliminary results
announced by NEC on August 4.
</P>
<P>
In the first Cambodian-organized election in decades, Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen's CPP cashed in with 64 seats, an absolute
majority in the 122-seat National Assembly, based on 41.4 percent
of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec netted 43 seats (31.7 percent) and the SRP 15 seats
(14.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
The remaining 36 parties got more than 12 percent of the vote,
but no seats under a seat allocaton formula verified by NEC.
</P>
<P>
About 4.9 million Cambodians voted out of the nearly 5.4
million registered, according to the NEC figures.
</P>
<P>
The NEC will provide copies of the official results to the CPP,
Funcinpec and the SRP. The results will also be sent to the
Constitutional Council and to King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The NEC said 48 hours will be given to permit political parties
to reconsider and change their list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
With a victory in the July 26 election, the ruling CPP has
secured enough seats in parliament to head the next government,
and incumbent co-premier Hun Sen, fielded by the CPP as the only
candidate for the premiership, will become Cambodia's next prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
But with the continuing rejection and protest against the
election result by Funcinpec Party and the SRP, the CPP is
unlikely to form a government alone because it has not gained two
thirds of 122 seats or 82 seats to form the government without a
coalition partner.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Nearly 1 U.S. Cent Firmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished nearly one U.S. cent higher Tuesday as a
better-than-expected performance on the Australian Stock Exchange
pushed it to a sharply stronger close.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 57.65 U.S. cents,
from 56.73 U.S. cents previously.
</P>
<P>
After an initial sell-off on the back of a huge Wall Street
fall, Australian shares recovered through the day to close less
than one percent lower.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished down 22.5 points at 2458.2,
more than 71 points above its early low of 2386.7 on a futures led
recovery.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a little bit of a recovery in all of the
markets," said Craig Busch, head of foreign exchange of St George
Bank.
</P>
<P>
On the day the Australian dollar ranged between 56.54 U.S.
cents and the late afternoon high of 57.69 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Busch said one reason behind the late afternoon volatility was
strong buying evident from U.S. funds.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said strength in the gold price had also offered
support to the Australian dollar. Gold closed in Sydney at 277.90
U.S. dollars an ounce, up from 275.55 U.S. dollars in New York
overnight Monday and higher from 275.05 U.S. dollars here locally
Monday.
</P>
<P>
the local currency was buying 80.20 Japanese yen from 80.35 yen
and 1.0103 German marks from 0.9998 marks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets with Former Japanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Amidst drastic changes in the
post-Cold War world, China and Japan should make efforts to bring
a long-term, stable and friendly relationship into the next
century in light of the principles set forth in the Sino-Japanese
Joint Declaration and Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty,
said Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian made this remark while meeting with former Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian praised Kaifu as a farsighted Japanese statesman and an
old friend of China. He welcomed Kaifu to again visit China on the
20th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Peace and
Friendship Treaty. "The treaty is a reflection of the common
aspirations and determination of the people of both countries for
everlasting friendship in generations to come," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Qian also briefed the guests on the impact the lingering East
Asia crisis was having on China's economy, and the
counter-measures adopted by the Chinese government. "The operation
of the Chinese economy this year is generally good," he told the
guests.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said he highly values the role played by China, an
influential country in world affairs. "No one should ignore it,"
he told Qian.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also had an exchange of views on the
international situation.

<HEADLINE> Russian Securities Market Idle Amid Political Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Transactions in the Russian
stock market tapered to almost zero Tuesday as traders try to come
to terms with the country's political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
No deals were made on the Russian Trading System early Tuesday
as President Boris Yeltsin resubmitted his nomination of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, said the nomination would be shot down in the
second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Quotations for leading stocks shed 15 percent to 30 percent in
the first 20 minutes, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax Composite Index in rubles, however, actually
rose by 12.55 percent to 23.6 by 11:25 local time (07:25 GMT), as
exchange rate for the ruble against foreign currencies further
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax Composite Index in dollars fell by 4.68
percent to 15.07.
</P>
<P>
Market operators said that despite some half-hearted attempts
to adjust quotations, most traders were waiting for events to
unfold.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin's
candidacy Monday night. He won only 94 votes for the presidential
motion while 251 deputies voted against him. The nominee needs 226
votes in the 450-seat Duma to win approval.
</P>
<P>
Plunges in world stock markets, partly a result of Russia's
financial crisis, further dampened the Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
By 11:20 local time (07:20 GMT), the RTS quoted Unified Energy
Systems of Russia at 0.022/0.028 dollars, down 30 percent from
Monday's close. Stocks of Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company,
fell by 11.1 percent to 3.35/3.65 dollars. Mosenergo declined by
15 percent to 0.013/0.0135 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom shares, which shot up dramatically last week following
the return of Chernomyrdin, who is former boss of Gas Monopoly-
Gazprom, also slid Tuesday because of the State Duma's continued
blocking of his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom shed 10.3 percent to the bottom line of its trading
band of 0.91 rubles in the first few minutes on the Moscow Stock
Exchange. A total of 786,000 shares were traded by noon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, regular trading in the Moscow
Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX) remained suspended Tuesday,
and authorities said it would not resume until after Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the MICEX will continue to deal in U.S. dollars in the
electronic lot trading regime.
</P>
<P>
The MICEX's Council was planning to adopt an electronic system
for setting exchange rates used by world exchanges, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Electronic fixing is seen as more flexible in determining the
dollar's exchange rate without the participation of the Central
Bank, which until recently has to react to commercial banks' needs
in case of sharp imbalance between demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the new system, the MICEX fixing will be
calculated on the basis of the average rate of the deals concluded
by banks in a trading session in approximately 5-10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
After MICEX sets the exchange rate, banks will be allowed to
make additional transactions at the announced exchange rate.

MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said on Tuesday that he will try to have the nomination of acting
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's nomination as premier
approved within this week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a visit to a Moscow middle school, Yeltsin said
that his first try failed on Monday and he would insist on
nominating Chernomyrdin for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hopes the State Duma would confirm Chernomyrdin
in office as soon as possible as delay costs the country and the
people heavily each day.

<P>
The Russian president said that he would not dissolve the State
Duma and make compromise if the State Duma "behaves well."

<HEADLINE> Australia Calls on Japan to Agree to Tuna Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia stepped up its
effort Tuesday for new talks with Japan in a bid to resolve the
long-running tuna dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Resources Minister Warwick Parer said
Australia had told Japan in a diplomatic note that it believed
Japan's experimental fishing program breached the international
law.
</P>
<P>
The program, which ended Monday, involved Japan catching an
extra 1,400 tons of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), a highly
migratory fish that spawns in the Indian Ocean, over its previous
6,065 ton quota.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Japan and New Zealand are the founding members of
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, an
organization that sets a total allowable catch and national
allocations for its member countries.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials argue the program will help assess tuna
stocks.
</P>
<P>
But in a strongly worded statement, Parer said Japan only had
itself to blame if critics accused it of using the experiment as a
vehicle for a de facto quota increase.
</P>
<P>
Australia believed the program was inconsistent under customary
international law, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea and the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin
Tuna.
</P>
<P>
And Japan appeared intent on repeating the program next year
and possibly beyond.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to resolve the dispute are therefore directed at
ensuring this kind of program is not repeated and that appropriate
remedial action is taken with respect to the impact of this year's
fishing," Parer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"As a first step we are seeking Japan's agreement to
negotiations (under the SBT Convention), aimed at resolving the
dispute within 30 days - given the importance of this matter, we
urge Japan to join us at the negotiating table as a matter of
urgency."
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Japan and Australia has already seen
Australia ban Japanese tuna boats earlier this year from fishing
in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and Australian ports,
except in emergencies.

<HEADLINE> ACFTU President Meets Singaporean Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, president of
All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), said today that
China values its friendly and cooperative ties with Singapore and
China is satisfied with the fruitful cooperation in various fields
between the two countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
made the remarks during a meeting here this afternoon with a
delegation led by Lim Boon Heng, general secretary of the National
Trade Union Congress of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Wei said it is imperative for China and Singapore to reinforce
their relations in every area, especially in economy and trade,
under the current international situation. China is ready to forge
a even closer relationship with Singapore oriented towards the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Wei briefed the Singaporean visitors on China's economic
situation and its ongoing flood fighting campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said that the heroic spirit demonstrated by the Chinese army
and citizens in controlling the flood shows the cohesion of the
Chinese nation when confronted with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Wei also voiced his thanks for the donation from the
Singaporean visitors to the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the different ideology and social systems
between China and Singapore have never prevented the exchange and
cooperation between the trade unions of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU hopes to further the ties with its singaporean
counterpart, Wei noted, adding that this would not only promote
the mutual understanding between the two peoples, but also serve
the healthy development of the collaboration between the trade
unions of the Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Lim expressed his solicitude to China's flood-hit regions and
said that although the donation from delegation is not much, it
shows the friendship of the Singaporean people towards their
Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the trade unions of the two countries
would strengthen their contacts and cooperation to contribute to
the mutual understanding of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The host and guests also exchanged views on the financial
crisis in Asia and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here Monday at the invitation of the
ACFTU.

LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Attempts to recover the bodies
of the 13 Nigerian football players and their coach were still
going on by Tuesday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fourteen people were drowned when the boat they were
traveling in capsized last Sunday in south Nigeria's Delta State.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at about 8:00 p.m. when the players and
coach of the Ronaldo Football Club were returning from a friendly
match at Steel Town, Aladja in the Delta State, in which they
won, media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eight players swam to safety and were saved.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the boat did not go far from the bank when
the driver demanded an increased fare from 10 to 20 Naira (0.12
to 0.24 U.S. Dollars), citing fuel shortage as the reason.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the players were angered by the move and
argued with the driver, when the latter tried to reverse the boat

<HEADLINE> Merger, Low Prices Shake Kenyan Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's oil sector is bracing
for major changes following moves by some of the key players to
improve efficiency, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Among these key players are Caltex with its announcement of
major staff and structural changes and BP following its merger
abroad with American oil giant Amoco in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The moves by the three large oil companies come in the wake of
two big events in the petroleum industry globally -- the economic
crisis in Asia and the subsequent decline in the demand for oil,
the local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The low demand has depressed world oil prices now at their
lowest in a decade, according to Tuesday's Daily Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shell/BP Kenya Limited, which manages the
operations of the two brands, was forced to deny press reports
that BP would divest from Kenya following the merger with Amoco.
</P>
<P>
But the report highlighted concerns in the local market that
changes overseas may have negative impact on Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The BP-Amoco merger early last month meant a slash of 6,000
staff from the total 100,000 worldwide. Fears are high that this
may happen in Kenya where BP has invested.
</P>
<P>
Caltex announced in July that it would reduce staff and change
its trade patterns in order to survive with the bottom line being
cost-cutting. The move was said to be a response to increased
competition and the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The new changes to its global operations are to be effected by
September 15 and begin with staff changes in Kenya, including the
scrapping of the managing director's position previously held by
Robert Hakim, who was re-deployed overseas.
</P>
<P>
Caltex said in a statement that the position would not be
filled and would cease to exist in the company's new structure.
It is expected some other positions may also be phased out
gradually.
</P>
<P>
In July, oil prices fell to 12 Dollars a barrel, representing
a six-Dollar drop since 1997 and have now registered the lowest
in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of oil held in stock and in transit are blocking
an immediate recovery in world oil prices, experts indicate.
</P>
<P>
They agree that the recovery of oil prices now is more
unlikely after the recent damage to the Russian economy prompted
by the devaluation of the Rouble.
</P>
<P>
The merger by BP and Amoco to create BP Amoco, with BP
controlling 60 percent, has been described as the largest
industrial merger ever, creating the third largest oil company in
the world.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, the merger is expected to strengthen BP's presence
now that it has greater financial muscle. Experts said this may
see it bolster its position as the Kenya market leader.
</P>
<P>
Other oil companies may be forced to go to the drawing board
to re-define their strategies.
</P>
<P>
Already the industry is involved in what has emerged as a
cut-throat competition, evidenced in the recent tender award by
Kenya Power and Lighting Cooperation (KPLC) to Mobil Oil to
supply the Westmont Power barge in Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Shell, Kenol, Total and Caltex all complained in letters to
KPLC that the tender for the supply of 15,000 tons of light fuel
to the barge had been done without an open tender system.
</P>
<P>
They claimed the tender favored Mobil, a recent re-entrant
into the Kenyan market having pulled out 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the recent global changes in the oil sector and a
crowded competition in Kenya mean some of the new licensed oil
companies may have a hard time making inroads into the market.
</P>
<P>
The recent heavy advertizing by Engen of South Africa and the
launch of lubricants into the oil scene, including plans to begin
petrol station outlets by next year are just part of the plans by
new entrants.
</P>
<P>
The National Oil Corporation has opted to enter into the
retail business by putting up petrol stations in the key towns.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan oil market is currently dominated by BP-Shell with
nearly 27 percent, Caltex about 25 percent, Total 16 percent,
recent entrant Mobil at 15 percent while Kenol and Kobil share 14
percent according to estimates by industry experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and France are to start in
a few days extensive diplomatic efforts to draw up the final
formula for their jointly-proposed international conference to
salvage the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to France Ali Maher, in an interview with
Egypt's Middle East News Agency Tuesday, said a ten-member
committee comprising Egyptian and French experts will meet early
this month in Paris to draw up a joint working paper on the final
arrangement for the proposed conference.

The agenda, the participating countries, the date and venue of
the conference will be included in the paper.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his French counterpart Hubert
Vedrine will look into the relevant details on the fringe of the
meetings of the United Nations Assembly meetings in New York this
month, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Maher disclosed that intensive contacts are being held with the
U.S. administration on this matter. Moussa, Vedrine and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright contacted each other by
phone several days ago on how to make the conference successful.

The idea of the international peace conference was conceived
when Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac in Paris in May.
</P>
<P>
Peace process between the Palestinians and Israelis has been
stalled for 17 months, while Israel's negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon have been derailed since 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The first half of 1998
witnessed a decrease in Cyprus' trade deficit by 1.2 percent
compared to that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Tuesday by the Statistics and
Research Department, imports totaled 938.3 million Cyprus pounds
(1,876.6 million U.S. dollars) in the period January-June 1998
compared with 938.6 million pounds (1,877.2 million dollars) in
the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Total exports were 315.6 million pounds (631 million dollars)
compared to 308.5 million pounds (617 million dollars) in
January-June 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade deficit totaled 622.7 million pounds
(about 1,245.4 million dollars), 7.4 million pounds (14.8 million
dollars) less than that in the first half of 1997.
</P>

BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese woman was wounded in
south Lebanon on Tuesday in an Israeli shelling, the Orient radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Fatamah Hajazi, 45, was wounded by the shrapnel of Israeli
shells which landed near her home at the Mashgara village in the
western sector of the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The electricity system in the village was also damaged by the
attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
This has raised to 82 the number of Lebanese civilians wounded
in south Lebanon so far this year. Some 15 civilians were killed
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, tit-for-tat conflicts between Lebanese resistance
movement spearheaded by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and Israeli occupation forces have never stopped.

LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, Niger and Cameroun
have decided to deploy more soldiers and policemen along their
borders to flush out armed robbers and rebels operating in border
areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Builds Railway Linking Hainan Island with Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China is now constructing its
first cross-strait railroad that will connect Hainan Island with
the mainland, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Guangdong-Hainan Railway is
scheduled to be finished in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 524.6-kilometer railway will include Zhanjiang-Hai'an
Railway in Guangdong Province, ferries from Hai'an to Haikou,
capital of Hainan Province, and the railway which rounds the
western part of Hainan from Haikou to Sanya. It will handle 30
million tons annually when completed.
</P>
<P>
The ferries will be able to withstand winds up to fresh gale.
When completed, the 4.5 billion yuan railway project will connect
with the rest of the country's railway network, thus strengthening
the relationship between the island province and the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
It will also advance Hainan's development and provide another
market link for rich marine resources to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the founding of Hainan
Province, also the country's fifth special economic zone after
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Huge costs have delayed the project, said an official with the
Ministry of Railways. The project now has financial support from
the Ministry of Railways, and the governments of Guangdong and
Hainan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The complexity of the project and the engineering challenge of
getting tracks across the Qiongzhou Strait also hinders the
construction, said the official, who didn't rule out the
possibility of building tunnels across the nearly 25-km strait to
connect the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
But the construction of undersea tunnels would take longer time
and be more expensive than the ferry system now proposed, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the cross-strait railway is the
ninth railway project begun in China this year. The country
planned ten major railway projects this year. The final one is a
trunk railway from Northeast China's Heilongjiang to East China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction on this year's last railway project, with a length
of 2,000 km, will start this month or October. It will take four
years to complete.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Boost Labor Exporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's first state-owned
service for labor exporting will begin operation later this year
to help lower the country's soaring unemployment and increase its
foreign currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Professional Placement Company (JPPC) will help
Jordanians find jobs in foreign countries, especially in the Gulf
states, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"One of our biggest assets is producing Jordanians with high
academic and professional standards. We will organize and market
Jordanians abroad so they can benefit themselves and their country
by sending remittance back home," said Samer Majali, who
represented the government in setting up the JPPC.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanians working abroad used to remit billions of
U.S. dollars back home during the 1980s, but the boom cooled down
after the 1991 Gulf War as most of the Jordanian workers were
expelled due to Jordan's support for Iraq, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf War was set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper quoted some economists as saying that such
a plan by the JPCC is a feasible way to help the government tackle
the soaring unemployment rate, whose official figure is 15 percent
and independent figure 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with a population of 4.6 million, has about 300,000
citizens working abroad, receiving an average remittance of
2.1 billion dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Block U.S. Persian Radio Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran has vowed to do all it can
to block a U.S. Persian radio service yet to be launched, the
Tehran Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister (Kamal Kharrazi) issued instruction to
Iranian diplomats to do all to block the plan that is against
international law and norm," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmud
Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tehran will closely follow the plan of the Radio
Free Iran and its possible broadcast material, and will try every
means to stop the anti-Iranian move.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congress approved in April to allocate 2.5 million
U.S. dollars to launch the Radio Free Iran, which is scheduled to
start broadcasting in September.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the U.S. move is a "candid interference in
Iran's internal affairs and is in no way acceptable."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also refuted a U.S. court rule on August 8, which
said that Iran must pay 65 million dollars in damages to three
former hostages held by pro-Iranian group in Lebanon in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"How can one judge of a country issue a verdict against a
sovereign, foreign government?" he asked, adding that the ruling
was in fact a continuation of an anti-Iranian move "that is doomed
to failure."

Aftermath of the Financial Meltdown", according to its organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 top executives and professionals from the oil

industries.
</P>
<P>
The participants are also expected to debate some key issues
which post great challenges to the industry under the existing
business environment characteristic of intensifying competition.
</P>
<P>
The main topics on agenda include companies restructuring,
business opportunities, strategies and infrastructure needed to
improve profitability.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Trade and Industry of Singapore Lee Yock Suan will

<HEADLINE> Eighth Yangtze Flood Peak to Sustain High Water Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The eighth Yangtze River flood
crest, which is passing central China's Hubei Province, is
expected to sustain high water levels on the middle and lower
reaches of the river for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The peak, which ranked fourth among the eight crests this
summer, passed Shashi at 2 p.m. Monday, raising the water level to
44.41 meters, or 0.81 meters below this summer's highest. The peak
was accompanied with a flow rate of 45,800 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
The upriver Gezhouba Hydropower Project and some other
reservoirs helped reduce the flow rate by 2,700 cubic meters per
second to greatly relieve the intense pressure on waterlogged
levees in downstream areas, said Jin Xingping, deputy chief
engineer of the Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, the new crest will slow down the receding floodwaters
on the middle reaches, making it more difficult for downstream
areas to protect already flood-saturated embankments.

<HEADLINE> Competition Picks up in Kenya's Milk Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Competition in Kenya's dairy
industry is picking up following the entry of new players to
challenge the Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC) in the
liberalized market.
</P>
<P>
Records at the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB) show that the
regulatory body has registered more than 60 private milk
processing companies since the liberalization of the milk
industry five years ago.
</P>
<P>
There are also more than 300 registered milk bars across this
east African country, handling an average of 5,000 liters on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
KCC monopolized Kenya's milk market before its liberalization.
</P>
<P>
By now the amount of milk delivered to KCC had dropped by
about 40 percent to 600,000 liters daily from a peak of one
million liters at times. Sometimes it has gone down to 200,000
liters, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The KDB records indicate that some 33 licensed milk processing
companies are currently handling about 550,200 liters of milk
daily, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The leading private milk processing and packaging firms are
Brookeside Dairy, Premier Dairy, Meru Cooperative Dairy and Spin
Knit.
</P>
<P>
Most of them process nearly all the milk products including
pasteur milk, fermented milk, condenselk, cream, yogurt,
mala, cheese and butter.
</P>
<P>
The report said farmers favor the private companies and
hawkers as alternatives to KCC since they pay promptly for milk
delivered.
</P>
<P>
The low price of raw milk offered by KCC is said to be one of
the main reasons that have forced most farmers that earlier
supplied KCC with milk to divert to private dealers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers receive 14 to 15 Shillings (0.23 to 0.25 U.S. Dollar)
for a liter of milk delivered to KCC while the consumer pays 30
Shillings for the same amount of processed milk. The private
firms are said to be offering up to 18 Shillings per liter.
</P>
<P>
In response, KCC Managing Director J. P. Nyaberi recently
announced that the company was planning to restructure its
operations in order to fit in a liberalized economy.
</P>
<P>
Nyaberi said the restructuring would focus on down-sizing and
cost-reduction and increase the company's efficiency and enable
it to consolidate what remains of the milk market.
</P>
<P>
One of the key strategies to be implemented by the company is
the merging of some factories to avoid duplication of efforts and
ensure effective utilization of available resources.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company will close down seven of its 11
factories and 13 of its 26 depots, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> China's Petroleum, Chemicals Output Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China reported 22.8 billion
yuan (about 2.7 billion U.S. dollars) worth of petroleum and
chemicals output in July, up 2.9 percent from the same month last
year, according to figures released by the State Petroleum and
Chemical Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
This growth rate is 1.9 percentage points lower than that for
June, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The combined output value of the petroleum and chemical
industry for the January-July period totaled 167.05 billion yuan,
up 3.2 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that the output-to-sales ratio
for petroleum and chemical products stood at 98.1 percent in July,
up 0.3 percent from June, and up 1.8 percent from July, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Production of nine of the 16 major petroleum and chemical
products, including phosphorus, fertilizer, sulphuric acid, nitric
acid, soda ash, pesticides and wheel, increased in the
January-July period.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also said that China produced 2.25 million tons of
fertilizer in July, with total output for the first seven months
reaching 15.52 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China produced 38,000 tons of pesticide in July, and a total
of 249,000 tons since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
A bureau official said the petroleum and chemical industry in
central China's Hubei suffered 68.57 million yuan in direct
economic losses due to severe flooding, which has forced 28
enterprises to suspend production.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hostages Are Alive in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has stated that the Iranian hostages
taken by the Afghan Taliban militia are alive and Tehran will
make efforts to bring them back safe.
</P>
<P>
In an interview carried on local daily Tehran Times Tuesday,
Mohammadi rejected the report of some Pakistani newspapers that
the Iranian hostages are dead.
</P>
<P>
"Our people in Afghanistan are alive," he said, "we are
exploring all avenues for their safety and return to their homes."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mullah Hassan Qalcheie, a close aide of the
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar told the Iranian official
news agency IRNA that the 11 Iranian diplomats and an IRNA
reporter are "safely" held in a prison near Qandahar, the
Taliban's headquarters in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Qalcheie said that the Taliban administration will release the
Iranian hostages as a goodwill gesture to improve its relations
with Iran, which refuses to recognize the Taliban rule over
Afghanistan and supports the ousted government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran stated that the Taliban has kidnaped 11 Iranian
diplomats, an IRNA reporter and 35 truck drivers on August 8 when
the Afghan fundamentalist group seized Mazari Sharif, Rabbani's
main stronghold in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has asked the Taliban to free the Iranian nationals as
soon as possible, threatening that it reserves the right to
"resort to any means" to release the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps announced to launch a
grand maneuver involving 70,000 troops on Iran's northeastern
border with Afghanistan this week.
</P>
<P>
In a response, the Taliban on Monday warned Iran to limit the
maneuver inside Iranian border and not to pose any threat to
Afghanistan's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the flames of war will cover Iran and its rulers
will suffer from its grave consequences," a Taliban "Foreign
Ministry" statement said.

URUMQI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 businesspeople from
32 countries and regions are attending a trade fair which opened
in this capital city of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region today.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day Seventh Urumqi Economic and Trade Fair has attracted
over 4,000 large and medium-sized Chinese enterprises, and
Xinjiang -- the host -- is offering over 90 projects to
overseas investors, and over 110 projects to domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
As restructuring of state-owned enterprises reaches a crucial
stage in China, the trading of property rights has become a new
feature at this year's Urumqi fair, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Zhou, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Fair, as
one of the major regional trade fairs in China, the current event
has already become an important show-window and a bridge linking
China with the world, especially the countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States and other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"The fair is of special significance since it is held amid the
Asian financial crisis and economic volatility in Russia,"
the vice chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The previous six fairs had combined transactions of 9.144
billion U.S. dollars from overseas investors, and 25.39 billion
yuan (3.596 billion U.S. dollars) from domestic investors.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin-Clinton Summit to Center on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia and
the United States met in the Kremlin Tuesday in a summit that is
expected to center on Russia's economic crisis and political
stand-off.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived here earlier Tuesday, laid a wreath at
the Unknown Soldier's Tomb in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, in their first full-scale summit since March
1997, will discuss primarily the economic situation in Russia,
Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton is keen to listen to Yeltsin's judgment of the
financial crisis and of ways to tackle the financial and economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Clinton came at a difficult time for Russia, which is
confronting a full-blown financial crisis while the country is
without a fully functional government.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, on Monday
overwhelmingly rejected Yeltsin's nominee for premier, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, in the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has renominated Chernomyrdin, but Duma speaker Gennady
Seleznyov said the nomination will most likely be rejected again
in the second round of voting scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the Duma blocks the
premier's nomination three times, the president will have to
produce a new nominee or dissolve the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
A political agreement aimed at averting such a scenario,
signed by representatives of the president, the interim
government and both houses of parliament, was wrecked at the last
minute when major opposition parties balked.
</P>
<P>
Despite rejection of his nomination on Monday, Chernomyrdin is
expected to submit a roster of the new government to Yeltsin later
in the day. Ministers of the key ministries, such as defense,
foreign affairs, interior, will retain their posts.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was appointed interim prime minister on August 24
when Yeltsin abruptly fired the four-month-old cabinet of Sergei
Kiriyenko, after an effective devaluation of the ruble and a de
facto default on Russia's foreign debts that sent prices rocketing
and securities diving to record lows.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is not expected to pledge any new financial assistance
this time around, although he would reiterated Washington's
support for Russia's economic reforms and democracy, observers
say.

<HEADLINE> NZ Wine Exports Nudge Target Set for Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Annual New Zealand wine
exports have almost reached their projected value for the year
2000 already.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of the year, wine exports would exceed 100
million N.Z. dollars (about 50 million U.S. dollars), two years in
advance of the projected date, the New Zealand Press Association
(NZPA) Tuesday quoted the New Zealand Wine Institute chairman Ross
Spence as saying.
</P>
<P>
A variety of factors has resulted in compound growth rates of
more than 19 percent value and 13 percent in volume, he said.
Influences included expansion of the vineyard area and number of
winemakers, and increased international demand for New Zealand
wines.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent annual report, the vineyard area in New
Zealand has increased to 8,716 hectares, a rise of more than 40
percent since 1993, with further growth expected in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The past year has seen a continued increase in the number of
winemakers, from 262 a year ago to current 293.
</P>
<P>
In the year, New Zealand has harvested a record vintage of
78,300 tons marked by high sugar levels and excellent fruit
balance, and the country also has seen a record total sales of
wine amounting to 53.8 million liters.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has become a net exporter of wine for the first
time, with exports reaching 97.6 million N.Z. dollars (about 48.8
Million U.S. dollars) a year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also spoke of international challenges including increased
competition from Australia, the United States and Chile.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China is confident of
realizing the 8 percent GDP growth target despite the lingering
Asian financial crisis and flooding in summer, said Zhu Bangzao,
spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, at the routine press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the measures adopted by the Chinese government early
this year, such as expanding domestic demand, increasing
investment in infrastructures, exploring both domestic and
overseas markets, have paid off. "The measures have been proven
effective and efficient," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts, China has kept its currency stable and
the GDP growth in the first half year reached 7 percent amid a
general economic slowdown in other Asian countries, he said,
adding that such a rate is "relatively high" worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Chinese government, millions of
Chinese servicemen and civilians successfully are still fighting
high floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
in central and east China and the Songhua and Nenjiang Rivers in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the floods have adverse effects to the
economic growth in the regions and added additional difficulties
for the whole country to realize the set economic goals.
</P>
<P>
However, "with the courage and determination, the diligent and
brave Chinese people have the confidence to overcome all the
difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese government has adopted a more active
financial policy and put more money on infrastructure construction
so as to push up domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"All efforts combined will surely minimize the adverse effects
of the natural hazards," he noted.

<P>
LUANDA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
announced the suspension of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola@P;9Q%j5DIM2U9
Q%=9J\"!rh%=915~
unity and reconciliation government, effective from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The govern said in a communique that the decision will
last until UNITA complies with all clauses stipulated in the
Lusaka peace accord signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Angola national assembly Speaker Roberto de Almeida
also proposed to the Supreme Court to suspend UNITA members'
positions in parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the government still pledged in the communique that
it will continue "to adhere to all that is contained in the
Lusaka peace protocol perfectly in a bid to achieve national
unity and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
It also appeal to the Angolan people to keep calm and alert,
and refrain from any moves in violation of the spirit of national
unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has been accusing the opposition UNITA
of delaying to carry out the tasks prescribed for the final
stages of the peace deal by refusing to disarm all its forces or
hand over four central cities under its control.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been attacking each other on the issues for
the past months, bringing the peace process in the country to a
serious standstill.
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the former rebel UNITA movement
announced on August 24 to cease its cooperation with the troika
observer missions, namely Russia, Portugal and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government move to suspend UNITA members'
official function might further worsen the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Strike Delays Opening of Israel's New School Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Because of the breakdown of
negotiations with the Treasury, Israeli teachers' unions moved on
with the strike on Tuesday and thus resulted in the delay of

</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that officials of the Treasury and the

percent salary increase, while they will agree only to a 5
percent increase.

<P>
Avraham Ben-Shabbat, chairman of the Teachers Union, said that
teachers want to open the schools, "but not at any price."
</P>
<P>
He told the Treasury that "pay us a fair and equitable salary,
don't pay us like kids working at summer camps."
</P>
<P>
But Treasury wage director Yossi Kucik said that "what we have
offered the teachers is fair and we can not give in to their
demands."
</P>
<P>
He added that teacher's real wages increased 27 percent
between 1993 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Students in Flooded Areas Greet New Term in Tent School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nanchang, September 1 (Xinhua) -- It comes as a pleasant
surprise to nine-year-old Zhou Zhenzhen, whose primary school has
been immersed in water, that she can attend school today as the
new term begins.
</P>
<P>
Leaning on a newly raised grey tent on the Sanjiao Dyke, Zhou
said she will have classes in the tent on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's Ganfang Primary School in Jiujiang City in east China's
Jiangxi Province has been greatly damaged by the floods, so she
and her schoolmates must greet the new term in this temporary tent
school.
</P>
<P>
There are three tent schools along the Sanjiao Dyke and more
than 170 of them in Jiujiang City.
</P>
<P>
Ganfang Primary School is one of the 5,700 middle and primary
schools in Jiangxi Province which have been ravaged by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Early this August, the provincial government began to repair
the damaged schools, and reports from the Jiangxi Education
Commission said 72.8 percent of these schools have been repaired
or rebuilt, and another 20 percent have set up temporary schools
in storehouses, tents and other safe locations.
</P>
<P>
Song Leiming, an official of the Jiangxi Provincial Education
Commission, said that students whose schools are unable to open on
time will be sent to attend other schools nearby. In remote
places, teachers will go the villages to teach.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, students in the flooded areas will
enjoy a partial or total tuition-fee waiver.
</P>
<P>
In Yongxiu County, each student will enjoy a two-thirds tuition
waiver, and those with particular difficulties can apply for a
further waiver.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the Jiangxi Provincial Education
Commission said that about 5,350 schools with 2.23 million students, 93
percent of the total number hit by the floods, open on September 1
when the new term begins. The local government is making efforts
to help another 190,000 students attend school before October 1.

<HEADLINE> Most Students in Areas Affected by Flooding Return to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Most of the 8.5 million
primary and secondary school students living in areas affected by
flooding returned to school Monday when the new semester began, an
Education Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Those living in 10 provinces and cities along the Yangtze River
and other major rivers were the most seriously affected by
flooding this summer.
</P>
<P>
The disaster has affected 44,853 primary and middle schools,
and resulted in the collapse of some 3 million square meters of
classrooms. In addition, the disaster has caused problems for
56,400 families of teachers, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Educational departments at various levels have raised fund
through different channels to repair classrooms, rent civilian
houses and set up temporary buildings for the students, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other methods have also been adopted, including organizing
students to study in other provinces and teaching courses at the
students' homes.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that some schools could not open on
schedule because of damaged or destroyed classrooms. The ministry
has issued a notice calling on local educational departments to
take more steps to ensure that all the students can return to
school in the autumn, according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Being Behind GCC Anti-Iraq Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has denied an Iraqi
allegation that it was behind a statement issued by the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) which demands Iraq's unconditional
implementation of the Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Kuwait Sunday of drafting the statement, saying
the statement "dose not reflect the opinion of other GCC members,"
the Kuwait News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry official said "the decisions and
statement of the GCC ministerial meeting were issued after lengthy
consultations and discussions."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq always rejected statements and resolutions issued by
international and regional organizations that condemned its
aggression against Kuwait," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi accusation was "meant to cast doubt on the GCC
states' continuous support to Kuwait," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC statement was issued last Friday to underline the need
of Iraq's implementation of relevant U.N. resolutions and
expressing concern over its suspension of cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended cooperation on August 5 with U.N. Special
Committee (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which have taken charge of weapons inspections in Iraq since 1991
Gulf War, set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused the UNSCOM of being pro-U.S. in attempt to prolong
the U.N. sanctions, which were imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War.

1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the

KUALA LUMPUR, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The APEC (Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation) Women's Business Council will be launched
Wednesday at the two-day 1998 APEC Women Leaders' Network meeting
which began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah
Aziz suggested at the meeting that the Council came up with
programs to motivate women entrepreneurs to invest in APEC member
economies.
</P>
<P>
The business council should ensure that within each APEC
economy, there is business-support mechanism and facilities that
can assist women entrepreneurs to venture into the market whether
in trade or industry, Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
She said the business council should also pursue the
establishment of the APEC Women's trade-net to optimize the
benefit of electronic commerce and strengthen the existing
network.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be put into market-driven human resource
and entrepreneur development programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
This can serve to promote the region as a profitable
manufacturing and export base and benefit manufacturers from the
region, she said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, attended by some 230 participants from
APEC members, will mainly discuss the current economic crisis and
its impact on women.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Launch Program to Help Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is working out a
nationwide program to provide the country's elderly people with
cheaper social, health and entertainment services, the Daily Star
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ministry of Social Affairs were quoted as
saying that the program, being prepared by the ministry, will be
formally launched in 1999, the world's year for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
People aged 65 years and older will have free medical service
under the program, said Neamat Kenaan, the director-general of the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
They will also be given discounts on access to sports clubs,
cinemas, nightclubs and free or discounted transportation.
</P>
<P>
Kennan said the program will be launched with an awareness
campaign aimed at high school and university students.
</P>
<P>
"Posters and flyers, as well as TV and radio adverts, are
especially oriented to youth, warning them that they will one day
grow old and be depressed if society doesn't take care of them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry recent statistics, some 6.9 percent
of the country's 3 million population are over 65 years old, which
means that Lebanon is a young society.
</P>
<P>

implemented, as all elderly people will receive medical and social
services and live longer," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Former Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people are
confident and capable of winning the battle against the ongoing
heavy flooding and of achieving the goal set for this year's
national economy, President Jiang Zemin today told former Japanese
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
</P>
<P>
"China will adhere to the policy of not devaluing its currency
of Renminbi in an effort to stabilize the overall regional
economy," Jiang said. "At the same time, we hope that Japan makes
its due contributions to ease the regional economic difficulties."
</P>
<P>
He said China-Japan relations are entering an important period
of inheriting the past and forging into the future at the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we draw from past experience, China-Japan relations
can be given impetus in the forthcoming century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
China-Japan peace and friendship treaty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the treaty, with great significance, has
further consolidated the political basis for relations between the
two neighboring nations and reflected the common aspirations of
the two peoples to live in friendship from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu expressed his sympathy and solicitude for the people in
China's flood-ravaged regions, saying that the Japanese people
fully understand the reason Jiang postponed his scheduled
September tour of Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, they expect this historical visit to be
possible at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu agreed with Jiang's viewpoints on Japan-China ties,
saying that Japan should properly deal with that period of history
and not follow the track of the overturned cart.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side, he said, should keep to principles set in
the peace and friendship treaty and in the China-Japan joint
statement in a bid to further promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu and his party are here at the invitation of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aviation Industry: Major Partner of Boeing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is in 1972 that China placed its first order for 10 Boeing
707 airplanes and the country has since become one of the
company's main customers by purchasing 289 aircraft in seven
Boeing series so far, accounting for 72 percent of its imported
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, China and McDonnell Douglas, which was taken over by
Boeing last year, started a series of cooperative projects in
China, including assembling 35 MD-80s at the Shanghai Aviation
Industry Corp.; making 20 MD-90 trunk aircraft; and manufacturing
parts such as vertical fins, stabilizers, noses and tail
assemblies by manufacturers in the cities of Shanghai, Chengdu,
Shenyang and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
"That was the turning point," Bracy said. "It marked the
beginning of our overall cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two partners have joined efforts in setting up
several training centers both in Chinese cities and the U.S. city
of Seattle, where Boeing has its headquarters. They have also set
up a joint air traffic service group and a huge field service
network in China, with more than 40 Boeing engineers based in more
than 20 Chinese cities to solve technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Chinese engineers also have participated in the design of tail
assemblies for Boeing 737-700s, which began delivery last October.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all the MD-80s assembled in Shanghai have been put
into use and the parts made in China have been installed in about
3,000 Boeing aircraft. The first Chinese-made MD-90 is scheduled
to come off the assembly line in November.
</P>
<P>
"Of our thousands of foreign partners, Chinese enterprises have
proved competitive for their high quality, low cost and prompt
delivery," Bracy said, adding that China has great market
potential, another reason for their successful cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is the world's leading airplane producer and has
produced more than 70 percent of the 11,500 passenger planes
flying around the world.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) confirmed Boeing's contribution to the development of the
Chinese aircraft sector.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to further cooperate with Boeing, especially in
developing and manufacturing new aircraft," said Wang Zhi,
director of planning for the CAAC.
</P>
<P>
"We chose Bracy to lead Boeing China in March of this year,
hoping that he would bring the cooperation to a higher and broader
stage," said Ron Woodard, president of Boeing's Commercial
Airplane Group.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Imposes Forex Controls to Curb Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday
announced foreign exchange controls with immediate effect to curb
speculation in its currency ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The controls include the need for foreigners to get Bank Negara
(State Bank)'s permission to convert ringgit into foreign
currencies, the central bank's acting governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz
said at a press conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Approvals are required for the transfer of funds between
external accounts, she said, adding the steps to curb speculation
and minimize the impact of short-term capital inflows on the
domestic economy were vital in view of the significant fall in the
ringgit due to speculative attacks against it since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the transfer to resident accounts is permitted only
until September 30, 1998, whereby approval is required thereafter,
and the withdrawal of ringgit from external accounts requires
approval except for the purchase of ringgit assets, she said.
</P>
<P>
For authorized depository institutions, all purchases and sales
of ringgit financial assets can only be transacted through
authorized depository institutions and for trade settlements, all
settlements of exports and imports must be made in foreign
currencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
On currencies held by travelers, effective October 1, 1998,
they (travelers) are allowed to import or export not more than
1,000 ringgit (about 250 U.S. dollars) per person, she said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no limits on the imports of foreign currencies by
resident and non-resident travelers," she said, adding the export
of foreign currencies by resident travelers is permitted up to a
maximum of 10,000 ringgit (about 2,500 U.S. dollars) equivalent.
</P>
<P>
She said the export of foreign currencies by non-resident
travelers is permitted up to the amount of foreign exchange
brought into Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Zeti said the ringgit would no longer be legal tender overseas
from October 1, 1998 and that those holding ringgit overseas will
not be able to convert the ringgit to any foreign currency
overseas unless they use the ringgit to buy Malaysian assets.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit can no longer be exchanged for other currencies
unless they are brought back to Malaysia, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that there would be no restrictions for foreign
currencies as international currencies would still be traded in
Kuala Lumpur. "We would like to see the forex market develop in
Kuala Lumpur," she added.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would return to the previous arrangement of free
capital flows once there is a discernible normalization of the
currency and financial markets, she said.
</P>
<P>
The acting governor said the measures would not impede foreign
direct investment flows as the foreign direct investors could
freely repatriate their profits and dividends.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether the Malaysian central bank would like
to see other countries take similar measures to control foreign
exchange, she said a concerted effort to deal with the problem is
required before a greater problem unfolds.
</P>
<P>
However, it is up to other countries to decide on what measures
they should take, she said, adding that for Malaysia, it wants to
insulate its economy from the risks and vulnerabilities of adverse
external developments.
</P>
<P>
Zeti was of the view that the new measures would bring
stability to the ringgit "to a large extent" because trading of
the ringgit will be brought onshore.
</P>
<P>
"But Bank Negara would let the ringgit's level to be determined
by market forces," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said offshore ringgit will have to be brought back in one
month's time after which they would not be permitted except for
the import of no more than 1,000 ringgit (about 250 U.S. dollars)
per person.
</P>
<P>
She said this also applies to ringgit depositors in overseas
banks. In other words, this would cause the ringgit to be no
longer traded in other financial centers except in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that this does not mean the foreign exchange
market will cease in Malaysia as exporters would still be required
to convert foreign currencies for exports and importers would
also have to convert ringgit into foreign currencies to pay for
their imports.
</P>
<P>
She explained that trade would not be affected in any way with
the implementation of the new measures as trade payments would be
made in major foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
She said what the central bank is doing is to target access to
ringgit funds by speculators.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara wants to have a more independent economic and
financial policy according to domestic considerations, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the government would revert to free flow of
capital if the currency and financial markets go back to normal,
but this return must be sustainable.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 31 (Xinhua) -- President of Panama Ernesto
Perez Balladares on Monday appointed Eduardo Ritter as the new
minister of foreign affairs to replace Ricardo Alberto Arias.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press office announced that President
Balladares accepted Arias's resignation on the day and shifted
Ritter, minister of state for canal affairs, to the post of
foreign affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
But Arias will remain in office until September 7 when Chilean
President Eduardo Frei concludes his visit to Panama.
</P>
<P>
Frei is scheduled to start a state visit to Panama at the
beginning of September and attend the 12th summit meeting of the
12-nation Rio Group.
</P>
<P>
Arias submitted his resignation last week partly because of
health problem, A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the main reason for his decision to quit is that the
Panama-U.S. negotiations on setting up a multinational
anti-narcotics center in a U.S. Air Force base after the
U.S. forces pull out in the year 2000 have run into deadlock, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, the two countries have failed to
resume the talks on the issue, which began in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Seeds Help Prostate Cancer Treatment, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A study released Monday said
that implanting radioactive seeds in the prostate to treat early
stages of cancer may be as effective as surgery, and more
effective than external beam radiation.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted at Northwest Hospital in Seattle and
published in the latest edition of the journal Cancer, looked at
152 men during 10 years after they were treated with radioactive
seeds and, in some cases, beams of radiation from outside the body.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four percent of them remained free of disease and had low
levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which can be an early
signal of the cancer, the study reported, adding that only three
patients died of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that brachytherapy is a proven, viable option for
treating clinically localized prostate cancer," said Dr. Haakon
Ragde, author of the study.
</P>
<P>
"This is just as effective as the best surgical results and is
more effective than conventional radiation beam results," he added.
</P>
<P>
The study is the first to observe brachytherapy patients for a
full 10 years, claimed Ragde, a urologist at the Seattle
hospital's Northwest Prostate Institute.
</P>
<P>
"Many men are now going to be opting for seed implantation
because of the numerous advantages it has in terms of reduced
morbidity, impotence and incontinence," said Dr. Subir Nag,
president of the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society estimates 184,000 American men may
get prostate cancer this year and 39,200 may die of it.
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer is the second leading cancer killer among
U.S. men after lung cancer.

WELLINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of more than 1.5
billion New Zealand dollars (750 million U.S. dollars) were wiped
off the value of New Zealand shares before noon Tuesday as the
share market reacted to sharp falls on world share markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the Evening Post, a Wellington-based newspaper,
New Zealand's NZSE40 index, which measures the country's top 40
shares, slumped five percent shortly before noon.
</P>
<P>
In New Zealand, there were 86 falls in early trading and three
rises. Most of the blue chip stocks slumped. NZ insurance giant
AMP lost 1.5 NZ dollars to 23.10, troubled Brierley Investments
shed five cents to 64 cents, and Telecom fell 31 cents to 7.49 NZ
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Don Turkington of sharebroker Cavill White
Securities as saying the situation was "very very serious".
</P>
<P>
In the current environment, it is hardly surprising that
concerns about global recession have emerged, the paper quoted

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition and trade center
will be set up in north China's largest port city for New York's
small businesses to display their products.
</P>
<P>
The center will be located in the Tianjin New Technological
Industrial Park, according to an agreement signed last week
between the park's management committee and the New York Small
Business Development Center (NYSBDC).
</P>
<P>
With 22 local branches, the NYSBDC supervises more than 30,000
small businesses in the State of New York, making it the largest
small business development center in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's business circles are expected to get more chances to
cooperate with small firms in New York and attract more investment
through the exhibition center.
</P>
<P>
The center also should help these American firms explore the
market here by showing their latest technology and products.
</P>
<P>
James L. King, state director of the NYSBDC who signed the
agreement on behalf of the American group, called the center a
"showcase" for both sides to step up efforts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aviation Industry: Major Partner of Boeing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Bill Boeing, founder of the
Boeing Company of the United States, hired a Chinese, Tsu
Wong, as its first designer 82 years ago. But he probably never
expected that China's aviation industry, which then did not exist,
might one day become a major business partner of this
international giant.
</P>
<P>
The latest Boeing Co. statistics show that China has bought
one-tenth of the firm's aircraft in the past three years; that
China and Boeing have jointly established one of the world's
largest airplane spare parts center in Beijing; that
more than one-third of the 8,500 Boeing aircraft flying around the
world are equipped with parts made in China; and that more and
more parts and aircraft are being manufactured or assembled in
China.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation with the Chinese aviation sector is the largest
and the most efficient part of Boeing's foreign business," said
Raymond Bracy, president of Boeing China Inc. "We've never done so
in any other foreign country."
</P>
<P>
According to the 41-year-old Bracy, the youngest of Boeing's
managerial class, former U.S. President Nixon's 1972 visit to
China in a Boeing 707, the Air Force One, resulted in not only the
normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries,
but also the establishment of long-term business ties between
Boeing and China's aviation industry.

82 exclusively invested corporations in Beijing by the end of this
June, according to the latest report from the Beijing Municipal
Government.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 323 transnational corporations, among which

<HEADLINE> Albanian President Calls for Prevention of Social Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani
Monday called for an end to the politicizing of every event and
urged a renewed respect for law in order to achieve peaceful
co-existence and prevent turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
Albania is again being threatened by social unrest as the
opposition, led by the Democratic Party (DP), have been reacting
strongly to the arrest on August 22 of six senior officials of the
former DP government on charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
"A return to the old way of an eye for an eye will lead
nowhere. It benefits no one and it does not help fulfill
obligations required of us related to the Kosovo issue. Neither
does it help our efforts to build and strengthen a legal state and
set up a modern constitution," the president said in the port city
of Durres.
</P>
<P>
"We must respect the separation of judiciary from
administration," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Affirming that he encourages dialogue, debates and
confrontation of ideas, as well as mutual understanding between
parties, Mejdani urged all political forces to be "more ethical,
more mature, more patient and more respectful to each other."
</P>
<P>
He also called for a transparent, standardized, speedy and
supervised trial of the six former officials to avoid unnecessary
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
This was the first presidential comment on the growing tension
in the country. The Albanian media have lately criticized
Mejdani's silence over the issue.

MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton arrived here Tuesday to meet Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was met at the airport by Acting Premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin and other senior Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday for their
first full-scale summit since March 1997. Since then, they have
met briefly a few times, most recently in May, when both were in
Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
The two will focus on security and Russia's economic
crisis. Clinton said Russia can count on American support so long
as it stays the course to reform.
</P>
<P>
Local media opinions hold that the ill-timed summit will not
achieve any significant concrete results because of the present
situation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's authority is being threatened unprecedentedly by his
"inappropriate relationship" with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's popularity has fallen to the lowest point since he
became Russian president in 1991, and he has been asked to step
down by the parliament chiefly because of the worsening economic
situation of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will travel to Ireland and the British province of
Northern Ireland after his trip to Russia.

NEW YORK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Tope seeds Pete Sampras of the
United States and Martina Hingis of Switzerland sailed into the
second round as expected in the men's and women's competition at
the U.S. Open tennis championships here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who opened his bid for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam
title, beat Marc-Kevin Goellner of Germany 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, while
Hingis, who started to defend her title here, rolled over
Aleksandra Olsza of Poland 6-2, 6-0 in commanding style.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who has won five Wimbledon and two Australian Open
titles, is seeking his fifth U.S. Open championship to tie former
Australian star Roy Emerson's record for career Grand Slam
titles.Sampras is also looking to tie Fellow American Jimmy
Connors'modern-day record of five U.S. Open championships.
</P>
<P>
The 27-yearold dominated Goellner, serving 11 aces and
cracking 38 winners against only 17 unforced errors, winning in
only 84 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good start," said Sampras, "In the early rounds, you
like to get a feel for the court, get used to the surroundings. I
didn't get a chance to get comfortable last year."
</P>
<P>
Sampras was upset in the fourth round last year by Petr Korda
of the Czech Republic in the new Arthur Ashe Stadium at the
National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
Goellner had nine aces but committed eight double faults. The
German had 27 winners but made 25 unforced errors and was unable

five of eight break-point opportunities while Goellner could not
even force a break point during the three sets.

Andrew Ilie of Australia, retired in the fourth set with an
undisclosed injury.
</P>

Italian Open in May and could lose the No. 1 ranking she has held
for the last 17 months to either Lindsay Davenport or Jana
Novotna at the conclusion of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hingis became the second youngest U.S. Open women's
champion. She won 12 titles, lost only five matches and came
within one victory of capturing the Grand Slam in 1997, but has
been unable to repeat that success this year.
</P>
<P>
Hingis has a tough second-round match against unseeded Iva
Majoli of Croatia, who beat her in last year's French Open
final.Majoli dispatched Germany's Anke Huber 6-3, 6-3 today.
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Alberto Berasategui of Spain became the first seed
player to fall in the tournament when he was ousted by former

<HEADLINE> Hawaii May Pay Families of Organ Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hawaii state government
is considering paying the families of organ donors in a bid to
improve its record for having the lowest number of donations among
the 50 U.S. states, Associated Press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This has been discussed in the past and people all thought it
was a macabre idea, but let's be practical about things, let's
think about things because we can help people," Hawaii Governor
Ben Cayetano said at an unveiling ceremony last week of a
commemorative stamp for the National Kidney Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Hawaii faces the worst shortage of organs available for
transplants in the United States. Only seven organs have been
donated so far this year and a total of 18 donations last year
with a waiting list of 191.
</P>
<P>
Local officials cited several factors intensifying the shortage.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Hawaii is too far away from the mainland to import
organs, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cultural and ethnic beliefs, particularly among
Filipinos, discourage donations because they are mostly Roman
Catholics who believe they need to be full in body and spirit when
they die.
</P>
<P>
U.S. federal law prohibits the sale of donated organs to
prevent creation of a potentially dangerous black market for
organs.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they believe certain payment to the families
of organ donors is needed in the island state. They also stress
the importance of educating islanders to overcome worries about
organ donation.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 20,000 Americans received organ transplants last
year, but 4,000 died waiting for a donor. More than 55,000 people
are on the transplant waiting list, up from 16,000 in 1988.

KATHMANDU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will launch an
immunization program against polio for the third year in a row on
December 7 this year and January 18 next year, The Kathmandu Post
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister K.B. Gurung was quoted as saying that more than
3.3 million children across the country will be immunized with
polio drops on the two days.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a World Health Organization (WHO) report as
saying that every year 100 to 150 children aged under five in
Nepal suffer from polio, a disease which cripples children.
</P>
<P>
But a statement issued by the Nepalese side put the number of
children suffering from polio at nine in 1996 and 11 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"No polio patients have been recorded till date in the current
year, but we are working hard in searching out polio patients all
over the country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO report listed nations like Myanmar, Bangladesh, India
and Nepal as polio epidemic-prone zones.
</P>
<P>
At their ninth summit in May 1997, leaders of the member
countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- decided to designate December 7, 1997
and January 18, 1998 as "SAARC Polio Immunization Days."
</P>
<P>
The SAARC countries had decided to achieve the goal of
universal eradication of polio by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar National Convention to Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar National Convention
will meet again after the convention's Convening Commission
completes discussions on basic detailed guidelines regarding
separation of powers between the legislative, executive and
judiciary at different levels, Chief Justice U Aung Toe was quoted
by Tuesday's The New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, no date was set for the re-convening of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
The sessions of the National Convention, which began in January
1993 to lay down fundamental principles for drawing up a new state
constitution, have been in recess for two and a half years since
the last session ended in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The convention has completed working out detailed principles
for six chapters out of 15 to be included in the new state
constitution. The six chapters are Fundamental Principles,
Structure of the State, Head of State, the Legislature, the
Executive and the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
U Aung Toe, who is also chairman of the National Convention
Convening Work Committee, said at a recent meeting of the 19th
Work Committee and General Assembly of ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary
Organization held in Kuala Lumpur that Myanmar is making a
step-by-step approach to develop the multi-party democratic
process domestically.
</P>
<P>
The convention has been attended by more than 500 delegates
from eight categories of the delegate groups including political
parties, parliament representatives-elect in the 1990 general
election, national races, peasants, workers, intelligentsia, state
service personnel including the military ones, and invited persons
including turned-in armed groups.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, all the delegates of the parliament
representatives- elect of the National League for Democracy (NLD)
Party, which won the 1990 general election, withdrew from the
convention.

<HEADLINE> Increase in Housing Credit Suggested in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to resolve the real
estate crisis, Thai condominium developers have proposed a plan to
the government, suggesting an increase in housing credit, lowering
interest rates as well as increasing level of government land
expropriation.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Thai Condominium Association
available Tuesday, the proposal, aimed at increasing liquidity in
the sector, has been submitted to Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda, who has been tasked with solving the problems in
the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
The association said in the statement that the government
should find some urgent measures to encourage commercial banks and
financial institutions to extend credit and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The association suggested that risk weighting ratio for housing
credit fall below 50 percent, commercial banks and financial
institutions be allowed to sell their housing loan portfolios to
the central bank or other institutions at a discount, and banks
sell export credits at a discount to the Export and Import Bank of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The association said housing credit is at the heart of the real
estate sector problem and a resolution to it would stimulate a
greater spending power in home-buyers, help real estate developers
to improve their liquidity and thus help lower the non-performing
loans of commercial banks and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, boosting the ailing real estate sector would allow a
lot of related businesses, for instance, building materials
producers and retail outlets, construction firms, furniture
manufacturers and retail outlets, electric appliance businesses,
and others to sell their products and services.
</P>
<P>
The improved situation would provide new jobs and reduce the
need for lay-offs, not to mention the increased taxes and fees the
government will be able to collect.
</P>
<P>
The association hoped that improving the country's real estate
and financial sectors would finally act as a driving force for
economic recovery.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has sought 879
million U.S. dollars of foreign assistance for immediate flood
relief and post-flood rehabilitation, The Bangladesh Observer
daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's needs for immediate flood relief are 1.35 million
tons of foodgrain worth 242 million dollars and 112 million
dollars as cash aid, the daily quoted an official of the Economic
Relations Division (ERD) of the Finance Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The post-flood requirement for rehabilitation has been
estimated at 525 million dollars, he said, adding that the
preliminary estimate of requirement in different sectors has been
sent to all the donor countries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
Since early July when the monsoon season began in the country,
45 of the country's 64 districts have been hit by flood, with
over 20.7 million people affected and the death toll rising to
423, according to the latest figures issued by the Control Room of
the Relief and Disaster Management Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the nearly two-month-long flood has damaged over
227,000 hectares of crops, more than 377,000 houses, 9,347
kilometers of roads, 4,121 kilometers of embankments, 4,652
bridges and culverts and 1,052 educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government has appealed to donors for assistance, and got
positive response from them. Donor countries and agencies such as
the United States, Japan, Britain, Canada, Australia, India, the
Netherlands and the Asian Development Bank have provided or agreed
to provide aid to the country.

WARSAW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Poland in
the first half of 1998 reached a record high of 5 billion U.S.
dollars, the Polish foreign investment administration reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Poland amounted to 5.7 billion dollars in
the whole of last year compared with 5.2 billion dollars in 1996

Poland with 1.247 billion dollars, followed by South Korea's

<HEADLINE> Austria Urges Political Settlement of Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Defense Minister
Verner Fasslabend, on a visit to Macedonia Monday, urged the two
conflicting parties in Kosovo to cooperate in finding a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Austria is of the view that there exists the possibility of a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis, Fasslabend said in a
meeting with his Macedonian counterpart, Lazar Kitanovski, in
Skopje, according to news reports from the Macedonian capital.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend said that a political settlement of the Kosovo
crisis should not lead to the occurrence of another Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Kitanovski said Macedonia is
trying its best to avoid any involvement in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers agreed that the Kosovo crisis should
be settled at an early date and that there would be a human
disaster if it could not be solved by this winter.
</P>
<P>
Fasslabend also met with Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj
Handziski earlier in the day. The two sides reportedly spoke
highly of the relations between their two countries and exchanged
views on regional security issues.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a Yugoslav province where ethnic albanians make up 90
percent of its total population, who have been seeking
independence from Yugoslavia since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The province was plunged into chaos in February when ethnic
Albanian separatists intensified their campaign for independence.
Although the path for a political settlement of the crisis is not
blocked, the United States has threatened the use of force for a
military solution to it.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Eyes Defense Ministry for Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The cash-strapped Thai
government is considering requiring the Defense Ministry to
contribute a bigger slice of the proceeds from its commercial
radio and television networks to the state's depleted coffers.
</P>
<P>
The Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Deputy Prime Minister
Bhichai Rattakul as saying that he had suggested Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai to consider allowing the Office of the
Auditor-General to check on the income of army-owned TV Channels 5
and 7 and its more than 200 radio stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Other government agencies targeted by the Office of the
Auditor-General as part of the efforts to boost the government's
shaking financial position include the Justice Ministry, which
receives a large income from the interest generated from huge
amounts of cash placed as bonds for bail.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai said the government wants to know how much money the
army-owned television and radio stations are making each year so
as to decide the financial contribution they will be required to
make to the state coffers.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Auditor-General has never examined income
generated from television and radio stations owned by the army and
other branches of the armed forces because proceeds from these
activities are currently categorized as non-budgetary funds, which
can be spent at their discretion.
</P>
<P>
Media watchers have estimated that army-owned television and
radio stations collectively earn billions of baht in profits each
year.
</P>
<P>
Relevant laws and regulations will have to be amended to
empower the Office of the Auditor-General to examine income from
commercial television and radio stations and allow the Finance
Ministry to require contribution from the proceeds.

<HEADLINE> Republican Leader says Censure Inadequate in Lewinsky Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott Monday called President Bill Clinton's behavior with a
former White House intern "disgusting," saying Clinton has reduced
the stature of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Lott also suggested that censure might not be an adequate
congressional response.
</P>
<P>
Lott declined to say whether he thinks Clinton should remain in
office, but he backed away from his suggestion earlier this year
that censuring the president, as opposed to impeachment
proceedings, might be the way to go.
</P>
<P>
"That was March. This is the first of September as of
tomorrow, and a lot has happened since then," The Associated Press
quoted Lott as saying. "... Censure really doesn't do anything.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not, at this point, going to say what is appropriate
either way," he added.
</P>
<P>
A senior Senate Republican aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said later that Lott no longer believes censure is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
"As a husband and father, I am offended by the president's
behavior," Lott told reporters as the Senate returned from its
summer recess.
</P>
<P>
"There is a moral dimension to the American presidency, and
today that dimension, that power, has been lost in scandal and in
deception. As a citizen, I'm disappointed in the way the highest
office in the nation has been reduced in stature and diminished in
credibility."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would urge Clinton to resign, Lott said he would
await any report Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is expected to
submit.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it will rise to levels that could justify
proceeding in the House on impeachment or anything else. So I am
going to wait for that report and withhold judgment or further
comment until I see it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said Clinton
has told him he plans to comment further on his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"I think he will say more," Daschle told CNN. "I think that
will happen."

<HEADLINE> China Builds Railway Linking Hainan Island With Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China is now constructing its
first cross-strait railroad that will connect Hainan Island with
the mainland, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Guangdong-Hainan Railway is
scheduled to be finished in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 524.6-kilometer railway will include Zhanjiang-Hai'an
Railway in Guangdong Province, ferries from Hai'an to Haikou,
capital of Hainan Province, and the railway which rounds the
western part of Hainan from Haikou to Sanya. It will handle 30
million tons annually when completed.
</P>
<P>
The ferries will be able to withstand winds up to fresh gale.
When completed, the 4.5 billion yuan railway project will connect
with the rest of the country's railway network, thus strengthening
the relationship between the island province and the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
It will also advance Hainan's development and provide another
market link for rich marine resources to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the founding of Hainan
Province, also the country's fifth special economic zone after
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Huge costs have delayed the project, said an official with the
Ministry of Railways. The project now has financial support from
the Ministry of Railways, and the governments of Guangdong and
Hainan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The complexity of the project and the engineering challenge of
getting tracks across the Qiongzhou Strait also hinders the
construction, said the official, who didn't rule out the
possibility of building tunnels across the nearly 25-km strait to
connect the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
But the construction of undersea tunnels would take longer time
and be more expensive than the ferry system now proposed, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the cross-strait railway is the
ninth railway project begun in China this year. The country
planned ten major railway projects this year. The final one is a
trunk railway from Northeast China's Heilongjiang to East China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction on this year's last railway project, with a length
of 2,000 km, will start this month or October. It will take four
years to complete.

<HEADLINE> Secret Thai Fund Found in U.S. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nation newspaper Monday reported that the huge sum of money
had been stashed away and accumulated over the years and no one
seemed to have been aware of its existence because the Defense
Ministry had failed to report it to the Finance Ministry as
required.
</P>
<P>
The official, who did not give his name, said the Finance
Ministry's Office of the Auditor-General recently came across the
account at the U.S. central bank while inspecting the government's
overseas assets.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Auditor-General has been instructed to
scrutinize the government's overseas assets as part of the efforts
to improve the government's flagging fiscal position. A huge
shortfall in the government's revenue collection is expected as a
result of the current economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The account was opened in 1982 under a recommendation of the
Finance Ministry for arms purchase by the Defense Ministry, which
was required to report the balances in the account to the Finance
Ministry every year.
</P>
<P>
Apparently the Defense Ministry had not reported it. The
Defense Ministry could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the existence of the account had been known to few
outside the Defense Ministry until U.S. government officials
recently mentioned it as a possible source of downpayment for
Thailand's planned acquisition of F-18 fighter jets, which was
later scrapped.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear how the account had eluded the detection
of the Bank of Thailand or the Office of the Auditor-General for
so long.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Venezuela Drops 70 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Venezuela
dropped by 70 percent in the first half of this year in comparison
with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued Monday by the Promotion Council of
Investments (CONAPRI), investment in the period was only 50.8
million U.S. dollars, compared with 172.35 million dollars in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
CONAPRI attributed the decrease to election times in Latin
America, which generated distrust among foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The fall of crude oil prices, the lack of a profitable activity
to replace the oil business, and the Asian crisis are affecting
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis Must Be Solved by Russia: Austrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia's financial crisis can
only be solved by Russia itself, Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schoessel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Schoessel, who also heads the European Union's Foreign
Ministers Council, said the international community could ask
Russia to continue its reforms and create conditions for
cooperation with foreign countries and international institutions,
but external forces alone could not resolve the Russian issues.
</P>
<P>
He called for an early return to stability in Russia, warning
that Moscow's plans to overcome the financial crisis contained
certain "disturbing" elements, such as restrictions over the
reform and privatization process, and resumption of state control
on prices and foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
He urged Russia to speed up banking reforms to ensure the
safety and participation of Europe.

<HEADLINE> China to Raise More Locust-Killing Chickens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has decided to greatly increase the number
of locust-killing chickens it raises next year.
</P>
<P>
As 100,000 trained chickens and hundreds of thousands of
migrating starlings played a key role in controlling the largest
locust disaster in the last decade, only eight counties around
Urumqi, capital of the region, decided to raise 200,000 trained
chickens next year.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is often attacked by locusts and more than 150 species
have occurred in the region in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A trained chicken can kill locusts in half a hectare of
grassland during a summer season.
</P>
<P>
A chicken usually needs two months of training before it acts
as a "soldier" to kill the enemy -- locusts.
</P>
<P>
As soon as a herdsman blows his whistle, a trained chicken
begins searching for and eating locusts in the grass.
</P>
<P>
As the locusts contain rich protein, these chickens can be sold
at a much higher price than ordinary chickens in the region.
</P>
<P>
The central and regional government has spent 10 million yuan
(1.2 million U.S. dollars) in curbing the spread of locusts and
this year's locust-caused disaster is now under control.
</P>
<P>
Har Wenguang, head of Xinjiang's locust and rat extermination
office, said starlings, the natural enemy of locusts from the
Indian subcontinent, each May protect 186,000 hectares of
grassland and the trained chickens consume locusts on 4,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Har said an adult starling can consume more than 120 locusts
each day.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Xinjiang has spent more than 140,000
U.S. dollars to build nests to attract migrating starlings.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration Tries to Reassure Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton Administration
tried to assure investors Monday that the United States economy is
basically sound despite the second biggest points plunge in Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said he had talked to President
Bill Clinton, who was on Air Force One on his way to Moscow for a
summit with Russian leaders, after Monday's stock market closed
with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 512 points.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals of the United States economy are strong due
in part to the sound policies we've been following," Rubin stated.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for growth, low unemployment and low inflation
continue to be strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he had also spoken to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and officials around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The world is currently working its way through a difficult
period," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was particularly important that Japan "move ahead
with actions to put its economy back on track so that it can be a
source of strength for the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
Payment and settlement systems and other market mechanisms were
working effectively, unlike in 1987, when backlogs occurred and
many small investors were unable to cash out their holdings when
they wanted.
</P>
<P>
There was a "slight" problem on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE), but it was resolved and the exchange is expected
to open on time Tuesday, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
CBOE officials said computer systems had to struggle to handle
the trading volume just before the close of trading, resulting in
a temporary slowdown in quotes for stock options on the trading
floor.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also urged the Republicans in Congress to authorize U.S.
additional contributions to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
which helps support countries in financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to receive full IMF funding so that the IMF
will have sufficient resources to respond to crises," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Historical Sites Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's 12,000 documented
sites and monuments of historical value have come under threat,
according to Archaeology Department sources Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last week five valuable guardstones belonging to the
Medirigiriya historical site in Polonnaruwa in the North Central
province were reportedly plundered.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Archeology Siran Deraniyagala complains
that he has only 40 watchers (security guards) to ensure the
safety of the country's historical treasures, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Deraniyagala was quoted as saying that his department also
covers sites and monuments amounting to another 100,000 over a
land extent of 16,000 acres but he has a staff of only about 1,400
to administer them.
</P>
<P>
The director lamented that out of his staff only 14 were
professionally trained. This was totally inadequate to meet the
demand within the department.
</P>
<P>
As a means of remedying this situation, the department has
already launched a program in the North Western province of
inventorying such sites. There is a grave necessity for the
private sector to come in to the functions of the department of
protecting and conserving historical sites and monuments, the
sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the increased threats to these sites from
treasure hunters and other vandals, the sources added that the
public must be conscious of the need to preserve their cultural
heritage and not leave that task to his department alone.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Along the Yangtze River running
through Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, and in
the suburban areas, more than 277,000 troops and residents are
keeping their eyes open on the ravaging flood waters, with
vehicles and sandbags nearby to tackle any possible dangers.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the streets in the downtown
section of the city are hustle and bustle as usual, schools
prepare for their new semester, peddlers yell at the market, and
cabs shuttle their customers.
</P>
<P>
Yun Lihua, 65, has kept her store open near the Longwangmiao
ferry on the Riverside Road in Jianghan District since the
anti-flood fight began in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Located at the junction of the Hanjiang and Yangtze rivers, the
1,080-meter-long ferry, dubbed as "Dragon King's Temple" in
Chinese, in one of the most vulnerable sections on the Yangtze
dyke.
</P>
<P>
"I reckon that the water will not flow in the city," Yun said
yesterday, pointing at the ferry which is less than 150 meters
away. "The soldiers and the district officials have been stationed
there for more than 60 days. I needn't worry about any risks."
</P>
<P>
In Fanhu Town, Jiangxia District in southwest Wuhan, more than
100 farmers from Chijishan Village gathered on Saturday under the
hot sun to receive their share of disaster relief from the city's
Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shili, whose two hectares of land was engulfed by the
flood, got 1,210 yuan (146 US dollars) that day. He had been
granted aid from the bureau twice before, while Chen Yongquan, the
village chief, was only given 40.9 yuan, because his loss was
slight.
</P>
<P>
"Based on meticulous checks and calculation, the city's Civil
Affairs Bureau and various instances at the county's level have so
far sent 19.6 million yuan (2.3 million US dollars) and 23 million
yuan (2.7 million US dollars) worth of material to the victims in
the city's flood-hit areas," said Lin Xiaoqun, an official with
the Wuhan Bureau of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Luo Yousong, director of the Wuhan Education Commission, said
that students whose schools were destroyed by the floods had all
been given a special pass, enabling them to enter nearby schools
without change.
</P>
<P>
He said no student will be left out of school because of the
floods.

<HEADLINE> Australian Ministers Ridiculed on Internet by Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard and his key ministers suffered unexpected negative
publicity as they were ridiculed on the Internet by hackers
Monday, the first day of Australia's federal election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph reported that the prime minister, instead
of being referred to as "The Honorable John Howard MP", had become
"The Dishonorable John Howard MP: Prime Minister for Pain,
Suffering and Inequity" on the Liberal Party's site.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the prime minister Tuesday confirmed the
report, saying the web site for the Australian Liberal Party,
whose leader is John Howard, was vandalized Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The site closed soon after the attack was discovered and the
offending material was then removed, the spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello, the would-be successor to John Howard
as leader of the party, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer and Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith also suffered
ridicule on their web sites.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer, who was behind the sweeping taxation reform plan
unveiled last month, became "Minister for the Rich, Stomping the
Poor and Wrecking the Economy".
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was called "Minister for Foreign
Humiliation" on his web site, which was also linked to
Disneyland.com.
</P>
<P>
Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith, who has launched a
nationwide campaign to break the monopoly of the nation's trade
union over seaports, became "Minister for Destruction of Workplace
Fairness, the Gestapo and Propaganda" with his site linked to the
Maritime Union of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Overnight repairs to the Liberal Party's Internet site have
restored dignity to Prime Minister John Howard.
</P>
<P>
But early Tuesday morning the sites of some key ministers were
still unable to be accessed, including those of Reith, Environment
Minister Robert Hill, Social Security Minister Jocelyn Newman,
Resources Minister Warwick Parer, Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone
and Attorney-General Daryl Williams.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Australian Federal Police declined to say
whether the police were going to investigate the case, adding they
would consider taking action after receiving a complaint from the
Australian Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
About one million Australian homes were now hooked up to the
Internet, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia's major political parties and government
organizations have their web sites established on the Internet and
are trying to use the net to get their message across to voters.

SHIJIAZHUANG, Septmeber 1 (Xinhua) -- A bronze gun made at least
100 years ago has been unearthed at a construction site for a
secondary school in north China's Hebei Province.

<P>
The gun was made during the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). It
is 1.6 meters long and weighs 250 kilograms.

Local archeologists said the 70 millimeter gun was well
preserved, and characters carved on its body, which still could be
seen clearly, listed the names of craftsmen and officials who
supervised its manufacture.
</P>
<P>
Several iron guns were discovered in the region,
archeologists said, but this is the first time a bronze gun has
been unearthed. The discovery should benefit the study of arms
manufacturing during the Qing Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Speaker Agrees to Limit Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian House Speaker
Harmoko Monday agreed to demands that the incumbent and future
presidents should only be allowed to serve a maximum of two
five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
"If the number of presidential terms is not limited, it would
accelerate the centralization of power," Harmoko told a plenary
meeting of the House of Representatives Monday here.
</P>
<P>
Such action will uphold the sovereignty of people, he said,
adding that Indonesians no longer want long-serving presidents.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience as a nation for 53 years is more than enough.
We have enough lessons to avoid any kind of state management that
is not in line with the values of democracy, justice and welfare,"
Harmoko was quoted by national newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, the power of the government tended to
become absolute and authoritarian especially when the executive
ignored criticism, suggestions and supervision from the
legislature, social institutions and other supervisory agencies.
</P>
<P>
"So, we see the upcoming People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
special session as crucial, since it will become a beginning for
more fundamental reform by the poll-produced MPR," Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's highest legislative body, the MPR, is scheduled to
hold a four-day special session on November 10. One of the main
items on the agenda will be to reset the election date from 2002
to 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the revisions, Indonesia would not only see an earlier
election, but also "change more quickly the existing political
system so it can become more acceptable to the people," Harmoko
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the elections, scheduled for between May and June
next year, could be a new beginning for the nation in handling the
problems it was currently facing.
</P>
<P>
"Through the general session of the MPR established after the
poll, we could even lay the groundwork for a national life that
reflects more the spirit of the people's sovereignty, in which we
will also see a limited presidential term," he added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the MPR Working Body, who are now preparing for the
special session, told reporters Monday that the special session
will discuss a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
Most issues raised by legislators were prompted by the public's
demand for sweeping reforms, Deputy Chairman of the MPR Working
body Ahmad Roestandi said.
</P>
<P>
The issues include limiting the presidential term, assessing
the accountability of former president Soeharto, and revoking a
decree that gives the president absolute power in times of
emergency, Roestandi added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Banks Opened to Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
treat foreign investors equally with local investors in the
opportunity to acquire ailing local banks, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will invite foreign investors to participate in the
restructuring of our banks," Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said participation of overseas investors in the
restructuring of the troubled banking sector was essential because
of the substantial funding required to clear up its problems,
local leading newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said the amount of money to recapitalize the ailing
banks would be large because the level of non-performing loans was
estimated to reach 50 percent of more than 600 trillion rupiah
(54.5 billion U.S. dollars) in outstanding loans, equivalent to
more than 40 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The government was revising the country's banking law to
abolish the foreign ownership limitation for local banks,
currently set at 49 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the finance minister submitted proposed amendments
to the 1992 Banking Act at a plenary session of the House of
Representatives, demanding foreign investors be allowed to own 100
percent shares in national banks.
</P>
<P>
The government recently suspended the operation of three banks
and took over the share-holding of four others in its first major
efforts to rehabilitate the sector.
</P>
<P>
The seven banks had received Bank Indonesia (central bank)
liquidity support equivalent to more than 500 percent of their
capital. They are believed to have channeled 70 to 100 percent of
the funds to affiliated business groups.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the government closed 16 insolvent
private banks under an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for economic and financial reform. In April this year,
the government again suspended the operation of seven private
banks and merged three others.
</P>
<P>
Economists held the ailing banking system is one of the major
causes for the prolonged economic crisis in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Builds 90 Dams in Past Ten Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has claimed that it has
built 90 dams in the country without any foreign assistance since
the Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) took over the state power in late
1988.
</P>
<P>
The claim was made by Lieutenant General Tin Oo, second
secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, at
Monday's opening ceremony of a latest dam, the Pin Creek dam, in
central Mandalay division, The New Light of Myanmar newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The completed 90 dams irrigate nearly 546,750 hectares of
farmland, he said, urging the people to help maintain the
facilities till future generations and to use water efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Of the 90 dams, 22 are in central Mandalay division where arid
zones lie.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo disclosed that the project for reforestation and
betterment of weather conditions of the central arid region has
been extended from 8 districts to 13 districts.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that priority is being given to greening and
forest restoration of the Popa mountain region, the main watershed
of central Myanmar which is related to the reforestation of the
arid region.
</P>
<P>
He warned against indiscriminate felling of trees and
destruction of forests which will cause severe weather changes.
</P>
<P>
He called for forest conservation and increased building of
dams to help put more land under crops in the central part of the
country and green the region.

<HEADLINE> Oil Sector to Push Toward 8 percent National Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Petrochemical
Industry Bureau (SPIB) is expected to take measures to ensure the
reeling petrochemical industry, and this helps meet a national
economic growth target of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, SPIB released a statement, outlining major tasks
intended to be achieved by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
SPIB will organize a special team to supervise implementation
of State-adjusted oil production and processing plans in the third
and fourth quarters, which have been carried out by China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec).
</P>
<P>
The bureau will try to implement the State-set oil price
structure and to guide the two groups in buying and selling crude
oil and refined oil products at prices set by the State Planning
Commission. The measures are expected to bring order to a
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
The national industrial administration is working with customs
authorities to crack down on refined oil product smuggling, a move
crucial for guaranteeing reductions in stockpiles of crude oil and
refined oil products, both by 3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The central government required the two petrochemical groups to
realize 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) in profits this
year, a target that has been downgraded in view of a sharp
worldwide drop in oil prices and because of the costs of
industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The bureau urged the chemical enterprises to enhance sales
promotion and to explore more intensely markets both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
They have been asked to ensure profits in the sector of between
1.5 billion yuan (180 million US dollars) and 2 billion yuan (240
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The chemical fertilizer market is likely to pick up as the
demand of farmers in the flood-stricken areas for fertilizer will
surge after flood waters recede.

MOSCOW -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday renominated
Viktor Chernomyrdin as the country's prime minister, hours after
the nomination was rejected by the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Only 94 deputies voted for Chernomyrdin, way below the required
226 votes from 450 lawmakers of the State Duma. Of the 345
deputies who cast votes 251 voted against, with no abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The vote, originally scheduled for 18:00 local time (1400 GMT),
was taken one hour later to allow deputies to vent, for the most
part, their anger at the government and President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, the largest
opposition faction with 133 of the 450 seats, said Chernomyrdin
"does not possess a single quality necessary for leading the
government."
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov blasted the government's performance in the past seven
years, both under Chernomyrdin from 1992 until March this year,
and under Sergei Kiriyenko, who was dismissed abruptly on August
23. (Russia-Premier-Yeltsin)

Clinton and Yeltsin are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday for their

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis to Affect Indonesia, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's deepening financial
crisis will affect Indonesia's economy, a senior minister was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The effect of the Russian crisis on the Indonesian economy
could be seen from the stock and money markets, said Coordinating
Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's bourse reacted negatively to the suspension of the
ruble trading after the Russian currency plunged 29 percent last
week, with the Jakarta Composite Index tumbling 4.5 percent to a
year-low.
</P>
<P>
The bourse was sharply down in midday trading Monday before it
rebounded in late trading on a rise in PT Telekomunikasi
Indonesia, Jakarta's market bellwether which accounts for almost
20 percent of the benchmark index.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, although continuing its upward bound journey with
the assistance of the inflow of foreign aid and loans, failed to
break the psychological level of 11,000 per U.S. dollar as
expected by analysts last week because of regional weakness
triggered by the Russian woes.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah on the Jakarta inter-bank spot market was closed on
Monday at 11,050 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We must be cautious and watch the developments in Russia very
closely, because long-term problems in Russia will affect
Indonesia," Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian turmoil may affect the world economy as a whole,
and will certainly affect Indonesia's exports, he added.
</P>
<P>
Just like Indonesia, Russia has also turned to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package after the
country was hit by currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said he would discuss Russian developments with IMF
deputy managing director Stanley Fischer and Asia-Pacific director
Hubert Neiss, who are scheduled to visit Indonesia on September 18
and September 3 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Refiles Lawsuit Against NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Former Golden State Warriors
guard Latrell Sprewell today announced plans to refile a lawsuit
against the team and the NBA, a liitle more than a month after
the case was thrown out of court.
</P>
<P>
Going against the recommendation of the judge who dismissed
the original lawsuit on July 30, Sprewell said he is reviving the
matter to repair his damaged image and because the team and the
NBA acted improperly after a December 1 incident at practice in
which he choked Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
"People have this perception of me being this evil person,
this bad person, because they don't have all the facts," said
Sprewell at a news conference in San Francisco. "If I go through
with the lawsuit, they will find out the wrongness that was done."
</P>
<P>
Sprewell also accused the NBA of shredding crucial documents
in the investigation of the matter and denied attacking Carlesimo
a second time, which the Warriors and the league contend.
</P>
<P>
The 30 million U.S. dollars lawsuit was dismissed in
U.S.District Court for Northern California by Judge Vaughn
Walker, who ruled that the case could be revived but recommended
that it be dropped.
</P>
<P>
According to attorneys for Sprewell, the new lawsuit was filed
in the same court but for unspecified damages. The lawsuit seeks
to cap the penalty for his attack on Carlesimo at 1 million
U.S.dollars, the cost in salary of his original 10-game
suspension.
</P>
<P>
"The contract with the players' union clearly states that
either the team or the league can punish me, but not both,"
Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell, a three-time All-Star, was originally suspended for
10 games by the Warriors. Warriors management then terminated the
two-plus years and 23.7 million of his contract. The following
day,the NBA suspended Sprewell for one year, the longest non-drug
ban in league history.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Players Association, which strongly backed Sprewell in
his initial grievances against the league, has not endorsed the
lawsuit.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 31, (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) resumed talks on
nuclear matters in New York on Monday after they adjourned last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the talks, which began on August 21 and
have had three sessions, resumed this afternoon at the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations, with the U.S. side led by Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman and the DPRK
represented by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye-kwan.
</P>
<P>
Like in previous sessions, both sides did not give any
information about what they talked about.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials only confirmed last week that the 1994 Agreed
Framework for the DPRK to freeze its own nuclear program in
exchange for two western-built light-water reactors was on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The meeting today took place hours after western media reported
that Pyongyang allegedly launched a long-range ballistic missile
over Japan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japan, a partner of an international consortium involving the
U.S. and South Korea in the construction of the 4.6 billion U.S.
dollar reactors, expressed its regret over the said move by the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has not issued any statement or comment on the news
reports.

<HEADLINE> Prediction of Huge Wellington Quake Reaffirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A huge earthquake in the
Wellington region is again predicted after new analysis shows
growing tension between the Pacific and Australian tectonic
plates.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper,
a study conducted jointly by the Geological and Nuclear Sciences
Institute of New Zealand and Massey University has found that
pressure under Wellington potentially makes its fault the most
dangerous of several in the region, including several newly
identified faults.
</P>
<P>
The research coincides with a paper published last month in the
Civil Defense Ministry's Journal Tephra. In the paper,
seismologists Martin Reyners and John Beavan wrote that
sophisticated satellite-measurements of tectonic plate movements
under the southern North Island of New Zealand showed significant
land deformations pointing to the inevitability of big
earthquakes. They made a prediction of big earthquakes in the
region, as well as in more southern regions that are subjected to
strains under the Southern Alps along the west coast of the
country's South Island.
</P>
<P>
The research carried out by the Geological and Nuclear Sciences
Institute and Massey University said that though no one can
predict when, the likely size of a quake out of the big Wellington
fault would be more than 7.6 on the Richter scale. "It could be
greater than 8, if it erupts out of the Wairarapa fault," the
research predicted.
</P>
<P>
The institute study shows five "new" and active faults have
been discovered in the Wellington region during the past five
years, each with the potential to be the source of the big quake.
</P>
<P>
Three of the faults are in the western Tararua Range between
Paraparaumu and Palmerston North; one through Whiteman's Valley
between Wainuiomata and Upper Hutt; and another directly
underneath Martinborough.
</P>
<P>
Another fault, the subduction thrust under Wellington between
the Pacific and Australian plates, is not newly discovered, but is
the subject of new data indicating greater strain.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, with Wellington Regional Council,
the institute has prepared a series of maps analyzing in detail
earthquake risk within individual suburbs and areas. The maps
indicate the dangers from ground shaking, fault movement,
liquefaction, slips, and tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted institute geologist Russ Van Dissen as
saying that during the past five or six years there has been a
growing awareness by local authorities of the inevitability of a
big earthquake, and necessary work to mitigate the effects of a
big quake is being carried out.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Net Investment Hits 124 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. firms will invest 124
billion dollars in the "Internet Economy" this year, according to
a study by the market research firm International Data Corp.(IDC).
</P>
<P>
IDC defines the Internet Economy as "spending on technology
deployment, marketing and sales, content creation, professional
services, and education and training to support Internet
technology-based applications."
</P>
<P>
The study found that U.S. net investment still exceeds return.
For every dollar and a half the firms invest, they will get back
one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that companies still invest more than they get
back this year, IDC said, the outlook is rosy. The study predicts
that the tide could turn as soon as 2000, with U.S. firms gaining
more in benefits than they spend on Net investment.
</P>
<P>
IDC defines "benefits" as a combination of commerce conducted
over the Web and productivity savings from Internet applications.
</P>
<P>
The current situation will change rapidly, IDC said. "Within
five years, every dollar of Internet investment in the U.S. will
be paying back 1.5 dollars, and the size of the total investment
will be four to five times bigger. It looks like the U.S.
cross-over point -- from investment to payback economy -- could
come as soon as the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
IDC is still finalizing the forecast of the worldwide Internet
Economy. The Western Europe economy will be 44 billion dollars
this year, about a third of the U.S. Internet Economy. In 2000,
the region's Internet Economy will reach 170 billion dollars.
"Europe's lag in adopting Internet technologies will mean a
commensurate delay in turning into a payback economy," IDC said.
</P>
<P>
IDC will release more results from its study of the Internet
Economy at a conference in September in San Jose, California.
</P>
<P>
The research company said that it analyzed information
technology (IT) budgets and non-IT budget technology spending
across an array of industries for its research on the Internet
Economy. It also surveyed 600 "architects of the Internet
Economy," in conjunction with technology business magazine, the
Industry Standard.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays Third Annual ESAF Loan for Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced here Monday the approval of the third annual
loan for Niger under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF), equivalent to about 26 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided in support of the government's program for
1998-99. The loan is available in two equal semiannual
installments, the first of which is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The principal macroeconomic objectives for 1998-2001 are to
achieve real GDP growth of 4 to 5 percent a year, maintain
inflation in the 2 to 4 percent range, and reduce the overall
fiscal deficit to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2000 from 7.5 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Within this medium-term strategy, Niger's program for 1998-99,
projects real GDP growth of 4.5 percent, maintaining year-end
inflation at about 3 percent, and an external current account
deficit at 9.4 percent of GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Niger joined the IMF in April 1963. Its quota is about 64
million dollars. As the end of June, this year, Niger's
outstanding use of IMF resources totaled about 64 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Official to Mediate Northwest Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has ordered Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to mediate with
Northwest Airlines officials and pilot union leaders to resume
negotiations to end the ongoing strike.
</P>
<P>
In his first move toward intervening in the strike, Clinton on
Monday issued a statement from Air Force One en route from
Washington to Moscow saying he had asked Northwest and its pilots
to "redouble their efforts to resolve their differences."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said senior administration officials were in contact
with both parties, "but it is up to the negotiating parties to
reach an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The president said he hoped that an agreement would be
concluded soon in their interests and the interest of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
The strike entered its third day Monday with little sign of
movement toward resolution. The union and the airline said they
were ready to start talks again, but there was no schedule
announced.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House officials had said that if the strike
reached Labor Day, September 7, Clinton might reconsider his
decision not to order a 60-day "cooling-off" period for the
parties as he did last year in the early stages of a strike by
American Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the airlines extended its cancellations of its 1,700
daily flights through Wednesday, and international flights from
Europe also were canceled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Northwest and its pilots' union are arguing over issues of job
security and compensation. Northwest said its last offer would
have paid the average pilot 150,000 U.S. dollars by the end of the
contract in 2002, more than other big airlines.
</P>
<P>
But the 6,100 pilots argued that Northwest misrepresented the
value of the offer, noting that pilots at other airlines are
likely to have new contracts by then. The pilots said their
average salary now is 120,000 dollars per year, but Northwest said
it is 133,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Northwest is the sixth largest airline in number of passengers
carried annually and the fourth-largest in revenue in the United
States. It carries nearly 150,000 passengers a day and 1,315 tons
of cargo on 1,600 flights in North America, Europe and Asia.

<P>
BONN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Monday said that a stable Russia is of great importance for
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Peace, progress and stability in Russia are also peace,
progress and stability in Germany," said Kohl at an election
campaign rally of his Christian Democratic Union party in Hanover.
</P>

The German chancellor on Monday also called on European
countries to make joint effort to prevent the Russian crisis from
worsening.
</P>
<P>
If Russia backed down from its political and economic reforms,
peace and stability in Europe was at stake, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also said Monday that
Germany would continue to support Russia despite its current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the nomination of Viktor
Chernomyrdin as Russian prime minister could still be approved by
the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, but he also
stressed that he did not want to interfere in Russia's internal
affairs.

<HEADLINE> European Bourses Fail in Rallies to Fall with Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets struggled
for most of the day on Monday against the Russian crisis, with
volatile trade ending in losses on the back of a sharp fall on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, after a strong start, the leading DAX index fell
back in line with other world markets, as the Russian political
crisis reached a stalemate over the formation of a new government
with acting prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin rejected by
parliament as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was still some strength in corporate
earnings but there is some risk that the DAX will fall back to
4500 points because there are no support levels between 5,000 and
4,500.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's electronically-traded Xetra Dax index ended down
114.52 points, or 2.3 percent, at 4,811.28 points.
</P>
<P>
The floor-traded Dax, which closes half an hour before Xetra
dealings, fell even further as it had to catch up with late
electronic losses on Friday and ended down 159.65 points or 3.2
percent at 4,833.89.
</P>
<P>
The markets drew early limited comfort from a 1.38 percent
rally in Tokyo stocks, though elsewhere in Asia most share markets
took a tumble, led by a seven percent dive in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But an opening plunge on Wall Street contributed to the late
pall over European share trade, while the absence of London,
Europe's largest bourse, for a market holiday was considered a
dampening influence, too.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares were volatile, too, falling over 2
percent at one stage on a choppy futures and options expiry
although prices picked up later.
</P>
<P>
The leading index, the Cac 40, ended 1.5 percent down at
3,651.85 points after being up a similar amount at the start of
the session.
</P>
<P>
Many investors were sidelined by the Russia crisis, although
current prices were good value with interest rates falling and
fundamentals still solid, brokers say.
</P>
<P>
The story was similar elsewhere with Spain's IBEX share index
down 1.4 percent, while the Swiss Market index shed 1.6 percent
and Amsterdam's AEX index was down 0.6 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 34,000 U.S. West
employees began to return to work Monday following a tentative
settlement that involves wage increase and limits on mandatory
overtime work in a new three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement contains a wage hike of 10.9 percent
over three years, a 21 percent increase in pension benefits and a
500 U.S. dollars contract ratification bonus.
</P>
<P>
It is in line with agreements the Communications Workers of
America has reached with other regional Baby Bell companies, the
union said.
</P>
<P>
Union officials expected that the agreement would be ratified
by 60 percent to 70 percent of union members.
</P>
<P>
The strike began August 16. In the 15-day strike, the first in
the company's 14-year history, operators, technicians and customer
service representatives walked off the job in 13 states. It forced
customers to wait for phone repairs and installations.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peaceful Solution in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday adopted a presidential statement, calling for a peaceful
solution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Danilo Turk, president of the 15-member council, said that the
peaceful solution included an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal
of all foreign forces and the initiation of a peaceful process of
political dialogue with a view to achieving national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The statement also reaffirmed the need for all states in the
region to "refrain from any interference in each other's internal
affairs," and voiced its "support for all the regional diplomatic
initiatives aimed at a peaceful settlement of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
"The problem of the Democratic Republic of Congo must be solved
on the basis of a process of all-inclusive national reconciliation
which fully respects the equality and harmony of all ethnic groups
and which leads to the holding of democratic, free and fair
elections as soon as possible," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement also condemned "reported summary
executions, torture, harassment and detention of civilians based
on their ethnic origin, the recruitment and use of child
soldiers, the killing or wounding of combatants who have laid
down their weapons."
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the Council calls for the protection of the
civilian population" in the country, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement came as African countries are
striving for a negotiated solution to the multi-lateral conflict
raging in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out on August 2 when ethnic Tutsis in
eastern Congo rebelled against President Laurent Kabila, who has
remained in power for about 15 months. Kabila accused neighboring
Uganda and Rwanda of arming and backing the rebellion, a charge
that both governments deny.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Secretary-General of
the Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim would join
central and southern African leaders at the upcoming Non-aligned
Movement summit for parallel talks on the Congo.

only the development of a conjunction of circumstances, but also
stems from deeper reason as well.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his visiting French counterpart,
Lionel Jospin, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that they
ascertained that the reasons for this development were not only
conjunctural but also deeper, there were some structural reasons
which they should study in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) should deal in depth with the Russian
problem because there was great concern over the crisis, its
length and scope, he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Jospin, who arrived in Greece on Monday, said
that both sides ascertained that beyond the financial aspect of
the problem, there were also problems relating to a political
balance in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed issues concerning the
Austrian-led October EU summit, and Simitis stressed that they had
reached agreement on the general course of the issues to be raised
there.

<HEADLINE> First-Ever Verdict on Crime of Genocide due September 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations tribunal
will hand down on September 2 the first-ever verdict on the crime
of genocide by an international court, U.N. Department of Public
Information said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It also said two days later, the Tribunal, the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based in Arusha, Tanzania, will
pronounce in a separate case, the first-ever sentenced for
genocide, the release said.
</P>
<P>
These two landmark decisions will also for the first time bring
to practical life, the lofty ideals of the Genocide Convention.
</P>
<P>
Through the Tribunal, the Convention has been lifted from
statute books to become, 50 years after its adoption in the wake
of the holocaust, a testament to the world's renewed determination
to collectively tackle genocide in a manner it never has before.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda Tribunal was created by the United Nations Security
Council in November 1994 after one of the most intense periods of
mass exterminations in human history. At least 500,000 people,
primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were brutally massacred in
just three months of that year.
</P>
<P>
In the dock now are Jean-Paul Akayeau, who was the mayor of
Taba district and whose verdict will be pronounced on September 2,
and more significantly, Jean kambanda, who was Rwanda's Prime
Minister during the genocide, has pleaded guilty. His sentence
will be announced in September 4.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal has in its custody a total of 26 indicated
Rwandans and 5 suspects. All 31 come from rwanda's governing elite
during the time the genocide took place.
