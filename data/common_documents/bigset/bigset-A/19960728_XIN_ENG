<HEADLINE> IMF Warns UK Over Tax Cuts And Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) - Britain has no scope for tax cuts in
this year's budget and needs to do more to bring public finances
under control, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned today.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain's recent economic performance is "enviable"
and its prospects "likewise favourable," the IMF annual report
said there were growing concerns over about public sector
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
It urged the British government to halt "the increasing
slippage in public finances" and to put "renewed emphasis" on
cutting the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) by trimming
government running costs, rather than limiting public sector
investment, said the report published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's report came as National Statistics, the government's
statistics agency, announced that the UK economy grew more slowly
than expected between April and June, partly due to the crisis
over British beef caused by a health scare about BSE or "mad cow"
disease.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.4 percent between the first
and second quarters, the same growth rate as in the previous two
quarters and 1.8 percent higher than the same period last year,
said National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural output fell by between 5 and 10 percent as cattle
which would normally have been slaughtered for market were
destroyed instead, resulting in a slowdown in GDP growth of 0.1
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials said further deterioration in public finances
revealed by the Treasury's summer forecast meant that the fund had
to step up the tone of its warning.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury reportedly raised its forecast for 1997-1998
public borrowing by 8 billion pounds (12 billion U.S. dollars) to
23.1 billion pounds (34.65 billion dollars), under pressure from
weak tax revenues and big bills for debt interest and social
security payments.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for this year's PSBR has been raised from 22.4
billion pounds (33.6 billion dollars) to 26.9 billion pounds
(40.35 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists here say they believe the government will struggle
to meet its 2.5 percent growth target by the end of the year and
suggest Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke may be tempted
to cut interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report says that Clarke had succeeded in imposing tough
spending targets but warns against further delays in capital
investment which would impede growth.
</P>
<P>
Running costs should bear the brunt of new cutbacks, it
suggests.

<HEADLINE> Organizers Beef Up Security Measures for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Security measures have been beefed
up in the wake of the wee-hours bombing explosion at the
Centennial Olympic Park, officials of the Atlanta Committee for
the Olympic Games (ACOG) said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Security measures are in place in all the competition venues
and the Centennial Park has been closed temporarily for the day
and tonight for the thorough investigation by the law-enforcement
department," A. D. Frazier, ACOG chief operating officer said at
the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The park is an open place for people to get together and it
was conceived that it will benefit the Centennial Games for people
in their celebration and relexation to share the spirit with each
other," Frazier said, adding that such a tragedy could happen in
any other place.
</P>
<P>
After urgent consultations, the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) decided that all competitions proceed as scheduled with two
events of baseball and dressage delayed for hours due to
transportation and security concerns, said IOC director-general
Francois Carrard.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at 1:25, and "a number of consultations have
been conducted immediately with ACOG, the White House, the state
and city officials" said Carrard.
</P>
<P>
"We are very quick to conclude that the competition will
continue as in schedule and we are totally confident as for the
security at the competition venues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The response of the law-enforcement was remarkable as they
even spotted the bomb in advance in a package. If they did not
spot, there would be more number of fatalities," said Carrard.
</P>
<P>
In the explosion, two people were killed. They included Turkish
Melih Uzunyol, a cameraman for Turkey CRP TV.
</P>
<P>
Bob Brennan, ACOG spokesman quoted ACOG president Billy Payne
as saying "he was sadden by the fact that two lost their lives and
a number of injuries, and he said he will not allow the bomb
accident to affect the continuation of the Games."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Further Improvement in Welfare Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday the welfare overhaul legislation has steadily
improved as it moved through Congress and is much better than two
previous Republican-written welfare bills he vetoed.
</P>
<P>
The version the Senate approved this week "does provide health
care and child care, and took some important strides to protect
our children," Clinton said in a speech prepared for his weekly
radio address.
</P>
<P>
"But we still have more work to do to promote work and protect
children, though we have come a long way in this debate and
mustn't go back," Clinton said. For those who fear welfare
overhaul of any kind, he said, children will never be lifted out
of poverty "by preserving a failed system that keeps them there."
</P>
<P>
"And to those who would undo the progress of recent weeks by
sending me another extremist bill like those I vetoed, I would say
we can only transform this broken system if we do right by our
children and put people to work so they can earn a paycheck, not
draw a welfare check," he said. "That's the only kind of welfare
reform I can sign."
</P>
<P>
A compromise of differing welfare bills passed by the House of
Representatives and Senate is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Both bills would limit lifetime assistance to five years per
family and force recipients to work after two years, with hardship
exemptions allowed for up to 20 percent of families. They also
would send the federal funds to states in capped block grants,
giving the states much more freedom to run the programs.
</P>
<P>
House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich said he anticipated
the House-Senate conference would finish the bill early next week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Bombing in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
condemned the bombing at the Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta as
an "evil act of terror" and vowed to do everything possible to
punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
In a White House address on Saturday morning, Clinton called
the attack early Saturday "an act of cowardice that stands in
sharp contrast to the courage of the Olympic athletes."
</P>
<P>
The president vowed that the United States will find the
bombers. "We will track them down," he said. "We will bring them
to justice.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that people that deliberately kill other people,
particularly under circumstances that demonstrate this kind of
cowardice ... deserve capital punishment," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his condolences to the victims and
their families, and praised security officials for their quick
work in finding the bomb and alerting the crowd before it exploded.
</P>
<P>
One person died and more than 110 were injured after a pipe
bomb exploded at about 1.20 a.m. (0520 GMT) early Saturday morning
near a sound and light tower at the Centennial Olympic Park in
central Atlanta where thousands of revelers were celebrating at a
free open-air concert.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports put the death toll at two. The other victim, a
Spanish cameraman rushing to cover the aftermath of the explosion,
died of heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he agreed with the International Olympic Committee
that the Games would go on.
</P>
<P>
He said new measures would be added to the games' security
efforts which he called the most extensive ever put in place for
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot let terrorism win," he said. "That is not the
American way. We cannot be intimidated by acts of terror."
</P>
<P>
FBI Director Louis J. Freeh was at FBI headquarters, where he
met this morning for nearly an hour with Attorney General Janet
Reno. Freeh was in and out of the Strategic Information Operations
Center, where the Atlanta bombing investigation is being
constantly monitored.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said that Clinton had
been woken soon after the bomb exploded and received updates on
the investigation and security measures throughout the
night.

<HEADLINE> Landslides Kill 40 in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Forty soldiers have died in
landslides caused by heavy rain in South Korea's Kangwon Province
over the last two days, military sources said here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The first buried some 50 soldiers, killing at least 16, as it
swept through the barracks of an army unit in Chorwon County in
Kangwon Province at 5.30 a.m. (local time) before the army
engineers began their daily duties.
</P>
<P>
The second landslide in Hwachon County, Kangwon Province, at
6.00 a.m. swept 15 air force servicemen away as they were digging
a drainage ditch, leaving two dead and one missing. The 12 others
were immediately sent to a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the death toll is likely to increase as
some of the injured are in a serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Today's tragedies come just a day after a landslide engulfed
two barracks in an army unit in Chorwon County, in which 20
soldiers were killed and eight others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Counter-Calamity Headquarters said here
today that heavy rain has left 53 civilians dead in the country's
Kyonggi Province during the past several days.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Condemn Olympics Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Worlder leaders today strongly
condemned the terrorist bombing at the Olympic Park in Atlanta
early this morning and called for tougher action against
terrorism, reports reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
A pipe bomb exploded during a rock concert at the park, at
about 1.25 a.m. EDT (0525 GMT), killing at least one person and
injuring more than 100 others. A Turkish TV cameraman died of a
heart attack while covering the incident.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, describing the bombing as "an evil
act of terror," vowed to do everything possible to find the
bombers and "bring them to justice."
</P>
<P>
"The bombing at the Centennial Olympic Park this morning was an
evil act of terror...an act of cowardice that stands in sharp
contrast to the courage of the Olympic athletes," Clinton said
during a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac sent a message to Clinton and
the President of the International Olympic Committee Juan Antonio
Samaranch, denouncing the "cowardly act of aggression."
</P>
<P>
The international community "must be unanimous in its
condemnation and in its will to reinforce cooperation against
terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major said the British people "will
share the anger of the American people...they will also share
their determination not to be deterred by this evil act."
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed his belief
"that the tragedy...once again shows how important it is to
combine the efforts of all countries in the fight against
terrorism," his spokesman Sergei Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
"It's high time to take joint comprehensive measures against
terrorism," said Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded three days before a planned anti-terrorism
conference in France due to be attended by diplomats and foreign
ministers from the world's seven leading industrialized countries
(G-7) -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the
United States -- and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The conference was agreed on during the G-7 summit in Lyon,
France, in June, a few days after the June 25 truck bombing of a
U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 American
servicemen and injured hundreds.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, the Palestinian Authority sent its
condolences to the families of the victims and to the American
government.
</P>
<P>
"We completely condemn any kind of terrorism against civilians
anywhere," said the Authority's planning and international affairs
minister, Nabil Shaath.

<HEADLINE> Moi, OAU Chief Condemn Military Coup In Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi today
condemned the coup in Burundi, saying it would deepen the
existing suspicions among the Burundi people and widen the gap
toward possible reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the State House, Moi said the coup
which overthrew President S. Ntibantunganya two days ago, is not
the solution to the problems that have been faced by the people
of the country.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned leaders of the coup against aggravating the
situation that was already "pathetic".
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya hid in the U.S. embassy after he was stoned by
Tutsis when attending a funeral of 304 people on Wednesday with
the policemen standing by and the military staged a coup to take
over.
</P>
<P>
The 304 Tutsis were killed by Hutu rebels and Ntibantunganya
was accused of being sympathetic with Hutu rebels who are waging
a bush war against the Tutsie-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said he supported the United nations stand which
follows the democratic path to bring about peace and
reconciliation among the people of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the world community to support the United
Nations position toward Burundi.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kenyan Foreign Minister K. Musyoka also condemned
the military coup in Burundi, saying the coup in Burundi "goes
against the very letter and spirit of the regional initiative
which aimed to ensure democracy and security for all."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary-General of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said here today the OAU will not
recognize the junta of the coup led by Tutsi major Pierre Buyoya
because doing so will only push the ethnically-divided country to
a full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
He told newsmen at the airport during a stopover from Lagos to
Addis Ababa early this morning that "Ntibantunganya is still the
President of Burundi... We shall not stand by idly and do nothing
because doing nothing is no option at all."
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni and Mwalimu Julius Nyerere will meet in Kampala
this evening to discuss options to return the tiny central
African country to democratic rule, Salim said, adding that the
meeting will be followed by an emergency African Summit on
Burundi in Tanzania next week.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria on Course to Democracy: Commonwealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary-general
Emeka Anyaoku today said the military regime in Nigeria has
responded positively to initiatives launched this year to restore
democracy in Africa's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe National News Agency here,
Anyaoku said a landmark meeting held in London last month between
the Nigerian government and the Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Group (CMAG) had given him hope that a solution could be found to
political problems in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"I am an optimist by profession and I must entertain the hope
that at the next commonwealth meeting, Nigeria will have made
progress and brought itself closer to fulfilling the
commonwealth's Harare principles on human rights and respect for
democracy of 1991," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, led by military strongman Sani Abacha, was suspended
from the commonwealth in New Zealand last November following the
execution of Ken Saro-wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The CMAG last month had dialogue with Nigeria since its
suspension from the commonwealth and that dialogue was very
important. We hope that Nigeria will continue down the path it
has begun to reform itself, repeal the decrees that are in
contravention of the Harare principles and move toward
establishment of democratic rule and release political
prisoners," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the chairman of the CMAG, Zimbabwe Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge had since written to the Nigerian government
requesting permission to visit the country so that "the
constructive dialogue started in London continues."
</P>
<P>
The commonwealth chief said he hoped the group will visit
Nigeria before its next meeting, scheduled to be held in
September.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku, who arrived in Zimbabwe this morning, is expected to
hold talks with the group Chairman Stan Mudenge.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Recognize Burundian Military Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will not
recognize the Burundian military regime headed by Pierre Buyoya
that took over power in a bloodless coup in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zambian Foreign Minister Christon Tembo
here today.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said Zambia supports the stand taken by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) condemning the coup in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He added that as a member of the OAU, Zambia will work
closely with the African body to see how best the situation in
Burundi could be normalized.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian military headed by Pierre Buyoya toppled
legitimate President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and set up a
military junta on Thursday. The military regime claimed to have
taken measures aimed at restoring peace in that country suffering
protracted tribal strifes between the Hutus and the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim A. Salim said in Nairobi today
that the OAU regarded ousted Burundian President Sylvestre
Utibantunganya as the legitimate ruler of the central African
country.

<HEADLINE> COMESA For High Quality Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia-based business
community are urged to produce high quality goods for exports to
enable the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
to have access to the international market.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was made by COMESA General Secretary Bingu Wa
Mutharika at a workshop on doing business in the COMESA here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika noted that his organization is not going to
support inefficiency in trading entities on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to establish and strengthen capabilities of
individual chambers of commerce and other similar business sector
organizations in the member states to assist the export
investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate business within the COMESA, Mutharika said the
tariff references and trade facilitation programs among member
states had been designed to enhance the competitiveness of
enterprises in the regional market and at the same time protect
industries from losing markets from non-COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop co-sponsored by the Zambia Association of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry was aimed at informing the
business community of the COMESA's principle of production and
market integration.

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Chastizes IFP Members for Infighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) could no longer tolerate the lack of internal discipline,
infighting and the undermining of colleagues, Inkatha leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said today.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi made the remarks at the IFP's annual national
congress, which starts this morning in Ulundi, Kwazulu/Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
Addressing several hundred supporters at Mandleni Camp in
Ulundi, Buthelezi said the image of the IFP had been tarnished on
many occasions by IFP members who "have not lived up to the
standards of ethics, responsibility, and dignity which we have
set for our party."
</P>
<P>
Without naming IFP members who undermined decisions taken by
the party's National Council, Buthelezi said, "it is my intention
in the future to ensure that there will be no tolerance within
the IFP for anyone who does not conduct his or her personal or
political life to the highest standards which are expected of
servants of the people."
</P>
<P>
IFP stalwart and member of the decision-making National
Council Thomas Mandla Shabalala was recently suspended from
office for two years for allegedly bringing the party into
disrepute.
</P>
<P>
On media speculation about the IFP's possible withdrawal from
the government of national unity (GNU), Buthelezi said his party
will continue to stay in the ANC-led government.
</P>
<P>
However, he dispelled reports that the IFP is seeking an
alliance with the ANC, saying the rumors probably sprang from
recent joint peace initiatives embarked on by the two parties in
Kwazulu/Natal.

<HEADLINE> Coins Worth 3 Million Canadian Dollars Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- 60 tonnes of freshly minted 2
dollars coins have been stolen from a Canadian National (CN) rail
yard in Montreal last Saturday, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 1.5 million of the polar bear engraved coins had been
shipped from the Royal Canadian Mint in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and
were on their way to a distribution center in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Thieves entered the rail yard in central Montreal, located a
tractor-trailer carrying the loot and drove off with all 60 tonnes
of it in broad daylight, Montreal police said.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest theft of coins in Canada's history,
according to the Royal Canadian Mint.
</P>
<P>
The biggest previous theft of coins in Canada occurred in 1992,
when between 60,000 and 70,000 Canadian dollars worth of
commemorative Nova Scotia quarters was stolen. They were never
found.
</P>
<P>
Recovering the coins may be very challenging, because coins
don't have serial numbers, police said.
</P>
<P>
But given the sheer volume of the shipment, the money,
totalling three million Canadian dollars (219 million U.S.
dollars) will be tracked down, police said.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions, other police departments and the
Montreal Casino have been notified of the robbery immediately. The
news went public only yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Divers Well Positioned for Platform Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese divers are well positioned
for the women's 10-meter platform final at the 26th Olympic Games
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After the semi-finals this morning, which featured four dives
of limited degree of difficulty, Fu Mingxia and Guo Jingjing of
China placed first and second respectively.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who led the preliminaries into today's semi-finals,
totalled 179.94 points from her four dives, followed by Guo in the
second place at 177.30. American veteran Mary Ellen Clark
finished third at 174.87.
</P>
<P>
Fu over-rotated slightly in each of her four dives in Friday's
preliminaries but managed to top the qualifiers with a splendid
show in the dive which gave her the highest score of the
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals, Fu dived much better, just as she promised
after the preliminary round. She took the lead after the second
dive and never looked back to win the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Guo, who beat Fu in China's Olympic trials, also found her form
after a sluggish preliminary performance.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old chalked up the highest score of 49.59 points in
the semi-finals, beating back the challenge from American Mary
Ellen Clark, who is 34 years old.
</P>
<P>
Clark didn't perform well in the preliminary and finished a
lowly 10th. She came out fresh in the semi-finals and went after
every dive in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The top 12 finishers of the semi-finals (with the total points
from preliminary and semi-finals) qualify for the final in the
evening. The points from the five-dive final plus that from the
semi-finals will determine the medalists of the event.

<HEADLINE> Deals Under Way for Hutu Leaders to Leave Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Western diplomats and the military
authorities of Burundi are bargaining "difficult deals" in
Bujumbura to allow the ousted Hutu leaders to leave the country,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, nothing has been done. No discharged leaders
have left the country Saturday," Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted
a source close to the talks as saying.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the U.S. embassy in Bujumbura told AFP
that the ousted president Sylvestre Ntibangunganya is still in the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of American diplomats went to the office building
of chief of staffs of the Burundi army this morning for the talks,
AFP quoted the same source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Leonce Ngendakumana, president of the National Assembly
dissolved by the army, is now taking refuge in the German embassy.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Hutu government and the leaders of the
presidential party of Front for the Democracy of Burundi are
hiding either in foreign missions or in the homes of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made Thursday night, the military-backed Tutsi
leader of the country Pierre Buyoya said that the security of
"those who were until today in the institutions, the outgoing
president of the republic, ministers, parliamentarians" were
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to guarantee their security. We ask them to go
back to their homes and... participate in the reconstruction,"
said Buyoya.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Warning Call Too Late for Evacuation in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The bomb exploded 18 minutes
after a telephone caller warned a 911 emergency operator of the
impending blast in Atlanta early today, too late for an evacuation
of a crowd of thousands in an open-air concert site of the
Olympics, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
The call, apparently from a man, reached the 911 operator at
1:07 a.m. and the bomb went off at 1:25 a.m., killing at least one
people and wounding 110 others, a CNN report quoted law
enforcement officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The caller, who did not give a name or identify any group or
organization, told the operator the exact site of Centennial
Olympic Park and claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The 911 call did not give enough time for law enforcement
officials to dispatch a bomb squad, but coincidentally a bomb
squad had already been summoned to the site by someone who spotted
an unattended bag, that ultimately blew up, an Associated Press
report quoted a law enforcement official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bomb squad officers saw three pipes inside the bag, but the
pipes may all have been part of one bomb rather than three
separate ones.
</P>
<P>
A police bomb squad arrived in time to look over the bag and
begin evacuating people but not soon enough to disarm it before the
blast, Justice Department spokesman Carole Florman said.
</P>
<P>
Florman said there were a number of calls after the blast
alerting authorities to other abandoned or unattended parcels in
Atlanta, but none proved to be explosives, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the games began, about 120 abandoned or suspicious
parcels have been picked up and not one of them has contained
explosives," Florman said.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Condemn Olympics Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- World leaders strongly condemned
the terrorist bombing at the Olympic Park in Atlanta early this
morning and called for tougher action against terrorism, reports
reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
A pipe bomb exploded during a rock concert at the park, at
about 1:25 a.m. U.S. eastern time (0525 GMT), killing at least one
person and injuring 110 others. A Turkish TV cameraman died of a
heart attack while covering the incident.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, describing the bombing as "an evil
act of terror," vowed to do everything possible to find the
bombers and "bring them to justice."
</P>
<P>
"The bombing at the Centennial Olympic Park this morning was an
evil act of terror...an act of cowardice that stands in sharp
contrast to the courage of the Olympic athletes," Clinton said
during a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac sent a message to Clinton and
the President of the International Olympic Committee Juan Antonio
Samaranch, denouncing the "cowardly act of aggression."
</P>
<P>
The international community "must be unanimous in its
condemnation and in its will to reinforce cooperation against
terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major said the British people "will
share the anger of the American people...they will also share
their determination not to be deterred by this evil act."
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed his belief
"that the tragedy...once again shows how important it is to
combine the efforts of all countries in the fight against
terrorism," his spokesman Sergei Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
"It's high time to take joint comprehensive measures against
terrorism," said Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded three days before a planned anti-terrorism
conference in France due to be attended by diplomats and foreign
ministers from the group of seven (G-7) leading industrialized
countries -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
the United States -- and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The conference was agreed on during the G-7 summit in Lyon,
France, in June, a few days after the June 25 truck bombing of a
U.S. military base in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 American
servicemen and injured hundreds.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, the Palestinian Authority sent its
condolences to the families of the victims and to the American
government.
</P>
<P>
"We completely condemn any kind of terrorism against civilians
anywhere," said the Authority's planning and international affairs
minister, Nabil Shaath.

With a win-loss record of 2-2, the South Koreans still keep
their medal hope alive. Their win over the United States or an
Ukraine loss to Cuba next Monday will assure the South Koreans a
spot in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans were led by Chun Eun-Sook with 29 points,
including 10 three-pointers. And four high scorers among the South
Koreans were Yoo Young-Hoo pouring with 18, Chun Joo-Weon with 16,
Jung Sun-Min with 11 and Chung Eun-Soon with 10.
</P>
<P>
The top scorer for Zaire was Mabika Mwadi with 30 points, Muene
Tshijuka added 14 for the African champion who was winless so far
from all its four outings in the six-team Gourp B.
</P>
<P>
"This is our first Olympics and it is such a different
experience for our national team," said Zaire's head coach
Mongamaluku Mozingo.
</P>
<P>
"Our team can't be compared to the other Olympic teams because
we have only been together for a year. Other teams have been
playing together for a much longer period of time," he added.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was the silver medalists at the 1984 Olympic Games.
But they lost their first two straight games here in Atlanta,
76-61 to Australia and 70-55 to Cuba, before bouncing back to take
the next two games against Ukraine and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We won against the Ukrainians the other day. But unless we win
this game (against Zaria), we wouldn't be in a position to move
into the top eight," said South Korea head coach Lee Byung-Kuk.

<HEADLINE> White Man with Accent Suspected for Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A white man with indistinguishable
accent was suspected for the bomb explosion that claimed the lives
of two people at the wee hours, a FBI agent said at noon of
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"From the 911 call, we believe it was a white male with
indistinguishable accent," said Woody Johnson, bomb expert from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
</P>
<P>
The caller of American voice "made a specific threat, indicated
a bomb at the park that will go off in 30 minutes," said the FBI
agent.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough situation, we're determining and tracing where
the call from and we have very clear indication," said Johnson who
declined to reveal details of the recorded tape.
</P>
<P>
Within two to three minutes after the bomb disposable team
arrived on spot, the pipe bomb exploded, claiming two people
including a Turkish TV cameraman Melih Uzunyol who died of heart
attack, injuring 110 others including a security officer.
</P>
<P>
"Among the injuried, 11 persons were hospitalized and all of
them are in stable conditions in various hospitals," said Bob
Brennan, spokesman of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
(ACOG).
</P>
<P>
The home-made anti-personnel frangmentation device obtained 100
yards away, with nails and screws attached, was observed first by
a security officer near the NBC tower in the park prior to the 911
call received at the Atlanta police office.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, we're not to focus on any specific individual,
but sort out facts," Johnson said, "We need time to sort out the
area, to sort out ways in order to re-advice for the organizing
committee."
</P>
<P>
"We have been provided with a number of films taken at the time
from different angles, and we're valuating these films," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rains will not hinder their investigation and "these
evidence will be flown to Washington for re-valuation," said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
At the time the pipe bomb exploded, the park was heavily
visited and the security officers were unable to disperse the
on-lookers after the arrival of the bomb disposable team.
</P>
<P>
After the explosion, 35 locations were reviewed by the FBI bomb
disposable teams who have received more than 100 calls during the
first seven day of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
So far, "we have made no arrest" and were not aware of the
motivation of the bomb, and no organization came out to claim the
responsibility for the explosion, said Johnson.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and
16 injured in a fire that broke out aboard a cruise ship
in Alaska's Inside Passage this morning.
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 3:11 a.m. local time aboard the ship
Universal Explorer and apparently began in the laundry room, Coast
Guard Lt. John Fitzgersal was quoted by the Associated Press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 617-foot ship was about two hours away from Juneau near
Admiralty Island when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said the fire was put out but re-started shortly
after 8 a.m. The flare-up was brought under control.
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether the casualties were crew members or
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The ship, owned by Commodore Cruise Lines, was carrying 730
passengers and 280 crew members, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard dispatched two cutters, a utility boat and a
helicopter from Juneau to aid the ship.
</P>
<P>
The ship was not in any danger of sinking and it was making its
way, escorted by the Coast Guard Cutter Woodruff, to Auke Bay
about 10 miles north of Juneau.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa and former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere arrived in
Uganda today for private talks with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni on the turmoil in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa arrived at the Entebbe International Airport this
afternoon for a two-day working visit to Uganda at the invitation
of President Museveni, while Nyerere arrived at the airport in
the evening.
</P>
<P>
During their visits, the two leaders will review with Museveni
the turbulent situation in Burundi within the context of the
Arusha regional peace initiative on Burundi held in Arusha,
Tanzania last month.
</P>
<P>
Retired Major Buyoya, a Tutsi military strongman staged coup
in Burundi last Thursday, citing rising insecurity and president
Ntibantunganya's failure to govern the country as reasons for the
seizure of power.
</P>
<P>
The coup sparked new fear of genocide and of a ferocious
backlash from Hutu rebels in Burundi, where around 150,000 people
have been killed in fighting between the rival tribes since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere who was here in 1994 last time to address the
country's Constituent Assembly has been trying to broker peaceful
settlement between the warring Hutu and Tutsi sides in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He recently appealed to the international community not to
support the new regime in Burundi led by Major Pierre Buyoya, and
also called for military intervention from the Organization of
African Unity and sanctions against Buyoya's regime.
</P>
<P>
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim said in Nairobi today that the OAU takes a tough
stand against Buyoya and would act against him.
</P>
<P>
"If the junta believes Africa will sit by and do nothing, then
they are deceiving themselves," Salim said, adding that the OAU
considers that S. Ntibantunganya is Burundi's legitimate ruler.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, Nyerere and Museveni are said to meet here to pave way
for an emergency African summit on Burundi next week.

<HEADLINE>   Pedgrave Becomes First Rower to Win Fourth Olympic Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- British Steve Pedgrave became the
first rower to win four Olympic titles when he and his partner
Matthew Pinsent claimed the gold medal in the men's coxless pair
in a time of 6:20.09 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The British pair, who are unbeaten since taking the Barcelona
Olympic gold medal four years ago, built a lead from the beginning
and kept their edge at the 1,000m with 3:08.97 and 1,500m with
4:47.08 before they completed the 2,000-meter race.
</P>
<P>
Australian new partnership David Weightman and Rob Scott rowed
to the silver medal 0.93 seconds behind in 6:21.02. Michel
Andrieux and Jean-Christophe Rolland of France was third 2.06
seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a good row. It's too early to comment, we're
absolutely knackered," said Redgrave, who and Pinsent won their
second Olympic gold in the pair and his fourth Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
"We took it from the start. They were never going to catch us,"
Redgrave added.
</P>
<P>
"We planned to win the race in the last 500 meters, but we
didn't have as good a race as we normally do," Weightman said.
</P>
<P>
Weightman didn't need to regret for their failure in the event,
as Megan Still and Kate Slatter won the women's coxless pair with
7:01.39, while Drew Ginn and James Tomkins took the title of the
men's coxless four with a clocking of 6:06.37.
</P>
<P>
Marnie Mcbean and Kathleen Heddle won Canada's first gold medal
of the women's double sculls at the Olympic regatta, becoming the
first Canadians ever to three gold medals. They won the women's
coxless pair in the Barcelona Olympics and were also members of
Canana's gold eight there.
</P>
<P>
Cao Mingying and Zhang Xiuyun of China won the first silver
medal in the event at the Olympic Games for their country 1.51
seconds behind the Canadians, who led soon after the start.
</P>
<P>
"We had the potential to win the gold but the winds were just
against us. We are not as strong as the Canadians who are used to
rowing against winds," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese will also join their partership to take part in the
quadruple sculls final Sunday, the last day of the rowing
competition.
</P>
<P>
In other finals, Yekaterina Khodotovich of Belarus beat
favorite Silken Laumann of Canada to win the crown of the women's
single sculls. Xeno Mueller from Switzerland took the men's single
sculls gold while Italians David Tizzano and Angostino Abbagnale
claimed the title of the men's double sculls.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Urged Against Liberian Warlords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the west
African countries today called for the imposition of sanctions
which can compel "Liberian factional leaders, their families,
supporters and sympathizers to sue for peace."
</P>
<P>
They also urged a meeting on Liberia to be held on August 18
to consider all outstanding issues connected with the
implementation of the Abuja peace accord, which is expected to
expire on that date.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights in the draft resolution and report
produced by the committee of nine on Liberia of the Council of
Ministers of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The committee reaffirmed that the peace agreement signed in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, last August remained the "only
workable framework for restoring durable and permanent peace to
Liberia."
</P>
<P>
The documents, produced before the 19th ECOWAS summit which
opened on Friday and ended today, said elections constituted the
final step in returning Liberia to democratic governance and
called on the ECOWAS to work in collaboration with the United
Nations to achieve this objective.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a delegation of Liberian organizations in the United
States attending the ECOWAS summit also called for the imposition
of tough sanctions on the warring factions in the war-ravaged
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry
has decided to put off his visit to Saudi Arabia, which was
scheduled for Sunday, because of a bomb explosion early today in
Atlanta's Olympic Park that killed two people and wounded more
than 100.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that during his visit to the kingdom, Perry
was supposed to discuss measures of moving U.S. military bases in
Saudi Arabia to safer places, according to the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Perry has reported worked out proposals on increasing security
measures following the June 25 bombing of a U.S. military complex
near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in which 19 Americans were killed.
</P>
<P>
No firm date has been set for a rescheduled visit by Perry, who
announced last week that the U.S. government intends to move the
its troops stationed in northern Saudi Arabia to safer places
for fear of possible attacks in the future.

<HEADLINE> French Rider Wins Woman's Sprint Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- French sprint specialist Felicia
Ballanger outsprinted Austrialia's rising star Michelle Ferris
here Saturday to capture the women's sprint title at the 26th
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Ballanger, who dominated women's track racing during the 1995
season by winning all the five events up to September, beat Ferris
in the first two races of the finals at the Stone Mountain
Velodrome outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Ballanger, 25, was the gold medalist in both women's sprint and
500 meter time trial at the 1995 World Cycling Championships in
Bogota, Colombia. In capturing the title in 500 meter time trial,
she broke her own world record with a new mark of 34.017 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The French rider was also the world's first ranked female track
cyclist in 1994, after setting a world record in Colorado Springs,
Colorado, the United States, and won a silver medal in the match
sprint in Palermo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Ferris, 20, is a secret weapon of Australia, a cycling
powerhouse. An athlete with the Warrnambool Club, she began to
show great promise when she dominated Australia's national
championships in 1994, winning four events.
</P>
<P>
She was also a three-time medalist at the Junior World
Championships in the sprint and the points race. Her breakthrough
at major international competition came at the 1995 World
Championships, when she snatched a bronze medal in women's 500
meter time trial, finishing less than 0.3 seconds behind
Ballanger.

<HEADLINE> Regional Summit on Burundi to Be Held in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state of Rwanda,
Uganda, Kenya, Zaire and Tanzania will hold a one-day summit on
Burundi situation in Arusha, Northern Tanzania next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here this evening by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said that Ethiopia
and Cameroon will attend the meeting in their capacities as
former and current OAU chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Secretary General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim will also attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Summit will be preceded by a meeting of the technical
committee comprising the foreign ministers of the invited
countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the military coup which took place in Bujumbura on
Thursday, military experts from five states of the Great Lakes
began a two-day meeting in Arusha on Friday to chart out security
assistance for that troubled central African country.
</P>
<P>
However, Burundi and Rwanda were not represented at the
experts meeting.
</P>
<P>
A source said they were going ahead with the meeting despite
the recent developments in Bujumbura because the bloodless coup
neither had backing from the states of the Great Lakes, nor from
western countries or from the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The source said a compiled report will be tabled to the
ministerial technical committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The overthrown coalition government in Bujumbura requested
security assistance be given to maintain law and order in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Benjamin Mkapa, accompanied by Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete and former President Julius Nyerere, who
is entitled to seek to settle the Burundi crisis, today went to
Kampala, Uganda to hold talks with Ugandan leaders to discuss the
situation in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Can Overcome All Difficulties: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
praised the spirit of the community which braved unimaginable
difficulties after an earthquake that shocked the world.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li was leading commemorations to mark the 20th
anniversary of the devastating quake which virtually leveled the
northern China city of Tangshan in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a grand gathering, Li said that Chinese people can
overcome all difficulties under the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which occurred in the middle of the night as most
people slept July 28, 1976, destroyed the industrial city of north
China, leaving 240,000 dead and another 160,000 seriously
injured. Western media had described Tangshan as the city that had
been wiped off the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng expressed heartfelt condolences on behalf of the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council, to the people killed in
the century's worst earthquake, which measured 7.8 on the Richter
Scale.
</P>
<P>
The premier spoke highly of the Tangshan people, who braved
unimaginable difficulties to win victory in the after-quake relief
work and reconstruction to ensure that their city was born again.
</P>
<P>
He said that the outstanding success of the earthquake relief
work, and the restoration and development work, had once again
proven incontrovertibly that the Chinese Communist Party is the
leading core of the socialist cause, the socialist system is the
correct choice of the Chinese people, and the Chinese People's
Liberation Army - who were in the vanguard of the relief work - is
the people's own army.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the changes that have taken place in the new city
display that with the spirit of self-reliance and hard working,
the Chinese people can bridge all kinds of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the spirit should be played to the full, since
Chinese people are striving to modernize the country, which calls
for hard efforts of people spanning several generations.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Chinese people to look forward and seize the
historical opportunity to bring about a brighter future for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The premier also called for closer ties between the Party, the
Government and the broad masses, adding that the basic principle
of serving the people whole-heartedly should be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Also, he called on the whole nation to push ahead with the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as guided
by Deng Xiaoping's theory and led by the Party Central Committee
with General Secretary Jiang Zemin as the core.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng and his party arrived in Tangshan on July 27. He
inspected the Anju Project (Comfort Living), paid visits to homes
of local families, factories and met people crippled in the quake,
as well as orphans who survived the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The commemorations took place in a city described as China's
most quake-proof city, after planners decided that never again
would their community suffer the horrors of an earthquake.

<HEADLINE> New Satellite Will Beam TV Pictures to Earth From August 1. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The satellite sent into orbit
from a Chinese rocket this month will be beaming TV pictures to
millions of homes from next week.
</P>
<P>
And following the successful launch the owners of the satellite
have revealed that a sister satellite will be sent into orbit from
China early in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific No. 1-A satellite will begin to provide a
telecommunications service from August 1, under a transponder
leasing contract signed in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the Radio, Film, and Television
Satellite Company of China will rent eight satellite transponders
from Hong Kong Asia-Pacific Telecommunication Company, the owners
of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
The eight transponders will replace the ChinaSat-5, a workhorse
satellite for 12 years, by providing television broadcast services
for Central China TV (CCTV), and television stations in Shandong,
Zhejiang, Sichuan provinces and Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
China successfully sent the AP No. 1-A satellite into orbit
from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Southwestern China's
Sichuan province on July 3. The satellite has been operating
smoothly in its planned orbit.
</P>
<P>
The Radio, Film, and Television Satellite Company of China
provides a wide range of services through space channels and
ground systems for China's radio and television networks.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong APT Company is a multi-national satellite company
with seven shareholder companies from China's mainland, Hong Kong,
Macao, Thailand, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The company's first satellite, Asia-Pacific No.1, went into
operation on September 15, 1994, with its 24 C-Band transponders
all leased out.
</P>
<P>
The company disclosed plans to launch a third satellite,
Asia-pacific No. 2-R, in the first quarter next year, again from
the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian athletes, both of them
bronze medalists, and one Lithuanian woman cyclist were tested
positive for stimulants, the spokeswoman of the International
Olympic Committee said here today.
</P>
<P>
The three convicted were Andrei Korneyev of Russia, bronze
medalist in the men's 200-meter breaststroke, Zafar Gouleiez of
Russia, also third-place finisher in 48-kg Greco Roman wrestling,
and Rita Razmaita of Lithuania in cycling who finished 13th in the
women's sprint.
</P>
<P>
The Russians "were tested positive for Bromantan, a stimulant
in class A and therefore their medals were disqualified," said
Michele Verdier, IOC director of media and special projects.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian woman cyclist also failed the doping test for
Bromantan, she added.
</P>
<P>
This were the first three doping cases announced by the IOC
medical commission so far as the Olympic Games was going into the
ninth-day competition here on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Repels Attacks by Kurdish Rebel Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Revolutionary Guards repelled
attacks by the forces of the Iraq-based Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) in a northwestern border area, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a local commander as saying the Iranian
forces shelled the KDP concentration centers with long-range
artillery and inflicted heavy damage.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about the casualties or the
military operations of the Iranian forces.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander said "several armed gangs composed of
bandits, smugglers and mercenaries of counter-revolutionary
grouplets crossed the border Sunday morning and attacked several
border villages."
</P>
<P>
"In encounters with the border guards the insurgents suffered
a humiliating defeat and fled to their bases inside Iraq," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards will
continue to encounter the forces of the dissolved KDP until the
"aggressors" are smashed.
</P>
<P>
The KDP radio has so far made no mention of the Sunday morning
clashes between the KDP groups and the Iranian border guards.
</P>
<P>
The radio, however, earlier reported that two Iranian
guards had been killed in the past two weeks by the KDP
forces.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, which is based inside a self-rule enclave in northern
Iraq, is fighting for an independent homeland inside Iran.
</P>
<P>
The enclave, established by the U.S.-led allies after the 1991
Gulf war, is protected by U.S., British and French warplanes based
in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Island Province Boosts Telecom Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Island residents in China's
off-shore province of Hainan have become upwardly mobile.
</P>
<P>
The island has invested more than three billion yuan in its
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The result of the phone-boom is that in the province there
are now 95,000 mobile phone users, and 426,000 pagers in use,
providing an inner-island roaming service to every subscriber.
</P>
<P>
Over 27 percent of homes in urban areas on the island are on
the telephone, and in provincial capital Haikou the figure is 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials say the growth of telecommunications on the island in
the past few years is higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Since its separation from Guangdong to become an independent
province in 1988, Hainan has completed work on a number of telecom
projects by importing state-of-the-art telephone technologies.
</P>
<P>
The island boasts digital microwave and optic fiber cables,
connecting Haikou and Guangzhou, it has a satellite ground station
in Haikou, and a program-controlled switching and analog cellular
phone network covering the whole island.
</P>
<P>
The province has 14,729 long-distance telephone lines,
as well as a switching capacity of 432,000 lines for local calls,
and 12,000 lines for its rural phone network.
</P>
<P>
 Over the next five years, the province will build three
sophisticated digital optic cables to boost its telecom link with
the mainland, and will expand its satellite ground station. It
will also complete a round-island optic loop system.

<P>
HANGZHOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- When young farmer Zhu Guobiao
hatched a plan to raise chickens his friends warned him he would
be a loser.
</P>
<P>
Now Zhu is chuckling all the way to the bank with a business
that nets 170,000 yuan a year from raising chickens.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, of Wenling City in east China's Zhejiang Province, started
to raise chickens in 1984. Just a few months later he bought
nearly 1,000 breeding chickens and eggs from Beijing.
Unfortunately the chickens and eggs were destroyed by illness just
a few days after he returned home. Determined not to be beaten,
Zhu decided to build a chicken farm in neighboring Jiangxi
Province. But the chicken house collapsed, killing over 300 fowl.
</P>
<P>
To avoid more losses, Zhu collected material and information
about chicken raising from various sources. he also sought
opinions from experts and he went to Macao to study how to raise
chickens. He also turned for help to a French fowl expert.

SEOUL, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The torrential rain which hit some
parts of South Korea in the past three days left 52 people dead,
23 missing and over 31,000 people homeless, said the Central
Anti-Calamity Headquarters here today.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that the number of casualties is likely
to increase as weathermen predicted up to 100 millimeters of more
rain for today in South Korea's capital Seoul as well as Kyonggi

JERUSALEM -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat Saturday
strongly reiterated Palestinian rights to Jerusalem, and hailed
"all martyrs who died for the cause" of the city, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to all martyrs who died for the cause of
Jerusalem starting with Ahmed Musa until the last martyr Yihye
Ayyash," Arafat told a rally of 4,000 people in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, master bombmaker of the Islamic Resistance Movement,
Hamas, was killed in Gaza in January when a cellular phone he was
using blew up, and Musa who died in 1965 was the first member of
Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which long said Ayyash was behind Islamic militant
suicide bombing attacks that killed scores of Israelis, has
refused to confirm or deny its involvement in Ayyash's
assassination.

WASHINGTON -- An investigation source said Saturday that the
explosion of Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight 800 ripped through
the front part of the plane, tearing off the cockpit and First
Class cabin, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The findings tempted investigators to speculate the blast was
caused by a bomb that exploded in the front cargo cabin of the
plane, a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
But the investigators are not ruling out the possibility of a
missile and other causes.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747 exploded soon after takeoff from New York JFK
International Airport on July 17, killing all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The source said TWA flight 800 flew without a front for 10 to
11 seconds after the initial blast. The plane was then engulfed in
a fireball approximately 9,000 feet (2,700 meters) up, according
to the report.

ANKARA -- The 70-day-long hunger strikes in the prisons

agreement was reached in Istanbul in favor of the inmates.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Deputy Mukadder Basegmez and his delegation came
out from the Bayrampasa Prison in Istanbul at 23:15 p.m. local
time and declared: "We achieved a positive result in the
framework of mutual understanding through more than 10-hour-long
talks and persuasion. Following this time, the hunger strikes in
all the jails in Turkey will end."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Writer Yasar Kemal, who is supporting the prison
hunger strikers and the member of the delegation, said that the
most important article in the agreement is that the inmates in
Eskisehir and Sakarya prisons will be taken to Umraniye Prison in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between the delegation and the

<HEADLINE> Technology Makes Guangxi Mountainous Village Rich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- People in China's Si'antou village
are flying high after shaking off desperate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Just five years ago they were doomed as being among the most
poverty stricken people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Thoughts of adventure or air travel were pie in the sky for
them. Now they have become jetsetters, as they wing their way to
big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago the mountain village in Lingchuan
County, in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was
officially labeled poverty-stricken. Travel by land, let alone by
air, was just a dream for most.
</P>
<P>
But with government help the village of 400 launched its own
bid for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 the local government listed Si'antou as a key
poverty-relief village. Experts began teaching villagers new
agricultural techniques, such as how to spread manure, control
insects and how to conduct successful businesses. Importantly they
were taught how to improve the production of the area's number one
crop, a gingko, a widely used herbal tonic.
</P>
<P>
The village reported an output of more than 400,000 kilograms
of ginkgo annually in 1994 and 1995, earning more than two million
yuan. Just a dozen ginkgo trees each brought in more than 10,000
yuan for their fruit.
</P>
<P>
Tomatoes became another rich source of income for the
villagers. The Red Diamond tomato, introduced from the South China
Agricultural University, ripens when other tomatoes wither.
</P>
<P>
Though the tomato is priced three times higher than other
varieties, it is popular in south China and southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We made our money through technology," a local farmer told
Xinhua. In the past two years net income per head in the once poor
village of 115 households exceeded 6,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> SADC Trade Officials Fail to Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development Community
(SADC) experts on trade and law at the weekend failed to finalise a
new regional trade protocol, which, when established, will see the
dismantling of barriers to free trade among member countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe National News Agency in Harare
today, SADC Industry and Trade Coordinator Abraham Pallangyo said no
agreement could be reached on the timetable for the elimination of
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
''We could not finalise the protocol as was arranged and the most
difficult part still remains... the time frame for the elimination of
tariffs,'' pallangyo said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC trade protocol seeks to boost intra-regional trade
through effective tariff reduction which will subsequently make the
region a non-tariff zone.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is pushing for the protocol as it is seen as the other
avenue to access the much protected South African Market after
protracted negotiations since 1992 for a preferential trade deal have
yielded no results yet.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that South Africa wants to prolong the
signing of the protocol to protect its domestic industry from
competition from its neighbours.
</P>
<P>
Pallangyo said a ''final'' meeting was scheduled to be held in
tanzania's capital, dar es salaam, next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's industrial growth will
exceed 10 percent in the current Iranian calendar year (starting
March 20), a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily "Iran" said that the central government will
continue the policies of stimulating production this year and
finance the industrial sector's needed resources.
</P>
<P>
Morteza Mohammad Khan, Minister of Economic and Financial
Affairs, was quoted as saying that the country experienced the
highest industrial growth rate last year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector reported an increase of 5.8 percent last
year over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate stood at 6.2 percent in the first quarter of
this year and more than 10 percent in the second, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Terming the performance of the industrial sector as very
positive during the recent years, he said that all the
government's policies are drawn to support production.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, Iran's economy grew by 4.5
percent in the last fiscal year which ended March 19, 1996. The
real gross domestic product (GDP) reached 13,880 billion rials
(about 4.6 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Death of Extremist Leader to Worsen Inner Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The death of Djamel Zitouni, the
leader of Algeria's most extremist Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
could cause bloody struggle for leadership among its factions,
the Algerian news media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The GIA released a communique Saturday on Radio Mediterranean
International in Tanger, Morocco, said Zitouni was killed on July
16 by "Algerianist renegade heretics" in his stronghold of Medea
in southwest of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The "Algerianists", supported by veteran Islamists fighting in
the Afghan War in the 80s, appear to stand opposite to the faction
of "Salafists," also known as "internationalists," who want an
expansion of Islamic radicalism.
</P>
<P>
The GIA communique also announced the nomination of the most
diehard follower of Zitouni -- Antar Zouabri -- as the new boss.
</P>
<P>
French Press Agency quoted observers in Algiers as saying that
the execution of Zitouni confirmed the profound discord within the
GIA, which declared a war several months ago on all those who
refused to "rally around its banner," including the outlawed
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Zouabri and the rejection of holding any
dialogue with other dissident Islamic radical groups show that the
followers of Zitouni will continue a hardline policy.

<HEADLINE> Officials Warned against Using Students for Ceremonies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Work units and colleges using
students to put out a welcoming mat for visitors face being
carpeted.
</P>
<P>
China's State Council has issued a circular announcing that
units are now forbidden from taking children from their lessons in
class to participate in welcoming or seeing-off ceremonies without
official approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Education Daily, some officials or
departments are organizing primary and secondary school students
to serve at meetings, visits or ceremonies, instead of attending
lessons at school.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council pointed out that
departments or individuals should not disrupt normal education in
schools.
</P>
<P>
The city government in Wangjiang County, in east China's Anhui
province, asked nearly 100 local students earlier this year to
welcome a delegation on a visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Many children suffered illness because of the cold drizzle
weather, and to make matters worse they missed their lessons.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that departments at all levels should
strictly obey the rules and regulations, pointing out that they
have no rights to organize students to participate in welcome or
farewell ceremonies without the approval from province-level
departments in charge of education.

<HEADLINE> Science Succeeds Where An Emperor Failed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese emperor Qianlong was
never able to use his dynastic influence to save Xinglong Village
from the shifting sands.
</P>
<P>
Xinglong means flourishing - the name given by Emperor Qianlong
of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Instead the village was on the
brink of extinction as families were forced to abandon their homes
as desert sands encroached.
</P>
<P>
Now people are returning to their ancestral village as modern
technology finally allows Xinglong to live up to its name.
</P>
<P>
Located 40 kilometers to Nanchang, capital city of Southeast
China's Jiangxi Province, the village had sacrificed half of its
lands to desert before the 1980s. Villagers were forced to
abandon their homes and they never expected to return.
</P>
<P>
Vast areas of north west China are covered by deserts, but few
people are aware that growing deserts also posed a threat to parts
of south China, where there are more rivers, bigger underground
water reserves and a larger forest coverage than in the north.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the changing courses of rivers,
and the excessive exploration of forests, led to desertication of
140,000 hectares of land in 17 southern provinces, including over
30,000 ha. in Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1981 Jiangxi province started to tackle the problem, helped
by the Lanzhou Desert Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, a leading desert-research body in the country.
</P>
<P>
They set up a semi-tropical wind and desert experimental
station, the first of its kind in south China.
</P>
<P>
The project has also received wide support from international
organizations, including the Commission of European Union, which
donated a large sum of money.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade local people and experts from the
institute tried ways of turning desert into farmland.
</P>
<P>
Floating sands, trees and grass were planted to protect land
from moving; soil and fertilizers were used to grow fruit trees
and vegetables. Trees were planted earlier, deeper and thicker in
a scientific way.
</P>
<P>
The experts selected over 70 species of trees, fruits and
vegetables as being suitable for desert planting. Experiments were
launched on over 8,000 ha. of desert over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have returned to our village, where the
desert-prevention forest blocks the way of wind and sand," said
Liu, who is one of the Xinglong villagers, forced to leave his
home several decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The present per-capita income of Xinglong farmers is over 1,600
yuan, 21 times that in the early 1980s. The village has become
one of the major suppliers of vegetables, fruits, eggs and meat to
Nanchang.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that Jiangxi's experience on control of desert
has inspired desert-control projects in the southern provinces of
Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan.

<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The satellite sent into orbit
from a Chinese rocket this month will be beaming TV pictures to
millions of homes from next week.
</P>
<P>
And following the successful launch the owners of the satellite
have revealed that a sister satellite will be sent into orbit from
China early in 1997.

from Hong Kong Asia-Pacific Telecommunication Company, the owners
of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
The eight transponders will replace the ChinaSat-5, a workhorse
satellite for 12 years, by providing television broadcast services
for Central China TV (CCTV), and television stations in Shandong,
Zhejiang, Sichuan provinces and Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous
regions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Criticizes Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Palestinian official
condemned the Israeli government for persisting in its current
intransigent policies.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Local Government Minister in the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), described the situation in the
Palestinian territories as "boiling."
</P>
<P>
This came in an interview broadcast by Egypt's Sawt El-Arab
Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced Saturday a closure of the West Bank following
the death of two Israelis in a drive-by shooting by unidentified
gunmen in the Jewish state. The closure has aroused anger from the
Palestinians who condemn it as "collective punishment."
</P>
<P>
"During his recent meeting with the PNA President Yasser
Arafat, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy pointed out that
neither violence nor (Jewish) settlement could go with peace,"
said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
The Likud government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed,
while pledging to honor the peace accords signed by the previous
Israeli government with the Palestinians, to expand settlements
and oppose the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government has to make up its mind and to opt for
either settlement or peace, because it cannot combine them," the
Palestinian minister added.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expressed his belief that in face of the current
situation in the Palestinian territories and the Israeli attitude
toward the peace process, it is necessary to hold an emergency
meeting of Arab foreign ministers, in accordance with the
resolutions adopted by the recent Cairo Arab summit.

MOGADISHU, July 28 (Xinhua) --Reports from the airport of
Ballidogle said the forces of Mohamed Farah Aidid have
recaptured the vicinity yesterday.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, the militiamen of General Aidid have also
claimed to have confiscated a telecommunication set, a large
number of weapons and ammunition at the airport, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
At least six people are reported to have died and more others
wounded during the forceful retreat of Ali Mahdi' militiamen from
the airport and from the main Ballidogle tarmac road.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources from the area said that Ali Mahdi's
militiamen are now regrouping themselves at Burane village, 113
km north of the capital, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Ali Mahdi's men will remain
stationed there as far as the Medina fighting in Mogadishu stands
still, but if General Aidid again squeezes his tight on Medina,
these forces will move towards the airport which is 90 km east of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
None of the radios of the warring sides spoke about the
recapture of the airport. however, the commercial airlines still
did not use the airport. According to the head of a local
airline, the airport has not been damaged by the fighting,
although the communication facilities were totally deprived from
the airport. Amir Aidid Isse, the Chairman of Africa Airlines,
said they will resume their ordinary flights early this week.
Isse has no blood relation with general Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The important Ballidogle road was open today for traffic even
though some freelance looters were seen in some part of the road
hijacking the civilian vehicles. Mogadishu has received enough
milk and vegetables today after three days of being short of
these stock.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu remains calm today inspite of the high tension in
Medina and Bosnia neighborhoods.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Says Medicines, Grain Still Short in Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China is providing more
grain, medicines and other disaster-relief material, as well as
medical teams, to its flood-stricken provinces, according to a
Red Cross Society of China official.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 medics, with 1,500 medical teams, have been
sent to flood areas of Anhui, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Hunan
and Hubei provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in east,
central and southwest China.
</P>
<P>
"But the aid is far less than what is needed in terms of
medical treatment and medicines in the vast disaster area," said
Sun Baiqiu, vice president of the RCSC.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who has just completed an inspection of the flood areas,
said the most important need at present is for more medics and
the provision of more medicine to local people to control the
spread of epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Grain, clean drinking water for human and live stock
consumption, medicines and sterilizers are the most vitally needed
things in the areas, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC has donated 11.65 million yuan (1.4 million US
dollars) of cash and materials to the areas, as well as four
million yuan's worth of grain and medicines provided by the Red
Cross Society of Hong Kong, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 200,000 US dollars, 1,250 sterilizing sprays,
and 400 tons of rice donated by the Taiwan Red Cross, have been
shipped to Guangzhou City.
</P>
<P>
Cash and materials worth 500,000 yuan, presented by the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies,
are to be sent to flood-hit areas in near future.
</P>
<P>
"The RCSC will continue to issue appeals for aid from overseas
and the international red cross organizations while organizing
donating activities at home," Sun told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
East China's Shanghai City has raised more than 2.6 million
yuan in donations for people overwhelmed by serious floods.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain since late June has caused severe flooding in
southern parts of China, leaving hundreds of people dead,
thousands homeless and causing heavy economic losses.
</P>
<P>
"The serious floods in China have aroused widespread attention
from overseas and the international red cross and red crescent
organizations," Sun acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Sun said she will accompany representatives of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent to inspect
flood-stricken areas in Hunan and Hubei.
</P>
<P>
Working groups sent by the RCSC and the Red Cross Society of HK
are distributing disaster-relief material in Guizhou and Guangxi,

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Vows to Invigorate Economy, Reform Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today vowed to foster new industries through
deregulation and to reform education.
</P>
<P>
"We have to foster industries that will lead the next era after
automobiles," the Kyodo News Service quoted the prime minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"If new industries cannot start off because of regulations by
the central and local governments, we have to change them."
</P>
<P>
Japan's auto industry, which has helped bring about this
insular country's rapid economic growth after World War II, is now
facing strong challenge from the United States, Germany, South
Korea and other countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in the central Japanese city of Nagoya, Hashimoto
also said Japan's educational system needs reform.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's educational system must be changed as well," he said,
noting that Japan, among developed nations, has the lowest
percentage of college students who go on to graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
The percentage, he said, is a "yardstick" reflecting a nation's
pool of talents in research.

</P>
<P>
Underground reports indicate that Aidid is currently being
treated at a residential house of his relatives near the

</P>
<P>
The doctors had also consoled the relatives that he is
recovering very soon.
</P>
<P>
The word of his wounds was first heard from the Radio North
Mogadishu supporting Aidid's main rival, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, on
July 23.
</P>
<P>
The radio announced that Aidid has been seriously wounded in
the fighting in Medina. Quoting sources close to the doctors of
Aidid, it said Aidid has received one round of an anti-aircraft
heavy machine gun in the abdominal near the lower intestine
above the kidney.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from the Jalaf subclan of Aidid indicate
that his wounds are not life threatening.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Qanyare, "Interior Minister" of Aidid self-styled
government has denied the report. However, local newsmen who

been refused access. enditem

<HEADLINE> More People Relieved out of Poverty in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Three million people in southwest
China's Yunnan Province have been relieved out of poverty over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
The people are inhabited in the province's 73 mountainous
counties which had poor infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, governments at various levels in the province have
put billions of yuan in the construction of power plants, railway
lines, highways, reservoirs, as well as other projects to improve
agricultural conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Manwan power plant, costing more than one billion yuan
(about 120 million US dollars), went into operation last year. It
has an installed capacity of 1.25 million kw and is able to
provide abundant electricity to the province's southwestern part.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a better infrastructure, the province is
carrying out integrated agricultural development of its mountains,
rivers, farmlands, forests and roads.
</P>
<P>
In addition to agricultural production, industrial and service
businesses are growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the per capita net income of farmers in
the 73 counties reached 459 yuan in 1995, an increase of 251 yuan
over 1990.

SHANGHAI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A dog has been stung to death by
a swarm of bees after it ate up a few bees in Xin'an town of
Xishan City in east China's Jiangsu Province, according to the
local Jiefang (Liberation) Daily.
</P>
<P>
A farmer, surnamed Sun, who earns a living by beekeeping, tied
his dog to a tree to look after his beehives.
</P>
<P>
The dog decided to eat a few bees, and it cost him his
life. The bees in three of the hives became agitated and swarmed
the dog. All the pet could do was bark as he suffered multiple bee
stings. When farmer Sun ran to the rescue, the dog had already
collapsed and died shortly afterwards, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The torrential rain which hit some
parts of South Korea in the past three days left 52 people dead,
23 missing and over 31,000 people homeless, said the Central
Anti-Calamity Headquarters here today.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that the number of casualties is likely
to increase as weathermen predicted up to 100 millimeters of more
rain for today in South Korea's capital Seoul as well as Kyonggi
and Kangwon Provinces which were hit hardest by the recent
downpours.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead are 45 soldiers. Most of them fell to the
victims of the torrential downpours while sleeping in their
barracks in Kangwon Province which borders with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The three days of downpours inundated 3,760 hectares of
farmland, 7,967 houses and 6,389 units of other structures,
leaving 31,865 people homeless, according to the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The rain also destroyed a total of 1,638 meters of roads, 9,522
meters of streams and 165 irrigation facilities, causing over 8
million U.S. dollars of property damage.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam today instructed
ministries and government agencies concerned to come up with
comprehensive measures to help the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
He also requested Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung to pay a visit to
the military units and the most serious flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy decided today to provide
175 million U.S. dollars, taken from the reserve fund, for the
flood victims to help themselves recover from the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Syria Emphasizes Inseparability of Syrian, Lebanese Tracks in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Syria intends to resist Israel's
plans to deal individually with the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli tracks of the Middle East peace process, Syrian
newspaper "Teshreen" said in its editorial today.
</P>
<P>
The paper made it clear that the government of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is maneuvering to disconnect the
inseparable Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the peace process, to
drag Lebanon into "a shameful peace" that would give Israel a free
hand to manage its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Teshreen" added that the current Israeli government has
refused -- as those which preceded it did -- to execute the
relevant U.N. resolutions, including the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the peace longed for by all the
Arabs is the one that would remove Israeli occupation and restore
the occupied lands and usurped rights of the Arabs, but Israel has
announced it will not withdraw from the Golan Heights, south
Lebanon, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, and that it
will not halt the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"After the Natanyahu government's policy has been widely
denounced at both the Arab and international levels, this
government is attempting to absorb the indignation of world public
opinion by uttering baseless peace allegations that are not even
worth discussing," Teshreen said.
</P>
<P>
The way to peace, it continued, is well-known and consists of a
complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, south Lebanon,
East Jerusalem and the West Bank in addition to respecting the
rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to
self-determination and establishment of an independent Palestinian
state.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Called to Shore up Bourse in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Bodi
Chunnananda, concerned with plunging stock exchange index, has
called an urgent meeting to boost foreign investors' confidence
and to woo back their funds to the Thai bourse.
</P>
<P>
Between June 11 and July 24, the Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index dropped 115.77 points, or 9.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting on Saturday, Bodi said the government would
try to persuade local brokers to use about five billion baht (200
million US dollars) to prop up local stock prices.
</P>
<P>
The sum is part of the 30 billion baht (1.2 billion dollars)
liquidity fund established in November last year after a
disgruntled investor attempted suicide to protest to the
government about the bearishness of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
However, Bodi said market mechanisms would be allowed to
function at the SET without interference from the authorities.
</P>
<P>
He added that local 'road shows' would be organized, for the
benefit of 25 leading brokers from Hong Kong, Singapore, London
and other centers, to try to give a clearer picture of the
fundamentals of the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Bodi added that in the longer term, the government will try to
boost the competitiveness of exports, restructure industries,
mobilize savings and restructure loans for stock investment.

<HEADLINE> Beautiful Weihai Attracts Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Weihai, a scenic coastal city in
east China's Shandong Province, declined several dozen overseas
businesses to invest in its economic development zone in the past
three years, which pledged to pour 180 million US dollars into the
area.
</P>
<P>
The reason is clear and simple: the businesses do not meet
local environmental protection requirements. The result is
conspicuous: many international hi-tech business giants have been
attracted to the beautiful city, including Daewoo from the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Weihai, the first national sanitary city in the country, has
attached great importance to both ecological environment and
economic development from the start of the economic development
zone. It has encouraged hi-tech, high value-added, low-consumption
and environment-friendly projects.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the development zone has invested more
than ten million yuan in building public green area. The forest
coverage in the zone has reached 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, in the past three years, the development
zone has attracted 209 overseas-funded projects, involving 310
million US dollars of investment. Sixteen of the projects involve
an investment of over ten million US dollars each. All the
enterprises meet the environmental protection requirement.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Reiterates Palestinian Rights to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat Saturday strongly reiterated Palestinian rights to
Jerusalem, and hailed "all martyrs who died for the cause" of the
city, Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to all martyrs who died for the cause of
Jerusalem starting with Ahmed Musa until the last martyr Yihye
Ayyash," Arafat told a rally of 4,000 people in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, master bombmaker of the Islamic Resistance Movement,
Hamas, was killed in Gaza in January when a cellular phone he was
using blew up, and Musa who died in 1965 was the first member of
Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which long said Ayyash was behind Islamic militant
suicide bombing attacks that killed scores of Israelis, has
refused to confirm or deny its involvement in Ayyash's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was reportedly incensed that Last Thursday, Israel
allowed members of the Temple Mount Faithful group onto the
mount, calling the move "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday which marked this year's Tisha Be'av, "the Ninth
of the Jewish month of Av," a somber and mournful day,
commemorates several disasters which befell the Jewish people
throughout their history on this day.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens of members of the Temple Mount Faithful were
allowed to enter the Temple Mount by pairs Thursday, and each
pair was accompanied by policemen to prevent them from praying
and to ensure the visit did not provoke unrest.
</P>
<P>
In a communique released Saturday, the Palestinian Authority
cabinet called Israel's move "a barefaced challenge to Moslem
feelings and an Israeli attempt to intensify the atmosphere in
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's speech, Arafat called for a meeting of the
Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
He also said that U.N. resolutions enshrining the principle of
trading land for peace applied to east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured east Jerusalem from the Jordanian authorities
during the "Six Day War" in 1967, and has been insisting that
Jerusalem is the "eternal and undivided capital" of the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has banned Jewish worship since 1967 at the
Temple Mount, on grounds it would spark unrest among the Moslem
population, who regard the place as their third holiest place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians, who make up the majority of the
residents in east Jerusalem, also claimed the city as the capital
of a future Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Protects Maritime Resources with New Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province in east China
has issued a set of regulations to better protect the ecological
environment of an ocean nature reserve and promote scientific
studies.
</P>
<P>
The 196-sq-km Nanji Islands State Ocean Nature Reserve, the
first in China, was designated in 1990 with the approval of the
central government.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people live on the islands, which are 50 km away
from the continent, and the disparity between people's production
and the reserve's protection is large.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the new regulations, the county government
of Pingyang, which the reserve belongs to, has issued a circular
and organized a supervision contingent to protect the ecological
circumstances more effectively.
</P>
<P>
A three-level protection will be implemented for the
reserve: the first-level protection area will be closed and
original residents will be removed out. In the second- and
third-level protection areas, fishery operations will be limited
by quotas.
</P>
<P>
Sandy, muddy and rocky beaches, winding coastlines, warm flows
and a confluence of different rivers endow the area with a unique
ecological environment where ocean-life can thrive.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the reserve area is home to 421 species
of shellfish and 174 species of algae, accounting for a quarter of
the country's total; 22 species of shellfish have not been found
in other maritime waters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there exist nearly 1,000 species of fish, shrimp,
crab, seed plants and vertebrates.

<HEADLINE> Prison "Death Fast" Strikes End in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The 70-day-long hunger strikes in
the prisons throughout Turkey ended at last late Saturday night
after an agreement was reached in Istanbul in favor of the
inmates.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Deputy Mukadder Basegmez and his delegation came
out from the Bayrampasa Prison in Istanbul at 23:15 p.m. local
time and declared: "We achieved a positive result in the
framework of mutual understanding through more than 10-hour-long
talks and persuasion. Following this time, the hunger strikes in
all the jails in Turkey will end."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Writer Yasar Kemal, who is supporting the prison
hunger strikers and the member of the delegation, said that the
most important article in the agreement is that the inmates in
Eskisehir and Sakarya prisons will be taken to Umraniye Prison in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between the delegation and the
inmates after 12 hunger strikers died in different prisons in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The prison hunger strikes had spread to 52 jails in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Following the statement issued by Basegmez for the end of the
hunger strikes, the inmates in poor health have been rushed to
hospitals in the country for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikes started 70 days ago after the then Justice
Minister Mehmet agar published a series of restrictive decrees in
May and opened the Eskisehir Prison which the inmates describe as
a coffin.
</P>
<P>
After the establishment of the new coalition government, the new
Justice Minister Sevket Kazan from the pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP) abolished the previous decrees but published another set in
their place.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners claimed that the new decrees were no different
from the former and changed nothing. So the protesting inmates
turned the hunger strike into a death strike.

<HEADLINE> 16 Soldiers Killed in PKK Ambush in Eastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen soldiers of the Turkish
security forces were killed and 21 others wounded in an ambush by
the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in Hakkari
province, eastern Turkey, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish daily Milliyet said that the Turkish security forces,
who returned from the military operations against the PKK near
northern Iraq late Friday night, fell into an ambush in
Cayirli village of Cukurca town in Hakkari and suffered heavy
casualties caused by the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were rushed to Hakkari State Hospital for
treatment, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel strongly condemned this PKK
attack against the Turkish government troops.
</P>
<P>
However, the security forces wiped out 25 PKK rebels in
the provinces of hakkari, Sirnak, Bitlis, Batman and Diyarbakir
in the recent military operations against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year guerrilla war for self-rule
in southeastern Turkey and over 21,000 people, including the PKK
rebels, civilians and government troops have been killed since
then.

<HEADLINE> Report Finds Explosion at Front of TWA Crashed Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- An investigation source said
today that the explosion of Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight 800
ripped through the front part of the plane, tearing off the
cockpit and First Class cabin, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The findings tempted investigators to speculate the blast was
caused by a bomb that exploded in the front cargo cabin of the
plane, a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
But the investigators are not ruling out the possibility of a
missile and other causes.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747 exploded soon after takeoff from New York JFK
International Airport on July 17, killing all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The source said TWA flight 800 flew without a front for 10 to
11 seconds after the initial blast. The plane was then engulfed in
a fireball approximately 9,000 feet (2,700 meters) up, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said some passengers in First Class cabin were thrown out of
the plane by the force of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are still searching for sheet metal from the
front of the plane to get more evidence needed to determine the
cause.
</P>
<P>
According to the data from the plane's two "black boxes," the
flight was operating normally in the minutes before the
explosion. The crew conversation was customary, and the captain's
final words were a routine order to increase altitude. After that
a loud sound was recorded before the flight tape ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
After the voice tape ends, the plane continued to be tracked by
radar for 41 seconds. Radar records indicate the plane was
disabled at 13,700 feet (about 4100 meters) and the engines
probably continued to run as it descended and burst into a
fireball at 8,500 feet (2550 meters) a blast probably fed by jet
fuel, the report said.

<HEADLINE> West African Leaders End Discussions on Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOMAS) has concluded a two-day summit in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria, where leaders of the 16 member nations held
discussions on regional economic and political situation, and
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued on Friday at the end of the
meeting which reached here early this morning, the heads of state
and government attending the meeting were satisfied with the
performance of the west African economy during the past year.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, however, expressed disappointment at the outcome
of the recent meeting of the group of 7 in Lyon, France, when the
world's most industrialised countries only agreed to forgive the
debts of six African countries, suggested by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the west African integration process, the
leaders acknowledged that ECOWAS only gained very modest
achievements and therefore decided to take some measures to step
up economic development in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government also expressed satisfaction
with the steady progress that is being made in west Africa and,
particularly, the peaceful change of government through the
electoral process in a number of member states.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the Liberian crisis within the context of
regional peace and security, condemning the leaders of the
Liberian warring factions who have failed to honor their pledge
to submit their troops to disarmament and demobilisation as they
agreed in the Abuja peace agreement signed last August.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government unanimously elected Nigeria
as chairman of the community for the 1996-1997 period, and
decided to hold the next summit in Abuja. But the date is yet to
be determined.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government of 11 member nations attended
the two-day summit, while five other members sent representatives
to the meeting. The secretary-general of the Organisation of
African Unity and the United Nations secretary-general's special
envoy on Liberia were among the observers to the session, the
communique said.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Leaders to Focus on Regional Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of west African countries
have decided to focus their attention on the acceleration of the
regional economic integration process though they have to deal
with other important issues.
</P>
<P>
At the 19th Summit of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), which ended on Friday in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, the heads of state and government agreed that ECOWAS
only gained very modest achievement in the regional integration
process during the past year.
</P>
<P>
To beef up the process, the leaders have decided to give
priority to the following programs:
</P>
<P>
-- community levy. According to a protocol adopted at the
summit, a 0.5 percent tax on the value of imports from third
countries to any member states shall be imposed so as to provide
ECOWAS with an autonomous source of funds. All member states are
appealed to ratify the protocol on the community levy before
December 31, 1996 and to start implementation on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
-- value added tax. To encourage increased intra-community
trade on a non-discriminatory basis, the summit adopted a
protocol instituting within ECOWAS member states a consumer tax
known as value added tax, which replaces the other indirect taxes
on turnover.
</P>
<P>
-- harmonisation of economic policies of member states. To
this end, the summit endorsed the decision on the limitation of
government borrowing from the central bank to 0-10 percent of
fiscal revenue or 2-3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
-- the trade liberalisation scheme: In order to accelerate
implementation of the scheme and encourage direct foreign
investment in the region, it was decided that the 25 percent
minimum indigenous participation in the equity capital of
companies should be removed as a condition for eligibility under
the plan.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government also adopted an ECOWAS
statistics policy to facilitate the accelerated development of
statistics in member states, and decided the second ECOWAS trade
fair shall be held from February 26 to March 7, 1999 in Accra,
capital of Ghana.  enditem

<HEADLINE> West African Leaders Call for Another Meeting on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of west African countries
have called for another meeting to consider the various issues on
the Liberian peace process as contained in the agreement signed
last August in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the committee of nine on Liberia of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) should be
convened by the new ECOWAS chairman not later than August 18 this
year, said an ECOWAS news release which reached here early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The request was made at a two-day ECOWAS summit which ended in
Abuja on Friday. Nigeria was ''unanimously'' elected as chairman
of the community for the 1996-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The news release said heads of state and government at the
summit regreted that hopes raised by the Abuja peace accord were
dashed through the failure of the leaders of the Liberian warring
factions to honor their pledge to submit their troops to
disarmament and demobilisation.
</P>
<P>
They condemned the renewed fighting which broke out in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia in early April this year and
involved all the warring factions, thus ending the ceasefire and
depriving the city of Monrovia of its safe haven status.

<HEADLINE> Ballanger Captures Woman's Sprint Title at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- French sprint specialist Felicia
Ballanger outsprinted Austrialia's rising star Michelle Ferris
here today to capture the women's sprint title at the 26th Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Ballanger, who dominated women's track racing last season by
winning each of the five events up to September, beat Ferris in
the first two races of the finals at the Stone Mountain Velodrome
outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Haringa of the Netherland received the bronze medal. She
lost the first race to Annett Neumann of Germany, but won the
second race and edged Neumann by less than one hundredth of a
second in the third to win bronze medal race.
</P>
<P>
"Since Barcelona I have learned a lot," said Ballanger after
the finals. "In the past four years, I have matured and learned to
have fun. Your have to be mature to win a gold."
</P>
<P>
Ballanger, 25, was the fourth in the sprint at the 1992
Barcelona Games. But she became the gold medalist in both women's
sprint and 500 meter time trial at the 1995 World Cycling
Championships in Bogota, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The French rider was also the world's first ranked female track
cyclist in 1994, after setting a world record in Colorado Springs,
Colorado, the United States, and won a silver medal in the match
sprint in Palermo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot relax now, " Ballanger said. "We have the World
Championships in a month and I hope can with the title there." She
also said she hopes she can go to Sydney for the next Olympic
Games in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ferris, 20, is a young and rising star of Australia, a cycling
powerhouse. An athlete with the Warrnambool Club, she began to
show great promise when she dominated Australia's national
championships in 1994, winning four events.
</P>
<P>
She was also a three-time medalist at the Junior World
Championships in the sprint and the points race. Her breakthrough
at major international competition came at the 1995 World
Championships, when she snatched a bronze medal in women's 500
meter time trial, finishing less than 0.3 seconds behind
Ballanger.

<P>
Michele Timms was the best scorer for the Aussies with a
game-high 26 points.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, who won their first three games by a winning

<P>
In their last group game on Monday, the Australians will face
Ukrainians who have 2-2 after an 87-75 win over Cuba earlier on

<HEADLINE> Military Chief Says Jakarta Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Major General Sutiyoso, military
commander in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, asked the people here
to remain calm and alert following the takeover of the
headquarters of Indonesian democratic party (PDI) by supporter of
PDI new leader Soerjadi.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Jakarta is fully under control, he said last
night to local press, the official Antara news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The PDI headquarters in central Jakarta was abandoned after
clashes between supporters of Soerjadi and those of Magawati
Sukarnoputri on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The control of the abandoned headquarters was handed over to
the local police for security purpose after supporters of Soerjadi
managed to take over the headquarters from the Magawati camp.
</P>
<P>
Clashes started at about 5:30 local time, injuring tens of
people. Some government buildings including a bank and several
department stores were damaged and some buses were set ablaze,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
"The number of injured people is no more than 20 and they were
being evacuated. The incident has claimed no lives," Sutiyoso
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had ordered security personnel to act firmly,
professionally and proportionately in connection with the matter
and urged rioters to immediately stop their brutal actions.
</P>
<P>
"We will not hesitate to take stern measures if they continue
with their brutal actions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, daughter of Indonesian late president Sukarno, was
elected in 1993 to a five year term as party leader. She was
ousted as leader of the party by the breakaway faction last month
at a congress in Medan, North Sumatra. She was replaced by
Soerjadi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian armed forces Chief General Feisal Tanjung
said last night the security authorities have arrested 176 people
during the riots.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that those found guilty will be tried, adding
that nobody was killed in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
Three days ago, President Soeharto received the Excessive
Committee members of PDI led by Soerjadi. The government had
earlier recognized the Soerjadi faction and agreed to allow the
faction to take part in the general election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has three parties, namely the ruling party Golkar,
the United Development Party (PPP) and PDI. The three parties will
compete for 425 out of 500 seats in the parliament in next year's
elections, the remaining 75 seats are reserved for the armed
forces, which will not take part in the elections.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Croatia beat title-holder Italy
7-6 in the semifinals of the Olympic water polo tournament on
Saturday and face 1992 silver medalist Spain in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, beaten by both Italy and the United States in the
preliminary round-robin group series, raised their game when the
stakes were higher in a match which went into extra-time with the
score at 4-4 at the end of normal time.
</P>
<P>
Four-goal Josko Krekovic was the Croatian hero, scoring with a
penalty to level the score at 6-6 midway through the second period
of extra-time and netting the winner, again from a penalty, just
10 seconds from the end.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, only third in their preliminary group, beat Yugoslavia
8-6 in Friday's quarter-final battle.
</P>
<P>
Italy had won all their previous matches in this tournament,
defeating Russia 11-9 in the quarter-finals.

They came to Atlanta as both Olympic and world champions,
having beaten Spain in the respective finals of Barcelona 1992 and
Rome 1994.
</P>
<P>
Spain beat former champion Hungary 7-5 in the other semifinal,
scoring three times in the final quarter to overhaul a Hungarian
lead. Salvador Gomez scored four goals for Spain.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Merlene Ottey of Jamaica beat her
nemesis Gwen Torrence of the United States in the women's
semifinal first group with a time of 9.93 seconds here this
evening in the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, 36, who was beaten by Torrence at last year's world
championships, has tried to avoid the American in any race after a
war of words broke out in Gothenborg in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Torrence, a local sprinter whose 200m gold medal was stripped
off after she stepped out of her lane in the world championship
final, clocked 10.97.
</P>
<P>
In the second semifinal group, Olympic champion Gail Devers of
the United States cruised home first in 11.00. She turned in a
10.92 clocking in the first heat, and looked in a superb form to
defend her title.
</P>
<P>
Irina Privalova of Russia, Olympic and world bronze medalist
both for the 100m and 200m, failed to qualify for the final. The
Russian great was timed 11.31 in the semifinals. The final will be
held later this evening.

<HEADLINE> Top Seeds Advance in Olympic Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Men's and women's singles top
seeds Andre Agassi and Monica Seles, both from the United States,
advanced into the quater-finals of the tennis tournament at the
Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi rallied from first set deficit to beat Italy's Andrea
Gaudenzi 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 while Seles outplayed Argentina's Gabriela
Sabatini 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the Agassi-Gaudenzi match, it once appeared that the top
seed might be ousted. Gaudenzi, ranked 38th in the world, won the
first set 6-2 and led 3-0 in the second. But Agassi turned up his
game and won 12 of the next 15 games.
</P>
<P>
"I had confidence in winning the match," said Agassi. "When I
got break back in the second, I felt I was starting to work the
point."
</P>
<P>
Agassi will face South Africa's Wayne Ferreira, the fifth seed
in the Olympics on Monday. Ferreira defeated Todd Woodbridge of
Australia 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Denfending champion Marc Rosset of Switzerland produced the
day's upset when he was ousted by Renzo Furlan of Italy at 6-0,
4-2.
</P>
<P>
Rosset, who has never won a grand slam title in his career, was
forced to retire in the second set when he was lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what has happed today, but I cannot stand up," he
said. "I lost my balance when I have to serve and I feel like
really no power in my legs and everything is going wrong."
</P>
<P>
Furlan will meet Leander Paes of India in the quarter-finals.
The Indian defeated Thomas Enquvist of Sweden 7-5, 7-6 for a top
eight spot.
</P>
<P>
While in the Seles-Sabatini match, 11 double faults doomed the
upset bid of the Argentinian, who is playing her first competition
after missing the last three months with an injury.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lamm Vying for Spot in Reform Party Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Richard Lamm, former governor
of Colorado, said Saturday he is "sure" he is on the ballot to
face Ross Perot for the Reform Party presidential nomination and
plans to announce his vice presidential pick in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I need to show the public that I choose good people," Lamm was
quoted by the Associated Press as saying in an interview at his
Denver home.
</P>
<P>
"I need to explain to a public that doesn't know me that I can
not only make hard decisions about the future of the country, but
I can attract and surround myself with good people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reform Party officials said Friday two candidates have
qualified for the Reform Party's ballot by receiving at least 10
percent support in a preference survey mailed to some 1 million
party members. The names of the finalists were to be officially
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Lamm and Perot were the candidates, Reform Party
national coordinator Russ Verney said, "It's a reasonable
assumption...I would suspect it was those two."
</P>
<P>
But Lamm said he was sure that "there are only two of us on the
ballot."
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party will pick its nominee at two conventions,
August 11 at Long Beach, California, and August 18 at Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania, where the winner will be announced.
</P>
<P>
Lamm said he will make his vice presidential choice "not next
week probably, but the following week."
</P>
<P>
Reform Party officials have said they would work with Lamm to
make the process "as fair as possible." But the Lamm camp is
still battling to get a list of the estimated 1.3 million Reform
Party members.
</P>
<P>
"I love being in this race and I think I can beat Perot in his
own party, but I am disturbed that the so-called Reform Party is
not more open and doesn't understand the need for a level playing
field," said Lamm, who was three times elected governor of
Colorado as a Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Harrison Wins Triple Jump Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenny Harrison of the United
States took the men's triple jump gold by producing his best
personal result on Saturday at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old American became only the second man to jump
over 18 meters when he recorded an Olympic record of 18.09 meters.
He defeated Britain's world record holder Jonathan Edwards and
Olympic champion Mike Conley of the United States in the process.
</P>
<P>
World champion Edwards failed to register a jump in his opening
two attempts but lifted his form in the fourth round to take
second place. The result marked Edwards' first defeat in a
competition since the end of the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
Edwards, the only other jumper to have gone over the mark, took
the silver medal with 17.88 with Cuba's Yoelbi Quesada winning
bronze with 17.44 meters. Conley finished fourth with 17.40.
</P>
<P>
Harrison has not won a major title since the 1991 world
championship in Tokyo at the end of his most consistent season.
</P>
<P>
The American, who jumped a wind-assisted 18.01 meters in the
same Atlanta stadium in June and pledged before the Games that he
would jump further than any man in history, opened the competition
with a brilliant 17.99 to take the lead. He went over the magic 18
meters mark in the fourth round.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Denies Change of Policy Toward Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Colombia has not changed
its policy toward drug-trafficking and does not oppose the
creation of an international court to try atrocious crimes,
Justice Minister Carlos Medellin said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia asked the United Nations in April to exclude
drug-trafficking and money laundering from atrocious crimes,
Medellin said in a letter published today by the "El Tiempo" daily.
</P>
<P>
Medellin said that he did not oppose the creation of an
international court to try atrocious crimes, such as inhumanity,
aggression, torture, bondage and genocide.
</P>
<P>
But he said crimes related to the trafficking of drugs and
money laundering should not be included as a crime under the
projected international jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The minister repeated his opposition to the creation of an
international court against the mafia.
</P>
<P>
Medellin said that Colombia has fought, is fighting, and will
fight drug cartels and drugs themselves.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the problem of drugs requires a comprehensive
and balanced treatment.
</P>
<P>
"This means that penalties should be applied as well to
producers of chemicals, drug consumers, arms traffickers and money
launderers," Medellin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- European sharpshooters showed
their prowess in the sport by sweeping 10 titles out of 15 on
offer while the Chinese saved some face for Asia after a
second-place finish in the Olympic shooting medal count.
</P>
<P>
Topping the world is Russia, which hauled in three golds, two
silvers and one bronze, just one gold more than China.
</P>
<P>
Germany placed third with a 2-2-0 record. It was followed by
Italy at 2-1-2 and Australia at 2-0-1.
</P>
<P>
More countries have struck gold this time around.
</P>
<P>
Nine countries have won gold against six in the Barcelona Games
and Chinese head coach Zhang Heng regarded it as a signal of
better prospect for shooting.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good signal for the sport," Zhang said. "The shooting
had been a neglected sport because it wasn't so spectacular. An
increased title-winning rank means more countries are paying
attention to this sport."
</P>
<P>
The Olympic shooting tournament was dotted with upsets as
German rapid fire pistol shooter Ralf Schumann was the only one to
successfully defend the title.
</P>
<P>
Except Schumann and Chinese running target shooter Yang Ling, a
dozen of world record holders have been denied gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Vessela Letcheva, world record holder of the women's
air and standard rifle events, came out 13th in the air and 12th
in standard.
</P>
<P>
Italy sent world record holders Giovanni Pellielo and Marcello
Tittarelli and mult-time World Cup winner Marco Venturini to the
men's trap event. The best finish of the trio was a co-13th.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day tournament also witnessed one world record
tumbled and other two levelled.
</P>
<P>
German Christian Klees Thursday evened the world record of 600
points in the men's free rifle qualifying round and then bettered
the world final mark of 703.5 by 1.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Italian Ennio Falco tied the world record of 125 points en
route to winning the men's skeet title on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Financing of Nicaraguan Elections Still Pending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Five days before the electoral
campaign, Nicaraguan authorities have not agreed on the amount of
the financing to be provided to the parties in the general
elections in October.
</P>
<P>
The funds should have been delivered on July 7-19 since the
campaign begins on August 2, according to the electoral schedule.
</P>
<P>
Some of the candidates have threatened to boycott the elections
if the government does not provide them with the financing.
</P>
<P>
The government and legislatives have met several times with the
electoral authorities for reaching an agreement on the amount of
the funds, but no consensus was reached.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 General Budget for the Republic establishes that 15
percent of the Supreme Electoral Council budget will go to
political organizations running in the race, which means the
government will get 17 million cordobas (2 million U.S. dollars)
and other political parties will receive 30-70 million cordobas
(3.5-8.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Emilio Pereira today pledged to provide the
financing before August 2.
</P>
<P>
The government, the legislative and the electoral authorities
announced that they will hold another round of talks later today.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite a bomb explosion in the
small hours, competition at the 26th Olympic Games here went
on Saturday with the creation of two resounding new world records.
</P>
<P>
The five-ringed Olympic flag flew at half-mast and a minute's
silence was observed at all sports venues in memory of the
victims of the bomb attack on revellers at an open-air rock
concert in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Donovan Bailey proved himself as the world's fastest
human after he won the men's 100m final in 9.84 seconds, shedding
one-hundredth of a second off the old world record set by
American Leroy Burell in 1994. Namibian Frank Fredericks was
second in 9.89 seconds and Ato Bolden of Trinidad and Tobago was
third in 9.90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The race was so tense and thrilling that there were three false
starts for which defending champion Linford Christie of Britain
was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
Gail Devers of the U.S. beat off a serious challenge from
Jamaica's Merlene Ottey to win the women's 100m race for the
second time. Both were clocked 10.94 seconds, but a photo finish
put Devers in front.
</P>
<P>
Russia's strongman Aleksey Petrov showed his worth when he
set a new world record in the 91kg category of weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
He snatched 187.5kg to improve on the old mark of 186kg he
created at the 1994 world championships in Istanbul, Turkey.
Later, he tried to jerk 227.5kg to break the two-lift world mark,
but failed. Nevertheless, he took the gold medal on a total of
402.5kg.
</P>
<P>
After eight days of competition, a total of 17 world records
have been broken on 22 occasions at the Games, four in the
swimming, 11 in weightlifting and one each in cycling and
shooting.
</P>
<P>
France reaped three gold medals Saturday to move to the third
place in the overall medals table, with 10 golds, after the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Amat won the men's free rifle three position final.
Felicia Ballanger secured the women's sprint crown by beating
Australia's rising star Michelle Ferris, and then a French quartet
followed suit taking the men's team pursuit title.
</P>
<P>
Australia netted two golds and three silvers, moving ahead of
Italy in the medals standing.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Finland won
their first Olympic gold medal Saturday. Norway and Denmark got
their first medals of lesser grade at the current Games.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Gail Devers of
the United States retained her Olympic women's 100 meters title on
Saturday in the Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Devers beat her old rival Merlene Ottey of Jamaica by the
narrowest of margins, timing 10.94 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old American, Ottey and world champion Gwen
Torrence, also of the United States, appeared to cross the line
together after a tremendous tussle in the Olympic final.
</P>
<P>
The three runners had to wait anxiously for several minutes
before Devers was declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
Devers, only the second woman to retain the 100 meters title,
clocked the same time as Ottey, with the Atlanta home favorite
Torrence taking bronze in 10.96.
</P>
<P>
The only other woman to achieve the feat was American Wyomia
Tyus in 1964 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
When Devers' victory was announced, her coach Bobby Kersee
rushed on to the track to congratulate her and the champion lept
into his arms.
</P>
<P>
The American runner said:"I dedicate this to my coach Bobby
Kersee. It's a time of great joy and also great sadness and all
the victims of the bombing are in my thoughts."
</P>
<P>
An explosion took place in the center of Atlanta Friday night
with two people were killed.
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Ottey, who has now won five Olympic medals but
never a gold, recalled the 1993 world championship final in
Stuttgart, Germany when she also lost on a photo-finish to Devers
with both credited in the same time.
"I can't believe that it's happened again," she said.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Minister's Dismissal Causes Drop in Uruguayan Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's peso dropped by 15
percent at trading today after Argentine Economy Minister Domingo
Cavallo was dismissed less than 24 hours ago.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine peso was quoted Friday at a buying rate of 8.10
U.S. dollars. It was sold today for 7.95 dollars and bought for
8.20 dollars, 15 percentage points lower than Friday's quotation.
</P>
<P>
Local financial sources said Cavallo's resignation had only
damaged the Argentine currency quotation but had no impact on
other currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, markets will open Monday with a bigger dollar demand
from the public to try to get rid of Argentine pesos, which will
be exchanged into dollars or Uruguayan pesos.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Davrieux, director of the Planning and Budget Office of
the Uruguayan Presidency, said economic, financial and stock
markets could suffer turbulences and possible losses because of
the change in the Argentine economic leadership.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the situation will improve in a short time
and Cavallo's dismissal will not affect the plans of the Uruguayan
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the United States
strengthened their defense and security ties by signing a joint
communique at the end of the first annual ministerial meeting here
today.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique outlines the Australian-US partnership in
all respects, including defense, security, economy, trade and
global affairs.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that it was a major step forward for the
Australian coalition government in its strive to reinvigorate and
strengthen the alliance relations with the US.
</P>
<P>
The two nations agreed that the maintenance of robust defense
forces capable of a high degree of interoperability and close
consultations on security issues of mutual interest were core
dimensions of the alliance relationship.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the Australia-US alliance played an
important role in contributing to stability and peace in the Asia
Pacific region and influencing the global environment.
</P>
<P>
The two nations emphasized the continuance of cooperation in
areas such as intelligence, training, logistics, defense science
and access to advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
The US confirmed that Australia would continue to receive
preferential access to US equipment, intelligence and military
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
In return, Australia would provide facilities for large-scale
US army training in its land.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to enhance the Australia-US joint defense
facilities arrangement, under which Australia would extend its
participation in the US ballistic missile early warning system to
2008.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique paid special attention to the Asia Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
It said that it was important to pursue a policy of
"comprehensive and open engagement with China" and to support
China's development as a secure, open and successful nation and a
strong and constructive member of the international community.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that a "one China" policy best served the
region's interest in stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In trade issues, Australia and the US agreed to "encourage
China to work with World Trade Organization (WTO) members to
accede to the WTO on a sound commercial basis and in accordance

<HEADLINE> Foreign Financial Institutions Pouring into China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Overseas financial institutions in
China brought their gross capital up to 19.14 billion US dollars
by the end of 1995, and post-tax profits to 139 million US dollars
last year, a Chinese banker has said.
</P>
<P>
Offices of 519 Overseas financial institutions and 142 business
bodies, run by overseas financial institutions, had been
established in the country by the end of last year, the overseas
edition of the "People's Daily" quoted Jin Qi, vice-director of
the administrative department of the People's Bank of China as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that overseas financial institutions in China
granted 12.75 billion US dollars in loans last year, most of which
were extended to the country's overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jin added that overseas financial institutions have become an
important part of China's entire financial sector, and are playing
a significant role in China's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
They have brought into China construction funds, which are
short in supply at home, advanced administrative expertise and
financial technology, which have helped sharpen the competitive
edge of Chinese financial institutions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jin went on to say that China will continue to improve its
legal building, and open more areas to overseas financial
institutions, and allow the establishment of an increasing number
of overseas insurance companies and investment banks in a planned
way.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the study on opening the business of
Chinese currency Renminbi to overseas financial institutions will
also be improved.

ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Donovan Bailey of Canada broke the
world record of the men's 100 meters on his way to take the gold
medal in the Olympic athletics competition here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Canadian stromed to the finish line with a time
of 9.84 seconds, beating the listed mark of 9.85 seconds set by
Leroy Burrell of the United States on July 6, 1994 in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorite Frank Fredericks of Namibia timed 9.89
seconds for the silver medal and Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago
came third in 9.90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Linford Christie of Britain was disqualified
from the men's 100m final at the Atlanta Olympic Stadium for two
false starts.
</P>
<P>
The race could not have got away to a more dramatic start.
</P>
<P>
Christie, 36, competing in his last major competition, was away
quickly at the gun only to be called back for a marginal false
start.
</P>
<P>
Then Boldon was adjudged to have made a flier, a decision with
which he clearly disagreed, shouting "No way" as he ran down the
track.
</P>
<P>
A second false start to Christie was followed by scenes of
confusion as officials gathered around the starting blocks, before
the Briton was reluctantly escorted from the track.
</P>
<P>
Bailey's world record was the first in an Olympic final since
Jim Hines set a new mark at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. It
bettered the two-year-old record of 9.85 set by American Leroy
Burrell in Lausanne.

<HEADLINE> Top Seeds Enter Quarter-Finals in Olympic Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- All top seeds secured their
quarterfinal spots on Saturday with Carmila Martin of Danmark
becoming the only European hopeful to break the Asian domination
in the women's badminton Olympic tournament.
</P>
<P>
Martin, the joint fifth seed in the women's singles, breezed
across Huang Chia-Chi of Chinese Taipei in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
While the other quarter-final berths were split among the Asian
players, led by world champion Ye Zhaoying of China and current
World number one Susi Susanti of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Ye, recently-deposed world number one, was on and off
court in 20 minutes, handing out a 11-4, 11-4 win over Swedish
newcomer Margit Borg.
</P>
<P>
On whether she's well prepared for her next match, Ye said:
"I'll just do whatever it takes."
</P>
<P>
Her next opponent is the joint 5/8 seed Kim Ji-Hyun of Korea,
who trounced Ye in the second round of All-England Championships
last year. But since then, Ye has won all the games against the
Korean.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Susi, who denied that she would retire after
the Games, overwhelmed underdog Katarzyna Krasowska of Poland
11-4, 11-0 on her way to defend the title.
</P>
<P>
Yet, more tough games were ahead for the Indonesian. She will
meet world runner-up Han Jinna of China in her half, who
demonstrated her top form with a 11-3, 11-6 victory over Pornsawan
Plungwech of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"I have played Han before and always beaten her"', said Susi in
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Bang Soo-Hyun of South Korea, one of the top favourites for the
title, was the joint third and fourth seed with Carmila, also met
few challenge by outwitting Japanese Yasuko Mizui 11-2, 11-3.
</P>
<P>
Among the other last eight were joint fifth and eighty seeds
Yao Yan of China and Mia Audina of Indonesia. They will take on
Bang and Carmila respectively in the quarter-finals to be held
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Province Governor Aids Orphaned Dropout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Tears came to Gao Peng's eyes when
he finally returned to school. He could hardly believe all that
had happened to him.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, Gao was forced to drop out of
school. With time to spare, he strolled along the Huanghe River
near his village in north China's Shaanxi Province, broken-hearted.
</P>
<P>
After the death of his father in a fall, and his mother's
subsequent suicide, young Gao and his 15-year-old elder sister
were left alone.
</P>
<P>
His uncle, a father of four, took in the orphaned children. To
allow Gao to stay in school, his uncle asked his 12-year-old
daughter to drop out.
</P>
<P>
Gao protested, and later wrote a letter to Liu Zemin, the
deputy governor of Shaanxi Province, asking for help.
</P>
<P>
"Save us, please, we want to go to school, we want to be useful
like our friends," he wrote of himself and his cousin.
</P>
<P>
Several days later, Gao received a letter from the deputy
governor.
</P>
<P>
"Little Gao, I am very sorry about your story," Liu said in
his letter. "Just like you, I also had a sorrowful
childhood. Believe me, be brave and you will come through."
</P>
<P>
He continued: "Enclosed is a money order of 1000 yuan. It is
for you to deal with your present hardship. I will take the
responsibility of paying for your education until you graduate
from college."
</P>
<P>
Gao Peng and his cousin returned to school. His letter was
passed on to county officials, and later published in the local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Many people who were deeply moved by the story have sent
donations totaling more than 200,000 yuan (25,000 US dollars) to
help poor students to continue their education in addition to
another 200,000 yuan allocated by the Provincial Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
The local county government decided to set up a fund with the
money to help the poor children to go to school.

<HEADLINE> Petrov Wins 91-kg Category at Olympic Weightlifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Aleksey Petrov
of Russia set a new world record in the snatch to win the 91-kg
category at the weightlifting tournament of the Centennial Olympic
Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian lifter, who was stripped of his gold medal at the
last world championships for positive test, snatched 187.5
kilograms and jerked 215 for a combined total of 402.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The previous world mark in the snatch was 186 set by himself in
Istanbul two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Leonidas Kokas of Greece claimed the silver medal at 390
kilograms from two lifts. Oliver Caruso of Germany, who had the
same total weight with Kokas, finished third with heavier
bodyweight.
</P>
<P>
Petrov, who began his weightlifting career at the age of six,
met no challenge in Saturday's lifts.
</P>
<P>
After lifting 175 and 182.5 in his first two attempts in the
snatch, Petrov tried 187.5 kilograms and made it a success.
</P>
<P>
The Russian strongman, who had 215 kilograms in his first lift
in the jerk, attempted two times at the weight of 227.5, but
failed.
</P>
<P>
Petrov, with his first ever Olympic gold medal, will receive
100,000 U.S. dollar bonus from the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
At the last world championships in Guangzhou, China in
November, 1995, Petrov was tested positive for anabolic steroid
and the International Weightlifting Federation imposed a life ban
on him.
</P>
<P>
However, earlier this year, the IWF, after re-hearing the
appeal from the lifter, the Russian Weightlifting Association and
the Russian Olympic Committee, decided to lift the life ban
against him.
</P>
<P>
The IWF said in a statement that "the disqualification of
Petrov from the World Championships is upheld, but his life ban is
lifted" since the banned anabolic steroid was introduced to
Petrov's body unknown to him.
</P>
<P>
Petrov said in a press conference after the competition that
the drug was put into his food by his ex-girlfriend before he left
for China last November. But he refused to give any reason why the
girl -- a medical student -- would do so.
</P>
<P>
After seven-day competitions in weightlifting, China and Turkey
each had two gold medals with Cuba, Russia and Greece taking one
apiece.

BELGRADE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament president
Momcilo Krajisnik met with Deputy High Representative of the
international community Michael Steiner today on the
implementation of the Bosnia peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held in Serb capital Pale, covered such issues as
the upcoming elections, freedom of movement, exchange of pows, and
missing persons, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Steiner described the talks as
productive and said there was a way to establish clear regulations
for the implementation of all the articles of the civilian part of
the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said Serb state Republika Srpska would respect the
agreement reached recently in Belgrade in the presence of special
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. Under Holbrooke's pressure, Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic resigned as Serb president and chairman of
the ruling Serb Democratic party to pave the way for the elections
in September.

Krajisnik added he hoped the international community would do
everything to settle controversial issues fairly and properly and
ensure free and democratic elections.
