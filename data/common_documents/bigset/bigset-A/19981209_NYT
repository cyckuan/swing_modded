   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ You always could count on Dave Taylor to do
the dirty work. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he was the
undervalued jewel on the Kings' Triple Crown Line, the one who'd
dig the puck out of the corners and sweep opponents out of the way
so Marcel Dionne and Charlie Simmer could do their scoring.
</P>
<P>
   There was no tinsel in Taylor's game, no glitzy moves or jazzy
improvisations. He paved a long and industrious NHL career by being
as colorful as asphalt. His deliberate, workmanlike approach paid
dividends when he was a player, but it's costing the Kings dearly
now that he's their general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The road back to respectability Taylor has spent the past two
years methodically laying down is littered with potholes and
debris. It has more dead ends than a maze. In rebuilding the
organization in his image, he has forgotten what makes teams go.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, it's hard to make any real headway when you're a
carburetor short of an engine. With their leading scorer ahead of
his pace of last season yet averaging under a point a game, the
Kings clearly don't have the combustion to keep pace with the
Colorados and Dallases and, criminy, even the Calgarys.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind a win, the Kings will go into their game tonight
against the Washington Capitals in search of a lead. They haven't
enjoyed one since Nov. 21, a span of five games. You want
frightful? In the 16 games the Kings have played since Halloween,
they've held a lead in only seven of them (and if you blinked, you
surely missed the five-minute span in which they held the upper
hand over San Jose and Dallas last month before losing both).
</P>
<P>
   They've been outscored 11-1 in the first period of their past 10
games. Their most exciting offensive player is their radio color
analyst Cammie Granato, a standout on the women's national team.
Trust us, this is not how you go about wooing locked-out NBA fans
and would-be Staples Center season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go all the way back to 1971, four years before
Taylor was taken by the Kings in the 15th round of the draft, to
find a more doddering squad of Angeleno icemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have gotten nicked and dented the first two months,
it's true. But it's not injuries that have dragged them all the way
down to the bottom of the NHL, it's Taylor's inertia.
</P>
<P>
   The time is long overdue for Taylor to pick up one of those
roadside emergency phones and, as the 1998-99 season noisily
whizzes by him in the background, dial for help. Goodness knows he
has plenty of options.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a marquee talent with the charisma to knock the smug
smile right off Shaquille O'Neal's face that Taylor wants, he
should dial the Pittsburgh Penguins and stubbornly hang on the line
until Craig Patrick is ready to deal and/or his phone is
disconnected because of a pile of unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better player in the league right now than Jaromir
Jagr and no financially worse-off team than the Penguins, who'll
have to decide pretty soon whether or not to hang onto Jagr for
collateral or deal him for cash and warm bodies.
</P>
<P>
   If Jagr's available, the Kings need him the same way the Dodgers
have to have Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing how time is of the absolute essence, we could
completely forgive Taylor if it's a fantastic finisher he wants and
he wants it now, no strings or bankruptcy courts attached. If
that's the case, he can ring up Calgary and complete a deal for
Theoren Fleury on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Of all his options, this is the one we'd endorse and not just
because it would be a marketer's delight, selling a team with both
the tallest player presently in the league (6-foot-8 Steve McKenna)
and the shortest. Yes, that would be the 5-foot-6 Fleury, who makes
up for in speed and grit what he lacks in height.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be an unrestricted free agent at the season's end, which
is why the Flames are resigned to moving him. A relatively youthful
30, Fleury figures to have plenty of mileage left in those
tree-trunk legs of his.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Taylor's options get riskier (not one of them,
however, is as treacherous as doing nothing). If it's an exciting
scorer with a lot of baggage that he wants, he can buzz Vancouver
and battle it out with the New York Rangers for the services of
Pavel Bure. The Russian Rocket has been grounded all season after
having a falling out with the Vancouver front office.
</P>
<P>
   Bure is the most exciting player this side of Paul Kariya. But
as fast as he is he can't outskate the worrisome rumors that he has
ties to the Russian Mafia. His memory is also a concern; he has a
penchant for forgetting there are two or three or four teammates
skating with him on any given shift.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a proven scorer with excellent hands and a quick first
step that he wants, Taylor can call the Islanders about Zigmund
Palffy. The 5-foot-10 left winger averaged 45 goals in his first
three full seasons with the Islanders. He is sitting out what would
have been his fourth because of a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor could swap his unsignable for Mike Milbury's. Idle Kings
defenseman Aki Berg surely could help shore up an Islanders defense
that gave up 12 more goals than the team scored in its first 26
games.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a puck (and chick) magnet that he wants, Taylor can ring
Ottawa about Radek Bonk. The 22-year-old center has good size
(6-foot-3) but so far inexplicably small numbers (90 points in 258
NHL games, including 10 in 22 this year).
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, if it's a smooth-striding, soft-handed scorer with
stars in his eyes that he wants, Taylor can dial Philadelphia for
Alexander Daigle. Daigle has a world of talent but is thinking of
throwing it all away for an acting career. In L.A. he could
straddle both worlds, a la Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   So you see, searching for a goal scorer right now is not like
shopping for a Furby. They're out there for the taking. If we were
Taylor, we'd bull our way to the front of the line.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MELBOURNE, Australia _ Jack Nicklaus has been there once as the
guinea pig, the sacrificial lamb, the guy who took one for the good
of golf _ if not for the good of his team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Nicklaus who led the U.S. charge at the 1987 Ryder Cup.
The event was in his hometown, no less, with the matches at
Muirfield Village, which Nicklaus designed just outside of
Columbus, Ohio. The team he captained would go on that year to be
the first to lose the Ryder Cup on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   It was a humbling moment _ certainly not on Nicklaus' personal
highlight reel, although he now says it may have been the best
thing that ever happened to the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, while he would prefer not to repeat the process,
Nicklaus says he would willingly do so this week if it's for the
betterment of the game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled. Nicklaus and his U.S. squad are focused on
winning the Presidents Cup, the Ryder clone that features Americans
against an international team of non-Europeans. When the first shot
is fired Friday at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, things will be
intense.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicklaus is making it his mission to ensure that the
Presidents Cup is not a conflict of global proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's much of a war,'' he says. ``We would like
to win, sure. But the most important thing is that the game of golf
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like it won in '87. It was Nicklaus' second tour as captain
of the U.S. Ryder Cup team. In '83, his team had won at Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla. That was the last in a run of 13 consecutive Ryder
wins for America.
</P>
<P>
   Europe won the Cup in '85 in England, and when the Americans
couldn't regain it in '87, it galvanized the Ryder Cup as an elite
sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '87, it was the first time that the Ryder Cup made money
and all of the sudden became an absolute viable financial event,''
Nicklaus says. ``It had always been a loser before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Presidents Cup came on because it (that Ryder Cup) opened
the doors for that type of event to happen. And so even though I
was the losing captain at Muirfield Village, that was not the
important issue. The important thing was that the game of golf grew
tremendously in Europe because of the win by that European team on
American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't like being the losing captain, of course. It was
an experience that I didn't enjoy. But I think what that did for
the Ryder Cup was something very special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that happened with it (losing) were only good for
the game of golf, and I think that's far more important than
whether I was the losing captain or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no matter what happens here this week, the game of golf in
general and golf in Australia in particular are going to be the big
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   His dignity will be intact regardless. Nicklaus will go down in
history as one of golf's greatest players, a superb golf-course
designer and an ambassador of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But if he had his druthers, he would just as soon not be
remembered as the man who captained the U.S. to its first Ryder Cup
loss on home turf and its first Presidents Cup loss. The Americans
won the first two in '94 and '96 on a course in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   From Nicklaus' perspective, this Presidents Cup actually throws
as much pressure on international captain Peter Thomson as it does
on Nicklaus and the U.S. squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his hometown,'' Nicklaus says. ``Peter has to avoid
that this year. Muirfield was my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus also is of the opinion that his job as captain is far
less important than some people would believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 12 highly successful, qualified players,'' he says.
``My job is to match them up, keep everybody from fighting, keep
everybody happy and make sure they have plenty of tees, towels,
spikes, things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, what does a captain do? A captain stands up for his
team and makes speeches on their behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he does a little more than that. In fact, pairing up his
team members and giving them the best chances for success are
factors that a captain can control to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Nicklaus has one rule of thumb he will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably won't pair unlike games together,'' he says.
``Unlike games come together sometimes. But oftentimes, they go
very far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   He's drawing on personal history for this rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember playing a lot of foursome, or alternate-shot,
matches with Arnold Palmer or Tom Watson or Tom Weiskopf,''
Nicklaus recalls. ``Most of the time, we won. Not all the time but
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then one time in St. Louis (at the 1971 Ryder Cup), I was
paired with Dave Stockton. He would hit it short and in the
fairway, and I would hit it long and in the rough. He wasn't used
to hitting 8-irons out of the rough for his second shots, and I
wasn't used to hitting 2-irons from the fairway. We got beat
something like 6-and-5. So that kind of stuck in my head, and I
thought, `Jack, don't do that again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was talking with Tiger (Woods) on the team bus when he
came out with Mark O'Meara, and I said, `You and Mark had a little
hard time over at the Ryder Cup.' He said, `Yep, we felt like oil
and water. We didn't mix very well.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So probably the only thing you might find is that they won't
play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus emphasized the word ``probably'' in that statement. He
also hopes that his players, all of whom are winding down into a
short ``offseason'' after a full 10 months of play on the PGA Tour,
will be in quality form for the matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who plays well that day is what it boils down to,'' he says.
``Obviously, I haven't been calling my guys every day to see
whether they have been practicing or not. So I can only assume that
they are ready. And there isn't anybody who has told me they
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our guys really enjoy not being at each other's
throats once in a while. They enjoy their competitions against each
other during the year, but it is fun to be able to take guys back
and feel like it's your college days again. It's fun. It becomes a
team sport, which is something that you don't find that often in
golf.''

NFL COMMISSIONER ANSWERS TO PERRY MASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITAL)The Tribunal of American Sports Justice is now in
session.
</P>
<P>
   Hon. Perry Mason, chief of tribune, presiding.
</P>
<P>
   Case No. 666: Sports Fans vs. NFL. (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Is it true, Commissioner Tagliabue, that one of your
executives told the coach of the Seattle Seahawks that the reason
for the mistaken call on the final touchdown of Sunday's game at
the Meadowlands between the Seahawks and New York Jets is that the
line judge mistook the helmet of Vinny Testaverde for the football?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: I, uh, believe that is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Is it true that the helmet in question is white and the
football in question is brown?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Is it true that the football does not have a face mask
and the helmet does not have two pointed ends?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Are you familiar with the Laws of Holes, Mr. Tagliabue?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: I'm not sure what you mean.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Let me recite to you the First Law of Holes: When in one,
stop digging.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: I don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: I'm not surprised. In your position as commissioner of
the NFL, let me ask your professional opinion on which was more
outrageous: The commission of the miscall, or the preposterous
excuse for the miscall.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Well, I think it's a matter of interpretation. You
can look at it like ...
</P>
<P>
   Mason: No equivocation, Mr. Tagliabue. You make the call on the
spot, just like your officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Well I suppose if I had to choose ...
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Too late, Mr. Tagliabue. The tribunal finds you in
contempt of this proceeding. The sentence is a ban on the NFL
seeking public funding for any of the next three stadium projects
in its cities.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Now wait a minute. That strikes at the very economic
foundation of our league _ public subsidy for private business.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: It is clear to this tribunal that the NFL's tolerance of
sudden, irreversible and unjustifiable officiating judgment has
economic as well as emotional impacts on sports fans and their
teams. Therefore the consequence to the league should also be
economic.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Who makes up this procedure?
</P>
<P>
   Mason: That's for us to know and you to find out. Think of our
operations in the same way your business handles accountability by
its game officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Wait a minute. All that happened Sunday was one blown
call. I will grant you it was a bad one, as was the excuse, and it
had serious consequences for the Seahawks. But every sport has
officiating mistakes. Errors by players, coaches and referees are
an inevitable part of all sports.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Isn't it true, sir, that the NFL plays far fewer games
than any other major professional sport?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Yes, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Isn't it also true that although most games last more
than three hours, the actual time the ball is in play is less than
30 minutes?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: That's true.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: So doesn't that put a higher premium on every call than
in any other sport?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: I suppose so.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Isn't it also true that the game is played on a large
field, with 22 players, that includes action that can spread
farther faster than any other sport?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Well, I hadn't thought about it that way, but I
suppose it's true.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: And isn't it true that the NFL adopted a large
technological advance called instant replay from 1986 to 1991 as a
visual aid to help in the accuracy of some officiating calls?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: It is.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Were some calls reversed, and accuracy increased?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Well, yes. But a lot of calls were upheld, too. And
many of the games were held up. The system forced a lot of time
delays. We concluded that the scarcity of errors didn't justify the
complications or the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Nevertheless, given your testimony, isn't it possible to
conclude that NFL officials have more pressure than any other
sport?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: I suppose you could say that.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: And are they the only part-time officials in major
sports?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: So doesn't it stand to reason that any technical aid
given to these part-time employees in order to help them render a
fair judgment in a fast, complex game not only enhances your
organization's credibility but is in the public interest?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: We certainly plan to give it every consideration,
perhaps as soon as this season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Now you're considering it? Mr. Tagliabue, where have you
been for seven years?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: I resent the tone of your inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: The tribune recognizes your remark as criticism, which is
not tolerated in a public forum. You are fined another three
projects' worth of public subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue: This is so unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Welcome to your world, Mr. Tagliabue. Next case, bailiff.
</P>
<P>
   Bailiff: Sports fans vs. NBA, your honor.
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Are these people capable of telling the difference
between a football and a helmet?
</P>
<P>
   Bailiff: Testimony is inconclusive so far, your honor. What is
known so far is they cannot distinguish between a hole in the
ground and their ...
</P>
<P>
   Mason: Proceed, bailiff.

TCU PASSES TECH TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU coach Billy Tubbs gave his players a pop
quiz before last night's game against Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the usual stuff, numbers of Tech's players, the
defensive assignments.
</P>
<P>
   His players failed, prompting a fiery pregame lecture from
Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't pass the pop quiz,'' said point guard Prince Fowler,
his measly quiz score of 35 leading his Horned Frogs teammates.
``But when we stepped on the floor, we passed the test.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU easily defeated Tech, 105-86, shooting 66 percent, including
71 percent in the second half, and forcing 24 turnovers along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs (8-2) didn't miss a shot until Lee Nailon's dunk 6:51
into the first half rattled off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them a makeup quiz tonight,'' Tubbs said. ``Extra
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he had been worried coming in against Tech (4-3) that
his team wasn't ready. They didn't seem fired up to play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs were clicking from the get-go in front of season-high
crowd of 6,581 at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum and a regional television
audience on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we got beat by a better team,'' Red Raiders coach
James Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   The inside duo of Nailon and Marquise Gainous was again dominant
for the Frogs. Nailon had 26 points and 10 rebounds, and Gainous
chipped in 24 and six. They took turns dumping it inside to the
other for thunderous dunks.
</P>
<P>
   The perimeter game also played well, delivering a second
consecutive solid effort.
</P>
<P>
   The outside scoring came from Shannon Long and Vladimir Jaksic.
Long had a career-high 19 points, and Jaksic chipped in 14 points,
including going 4-for-7 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Malcolm \RJohnson\S and Mike \RJones\S. They were
great players,'' Jaksic said of the guards TCU lost after last
season. ``But it's time to move on. We can be good players too.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead, as usual, came from Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery guard with the in-your-face-for-40-minutes-game
attitude keys the Frogs' defense. The job he did on Tech's Rayford
Young had Tubbs raving.
</P>
<P>
   Young couldn't get free, and as a result the Red Raiders'
offense couldn't get on track. The Red Raiders shot 44 percent, and
turned over the ball 24 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned the ball over too many times,'' Dickey said. ``In a
game like this, you can't turn the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler was right in the middle of most of it.
</P>
<P>
   His line wasn't as impressive as some, save for a school-record
15 assists. He finished with 11 points and three steals.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt that nights like last night start with him,
his defense, his intensity.
</P>
<P>
   To look at him, though, it's hard to see it. He's as laid-back
as they come most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   So Fowler's the perfect guy to explain the seeming disparity
between the team that acted nonchalant before the game and the team
that dismantled Texas Tech with relative ease during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready,'' Fowler said. ``We passed the real test.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was hard about the pop quiz?
</P>
<P>
   ``Remembering the players' numbers,'' Fowler said. ``You see
them on TV all of the time, but you don't remember their numbers.''

HELLS ANGEL, GIRLFRIEND FOUND SHOT TO DEATH AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Large Larry'' Lajeunesse, a 468-pound Hells
Angel, and his longtime girlfriend, Tami Ann Brannigan, were shot
to death in the converted industrial garage where they lived,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect robbers killed Lajeunesse, 44, and Brannigan, 35.
</P>
<P>
   So do family members who walked through the couple's ransacked
home and scrap-metal and car-repair business in suburban Chatsworth
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lajeunesse, who called his 6-foot-5-inch brother a ``big
teddy bear,'' said he noticed that gems, antique watches, knives
and swords the couple collected appeared to be missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought the little trinkets were more important than my
brother and Tami's lives,'' said Michael Lajeunesse, who was
present when the bodies were taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've got an ice pick in my heart,'' he said. ``I
hoped it was somebody else and not my brother, but when I saw the
size of that bag on that gurney, I knew it was him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two fellow Hells Angels from the chapter in nearby San Fernando
who had not heard from Lajeunesse for several days stopped by his
home Monday and found him dead on his bed in a back room, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   They called police, who found Brannigan in the adjoining
industrial unit the couple also rented, said Officer Dwayne White
of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Robbery/Homicide Division detectives were at the industrial
park through the night, but would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   After police left Tuesday, family members walked through the
collectible-filled garage. The family was together two weeks ago in
Simi Valley for their first reunion in about 15 years, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Lajeunesse's shiny, maroon Harley-Davidson motorcycle remained
in one room alongside a glass showcase of miniature model cars. In
another room, his Hells Angels jacket hung on a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lajeunesse said his brother had a Hells Angels tattoo on
his back and was wearing his new 10-year Hells Angels belt buckle
when they last saw each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was proud about being a Hells Angel,'' Michael Lajeunesse
said. ``I play the bad guy in the movies, but he's living it. But
he was a big teddy bear.''
</P>
<P>
   He described his brother's girlfriend as a quiet, friendly
person who was into computers, sewing on her 1900 antique machine
and tending to her cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was skinny. He was heavy. I guess they loved each other,''
Michael Lajeunesse said of the couple, who were together at least
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   As he sifted through rooms, some packed to the ceiling with
tires, auto parts, antiques, law books and collectibles, Michael
Lajeunesse, older than his slain brother by 18 months, recalled
growing up with three brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Working on cars was a natural for Larry, he said. ``He could
pick up a transmission by himself that weighed 300 pounds and throw
it on the truck. Changing a motor to him is like changing socks.''
</P>
<P>
   As she walked through her son's home Tuesday, Agnes Vooris held
a clay hand print Larry Lajeunesse made when he was 6. On the back
it read, ``Mother's Day 1960, Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors in the industrial complex described
Lajeunesse and Brannigan as quiet and always willing to lend a
hand. Larry would offer spare auto parts to his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing,'' said Larry Bjork, who works at a business
next door. ``He was a real good guy.''

INJURED BLAKE SAYS HE'S READY TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The most important 20 minutes of the Kings'
failing season might have occurred Tuesday, an off day, when
defenseman Rob Blake skated on the Forum ice and stated confidently
he expects to return to the lineup after missing just one more
game.
</P>
<P>
   For a team with 11 losses in 12 games entering tonight's home
game against the Washington Capitals, the Kings (6-17-3) will take
good news wherever they can find it. And the best possible news
would be the return of Blake, the NHL's top defenseman last season,
who tonight will miss his 15th game because of the broken foot he
suffered more than five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to stay out there and play (tonight),'' Blake said
after his skate. ``I'll play Saturday (at home against Vancouver).
It's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are 2-12 in Blake's absence and their playoff hopes
are in jeopardy at a relatively early stage in the season, but he
said the team's woes are not hastening his return to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come back when you're ready,'' he said. ``I've had enough
injuries to know you don't rush back.''
</P>
<P>
   Winger Steve McKenna is cleared to return tonight after missing
a month with an abdominal strain, which means that when Blake
returns, the only injured Kings will be wingers Russ Courtnall
(broken ankle) and Sandy Moger (back strain).
</P>
<P>
   __ Winning time: Blake said he is aware that even with 56 games
remaining, the Kings find themselves in danger of missing the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 11 games under .500,'' he said. ``If we play .500 hockey
from here on out, it's not good enough. Right now, between now and
Christmas, it's a pretty important time to get something going.
We've got to get on a roll and get back to .500.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have eight games between now and Christmas, just two
against teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stumpel improving: Center Jozef Stumpel had two assists in
Saturday's loss to Detroit and has shown signs the last couple of
games that his injury problems might be behind him and that he
might be regaining his form of last season, when he led the Kings
with 79 points.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel set up a 2-on-0 break with a beautiful behind-the-back
pass from the blue line on Saturday, a play that resulted in a goal
by Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last game against Detroit, I was feeling almost in
shape,'' said Stumpel, who has been slowed by ankle and hip-flexor
injuries, missing 13 games. ``After 15 or 20 seconds, I was dead
and I couldn't move my feet (when first returning from his
injuries). Now, I don't have that problem. I'm staying 30 or 40
seconds out there and I'm working hard.''

TWA IS SET TO ORDER JETS FROM BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Trans World Airlines is expected to announce an order
for at least 50 Boeing 717 jetliners on Wednesday to help replace
its aging fleet, people close to the transaction said on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The order, worth about $1.5 billion, would insure the future of
the 717, a short-range plane developed by McDonnell Douglas before
Boeing bought the one-time rival last year.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for the 717 have been lacking since the first customer,
Airtran, formerly known as Valujet, ordered 50 three years ago.
Pembroke Capital, an Irish leasing concern, ordered 10 717's
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and TWA declined to comment on the TWA order, but a
person close to the deal said TWA would announce it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms, TWA is expected to order 50 of the planes and
take options for 50 more, giving the order a potential value of $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The order would be the first large-scale purchase of Boeing
aircraft since it announced an extensive cutback last week because
of slowing demand, mostly from Asian customers. Boeing said it was
reducing production and cutting 48,000 jobs in the next two years,
20,000 more than it had announced some months ago.
</P>
<P>
   TWA is expected to use the 717's as replacements for its aging
DC-9's, which were built by McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   TWA is also expected to buy an undisclosed number of Airbus
A318's, which are short-range aircraft that Boeing's European rival
is developing to compete with the 717. The Seattle Times, citing
unnamed sources, reported on Tuesday that TWA is planning to buy 75
A318's with an option for another 75, a deal potentially valued at
$5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why TWA would split the order between two
competing models, however. Many airlines choose to avoid that as a
way to simplify maintenance procedures and reduce costs.

INSTANT replay.
</P>
<P>
   To re, or not to re, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to get it right, even at the cost of adding four or five minutes
to the length of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Gingerly, as if dealing with a live hand grenade, the lords of
pro football are wrestling with the issue of bringing back instant
replay, possibly in time for this year's playoffs. In the interest
of our national health, we pray that they do. Nearing the end of
the most contentious season of officiating in the recorded memory
of mankind, owners, coaches and fans have reached the point of
emotional meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the arguments offered when this technology was
ash-canned after a six-year run: The TV reviews took too long and
were too often ruled ``inconclusive.'' The camera angle was not
always reliable. The officials on the field were inhibited by the
eye in the sky. And these doubts were aggravated by a general
impression that everyone in the replay booth was out to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   These complaints no longer matter. What we are dealing with is a
crisis that is spreading like crabgrass. Games are being lost on
bad officials' calls in full view of the millions watching at home.
If they can see the replays, why shouldn't the officials?
</P>
<P>
   It is our belief that, hardened by bitter lessons, the fans _
even the coaches _ are now mature enough to live with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it matter which format or system is adopted. Give those
in the stadium, including the men in stripes, the same opportunity
as the television viewers. This must be done before a call occurs
that inflames the crowd, causing the fans to take matters into
their own hands. The stadium would be destroyed by those who built
it, like the Bridge on the River Kwai, only without the stirring
music.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a game has failed to produce a wail of anguish, and at
least four in four weeks have been decided by blown decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers lost in overtime when the referee blew the coin
toss, giving the Detroit Lions the crucial first possession. This
is believed to be a first in pro football history. Coin tosses are
like elevators. You have only two ways to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills were knocked off by New England after time had
expired, the result of an interference call on the game's last
play, a foul that was not apparent on the replay, or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets squeaked past Seattle when quarterback Vinny
Testaverde was credited with a touchdown, a foot short of the goal
line. The ball was under cousin Vinny's chest, but the officials
may have ruled that the top of his helmet broke the plane.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dallas Cowboys held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals
when the officials failed to call interference on Kevin Smith on
the final play. Smith held the receiver tightly in his embrace, a
touching moment but a costly one for the Cards.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the officials are darned if they do and darned if they
don't. But if the television cameras would help them correct one
wrong call, why shouldn't they have that option?
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much point in raising your blood pressure by
reciting other atrocities. The Oilers, the Tennessee Oilers,
received two letters of apology from the NFL office, regretting
calls that may have cost them two games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nostalgia fans will no doubt remember that the Oilers
were the team most responsible for this innovation. When the Oilers
still lived in Houston, they had a touchdown taken away from them
during the 1979 AFC Championship Game. The call kept them from
tying the Steelers and gaining momentum in what turned out to be
their best chance to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The officials ruled that Mike Renfro had caught Dan Pastorini's
pass out of the end zone, but the replays showed clearly that his
feet were in bounds. What they did not show was whether he had
control of the ball. Eyewitnesses, including Renfro, insisted that
he did.
</P>
<P>
   This play, and the controversy it unleashed, inspired two
changes. NBC realized it was lacking a reverse-angle camera, and it
quickly became a part of the game-day hardware. To this day, the
camera is referred to as The Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, with the improvements in camera placement and slow
motion, the league voted to employ instant replay. They pulled the
plug in 1992, having decided that while the theory was fine, the
system itself did little more than whip to a greater frenzy those
who were already paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   But there is now a larger concern _ namely, the perception that
too many games are decided not by the skill and bloody effort of
those in the arena but through acts of robbery perpetrated by
people in striped shirts.

RESCUED HEDGE FUND STILL BRINGS PROFITS TO WALL ST. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for 2nd, 3rd and 4th grafs for updating) (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management, the troubled hedge fund rescued at
the height of this fall's stock- and bond-market turmoil, has
continued to generate profits for the Wall Street banks that
injected fresh capital in September. But some government regulators
are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the
near-collapse of the hedge fund, people directly involved in the
matter said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, some members of the Wall Street
consortium that now controls the hedge fund, said that Prince Walid
bin Talal, the billionaire Saudi Arabian businessman, might be
weighing an offer to buy Long-Term Capital. The prince was among
the wealthy individuals approached in late August and early
September about taking a stake in Long-Term Capital, when the hedge
fund ran into difficulties, people close to the fund said.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Walid could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
Executives of banks and brokerage firms that control the fund have
said in the past that they would be eager to sell their stakes to a
qualified buyer. But any offer from the Saudi prince, who is well
known for investing in troubled companies, including Citibank in
1991, is not thought to be well advanced. He has yet to present a
proposal to Long-Term Capital's board, the people close to the fund
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hedge fund, which was almost certain to face
bankruptcy in September without the $3.6 billion rescue package
financed by 14 Wall Street banks and brokerage houses and
orchestrated by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has staged at
least a temporary recovery. In November its portfolio rose about 20
percent, or more than $700 million, mostly aided by a surge in
global debt markets.
</P>
<P>
   The November rise means that the 90 percent equity stake
controlled by the banking consortium has earned a healthy return
since September, in tandem with rises in stock and bond markets.
But the fund's original investors, who saw the money they put into
Long-Term Capital almost entirely wiped out by the turmoil of
recent months, have still recovered only a sliver of their
pre-August stake.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fund's financial situation has stabilized, it still
faces scrutiny from regulators. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has been talking to investors who put money in the hedge
fund, which is based in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is conducting what was described as a preliminary
inquiry into whether the fund's partners violated any securities
regulations in trying to raise fresh money for the fund during the
August-September crisis. The inquiry was first reported Tuesday in
The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry appears to stem from concerns voiced by investors or
potential investors who were approached to put up new money when
markets turned against the fund in late summer. At issue is whether
Long-Term Capital partners made clear to potential investors that
the fund's capital was running dangerously low, and whether
investors were made aware that any fresh money raised might be used
to pay mounting margin calls to nervous bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC declined to confirm or deny the existence of an inquiry
into Long-Term Capital. The hedge fund issued a statement saying
that it had complied with all applicable securities laws. A person
close to the fund said that the SEC had not got in touch with
Long-Term Capital in recent weeks and that the fund had no
knowledge of any official inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Other government officials have also explored issues surrounding
the troubles of Long-Term Capital, including its relationship with
banks and investors. All these investigations are seen as
preliminary, meaning that no formal investigation is taking place.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One government official described inquiries as natural given the
large size of the fund and the high-profile nature of the rescue.
The inquiries could lead to a full investigation, or be dropped
without any action taken, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Long-Term Capital said it was true that the fund
was seeking to raise money from investors during the period when it
faced grave difficulties, as has been widely reported. But no money
was raised, they said, and the need was eliminated when the Wall
Street consortium provided funds and assumed majority ownership.
</P>
<P>
   All investors approached were sophisticated and would have been
given the opportunity to examine the fund's books in detail before
committing any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``All such prospective investors were invited to discuss the
situation with authorized persons at Long-Term Capital or to visit
the office in Greenwich for an in-depth evaluation, and many took
the opportunity to do so,'' the statement said.

BURTON GIVES ENDORSEMENT TO IMPROVEMENTS AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jeff Burton says the reconfigured and
repaved Texas Motor Speedway really is different and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty damn nice,'' said Burton, winner of the inaugural
500-mile NASCAR Winston Cup race at TMS in April 1997. ``This is a
racetrack that's been improved. There'll still be people who say
they don't like it, but nobody who will say it's not better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burton also warned that the 1.5-mile trioval automatically
will not shed its reputation as a ``one-groove racetrack'' and
produce side-by-side racing during the Primestar 500 on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Testing tires on behalf of Goodyear, Burton became the first Cup
regular to hot-lap around TMS since it underwent a massive
reconfiguration and repaving after the water-plagued Texas 500 in
early April. The reconfiguration included installation of a new
drainage system and elimination of the 8-degree ``dual-banking''
originally intended for open-wheel, Indy-style cars. The changes
added eight feet of racing surface to the layout, which now
measures 58 feet at its widest point through the 24-degree banked
turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean we're going to race side-by-side?'' said
Burton, driver of the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus. ``I don't
think we're going to race side-by-side. But I've said all along
that a lot of the side-by-side racing question has been blown way
out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bottom is the fastest groove, by a lot more than the
top, then you can't run the top and be competitive. That's the way
this racetrack is right now. What we've seen over the years is that
as racetracks get older, and the pavement gets worn out, the groove
always seems to get bigger. Seems to get wider. I think that will
happen over here in \Rturns\S 3 and 4.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new drainage system, the management of
Speedway Motorsports Inc., opted to redesign the steep transition
entering Turn 1 and the tight and narrow exit of Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-day reconstruction project cost developer Bruton Smith
approximately $3 million. Four events, including a NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series race, have been run at TMS since without complaint.
But Eddie Gossage, the track's executive vice president and general
manager, eagerly has been awaiting the first laps run by a Cup
regular since April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Burton rang up 65 laps yesterday morning before delivering his
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe there's been huge improvements made to the
racetrack,'' said Burton, who won two races and finished fifth in
Cup points in 1998. ``Turn 4 has much more of a wider groove. So
now when you approach Turn 3 and get in the gas, if you miss the
groove off Turn 4, you don't feel like you're going to wreck. The
momentum now takes you to the wall, where before it tried to drive
you into the wall. That's a definite improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Turn 1 is better. It was almost like you'd run down in
a hole, and you never knew where your car was going. Now you can
drive down in there as deep as you want to and if anything happens,
the car just gets a little bit tight. That's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said Burton's favorable comments were ``just another
step'' in management's effort to remove all doubts about the racing
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone has wanted to see what the changes made to
the racetrack meant to a Winston Cup car,'' Gossage said. ``It's
very pleasing to hear that he feels good about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've experienced, what the drivers say is what counts. I
don't know that it's our place to tell you it's fixed or not fixed
or it's perfect. That's up to the drivers. We'll leave it to them
to talk about the racetrack.''

DEVILS AND FLYERS TIE, 5-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils and the Flyers want to
establish some kind of superiority against each other during the
regular season, but they are dead even right now, or at least until
they meet again in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   After splitting the first two games of their season series, each
winning at home, the Devils and the Flyers fought to a 5-5 deadlock
on TUesday night at Continental Arena in a game in which both
squandered two-goal leads _ the Flyers at the start and the Devils
at the end, a development that displeased New Jersey Coach Robbie
Ftorek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to control those two-goal leads,'' Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils (15-7-3) took a 5-3 lead with 7 minutes 56 seconds
left in the third period when Brian Rolston scored against Ron
Hextall, who replaced John Vanbiesbrouck at the start of the third
period. Vanbiesbrouck had allowed goals to Bobby Holik, Jason
Arnott, Dave Andreychuk and Patrik Elias.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who defeated the Islanders by 7-5 on Saturday, have
allowed 10 goals in their last two games, and they know they cannot
keep up their own production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get carried away and try to score too many goals
every game,'' Andreychuk said. ``We can't force to get offensive
chances. We have to be patient, because we create turnovers. There
were too many turnovers, and that was the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the first time this season without their captain,
Scott Stevens, who was nursing flu-like symptoms, the Devils turned
the puck over consistently in the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros had two goals for the Flyers (12-8-5). Jody Hull,
Dainius Zubrus and Rod Brind'Amour had the other goals for
Philadelphia, which will play host to the Devils on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brind'Amour got credit for the game's last goal, with 3:45 left
in regulation, on a play in which the puck hit Martin Brodeur's
stick, went in the air and ended up in the net. ``It hit my stick
and I never saw it after that,'' said Brodeur, who faced 20 shots,
one in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros and Hull scored goals 55 seconds apart, starting at
11:11 of the opening period, to give the Flyers a two-goal lead.
The goal by Lindros was his 13th and came on the first manpower
advantage for the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Holik and Arnott tied it for the Devils. Holik's goal,
his seventh of the season, came with 3:24 left in the first period,
and Arnott scored his seventh just 2:01 into the second period on
the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had a chance to take the lead about six minutes later
during a 2-on-1 break, but Krzyszstof Oliwa fell with no one around
him, and the Devils found themselves behind in the same sequence.
Zubrus went down the right flank after a lead pass by Mike
Sillinger and beat Brodeur from the right circle to the far post.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrus' goal seemed to awaken the Devils, who took the lead for
the first time on goals by Andreychuk, at 13:33 of the second, and
by Elias, with 3:18 left in the period. But the Devils squandered
their lead.

AVALANCHE DEFEAT ISLANDERS, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Patrick Roy, the superstitious Colorado
Avalanche goalie, has been known to talk to his goal posts. Surely
several ``thank yous'' were among his comments to them on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Four times in their 2-1 loss to the Avalanche on Tuesday night,
an Islander was staring at an open net but managed only to clank
the puck off of the three-inch-wide red cylinder. The defeat,
before 9,450 at Nassau Coliseum, continued the Islanders' slide,
which reached six straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Linden, Mariusz Czerkawski, who did score once, Robert
Reichel and Bryan Smolinski all came within inches of scoring
tonight for the Islanders. Roy, who was outstanding, stopped 31
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Lady Luck was not with us,'' said Mike Milbury, the
Islanders' coach and general manager. ``We carried the play and did
what we were supposed to. But we were guilty of one mistake, and
they made us pay for it. When you're not winning, somehow you find
a way to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake Milbury referred to was more of a miscommunication
between the Islanders' goalie, Tommy Salo, and defenseman Rich
Pilon. Early in the third period, Pilon misplayed the puck, which
bounced over his stick and into the Islanders' zone. Salo saw the
blunder and skated 25 feet from his crease to play the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg, the speedy Avalanche center, picked up the puck
at the blue line and steered it around Salo for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go out there,'' said Salo, who made 20 saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' league-leading power play went 0 for 5 on Tuesday
night. Entering the game, it was successful 23.4 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening the season with four straight losses and a tie,
Colorado (12-11-2) has climbed into contention and has now won
eight of its last 11 games. The Avalanche has also won its last
eight against the Islanders, outscoring them by 37-18.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Islanders (10-17) can look forward to
Saturday's game against the Tampa Bay Lightning for a couple of
reasons. They have not lost to the Lightning in six games and Kenny
Jonsson, their best defenseman, is expected to return after missing
eight of the last nine games with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   That the Islanders' slide has occurred with Jonsson out is no
coincidence. Jonsson holds the point on the power play, kills
penalties, and routinely sees more ice time than any of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche took a 1-0 first-period lead when Cam Russell
slapped the puck past a screened Salo from the point for his first
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders tied the game at 1-1 on a goal by Czerkawski at 14
minutes 21 seconds of the second period. He redirected a Smolinski
slap shot over Roy's shoulder for his seventh goal of the season.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The rest of the holiday season might be a little anticlimactic for
Texas A&AMP;M's Dat Nguyen.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He and the Aggies already had made merry on Saturday by
upsetting then-No. 2 Kansas State for the Big 12 championship.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, Nguyen got a nice little stocking stuffer
when he walked off with the 1998 Lombardi Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past week what more can you ask for?'' asked A&AMP;M's senior
linebacker and career tackles leader. ``You win a big game, and
then you come in here and win an award like this. I'm just honored
to be the recipient of the 1998 Lombardi Award.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen beat out three others to take home the 40-pound
granite-and-silver trophy given each year by the Houston Rotary
Club to the player deemed the best lineman in college football.
</P>
<P>
   Finalists Aaron Gibson, the 6-7, 386-pound senior offensive
tackle from Wisconsin, and Andy Katzenmoyer, the 6-6, 290-pound
junior linebacker from Ohio State, were also present at Tuesday's
29th annual award dinner and ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth finalist, senior offensive tackle Matt Stinchcomb of
Georgia, was unable to attend. He was in New York receiving an
$18,000 postgraduate scholarship from the College Football Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   As Nguyen rose from the head table in the Imperial Ballroom of
the Hyatt Regency to accept the award, he stood for much more than
being crowned the nation's best lineman. The son of Vietnamese
immigrants, the 6-1 Nguyen has over the last few years become a
towering role model for youngsters, using football as his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's different,'' Nguyen said. ``It's a
unique story, one of the most unique stories in college football.
It's one of those things that everybody wants to talk and write
about. It's neat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a lot of kids out there dreams and aspirations to
play college football or any other sport they want to do. It's just
opened the doors for them. It lets them know that regardless of
what race you are, the door is wide-open for you if you put your
heart and soul into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen said he was caught by complete surprise when his name was
called Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I had that big of a chance,'' he said. ``At
first, I thought they were joking when the announcer opened the
envelope and said, `Gig 'em, Aggies.' He had told me he was going
to joke with me before he got on the podium. But I'm just real
honored to represent Texas A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, Nguyen's presenter, praised his player's
latest accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really fitting because Dat has been one of our
unselfish guys throughout his career,'' Slocum said. ``This is not
one of those cooked-up deals. Dat played himself into this deal. He
made himself into one of the best players in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Though several Aggies had been chosen as Lombardi finalists in
the past, Nguyen became the first to take home the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the only A&AMP;M player to lead the team in season
tackles four times. He has 517 career stops, and in the 36-33
double-overtime win over K-State, Nguyen set a Big 12 Championship
Game record with 17 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   In starting all 50 of his games for A&AMP;M, Nguyen has helped his
team win the last two Big 12 South titles. Now, the eighth-ranked
Aggies (11-2) are headed to the Sugar Bowl to face No. 3 Ohio State
(10-1) and Katzenmoyer on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for us to go to a bowl game,''
said Nguyen. ``Everybody played well (at St. Louis). We fought to
the end and came out on top. So it's a great opportunity for the
seniors to play another game on the collegiate level and for us to
play another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (Big 12 championship) win proves that we can play up
there with some of the top 10 teams in the nation. And now we're

RED SOX SIGN FREE AGENT PORTUGAL TO BOLSTER ROTATION 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, Jose Offerman has company.
</P>
<P>
   One day after bidding farewell to three pitchers who were in
their rotation at various times in 1998, the Red Sox Tuesday signed
free agent Mark Portugal, a 36-year-old righthander who won 10
games for Philadelphia last season but after three operations in
two years was deemed too much of a health risk for the Phillies to
ask back.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who went to high school in Southern California but now
lives in Barrington, R.I., signed a one-year, $3 million deal, with
a club option for the 2000 season. His salary will be $2.7 million
for 1999 and would be $3.3 million the following season if the club
does not buy him out for $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   He is the second free agent acquisition by the Sox this
offseason, joining Offerman, the team's new leadoff man.
</P>
<P>
   While six teams, according to Toronto general manager Gord Ash,
remain in the running to trade for five-time Cy Young Award winner
Roger Clemens, Red Sox GM Dan Duquette took a far more modest step
in bolstering a rotation that will no longer feature Steve Avery,
Butch Henry, or Pete Schourek. The Sox declined to offer the three
salary arbitration, which prohibits Boston from re-signing them
until May 1, essentially guaranteeing that they'll be elsewhere
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who figures to assume the No. 4 spot in the rotation,
has actually won one fewer game (29) in the last four seasons than
Avery and six fewer than Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who decided against trading Portugal last season
when they thought, briefly, that they could stay in contention for
the National League wild card, held a $2.75 million club option on
him but declined to exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was on the disabled list three times in his two seasons
with the Phillies. He missed almost all of 1997 after he tore the
flexor group of muscles in his right elbow and needed surgery. He
also had surgery on his left knee. In all, he has been on the DL 10
times in a big league career that began in 1985 with the Twins and
has included stops with the Astros, Giants, Reds, and Phillies. He
had two earlier operations, one to remove bone chips in his elbow
in 1992 and one to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
right knee in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But after undergoing arthroscopy on his right knee following his
first start last season, Portugal bounced back, going 10-5 with a
4.44 ERA in 26 starts. A changeup specialist, he was sought by a
number of teams before the July 31 trading deadline, but Phillies
GM Ed Wade elected to retain him.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who came back five weeks after the knee surgery and
shut out the Dodgers on two hits over eight innings, went 7-3 with
a 3.69 ERA after the All-Star break. He pitched at least seven
innings in eight of his last 16 starts, including two complete
games.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's best season was 1993, when he went 18-4 for the
Astros. That November, he signed as a free agent with San
Francisco, and in 1995, he was traded along with current Boston
center fielder Darren Lewis to the Reds in the deal that netted the
Giants Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked on and off with the Red Sox, but it just came
into focus the last couple of days,'' said Barry Meister,
Portugal's agent. ``They feel Portugal's a good fit, and he's happy
for the chance to pitch for the Red Sox and come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who figures to take the spot in the rotation behind
Pedro Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, and Tim Wakefield, had offers from
two other clubs, according to Meister. He was signed as a free
agent by the Phillies following the '96 season by then-GM Lee
Thomas, now one of Duquette's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dennis Eckersley, cut loose by the Red Sox Monday,
will decide by next week whether he intends to continue his playing
career, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, 44, had said last month that he was leaning strongly
toward coming back, but only with the Red Sox and only if he felt
his right shoulder was healthy again; he spent seven weeks on the
disabled list last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Eckersley met with Duquette in the Boston offices
of the player's attorney, Jack Sands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was very forward, very straight up,'' Sands said. ``Dan
said the team was looking at people for Dennis's position that
could help the club for more than one year, so they were going to
explore other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Dennis's age, what have you, he wasn't surprised, but he
was slightly disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley has expressed an interest in broadcasting and this
past fall did some work on ESPN during the World Series. If he
elects to retire, a strong possibility, he would probably have
interest in talking to the Sox about a broadcasting role but will
most likely have to wait until the team's TV rights situation is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things facing Duquette this winter is the need to
replenish the bullpen. He's set at closer with Tom Gordon and has
two above-average setup men in Jim Corsi and Derek Lowe. But the
Sox have only one experienced lefty reliever, Ron Mahay, after Greg
Swindell signed as a free agent with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball winter meetings begin Friday in Nashville, where
Duquette's top priority will be to find a slugger to compensate for
the loss of Mo Vaughn. But there were strong indications that the
market may be a tight one.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At age 46, John Grass is the head groundskeeper for
the Mehlville School District outside St. Louis. He earns $30,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Philip Ozersky is a research scientist at the Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He, too, earns $30,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Grass caught Mark McGwire's 63rd home run and
Ozersky caught the 70th and last of McGwire's record-breaking
season. For Grass, Ozersky and a few others who caught historic
home runs this season, the jackpot is five weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Guernsey's, a New York auction
house, announced an auction Jan. 12 at The Theater at Madison
Square Garden to sell seven baseballs from this year's home run
derby. The balls are the 63rd, 67th, 68th and 70th homers by
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and the 61st, 64th and 66th by
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs own the ball from Sosa's 61st home run and say they
will donate the auction proceeds to Sosa's foundation. The owners
of the other balls are represented or advised by Mike Barnes, a
28-year-old lawyer and agent from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he expected the 70th home run ball to bring more
than $1 million and the others to bring more than $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   The highest price ever paid for a baseball was $110,000 at a New
York auction this year for the ball Babe Ruth hit for the first
home run in Yankee Stadium history. For the McGwire-Sosa balls,
Barnes said, ``The sky is the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have written offers of more than $1 million for No. 70,''
Barnes said. ``Most buyers are collectors or plan to donate the
balls to museums. It's a matter of ego. You're buying a piece of
American history, not a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   To people who believe the huge potential prices are incongruous,
Sosa, who attended the news conference, took a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad much of this money will go to charity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlan Ettinger, Guernsey's president, said he expected half the
proceeds to be donated to charities. He said the owner of one ball
was a veterinary student who said he would use part of his money to
repay student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Grass, who owns McGwire's No. 63, said he didn't care how much
he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to take care of my family,'' he said. ``I have a
son, two daughters, a grandchild, six brothers and two sisters.
That's a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozersky, who owns McGwire's No. 70, was looking more to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got the ball,'' he said, ``I was trying to live my
life out. This is a lot different from my life as a research
scientist. I will give some of this to charity, a significant sum,
I hope. I'm not married, but I'm trying to provide for my kids when
I have them.''

 &HT;    Texas outlook bright, says Reserve Bank economist
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas job growth has cooled considerably in the
last year, but the state's economic outlook is still good for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   That was the view of Sheila Dolmas, an assistant economist for
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who is on the team that keeps a
regular check on the state's economic pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas economy is still very healthy. Employment growth has
slowed, but we expect the (state's economic) expansion to continue
next year,'' said Dolmas.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas' job growth exceeded the U.S. average job growth
this decade, the rate of new job creation has ``slipped
considerably'' over the last year, Dolmas said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the latest month for which numbers are available,
Texas' job growth rate was 2 percent. That's down from the 3
percent job growth rate in the previous 12 months, and 4.6 percent
for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor industry struggled with an oversupply of chips
even before Asian economic problems cut into demand. The result was
layoffs at big Austin employers like Motorola Inc., Applied
Materials Inc. and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this slowdown to be temporary, however, as the chip
industry sees inventories stabilize and sales start to recover and
the Texas economy continues to expand _ albeit at a slower rate,''
Dolmas said. Dolmas also attributed the slowdown in Texas this year
to a tight labor market, continued weakness in some sectors like
agriculture and energy, and the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with those problems, Texas exports are lagging. In the
first three quarters of 1998, overall Texas exports fell 10 percent
from the comparable period last year, with exports to Asian
countries dropping 30 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a worldwide oil glut has sent oil prices down 40
percent from prices prior to the 1973 oil embargo. Low oil prices
also have hurt Mexico, a major oil producer and Texas' biggest
trading partner, which in turn has hurt its trade with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Dolmas said, is recent signs of improvement in
the U.S. economy _ which is the biggest determinant of how well
Texas will do next year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is back up from its October lows. Consumer
confidence also has improved. And interest rates _ which help drive
consumer spending and big economic engines like home buying _ also
remain low, she said.

 &HT;    On a mission to cure the humorless
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I see GRUMP as a snitch group whose mission is
to turn in the chuckle-deprived.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it will work. Members of Good Riddance to
Unrelentingly Morose People, or GRUMP, will keep a diligent eye out
for grumbly behavior in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when they see it, they'll call me, GRUMP's CEO, and report
the laugh-challenged. Next, a GRUMP team will contact this person's
family and hold a GRUMP intervention session at the person's home
to help him overcome his humorless condition.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has begun, folks. There was so much response to my
column last week suggesting starting a political action group to
get rid of humorless people that I've decided to actually form
GRUMP.
</P>
<P>
   GRUMP membership cards are in the works. And maybe later there
will be GRUMP bumper stickers: ``GRUMP: This Vehicle Brakes for
Jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to help with Good Riddance to Unrelentingly
Morose People,'' wrote Will Cook, who works for a company that
sells computer software. ``Can one of our first assignments be my
boss's boss? I have attempted some humor with this man in the past
and received just a blank stare.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook was one of about 20 people who wrote in to join GRUMP.
Consider yourselves signed up, folks. You have been designated foot
soldiers in the war against angst.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's room for more troops. If you want to become
part of this army, just e-mail me at the address at the bottom of
this column. This could be the start of something big.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of the sort of problem that GRUMP needs to
fix.
</P>
<P>
   I recently said in a column that the reason I wanted to find a
Furby is that I would like teach it to swear like a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   A Furby is one of those hard-to-find computerized interactive
plush toys that starts out speaking its own language, called
Furbish, then picks up English.
</P>
<P>
   I figured you probably couldn't really teach one of these Furbys
to swear, but I said it anyway, figuring everyone would know I was
kidding. Hah. Silly me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that you haven't done proper research on the
subject of today's column,'' a Furby owner wrote. ``Furbies don't
actually learn words from you, and therefore can't learn to speak
profanities.''
</P>
<P>
   You've got to wonder how many hours this person spent on the
living room floor with Furby, trying to teach the Furby to talk
trash, with no success. I can see it now: ``Come on, Furby, say
$%&AMP;, say (at)$&AMP;.'' Otherwise, how would this person know Furbies
can't cuss?
</P>
<P>
   You wait. Now I'll get a letter from the writer telling me no
such thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my share of humorless people giving me weird looks or
scathing remarks,'' wrote another person who has joined GRUMP.
``GRUMP is the ultimate solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more someone says 'You can't joke about that!' the harder
I try to come up with a joke about 'that,' `` wrote Chris Glenn.
``Here's an idea for a motto _ 'I won't stop joking if you won't
stop whining!'''

 &HT;    A packrat on wheels
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Traveling has always brought me pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving home without all my stuff has always brought me anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The only time in my life that I have traveled without suffering
packing remorse was when I was in the military. Then I was told
what to take. No more and no less.
</P>
<P>
   But in civilian life packing for trips involves choices. Way too
many choices for me.
</P>
<P>
   I leave on vacation trips with the car so heavily loaded that it
scrapes backing out of the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   On motorcycle trips I leave home with gear crammed, stacked and
strapped all over the bike. That's never enough, of course. I send
large boxes of more stuff to hotels along my planned route.
</P>
<P>
   Mailing ahead boxes of clean clothes, equipment and other
belongings overcomes difficult packing decisions. But it requires
work.
</P>
<P>
   I have to plan where I will stay and when I will arrive. Before
I make reservations, I make sure that someone at the hotel will
accept delivery of the box. I want to know who this will be. At the
very least, I want to know where the box will be stored.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned the hard way that boxes sent ahead need to be
entrusted to a service that requires someone to sign for the box
every time it changes hands. It's a terrible feeling to check into
a hotel and discover that you do not have 50 pounds of extra stuff
waiting for you.
</P>
<P>
   I include pre-addressed mailing labels in the boxes I send
ahead. I also include a fresh marker pen and plenty of packing
tape. That way I can send my dirty clothes and gear I no longer
need back home.
</P>
<P>
   By mailing boxes ahead, I can arrive at a hotel on a motorcycle
and in a few hours be dressed in a tuxedo ready to take in an
opera. I've never done that. But I like the idea that I could if
someday I develop a taste for opera and buy a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Europe, I was told that I had to keep my
luggage to two bags _ one to check through and the other small
enough to carry on the plane and fit under the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Sending boxes ahead to various European countries was far too
expensive. Friends predicted that I could never pack in only two
bags.
</P>
<P>
   I bought the largest rolling garment bag sold on this planet and
spent three months agonizing over what to put into those two bags.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote and rewrote packing lists, which, over the years, I have
collected into a fat stack. My early packing lists include ointment
for pimples. More recent packing lists remind me to bring my AARP
card for discounts.
</P>
<P>
   I keep my personal packing lists together in a drawer along with
articles on packing and two books that offer packing and travel
tips.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have made all this a lot easier. Before there were
home computers, I made packing lists on typewriters. Before that, I
used goose quills and ink made from lampblack and bear grease. No,
excuse me. That last part was an impeachable lie.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to pack for the European trip, I used a guest bedroom
as a staging area. I carried stuff I thought I might need to
bedroom. I studied travel catalogs and travel sites on the
Internet. I pored over my packing lists. I practice packed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the night before my flight to Paris, I was packed in
only two bags. I figured the larger bag was heavy enough for the
two roller-blade wheels to crystallize marble, but what the heck.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the airline lost my huge checked-through garment bag.
In return, they gave me a tiny complimentary shaving kit. Somehow,
I survived.
</P>
<P>
   Now my brother wants me to join him and other family members in
San Francisco in February to attend his youngest daughter's
graduation ceremonies. I agreed. I am already working on my new
packing list.

 &HT;    Who knew death could be had at such a bargain price?
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It takes nerve to comparison shop for
your own coffin. You're not just browsing, after all. You're
confronting your own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's leaving this world alive,'' says Angelo Rolon.
</P>
<P>
   This could be his sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Rolon sells discount coffins to penny-pinchers planning for the
day they breathe their last, pass on to eternal glory, tee-off at
the great golf course in the sky. His showroom, the recently opened
Factory Caskets Direct on Dixie Highway in West Palm Beach,
features caskets with names that sound vaguely like American luxury
cars: the Winston, the Grant, the Primrose, the Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not morbid at all,'' Rolon says. ``Once they see they're
saving money, they feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so good, though, that anyone has been willing to try out a
coffin before deciding which to buy.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a casket, it's a snug fit. The sidewalls touch your
shoulders, so your hands must rest on top of you somewhere, hence
that ``he looks so peaceful'' pose. The satin upholstery, should
you choose the satin option, comes right down against your nose.
</P>
<P>
   It's dark in there. Cramped. And, yes, kind of eerie.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hiding from the truth at Rolon's store. On display at
the front door is The Lord's Supper, a metallic casket with a small
mural of the biblical feast inside the viewing lid. All together,
he has 12 caskets in stock, with stickers contrasting Rolon's
prices to those you might pay at a funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   At the pricey end, Rolon sells the Pieta: 18-gauge bronze-tinted
steel, elegant ruffled lining, a pillow, and subtle rubber gaskets
to seal the thing shut. You can almost hear a pitchman like Ricardo
Montalban purring about its ``rich Corinthian styling.'' Price:
$2,025 _ a $1,420 savings.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end,: the Abraham, a plain pine box that costs
$495. Its only distinguishing features are three holes drilled in
the bottom (Rolon wouldn't elaborate on what those do). You'd
probably pay $695 for the box at a funeral home, he says. One
customer took it home to use as a coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't carry the very, very expensive ones _ the Honduran
mahogany,'' Rolon says as you browse. ``But I can get one for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   At Factory Caskets Direct, you choose your coffin, and then
Rolon has it stored and delivered to the funeral home when you pass
away.
</P>
<P>
   You pay upfront. His chances of collecting on delivery are
understandably iffy.

 &HT;    Having a hot-selling toy is `good for the entire industry'
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ No, it didn't start with Cabbage Patch
Kids.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know about holiday-hyped, media-driven,
tantrum-inciting toy fads? Ask Grandma whether she felt the
slightest guilt about begging for a Shirley Temple doll in the
middle of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   (You can bet she got plenty of lectures about starving children
and people selling apples on street corners. You can also bet she
got the doll.)
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone who's seen A Christmas Story.
</P>
<P>
   Ralphie doesn't badger his parents into getting him just any BB
gun, does he? Like any real Saturday matinee junkie of the 1930s or
'40s, Ralphie absolutely has to have an official Red Ryder gun like
the one his favorite cowboy star fires at rustlers.
</P>
<P>
   From the very first time his parents warn, ``You'll shoot your
eye out,'' you know two things:
</P>
<P>
   1) They're right.
</P>
<P>
   2) They'll give in anyway.
</P>
<P>
   You also know that the bawling, bleeding Ralphie at movie's end
will learn nothing from his brush with disaster. He is not only
every kid, he is every parent-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   He is a born sucker. Does that seem harsh? It won't two months
from now.
</P>
<P>
   All parents know that the surest way to light up a child's eyes
is with a 9-volt battery. But we all learn soon enough that Math
Whiz Gumby or whatever seemed so captivating when the wrapping
paper came off is destined to be tossed behind the couch long
before the battery runs down.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, every parent learns that each trip to the toy
store for the latest craze results in an equal and opposite trip to
the Goodwill bin or the local kids shelter.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with Care Bears and Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles.
So it will be with Furby. (Maybe not with Beanie Babies, which are
really for adults who believe they are collector items on a par
with Cleopatra's jewels.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet we continue on an unprecedented national toy-buying binge
that last year worked out to about $350 a child, according to
industry figures. We rang up more than $1bil-lion on action
figures, twice that much on regular-old dolls and more than $4
billion on video games.
</P>
<P>
   In all, toy sales topped $22bil-lion, up nearly $10 billion in
10 years. That's enough money to raise serious expectations: We put
men on the moon for $24 billion. So it's no wonder we've come to
believe there will be something miraculous each year _ something
worth the longer lines and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it's Furby, an odd-looking marvel of microchips like
two other recent fads, Tickle Me Elmo and Tamagotchi. The gimmick
is that Furby's nonsensical utterances (the Furbish dialect of
gibberish) gradually turn to English in a manner that mimics
learning.
</P>
<P>
   Whether great numbers of children will find that entertaining,
much less intellectually stimulating, remains to be seen. For most
people, so does Furby. Rave reviews in national publications and on
tele, and you have a powerful and increasing urge to spend wildly
on toys that impress.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach sees more than a little blame-shifting in the notion
that parents are helpless to say no to fads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids get caught up in all this,'' she says. ``It's the
parents who have some deeper need to brag to the neighbors or who
think they have something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   What kids really want is a warm lap and a little attention,
Auerbach says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to sit down and play a game, or put together a
puzzle,'' she says. ``They want what they need, a chance to develop
their language skills, their artistic expression, their
dexterity.''
</P>
<P>
   On her wWeb site (www.drtoy.com), Auerbach offers a list of 100
toys that parents and children can play with together. They're all
toys that require children to think and imagine, rather than toys
that simply dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach spreads her message through the Internet, magazine and
newspaper articles, television and books, including her latest,
Smart Play.
</P>
<P>
   And still, people miss the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting e-mail every day begging me for help finding
a Furby,'' she says with exasperation. ``I couldn't care less. It's
the last toy I'd put on my list.''
</P>
<P>

   Hot Wheels, introduced in 1968, continue to be the
hottest-selling toys in the country. They don't have motors or
computers, and they don't do anything except roll really fast
downhill. More than a billion have been sold.

   More than 230 million eggs of Silly Putty have been sold since
1950, about 3,000 tons.

 &HT;    Just who is Greg Hauptner?
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The quote from billionaire oilman Nelson
Bunker Hunt tells you all you need to know about Greg Hauptner.
</P>
<P>
   Decide what you want to do and resolve to pay the price to get
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken that quote as one of the building blocks of my
existence,'' says the full-time hairdresser, part-time TV show host
and round-the-clock entrepreneur. ``I only added as long as what
you do is moral, ethical and decent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Greg Hauptner _ a former long-haired hippie turned savvy
(some might say shameless) self-promoter. Or, as one friend put it,
a man who knows how to get his name in the papers.
</P>
<P>
   And in magazines and on TV. Hauptner, 52, has been featured in
People, Vogue, Family Circle and was even selected by CBS News as
one of the six most successful business people in Florida in the
late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   One glance at Hauptner's extensive four page _ yes four page! _
resume shows he's been a hairdresser (he once owned a string of
shops, but is now stylists director at Elizabeth Arden in Palm
Beach Gardens), author (five motivational-style books), management
seminar leader (he recently worked with Jonathan's Landing Golf
Club in Jupiter) and even stuntman in the awful 1992 film Cop and a
Half (he fought with Burt Reynolds during a barroom brawl).
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Reynolds, from 1979 to 1987, Hauptner was the
official stylist for the Burt Reynolds Theater, where he coifed
such stars as Farrah Fawcett, Loni Anderson and Kirstie Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can add another occupation to Hauptner's job-filled
resume _ TV host. Since April the gregarious New York native has
hosted In Style with Greg Hauptner, a low-budget version of
Lifestyles of the Rich &AMP; Famous. The hour-long show has featured
segments on Donald Trump, Sylvester Stallone and Tommy Lee Jones at
The Mar-a-Lago Club.
</P>
<P>
   Like Robin Leach, Hauptner's show attempts to give viewers an
up-close-and-personal look at some of South Florida's richest
residents and visitors. The show has done segments on Rolls-Royces,
luxury yachts and The Breakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek out class, style and elegance,'' says Hauptner.
</P>
<P>
   But who is Greg Hauptner? A publicity seeker or a man who works
hard for the money and the fame?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is a little bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Green, the senior vice president of government relations
for Raycom Media Group, has known Hauptner for 17 years. Green
describes Hauptner as a smart salesman, and a sincere, ``no B.S.''
guy as well. ``When he had his own shops, he marketed his stores
very well. He managed to get his name in the papers. He knew how to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauptner, who says he earns a six-figure salary from his various
endeavors, is probably best known for dumping his 1967 Rolls-Royce
Silver Shadow into the Atlantic in 1985 to protest the lack of
artificial reefs for fish. The stunt was typical Hauptner. Of
course, the widely publicized move didn't hurt business for his
Great American Hair Experience salon.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptner says he knows how to get attention because he works at
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy tons of audio cassettes on being successful in business
and the philosophy of how to treat people nicely,'' says a nattily
dressed Hauptner, while sitting in one of Elizabeth Arden's
shoebox-sized facial rooms. ``I love networking and I meet people
constantly. But I always find out first what I can do for them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Hauptner got his TV show. In fact, Hauptner wasn't
even looking to get on TV. Jan Orazio, a local television station
president and general manager, met with Hauptner to get her hair
styled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she wanted to do local programming,'' recalls the
quick-thinking Hauptner. ``So, I said, `I'll do a show for you.'
And she goes, `Really? What would you do?' I thought, `I'll do, uh,
a Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous show.' It took me like 12
seconds to make up the show and sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Orazio, however, was only willing to give Hauptner one segment
on the program. But when the show's main segment didn't pan out,
she had to put something on the air, so she gave the eager Hauptner
a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a real presence before the camera and he projects a
lot of confidence,'' Orazio says.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-time TV host admits he's not going to make anyone
forget Johnny Carson, or even Robin Leach. Initially, Hauptner read
from a script. He came off as approachable as a corpse. His
solution: ad-lib everything.
</P>
<P>
   He also ditched holding a 1950s-looking microphone that made him
look more like The Price Is Right's Bob Barker than a hip host.
``When I was holding up that microphone, I looked terrible,''
Hauptner admits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some production problems, Orazio says In Style with Greg
Hauptner is one of her station's most popular programs. She notes
that about 30 viewers have called in, requesting tapes. With a
potential local viewership (Channel 19 in West Palm Beach) of
120,000 and a potential Comcast viewership of 140,000-150,000,
Orazio says she believes Hauptner's show can capture an even bigger
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to meet to discuss the direction we want the show
to go in,'' says Orazio, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptner admits the show's low-rent production values are slowly
improving. ``We're all learning together,'' he notes. ``Now we have
production meetings ahead of time, instead of just showing up and
shooting like we did before.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may not look like a slick, network production, the show
often covers interesting topics for a well-heeled audience. But
Hauptner says his favorite show was when he got to fly the Goodyear
Blimp. ``The feeling was absolutely tremendous,'' he says. ``It was
a feeling of floating. But it's much tougher to fly than it seemed
it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out what he wanted to do with his life was once tough
for Hauptner, a tall, ruggedly handsome man with salt-and-pepper
hair and a bushy mustache. While attending Palm Beach Junior
College in the mid '60s, Hauptner had no clue what he was going to
do with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went there for five years and never got out of a two-year
college,'' he cracks. ``I went to too many parties. So, I took $200
and a beat up van and went to California in 1969 to become a hippie
and live forever. That lasted a couple of years since I had no idea
what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Florida in 1973, he met a hair salon owner who lost all
his money in a get-rich-quick scam. Hauptner and the man became
fast friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me his books and how much money he was making,'' he
says. ``He said, `If you ever want to get out of what you're doing,
go to beauty school and you can work at my shop.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what Hauptner did. He went to hairdressing
school for one year in West Palm Beach and Miami. He figured he'd
make some quick money, cash out and ``get a real job.'' The chatty
Hauptner, however, discovered he actually liked being a
hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked the people part,'' he notes. ``If you really
think about it, it's unique because there's no other business where
you can touch somebody's head and talk to them and you have a
captive audience for a half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauptner invested much of his earnings back into his education.
He took private lessons and went to hair shows all over the world.
The work paid off _ he once owned six shops.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptner, however, says he sold the salons one-by-one because
they were becoming difficult to operate. ``They went under because
of my lack of focus,'' he says. ``I would go out and do other
projects and my businesses suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for Elizabeth Arden, he adds, gives him time for other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   One of those projects was writing books. Hauptner has written
five self-help books, three of which were self-published. He says
the idea to become a part-time author came about 20 years ago when
his first salon ran into financial difficulties. After talking to
friends, who gave him advice on turning around his business,
Hauptner decided he could ``write a book for novice people.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hauptner has had some setbacks (a photography business in
the late '70s also went under), one of the biggest blows came when
his five-year marriage ended. Hauptner doesn't like to talk about
it, but his barely-above-a-whisper voice makes it clear the wounds
remain fresh. But that hasn't stopped him from spending time with
his three kids, Gregory, 5; Jake, 2 and Chloe, 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptner, however, still spends most of his time doing hair and
thinking of ways to get rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I schizophrenic?'' he asks. ``No, I'm just an easily bored
person. I like working on a lot of things. . . . Some people have a
passion for model airplanes, I just have a passion for doing all
these little things to see if I can turn them into big things.''
</P>
<P>
   STYLIST RECALLS BRUSH WITH STARS
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Greg Hauptner was the official hair stylist for
the Burt Reynolds Theatre, meaning he had close encounters with
several stars. Here's how he remembers some of them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kirstie Alley: ``She's a sailor's delight. That woman doesn't
care what she says, when she says it or what words she uses. She's
the kind of girl who'll prop her feet up, play cards and drink with
you until you pass out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Loni Anderson: ``She has the purest skin I've ever seen on a
human being. She's also very candid and very open about everything,
almost to the point of sounding naive. She would tell you anything
_ even the intimate details of her romances and her relationship
with Burt.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dom DeLuise: ``He just loved to talk dirty. His favorite thing
was to be in a situation like opening night, when everybody's in
tuxedos, and he'd wear these old Italian shirts with the stripes
down the middle. He loved to get women who were in furs and
diamonds all chuckling by saying the filthiest and dirtiest
things.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Farrah Fawcett: ``She was so sweet. If she got an inkling that
you were thirsty, she would stop the production and personally get
you a glass of water.''

 &HT;    Lunden's all about thinking positive, getting some sleep
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You'd think, after 20 years on TV, where
mere seconds can make or lose millions, Joan Lunden could answer
questions quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Not today, my friend.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because she's off the tube. Or maybe it's because the
presence of a tuna sandwich in a Styrofoam box makes her want to
chat like she's in a school cafeteria with a full hour before
fourth period. Or maybe it's because she doesn't realize I have all
of 10 minutes with her before her book signing.
</P>
<P>
   We're nestled in an office in Boca Raton, where about 100 folks
have gathered to fetch a copy of A Bend in the Road Is Not the End
of the Road (which whips ABC's Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place
for longest title in '98). I fire questions like shrapnel, she
replies like I've lobbed cannonballs. But her leisurely manner is
testament to her new life: Lunden, 48, finally has time on her
side. Here are a quick five with the former Good Morning America
co-host:
</P>
<P>
   1) There are tons of don't-worry-be-happy books. Why'd you write
one?
</P>
<P>
   Many are written by stress experts and psychologists. A lot of
people who'd walk by those books would come in to buy mine because
they're used to seeing me when they're in their bathrobes. The
viewers have even lived with me through three pregnancies (Jamie,
18; Lindsay, 15; and Sarah, 11).
</P>
<P>
   2) It seems as if you want to make clear that leaving GMA was
your call ...
</P>
<P>
   That really didn't have anything to do with it. I wanted people
to see that everyone must face change in a positive manner.
</P>
<P>
   (Excerpt: ``Just before the last contract, I remember saying: `I
just don't know if I can actually sign back on to this grind.''')
</P>
<P>
   3) How'd you meet Jeff? (She and husband, Jeff Konigsberg, 37,
have been married nearly two years. He runs a boys' camp.)
</P>
<P>
   At a deli in Greenwich, Conn. He came over to talk to me _ we
had a mutual friend _ and I remember wishing I'd ordered some melon
and a salad instead of a huge turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   4) How long did it take you to select your ``final outfit''?
(Lunden wore a fuchsia jacket over a black top and pants Sept. 4.)
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have time to mull it over. There was just so much going
on _ radio, TV shows, newspapers. It was a whirlwind. I just wanted
to look really bright. And slim.
</P>
<P>
   5) Do you think doing Claritin ads compromises you as a
journalist?
</P>
<P>
   I never worked for ABC News. I was very much under ABC
Entertainment. I'm a broadcaster, period. I've never claimed to be
more than a disseminator of information. And I really am the poster
child for allergies.

 &HT;    Francis helping those who may one day replace him at linebacker
position
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ National Football League players don't have the
right to choose their own successors, but James Francis is going to
have some input when the Cincinnati Bengals start looking for a new
left outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the 30-year-old Francis' playing time has
diminished, partly because of a knee injury and partly because the
2-11 Bengals want to look at younger players such as rookie
linebackers Adrian Ross and Steve Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is still trying to come back from a sprained ankle, but
Ross, a free agent from Colorado State, has been splitting time
with Francis.
</P>
<P>
   In last Sunday's 33-20 loss to Buffalo, Ross had one
interception and a deflection that led to another. He also had four
tackles, three of them for minus yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, a 6-foot-2, 245-pounder, said he has leaned heavily on
Francis for guidance and support. ``James has helped me a lot. He
tells me how to play against certain guys, how to adjust in certain
situations, even little things like what to expect in different
stadiums. I don't think I'd be in the situation that I'm in now if
it wasn't for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis sees nothing extraordinary about helping younger players
who are trying to take his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything these guys ask me, I'm going to tell them the
truth,'' he said. ``If I help them, I'm helping the team. I'm not
going to stop being the kind of person I am. Just because they're
after my job, that doesn't mean I'm going to stop being their
friend and stop trying to help them on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals are starting rookies Takeo Spikes and Brian Simmons
at the two inside 'backer spots and second-year man Reinard Wilson
at right outside.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been struggling all year, but most of the
problems have been with the line and secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in the way these young guys are playing,''
Francis said. ``They're going to be here for a long time. I know I
can still play the game. If the team decides to go another way next
year, I'll accept that and move on. I know I'll be playing next
year, whether it's here or someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross was a smallish defensive end at Colorado State and drew
free agent interest only from Jacksonville and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a linebacker at heart,'' he said. ``In
college, I didn't move to end until my last two years. I played end
like I was a linebacker. The coaches were always telling me,
'You're not a linebacker any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ross is still raw, but his play has attracted attention.
``Adrian is going to be a factor next year in who's going to start,
if he continues to improve,'' said coach Bruce Coslet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of thing you find out when you put these guys
in the game. You can get an idea out of practice and in training
camp, but when you get them in a real game, that's when you find
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said there is a direct correlation between playing time and
reaction time. ``I'm starting to know the defenses a lot better.
Now when the defense changes because a guy goes in motion or
something like that, I know what I'm going to do before the
defensive backs call the change.

 &HT;    Good riddance to employees like Johnson
 &HT;    If you criticize the boss, expect to be fired
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I'd have fired him.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have fired him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Johnson wrote his own ticket out of Cincinnati on Sunday.
He's an intelligent man. He knew what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   If you're employed by a company, you don't say, ``I wouldn't buy
its product.'' At least you don't say it out loud for public
dissemination.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Johnson did Sunday when he said there was no way
he'd attend a Bengal game as a fan.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if it's true. This is about common sense.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if I went on television and said I wouldn't buy this
paper. What would I expect management to do, ignore it?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Brown did what Johnson forced him to: He released his
punter and went on to the next page.
</P>
<P>
   If I own the team and you tell me I have no idea what I'm doing,
you're gone. It doesn't matter if I actually don't have an idea.
That's not an issue. The only thing that matters is that you have
certain obligations to the man signing the check _ one of which is
you don't trash him.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're so intrinsic to the business,
management couldn't afford to get rid of you. Mike Brown, for
instance, wouldn't have released offensive tackle Willie Anderson,
if Anderson had said that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee Johnson isn't Willie Anderson. And he isn't Brett Favre.
And he isn't Bruce Smith. Lee Johnson is replaceable.
</P>
<P>
   As for what Johnson said, some of it's true, some of it's not.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wouldn't go to a Bengal game if he were a fan. The
problem is, people have bought their tickets up front, so they can
either throw $40 or $80 or $160 in the waste basket, or go.
</P>
<P>
   When he said, ``The formula the Bengals have developed is not
working,'' who could possibly disagree with that?
</P>
<P>
   But when he added, ``Their financial formula is not working,''
he went over the edge. The Bengals are a cash cow. Bengal
management is eating well and living well, as are the players.
</P>
<P>
   And when he said, ``They're always building. The days of
building are over. When free agency arrived, building was
destroyed,'' he was wrong, too.
</P>
<P>
   And naive.
</P>
<P>
   No team just goes out and signs a bunch of free agents and wins.
Football is far too complicated and the salary cap precludes that.
The foundation must be there in advance.
</P>
<P>
   When the 49ers signed Ken Norton Jr. a couple of years ago, they
already had a solid framework. He was just another piece. Same
thing when the Packers signed Reggie White.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals' puzzle has so many missing pieces, there isn't
enough money to lure free agents to buy them all.
</P>
<P>
   You have to build with the draft and free agency, which is what
Mike Brown has tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   No, he hasn't been successful. He's had bad judgment or bad luck
or both.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bengals certainly haven't ignored free agency. They
threw a $5 million bonus at Neil O'Donnell. They tried to bulk up
their defensive line by giving big contracts to Clyde Simmons and
Michael Bankston.
</P>
<P>
   They've spent the money. Just not wisely.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Mike Brown is trying to lose.
</P>
<P>
   I agree he has to spend more money on his infrastructure. I
agree he has to hire more full-time scouts and should hire a
full-time general manager.
</P>
<P>
   I also doubt if he will. And there's no guarantee if he did that
everything would turn out rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Bengals lousy?
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike Brown wouldn't argue that with you.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're working for him, and you trumpet that fact, be
ready for the recriminations.

 &HT;    TV chef adds seasoning to show
 &HT;    By Bob Batz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Ming Tsai is preparing one of his
specialities on the Food Network, there's a good chance the
ingredients include a dash or two of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, who lived here for 18 years, hosts East Meets West With
Ming Tsai , which debuted Sept. 29 on the Food Network. The
34-year-old chef mentions Dayton often on the 30-minute program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it,'' he says,'' because I cooked my first restaurant
meal in Dayton and I have many fond memories of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, who was born in Newport Beach, Calif., was 12 when he went
to work at the Mandarin Kitchen, one of the first businesses to
open in Dayton's renovated downtown Arcade in 1980. At that time,
the takeout restaurant _ which specialized in the food of Northern
China _ was owned by his parents, Iris and Stephen Tsai, who now
live in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first dishes were fried rice and Mongolian beef, and that's
when I got hooked on cooking,'' Tsai recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai received a mechanical engineering degree from Yale
University, then moved to Paris to study at Cordon Bleu and work at
Fauchon and Natacha, where he encountered east-west cuisine for the
first time. He got his big break in television after executive chef
stints at restaurants in Palo Alto and Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did guest shots on several Food Network shows, including
Dining Around, Ready, Set, Cook and Chef de Jour , then the
producer of Dining Around told me I had a knack for TV,'' he says.
``At his suggestion, I enrolled in a two-day crash course with a
professional media trainer, whose job is training chefs for TV. It
cost me a bundle _ $1,500 _ but it was worth it because he taught
me a lot of the tricks of the trade, like how to move plates around
on the set and how to talk to the cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   On East Meets West , Tsai combines Asian cooking techniques with
Western ingredients to create international menus featuring
everything from Chinese vegetables to French sauces. Recent
episodes, which are taped in New York, featured such dishes as
Sesame Noodles With Cucumber, Shredded Ahi Tuna Tartare and Red
Roast Duck With Bok Choy Fondue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People nowadays want more than meatloaf and right now Asian
food is very popular,'' Tsai explains. ``It's good for you, offers
flavors that don't exist in other cuisines and is relatively
inexpensive to prepare because even Kroger sells ginger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food Network, which reaches 31.5 million cable TV
subscribers with its 24-hour programming, is a fascinating place,
according to Tsai.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 15 fridges and you wouldn't believe the number of
people who work here. It takes 25 or 30, including a kitchen staff
of six or eight, just to tape one episode of East Meets West ..
It's quite a hoot for me and sometimes things get pretty wild
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   On-air goofs are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   `` Just today, we were making a balsamic vinegar syrup and I
left the pan on the stove too long. I splashed hot vinegar on my
arm, then the kitchen started filling with smoke. We didn't
re-shoot the episode, though, because little mistakes are part of
cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tsai's not creating culinary masterpieces in front of the
Food Network cameras, he and his wife, Polly, own and operate Blue
Ginger, a chic eatery in the Boston suburb of Wellesley. They
opened the restaurant in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a casual, upbeat bistro that has the feel, but not the
stuffiness, of a classy restaurant,'' he says. ``We seat 120 and
prices range from $5 to $12 for appetizers and $16 to $25 for
entrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Ginger's most popular menu item is miso sake marinated
Chilean sea bass served with soba (buckwheat noodles).
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell the hell out of that dish,'' Tsai says, adding that
the restaurant is also noted for its shiitake and leek spring rolls
that are served with three chili dipping sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, who commutes between Boston and New York, isn't sure what
he'll be doing 10 years from now. ``I'll probably be involved with
something that's related to what I'm doing right now. Polly and I
aren't interested in making a million, because were not that gung
ho, but we are having fun. We definitely aren't dreaming of opening
five more Blue Gingers and having a restaurant chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsai's frequent on-air plugs of Dayton have trigged numerous
reponses from the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming out of the woodwork,'' he says. ``Just the
other day, my old tennis pro e-mailed me out of the blue. I've
heard from lots of other people, too, including some I haven't
talked to for a long, long time and a few I've never even met. I
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes for two of Ming Tsai's specialties - chicken
with snap peas and shiitakes and mushroom and leek spring rolls.

 &HT;    Help friends, family stock cupboards with the items they really
need
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Christmas is the perfect time to give someone the
gift they would never buy for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And one place to start is in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the possibilities are the gadgets and tools that
cooks don't need very often _ but when you need them you probably
can't borrow from the neighbors, who may not have a turkey baster,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Even people with state-of-the-art kitchens and cupboards full of
Calphalon may not have a nutmeg grater.
</P>
<P>
   I've been in fine kitchens that didn't have a decent, readable
measuring cup.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to do some research, poking around in the shelves
and drawers to see what's missing. I've got the list of things to
look for and buy if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'd mislead you if I said that they'll ``ooh and ah'' on
Christmas morn and say, ``Oh, it's what I've always wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't know they needed an instant-read thermometer.
My sister didn't until I tucked one in her Christmas stocking;
she's still talking about how she uses it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my checklist:
</P>
<P>
   Nutmeg grater: The traditional dime-store grater, with a little
pocket to hold the whole nutmeg, does the job, though you also may
grate your fingers. It's less than $3 and available everywhere. But
newer models range from the utilitarian Zyliss to acrylic grinders
that look and work like a pepper mill. And fresh nutmeg makes all
the difference. One grind and you're inspired to bake.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger grater: Lots of today's recipes call for fresh grated
ginger, and nothing does the job like the oroshigane developed by
the Japanese. It has fine teeth to trap the fibers. Inexpensive
metal ones can be found at some Asian stores. Ceramic versions,
with teeth that are not quite as sharp, are also available in most
cookware stores. T
</P>
<P>
   Bulb baster: You may need it only once or twice a year, but
there's no substitute. Do hold out for one made of stainless steel.
The hot fat siphoned off a duck or Christmas goose can melt a
plastic baster.
</P>
<P>
   Zester: So many recipes call for lemon zest, and no matter how
many times we explain it, people ask, ``What is lemon zest?'' It's
the flavorful outer peel, and you need a special tool to remove it
so you don't get into the bitter white pith. The traditional 6-inch
zester has five little holes to remove strands of lemon zest with
precision. The newest tool, called a microplane, looks more like a
rasp from a woodworker's shop. Just pull it across the lemon in one
long slide and you have lemon zest.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus juicer: Sure, everyone has a lemon juicer, either plastic
or glass (the old ones are collectibles), but often there's the
problem of picking out the seeds and pulp. This new gadget is a
three-piece device. Put in the lemon half, cover and twist to
juice. The seeds are strained out and you can pour the juice from
spout in the container. Called the Mini Citrus Juicer.
</P>
<P>
   Instant-read thermometer: Most cookware stores are reordering
the battery-operated digital models, which sell out during the
Thanksgiving rush. This model holds the reading for easy reference.
But the cheaper model, about $10 to $12 at most stores, is good to
have on hand as a backup for when the batteries go out in the
high-tech digital version.
</P>
<P>
   This tool is essential because food temperature is a major
safety issue. The old-fashioned models that cooks stuck into the
roast should be discarded. After years of cooking along with the
roast, it's inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable peeler: They probably bought one years ago at the
supermarket or discount store, which means the peeler has been
through the dishwasher a zillion times and is starting to rust or
just corrode. So it's a good time to pitch it and get one that
really works.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxo Good Grips peeler is the choice of chefs who have to
peel more than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Mouli grater: If I had to pick three tools to take to a desert
island, this rotary grater would be one. It is the perfect gadget
for grating fresh Parmesan, and it does a wonderful job with nuts
and chocolate. The tool has been around for decades, and my early
version had three interchangeable drum graters.
</P>
<P>
   The newer stainless-steel version promises a longer life than
the earlier aluminum or plastic models. A stainless model with one
drum is around $20.00.
</P>
<P>
   Knife sharpener: If you think they'll use it, buy a hand-held
sharpening steel, but if they're into gadgets buy one of the manual
countertop sharpeners by Chef's Choice or Henkel. Regularly slide
the blade through the correctly aligned diamond hone sharpeners to
keep knives sharp.
</P>
<P>
   If money is no object, and noise is not objectionable, the
Chef's Choice electronic model is the one to get. Never buy the
discount-house variety that allegedly sharpens knives and opens
cans. Those will destroy a knife's sharp edge.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk: When the gravy recipe says to whisk the broth into the
flour and fat, this is the tool to use. Versatile in the kitchen
for whipping everything from egg whites and cream to polenta, it
can get regular use. Whisks come in many prices and varieties,
including the flat whisk, medium-sized sauce whisk and the big
balloon whisk. Stainless steel is preferable; avoid wood-handled
whisks, which will crack.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate measuring spoons: There was a cook at the design
board when they came up with these spice spoons sold through the
King Arthur Baker's Catalog . They call them Spice Measuring
Spoons, and they're my favorite find of '98. The spoons fit deep
into the tallest, narrowest spice can or bottle. If you've ever
made a mess pouring mustard powder into a fat 1 teaspoon measure,
you'll know these are the solution. Priced at $12.95; to order,
call (800) 827-6836.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the Indian guide who is the
proposed subject for the new U.S. dollar coin?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, her name: According to the U.S. Mint, historians
disagree over how it's spelled (Sacagawea or Sacajawea, among
others), and how it's translated (either as ``boat launcher'' or
``bird woman''). Regardless of the spelling, Sacagawea _ as it's
listed on the Mint's Internet site _ was the teenage guide who in
1804-06 accompanied the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William
Clark from the northern Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean and back.
</P>
<P>
   Captured at age 11 by a Hidatsa raiding party and taken from her
Shoshone tribe, Sacagawea subsequently was bought from the Hidatsa
by a French-Canadian trader, Toussaint Charbonneau, who made her
one of his wives. In 1804, Toussaint was hired by Lewis and Clark,
not for his own skills but for those of Sacagawea. She knew several
Indian languages, and being Shoshone could help the explorers make
contact with her people and acquire horses that were crucial to the
expedition. She also provided knowledge about the rugged
topography, and she taught the explorers how to find edible roots
and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Little is documented about what happened to Sacagawea after the
expedition, but she is believed to have died Dec. 20, 1812. She is
buried in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address to request greetings from the White House
to someone celebrating a birthday?
</P>
<P>
   A: Requests for presidential greetings for a person 80 or older
must be made in writing. Mail to: The White House, Attention
Greetings Office, Room 39, Washington, DC 20502; or fax it to
202-395-1232. The same procedure is followed if requesting
greetings for couples observing 50th wedding anniversaries. The
White House says a response will be mailed 10 days before the
birthday or anniversary. For recorded information, call
202-456-2724.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the late-night sky recently, I noticed an incredible
circle around the moon, like a fog or mist of some sort. What was
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a common phenomenon in winter, said astronomer David
Dundee at Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta. Whenever it happens,
Fernbank gets calls from people asking if it's a UFO, he added. The
apparent ``halo'' is created by ice crystals and water vapor in the
upper atmosphere. It's the same phenomenon that causes rainbows
during the daytime, and occurs because of the process of refracting
or bending light by water or ice in the upper atmosphere. If the
temperature had been lower than it was that night, you'd have seen
a tighter, multicolored ring, Dundee added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Chinese are upset because the Japanese government has
never apologized about World War II. Has the Japanese government
ever apologized to the United States for attacking Pearl Harbor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but many years after the fact. The first time a Japanese
official publicly apologized for that country's role in the war
came in August 1995, when Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama made a
somber address on Japanese national television. In it, he became
the first prime minister in Japanese history to use the word
``apology'' instead of ``remorse'' or ``regret'' in a public speech
about the war. A month later, a Japanese envoy made what was
believed to be the first official apology on American soil for the
attack 50 years earlier. ``With utmost anguish, we squarely face
the agony of our deeds,'' said Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, the Japanese
consul general to Chicago. He was addressing a group of World War
II veterans and foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Because Japan long has considered itself a war victim, not an
aggressor, it has been extremely reluctant to offer any sort of
apology. In early 1995, for example, the Japanese parliament
refused a resolution expressing remorse. In 1994, Japan's
government apologized for failing to break off diplomatic
negotiations before the attack on Pearl Harbor, but that was
addressed to the people of Japan, not to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports say the new space station is a joint venture of
16 nations, among them Russia and the United States, which is
paying most of the costs. What are the other participating
countries, and how much are they contributing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Others taking part in the International Space Station are
Japan, Canada, Brazil and the 11 member countries of the European
Space Agency: Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, Denmark,
the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Money predictions vary widely, but the most recent suggested
cost for construction and hardware alone was about $40 billion.
Officially, the U.S. share is expected to be almost $25 billion.
The original Russian contribution was expected to be $8 billion to
$10 billion, but that was before the current economic crisis hit.
Since Russian Proton rockets and Soyuz spacecraft are vital to the
enterprise, it's believed that U.S. taxpayers may well have to pick
up much of Russia's original contribution. The other partners'
shares are about $3.1 billion from Japan; $850 million from Canada;
$200 million from Brazil; and $3.8 billion from the European group,
with a separate $550 million from Italy. With shuttle flights and
operational expenses added to engineering and construction costs,
the price tag is expected to reach or exceed $100 billon during the
station's planned 10-year operational lifetime. The target date for
its completion is 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``jaywalking?''
</P>
<P>
   A: The expression dates to the early part of the century,
according to Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, when
``jay'' was a popular slang term meaning ``countrified'' or
``rustic.'' A jay was pretty much the same as a rube and the word
was so used by George M. Cohan in the lyrics of one of his most
famous songs, ``45 Minutes From Broadway.'' A farmer _ strange in
the ways of a city, and perhaps frightened by all the newfangled
autos churning down the streets at fantastic speeds up to 15 mph _
might have been expected to cross the street without paying
attention to vehicles, signs or crosswalks, if there were such.
Hence, ``jaywalking.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I live in Dayton, Ohio, a city where I-70 and I-75 intersect,
with heavy congestion. I've heard that there's a pattern to the way
highways are numbered, related to their direction. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, U.S. and Interstate highways on east-west routes have
even numbers, and on north-south routes have odd numbers. Thus, in
your situation, I-70 goes east-west, I-75 north-south.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nearly 20 years ago, a nuclear reactor failed at the Three
Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania, creating a crisis. What is
the current status of that failed reactor? Has it been completely
cleaned up? What have been the costs?
</P>
<P>
   A: The nuclear power plant, site of the most serious accident in
the history of America's nuclear power industry in 1979, was back
in the news in July when it was announced that its owner, GPU Inc.
of Morristown, N.J., planned to sell it to a joint venture between
Peco Energy Co. and British Energy PLC. The reactor that was ruined
in the accident March 28, 1979, was not part of the sale, and would
continue to be owned by GPU, which spent $100 million refurbishing
the plant and its other reactor and retraining workers after the
incident. As reported by Bloomberg News in July when the sale was
announced, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission now considers
Three Mile Island to be one of the better-run U.S. nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, the first sale of a nuclear plant by a U.S.
utility, is expected to take one to two years to win approval from
regulators, including the NRC. Peco, a power company with 1.5
million customers in the Philadelphia area, and British Energy, an
electricity generating company in the United Kingdom, are in a
partnership to purchase U.S. nuclear plants. The two companies
formed a joint venture in September called AmerGen Energy Co. to
buy the plants.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the Indian guide who is the
proposed subject for the new U.S. dollar coin?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, her name: According to the U.S. Mint, historians
disagree over how it's spelled (Sacagawea or Sacajawea, among
others), and how it's translated (either as ``boat launcher'' or
``bird woman''). Regardless of the spelling, Sacagawea _ as it's
listed on the Mint's Internet site _ was the teenage guide who in
1804-06 accompanied the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William
Clark from the northern Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean and back.
</P>
<P>
   Captured at age 11 by a Hidatsa raiding party and taken from her
Shoshone tribe, Sacagawea subsequently was bought from the Hidatsa
by a French-Canadian trader, Toussaint Charbonneau, who made her
one of his wives. In 1804, Toussaint was hired by Lewis and Clark,
not for his own skills but for those of Sacagawea. She knew several
Indian languages, and being Shoshone could help the explorers make
contact with her people and acquire horses that were crucial to the
expedition. She also provided knowledge about the rugged
topography, and she taught the explorers how to find edible roots
and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Little is documented about what happened to Sacagawea after the
expedition, but she is believed to have died Dec. 20, 1812. She is
buried in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address to request greetings from the White House
to someone celebrating a birthday?
</P>
<P>
   A: Requests for presidential greetings for a person 80 or older
must be made in writing. Mail to: The White House, Attention
Greetings Office, Room 39, Washington, DC 20502; or fax it to
202-395-1232. The same procedure is followed if requesting
greetings for couples observing 50th wedding anniversaries. The
White House says a response will be mailed 10 days before the
birthday or anniversary. For recorded information, call
202-456-2724.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the late-night sky recently, I noticed an incredible
circle around the moon, like a fog or mist of some sort. What was
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a common phenomenon in winter, said astronomer David
Dundee at Fernbank Science Center in Atlanta. Whenever it happens,
Fernbank gets calls from people asking if it's a UFO, he added. The
apparent ``halo'' is created by ice crystals and water vapor in the
upper atmosphere. It's the same phenomenon that causes rainbows
during the daytime, and occurs because of the process of refracting
or bending light by water or ice in the upper atmosphere. If the
temperature had been lower than it was that night, you'd have seen
a tighter, multicolored ring, Dundee added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Chinese are upset because the Japanese government has
never apologized about World War II. Has the Japanese government
ever apologized to the United States for attacking Pearl Harbor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but many years after the fact. The first time a Japanese
official publicly apologized for that country's role in the war
came in August 1995, when Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama made a
somber address on Japanese national television. In it, he became
the first prime minister in Japanese history to use the word
``apology'' instead of ``remorse'' or ``regret'' in a public speech
about the war. A month later, a Japanese envoy made what was
believed to be the first official apology on American soil for the
attack 50 years earlier. ``With utmost anguish, we squarely face
the agony of our deeds,'' said Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, the Japanese
consul general to Chicago. He was addressing a group of World War
II veterans and foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Because Japan long has considered itself a war victim, not an
aggressor, it has been extremely reluctant to offer any sort of
apology. In early 1995, for example, the Japanese parliament
refused a resolution expressing remorse. In 1994, Japan's
government apologized for failing to break off diplomatic
negotiations before the attack on Pearl Harbor, but that was
addressed to the people of Japan, not to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports say the new space station is a joint venture of
16 nations, among them Russia and the United States, which is
paying most of the costs. What are the other participating
countries, and how much are they contributing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Others taking part in the International Space Station are
Japan, Canada, Brazil and the 11 member countries of the European
Space Agency: Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, Denmark,
the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Money predictions vary widely, but the most recent suggested
cost for construction and hardware alone was about $40 billion.
Officially, the U.S. share is expected to be almost $25 billion.
The original Russian contribution was expected to be $8 billion to
$10 billion, but that was before the current economic crisis hit.
Since Russian Proton rockets and Soyuz spacecraft are vital to the
enterprise, it's believed that U.S. taxpayers may well have to pick
up much of Russia's original contribution. The other partners'
shares are about $3.1 billion from Japan; $850 million from Canada;
$200 million from Brazil; and $3.8 billion from the European group,
with a separate $550 million from Italy. With shuttle flights and
operational expenses added to engineering and construction costs,
the price tag is expected to reach or exceed $100 billon during the
station's planned 10-year operational lifetime. The target date for
its completion is 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``jaywalking?''
</P>
<P>
   A: The expression dates to the early part of the century,
according to Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, when
``jay'' was a popular slang term meaning ``countrified'' or
``rustic.'' A jay was pretty much the same as a rube and the word
was so used by George M. Cohan in the lyrics of one of his most
famous songs, ``45 Minutes From Broadway.'' A farmer _ strange in
the ways of a city, and perhaps frightened by all the newfangled
autos churning down the streets at fantastic speeds up to 15 mph _
might have been expected to cross the street without paying
attention to vehicles, signs or crosswalks, if there were such.
Hence, ``jaywalking.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I live in Dayton, Ohio, a city where I-70 and I-75 intersect,
with heavy congestion. I've heard that there's a pattern to the way
highways are numbered, related to their direction. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, U.S. and Interstate highways on east-west routes have
even numbers, and on north-south routes have odd numbers. Thus, in
your situation, I-70 goes east-west, I-75 north-south.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nearly 20 years ago, a nuclear reactor failed at the Three
Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania, creating a crisis. What is
the current status of that failed reactor? Has it been completely
cleaned up? What have been the costs?
</P>
<P>
   A: The nuclear power plant, site of the most serious accident in
the history of America's nuclear power industry in 1979, was back
in the news in July when it was announced that its owner, GPU Inc.
of Morristown, N.J., planned to sell it to a joint venture between
Peco Energy Co. and British Energy PLC. The reactor that was ruined
in the accident March 28, 1979, was not part of the sale, and would
continue to be owned by GPU, which spent $100 million refurbishing
the plant and its other reactor and retraining workers after the
incident. As reported by Bloomberg News in July when the sale was
announced, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission now considers
Three Mile Island to be one of the better-run U.S. nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, the first sale of a nuclear plant by a U.S.
utility, is expected to take one to two years to win approval from
regulators, including the NRC. Peco, a power company with 1.5
million customers in the Philadelphia area, and British Energy, an
electricity generating company in the United Kingdom, are in a

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: PART TWO OF TWO TAKES.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: This season, the undefeated Denver Broncos almost lost to the
struggling Cincinnati Bengals. Could you print the scores of the 17
games that the 1972 Miami Dolphins won in their undefeated season?
</P>
<P>
   A: The teams they beat, in order: Kansas City 20-10, Houston
34-13, Minnesota 16-14, New York Jets 27-17, San Diego 24-10,
Buffalo 24-23, Baltimore 23-0, Buffalo 30-16, New England 52-0, New
York Jets 28-24, St. Louis (Cardinals) 31-10, New England 37-21,
New York Giants 23-13, Baltimore 16-0, Cleveland 20-14 (AFC
divisional playoff), Pittsburgh 21-17 (AFC championship),
Washington 14-7 (Super Bowl).
</P>
<P>
   Miami is the only team in National Football League history to go
through an entire season, including postseason games, unbeaten and
untied. For the Broncos to go undefeated this season, they'd have
to win 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We watched the lighting of the Christmas tree at Rockefeller
Center on TV. I didn't hear how many lights are on it, or if any
ornaments or other decorations are used. Do you know? Also, how
tall is the tree? Where did it come from? How long has Rockefeller
Center been doing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tree is decorated with 26,000 lights and a star on top,
but has no other ornamentation, said Nora King of Rockefeller
Center's marketing department. A 75-foot-tall Norway spruce, the 7
1/2-ton tree came from the yard of Adolph and Ethel Szitar of
Richfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Center's holiday celebration began in 1931, when
Depression-era workmen building the skyscraper complex placed a
small, unadorned tree on the site to help lift their spirits. In
1933 another tree was set up, this time with 700 lights. Over the
years, the tree and the ceremony both have grown. In 1951, the
tree-lighting was televised for the first time on NBC's ``The Kate
Smith Show.'' This year's ceremony, televised nationwide on NBC,
drew an ``enormous'' crowd, the largest in years, King said. She
attributed the turnout, estimated in the thousands, at least partly
to the unseasonably balmy early December weather.
</P>
<P>
   The lights were turned on precisely at 8:52 p.m. by first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and country singer Garth Brooks. Other
participants in the ceremony were singers Jewel and Cyndi Lauper,
and Olympic gold medal ice skater Kristi Yamaguchi, who took a few
turns on Rockefeller Center's ice rink.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With respect to inheritance taxes, can you tell me the dollar
amount of the estate that is exempt from taxation?
</P>
<P>
   A: By federal law, for estates of people who died in 1998, if
the total estate is less than $625,000, no estate tax return is
required. The amount of estate valuation excluded from taxation
will rise in increments from $625,000 to $1 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has any U.S. president ever visited, or been allowed on the
grounds of, Area 51 in Nevada?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Air Force says it has no information about any
presidential visits to Groom Lake, the official name of the site
you refer to as Area 51. The White House press office says
President Clinton has never been there, and wasn't sure if any
previous presidents had visited.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't know, Groom Lake is about 90 miles northwest
of Las Vegas. It's the home of a super-secret U.S. military base
that goes by such other names as Dreamland (the call sign of its
control tower), The Ranch, Paradise Ranch, The Darkside of the
Moon, and The Container, as well as Area 51. The base is in
Emigrant Valley north of the Papoose mountain range. Many planes
have been built and/or tested there, including the U-2 spy plane of
Gary Powers fame, the SR-71 and the F-117 stealth fighter. Rumors
fly as fast as a speeding UFO about the existence in Area 51 of a
hypersonic aircraft called the Aurora, as well as a
triangular-shaped aircraft with rounded corners called the TR-3
Black Manta. Airspace over Groom Lake is said to be off-limits to
civilian and military aircraft, and visits by anyone on land are,
to put it mildly, not encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Bill Hendrick went to
Nevada and described Area 51 in an article published in June 1997.
His opening paragraph sets the tone of the place: ``Something weird
is going on in the Nevada desert and the Pentagon is dead set on
keeping it secret.'' He went on to say the Air Force base at Area
51 ``is said by UFO buffs to be one of the places where aliens and
'flying saucers' have been taken for study by the military,'' but
added that there's little evidence to back up such claims, and the
Pentagon dismisses them as ludicrous. The secrecy surrounding the
base naturally gives rise to all sorts of rumors, making the nearby
town of Rachel, Nev., a great place for UFO-minded tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Mel Allen, the famed Yankees broadcaster, still living?
When I was 13, he wrote me a note about becoming a man at age 13.
As I'm approaching my 50th birthday, I wanted to track him down and
thank him for the note he sent so many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a nice thought, but sadly it's too late. Allen, the
voice of the New York Yankees for a generation, as well as the
voice of television's ``This Week in Baseball,'' died in June 1996
at age 83. He was with the Yankees from 1939 to 1964 and was
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. After Allen died,
the Yankees wore black armbands on the left sleeves of their
uniforms for the remainder of the '96 season in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard politicians on both sides of the Clinton-Lewinsky
issue say the other side someday would have to eat humble pie. Can
you explain that expression?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means to suffer humiliation, to apologize, or to abase
oneself. The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins says it has
nothing to do with the word humble, in the sense of lowly. Instead,
it's traced to ``umbles'' (from the Latin lumbulus, or litte loin).
It had to do with the custom in centuries past for the lord of a
manor to serve his guests meat _ venison, for example _ with the
manor's lowly workers given only umble pie made with the animal's
innards. Because the pie was associated with a position of
inferiority, it came to have its present meaning. The encyclopedia
says an anonymous punster in the time of William the Conqueror
added the ``h'' to umble _ but it didn't affect the pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the first college football game televised? When was
the first professional game televised?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first televised collegiate game was Sept. 30, 1939,
between Fordham University of New York and Waynesburg College of
Waynesburg, Pa. It was played in New York at Randalls Island and
televised by W2XBS of the National Broadcasting Corp. in New York.
Fordham won, 34-7. The first pro game to be televised was Oct. 22,
1939, at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field, also by W2XBS. The Brooklyn
Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are two census forms, one long and one short, but how
is it determined who gets which one? What is the penalty if someone
doesn't complete a census form?
</P>
<P>
   A: A computer randomly selects which households get which forms,
with the computer selecting simply by addresses. The Census Bureau
says it doesn't know who lives in each household. In a big city,
perhaps one in every eight households gets the long form, a
spokeswoman said; in a rural area, it's perhaps every other
household. The short form has seven questions; the long form has
those same questions, plus additional ones.
</P>
<P>
   So far as penalties are concerned, the Census Bureau's approach
is not to punish people who choose not to participate, although by
law the taking of a census is mandatory, and that same law says
anyone refusing to answer questions is subject to a fine. The
Census Bureau says it prefers that people understand how important
it is to participate, and because of that will be willing to fill
out whichever form they receive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an easy way to find out a person's ZIP code? Because
I'm handicapped, it's hard to get to a library or even to the post
office to look at a directory, and I don't have a computer for
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Postal Service operates a hotline to answer this and any
other postal question. Call 1-800-275-8777.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a radio commentator talking about a recent Ann
Landers column in which someone wrote that they resented long
letters at the holiday season about ``happy news'' that had
occurred during the previous year. The commentator then mentioned
an organization called Happy People. Can you fill in the details on
the Landers column, and the Happy People group?
</P>
<P>
   A: The issue came up in Landers' Nov. 29 syndicated column. In
it, Landers endorsed the idea that people should keep their ``happy
news'' _ or, as the letter writer put it, ``ghastly Christmas
letters'' _ to themselves. The letter writer, identified only as
``Your Cousin in Illinois,'' resented hearing about ``your new
$700,000 home or the Lexus your husband had parked in the driveway
as a surprise,'' adding that many people have a rough time making
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   The Happy People group the commentator mentioned is the Secret
Society of Happy People, based in Irving, Texas. It responded to
the Landers column by issuing a press release saying it was
``shocked to see such a blatant example'' of the way popular
culture discourages the sharing of happy moments. Pam Johnson,
founder of the Secret Society of Happy People, has asked Landers
for an apology, so you're likely to read more about this in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Happy People organization can be contacted at 5330 N.
MacArthur Blvd., Suite 148-215, Irving, TX 75038 (972-791-0028) or
at http://www.sohp.com for online information. If you want to join,
membership is $30, and you'll receive a T-shirt and other items, as
well as a quarterly newsletter.

When I was 13, he wrote me a note about becoming a man at age 13.
As I'm approaching my 50th birthday, I wanted to track him down and
thank him for the note he sent so many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a nice thought, but sadly it's too late. Allen, the
voice of the New York Yankees for a generation, as well as the
voice of television's ``This Week in Baseball,'' died in June 1996
at age 83. He was with the Yankees from 1939 to 1964 and was
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. After Allen died,
the Yankees wore black armbands on the left sleeves of their
uniforms for the remainder of the '96 season in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard politicians on both sides of the Clinton-Lewinsky
issue say the other side someday would have to eat humble pie. Can
you explain that expression?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means to suffer humiliation, to apologize, or to abase
oneself. The Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins says it has
nothing to do with the word humble, in the sense of lowly. Instead,
it's traced to ``umbles'' (from the Latin lumbulus, or litte loin).
It had to do with the custom in centuries past for the lord of a
manor to serve his guests meat _ venison, for example _ with the
manor's lowly workers given only umble pie made with the animal's
innards. Because the pie was associated with a position of
inferiority, it came to have its present meaning. The encyclopedia
says an anonymous punster in the time of William the Conqueror
added the ``h'' to umble _ but it didn't affect the pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the first college football game televised? When was
the first professional game televised?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first televised collegiate game was Sept. 30, 1939,
between Fordham University of New York and Waynesburg College of
Waynesburg, Pa. It was played in New York at Randalls Island and
televised by W2XBS of the National Broadcasting Corp. in New York.
Fordham won, 34-7. The first pro game to be televised was Oct. 22,
1939, at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field, also by W2XBS. The Brooklyn
Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are two census forms, one long and one short, but how
is it determined who gets which one? What is the penalty if someone
doesn't complete a census form?
</P>
<P>
   A: A computer randomly selects which households get which forms,
with the computer selecting simply by addresses. The Census Bureau
says it doesn't know who lives in each household. In a big city,
perhaps one in every eight households gets the long form, a
spokeswoman said; in a rural area, it's perhaps every other
household. The short form has seven questions; the long form has
those same questions, plus additional ones.
</P>
<P>
   So far as penalties are concerned, the Census Bureau's approach
is not to punish people who choose not to participate, although by
law the taking of a census is mandatory, and that same law says
anyone refusing to answer questions is subject to a fine. The
Census Bureau says it prefers that people understand how important
it is to participate, and because of that will be willing to fill
out whichever form they receive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an easy way to find out a person's ZIP code? Because
I'm handicapped, it's hard to get to a library or even to the post
office to look at a directory, and I don't have a computer for
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Postal Service operates a hotline to answer this and any
other postal question. Call 1-800-275-8777.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a radio commentator talking about a recent Ann
Landers column in which someone wrote that they resented long
letters at the holiday season about ``happy news'' that had
occurred during the previous year. The commentator then mentioned
an organization called Happy People. Can you fill in the details on
the Landers column, and the Happy People group?
</P>
<P>
   A: The issue came up in Landers' Nov. 29 syndicated column. In
it, Landers endorsed the idea that people should keep their ``happy
news'' _ or, as the letter writer put it, ``ghastly Christmas
letters'' _ to themselves. The letter writer, identified only as
``Your Cousin in Illinois,'' resented hearing about ``your new
$700,000 home or the Lexus your husband had parked in the driveway
as a surprise,'' adding that many people have a rough time making
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   The Happy People group the commentator mentioned is the Secret
Society of Happy People, based in Irving, Texas. It responded to
the Landers column by issuing a press release saying it was
``shocked to see such a blatant example'' of the way popular
culture discourages the sharing of happy moments. Pam Johnson,
founder of the Secret Society of Happy People, has asked Landers
for an apology, so you're likely to read more about this in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Happy People organization can be contacted at 5330 N.
MacArthur Blvd., Suite 148-215, Irving, TX 75038 (972-791-0028) or
at http://www.sohp.com for online information. If you want to join,
membership is $30, and you'll receive a T-shirt and other items, as
well as a quarterly newsletter.

   1. EDWARD NORTON'S 'HISTORY' LESSON In a short but controversial
career, Edward Norton has played a psychotic killer in ``Primal
Fear,'' a singing lover in ``Everyone Says I Love You'' and Hustler
Magazine's defence attorney in ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' But
his latest film, ``American History X,'' is his most controversial:
he plays a neo-Nazi leader. In this interview Norton talks about
the new film, how he learned to think like a Nazi, why he doesn't
expect it to help race relations in America and what led to the
rift between him and director Tony Kaye (who has disowned the film
after accusing Norton of re-editing his work.) By Jeanne Wolf.

Advertisers who pay for expensive TV slots in the middle of films
like ``Reservoir Dogs'' could be wasting their money. Screen
violence seems to impair viewers' memory for advertising. By Sara
Abdulla. Nature News Service. 400 words. (N/A France and Spain.) 3.
VINCE VAUGHN : SERIAL KILLER? How many times have you seen the
classic Hitchcock film ``Psycho?'' It's a question an interviewer
can't help but ask when talking to actor Vince Vaughn, who is
reprising the role of Norman Bates in the much-anticipated remake
of ``Psycho.'' Vaughn, 28, has only seen the original film twice.
``Once as a kid and when I found out I'd be playing the part,'' he
says. ``My thing was not to go and mimic Anthony Perkins ... I
decided to approach it as a play, like something powerful you see
once on stage, and then take the material and interpret it
differently.'' Interview by Molly Knight. From The Daily News
Record. 1,000 words + photos. 4. BRIDGET FONDA'S NOT-SO-SIMPLE PLAN
As a third-generation movie star, Bridget Fonda has some big shoes
to fill. But Fonda - daughter of Peter, niece of Jane,
granddaughter of Henry - has carved out a solid career for herself
in films such as Francis Ford Coppola's ``The Godfather Part III,''
``Single White Female,'' Quentin Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown'' and
her current film, ``A Simple Plan.'' In this interview Fonda talks
about the new film, her break-up with actor Eric Stoltz, an
upcoming role as a Marilyn Monroe imitator and why she's beginning
to rethink her career-long uninhibitedness about nude scenes. By
Jeanne Wolf. 1,400 words + photos.

   5. PETER FONDA : EASY RIDER TACKLES SHAKESPEARE His role as
Prospero in an innovative new version of Shakespeare's ``The
Tempest'' caps a memorable year for Peter Fonda. It follows his
Oscar nomination as Best Actor for ``Ulee's Gold,'' and the warm
reception given to ``Don't Tell Dad,'' his candid memoir of life
with his beloved but obstinate father, the late actor Henry Fonda.
In this interview Fonda talks about ``The Tempest,'' how ``Ulee's
Gold'' has changed his life, how his sister Jane reacted to his
autobiography and why he thinks so many people see echoes of their
own families in his. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.

LEVAR BURTON'S LONG, STRANGE TREK LeVar Burton's career started in
the past - as Kunta Kinte in the acclaimed TV miniseries ``Roots,''
- and has brought him to the future - as Lt. Cmdr. La Forge in the
TV series ``Star Trek : The Next Generation,'' and several movies,
including ``Star Trek : Insurrection.'' Burton explains why he
thinks ``Star Trek'' has such enduring appeal and how his blind
``Trek'' character reacts in the current film to the chance of
having his vision restored. By Jeanne Wolf and Shep Morgan. 1,400

 &HT;    Tight-fitting sleepwear OK for kids, safety agency says
 &HT;    (Eds: A compilation of health stories that moved from Cox News
Service in the past week.)
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sleeping in oversize T-shirts could create a firetrap for
children, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warns. But
snug-fitting cotton pajamas, previously considered dangerous,
should be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the agency advised the public that
flame-resistant pajamas were the only safe garments children should
wear to bed. However, those standards were relaxed this year, after
the commission decided that the way pajamas fit is more important
than the fabric they're made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``By fitting close to the skin, you don't have oxygen underneath
that feeds the fire,'' said Ken Giles, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, up to 300 children are burned by being near a flame _
a space heater, kitchen range or candle, for example _ while
wearing loose-fitting sleepers, the safety commission said. Hence
the warning about loose T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Flame-resistant fabrics, such as polyester, stop burning when
removed from a flame, prompting the agency's earlier warning about
fabric types. Cotton was one fabric the commission used to warn
against, because it can burn rapidly. But Giles said that is not
the case if the cotton garment is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Report says states not curbing animal pollution
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- At least 30 states are failing to curb pollution
from large livestock and poultry operations, a report says. The
waste from these ``animal factories'' fouls drinking water and
threatens public health, according to the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental group that released the report last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most states have few regulations and do little to enforce what
laws might be on the books,'' said Robbin Marks, one of the authors
of the report. ``The result is unchecked pollution leading to
contaminated well water, fish kills, sickness from toxic gases in
the air and plummeting property values for neighboring
landowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Livestock industry representatives say the report lacks
scientific evidence and is packed with old information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this (the report) was food, it would have salmonella,''
said Steve Cohen, spokesman for the National Pork Producers
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, however, say much more needs to be done.
The report details specific environmental problems in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, for example, groundwater contamination near
animal factories is increasing, posing a potentially serious
drinking water problem for nearby residents, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Shock waves tested for orthopedic pain
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials are under way in five U.S. cities to determine
if extracorporeal shock wave therapy can benefit those with foot
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not completely well; I've probably got about a third of
the pain left,'' says Rick Waits, 47, of Atlanta, whose foot pain
kept him from playing golf or going for walks. ``But the beauty of
it now is all I have to do is get off my feet for 15 or 30 minutes
and I start to get relief. That was never the case before.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment that turned Waits' life around and healed his heel
involves a machine called an OssaTron, which uses high-energy shock
waves to blast away calcifications and re-tear injured tendons in
heel spurs and tennis elbows. By doing this, doctors can dissipate
old scars and cause tendons to heal correctly, thus alleviating
pain.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, called extracorporeal shock wave therapy, has
been around since the mid-1980s, when it was first used to
disintegrate kidney stones. Researchers suspected that the process
had a number of orthopedic applications as well.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health officials try to get a hold on `basket' restraint
misuse
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Unless national standards for training
and the use of physical restraint are developed, state and national
experts believe more people like 17-year-old Laura Hanson will die.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still investigating Hanson's death, which was ruled a
homicide by asphyxia. She died Nov. 19 after two employees put her
in the controversial ``basket hold,'' a restraint that has lead to
the deaths of mental health patients across the country. The hold
becomes deadly when the patient is placed face-down, pressure is
placed on the backs and the patient's arms are criss-crossed over
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   The Child Welfare League of America, the nation's oldest child
advocacy organization, is pushing for national standards regarding
the use of restraint, said Lloyd Bullard, director of residential
care for the Washington-based nonprofit agency. Bullard said the
group wants federal legislation that will require training and
mandatory reporting of restraint deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It's head lice season again
</P>
<P>
   The start of the school season means the return of head lice
season. If your kids come home with head lice, don't expect a quick
solution. Here are a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the lice-killing shampoo. While common over-the-counter
pediculicides are only 70 percent to 80 percent effective at
killing the eggs, that's the only way to start. Most contain
pyrethrum, a naturally occurring pesticide derived from
chrysanthemum flowers. Lindane, the prescription pesticide used for
pubic lice, is considered somewhat toxic and should be used only as
a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a metal comb. Those plastic combs that come with
lice-killing shampoo are practically useless at trapping nits. Give
it to your daughter so she can disinfest Barbie's hair while you
work on hers with a sturdy metal comb, which costs about $5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a few small plastic hair clips and a fine-tooth plastic
comb with a long handle. You can and will learn to part and repart
the kids' hair like a stylist cutting a shag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every night: Get the children sitting in position with water,
toys and treats. Comb their hair out with a regular comb. Check the
scalp thoroughly for live and dead lice, pick them out and put them
in a cup of water. Next, nits. Take a small ( 1/2-inch to 1-inch)
bunch of hair, and scrape the nit-removal comb through it, making
sure the shafts of hair push against the top of the comb. Check the
hair carefully and pick out nits the comb misses; deposit in the
cup of water. Repeat with the next bunch of hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change kids' sheets and pillowcases every night for the first
week. Then change their pillowcases every night until the nits are
history.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the National Pediculosis Association
at 1-800-446-4672 or visit the nonprofit agency's Web site:
http://www.headlice.org.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters, school lunch programs focusing on nutrition
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Those who feed the poor, from the federal
government to local food pantries, are increasingly aware of the
role proper nutrition should play in their programs. Some say it is
paying off in more healthful diets for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general observation is that . . . the nutritional quality
of the foods that are currently coming through the system are some
of the best I've seen in a very long time,'' said Lisa
Hamler-Podolski, director of the advocacy group Ohio Food Policy
and Anti-Poverty Action Center.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA also prepares its food differently. Where it once
packed fruit in sugar solutions, it now uses natural juice. It
eliminated the use of tropical oils. It developed items such as
lower-fat beef patties and cut the sodium content in cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Government-backed public school lunches _ which low-income
students can eat free or at a reduced cost _ have also gone
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton schools, where 75 percent of students get free or
reduced-price meals, cooks have slashed their dishes' fat and
sodium levels, according to Nutrition Services Director Nancy
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't fried anything to speak of in years _ except french
fries,'' she said. ``And we use olive oil to fry them.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida bans online Viagra prescriptions
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Concerned about the danger of Web sites that
offer Viagra prescriptions without any face-to-face doctor-patient
contact, the state's Board of Medicine said that doctors who
prescribe the drug online could face criminal prosecution or board
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have at least a basic history and physical and an
impotence workup,'' said Dr. Abraham Woods, a urologist and member
of the board. ``This is clearly not an issue you want to treat
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The area of Internet prescriptions is so new that the board had
never before discussed setting rules for the issue, but the board
made it clear that they frown upon online Viagra prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, board members said, is that doctors who
prescribe over the Internet know very little about the patient.
Woods said some patients may be impotent as a result of diabetes or
elevated testosterone levels, and therefore Viagra would not be
appropriate. Also, taking Viagra in conjunction with heart medicine
can be extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need follow-up and care, he said. ``You can't just put a
person on medication and leave them out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Year's end spurs eye-care business
</P>
<P>
   Eyeglasses often make it on the list of holiday purchases _ not
as presents, but as a way for patients to squeeze out the last
dollars of their yearly health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As more employees participate in medical flexible spending
accounts _ a pool of tax-free funds they can use for health-related
expenses _ some discover they did not use as much money throughout
the year as they'd anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   And that means they must find ways to spend it by the end of the
year, or lose it _ one of the few conditions of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see an upswing in business as individuals search for ways
to use their spending accounts,'' said Dr. Peter Gordon, an
ophthalmologist with Eye Physicians and Surgeons. ``Sometimes, they
just buy the frames and wait to buy the lens.''

solution. Here are a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the lice-killing shampoo. While common over-the-counter
pediculicides are only 70 percent to 80 percent effective at
killing the eggs, that's the only way to start. Most contain
pyrethrum, a naturally occurring pesticide derived from
chrysanthemum flowers. Lindane, the prescription pesticide used for
pubic lice, is considered somewhat toxic and should be used only as
a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a metal comb. Those plastic combs that come with
lice-killing shampoo are practically useless at trapping nits. Give
it to your daughter so she can disinfest Barbie's hair while you
work on hers with a sturdy metal comb, which costs about $5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a few small plastic hair clips and a fine-tooth plastic
comb with a long handle. You can and will learn to part and repart
the kids' hair like a stylist cutting a shag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every night: Get the children sitting in position with water,
toys and treats. Comb their hair out with a regular comb. Check the
scalp thoroughly for live and dead lice, pick them out and put them
in a cup of water. Next, nits. Take a small ( 1/2-inch to 1-inch)
bunch of hair, and scrape the nit-removal comb through it, making
sure the shafts of hair push against the top of the comb. Check the
hair carefully and pick out nits the comb misses; deposit in the
cup of water. Repeat with the next bunch of hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Change kids' sheets and pillowcases every night for the first
week. Then change their pillowcases every night until the nits are
history.
</P>
<P>

at 1-800-446-4672 or visit the nonprofit agency's Web site:

   Shelters, school lunch programs focusing on nutrition
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Those who feed the poor, from the federal
government to local food pantries, are increasingly aware of the
role proper nutrition should play in their programs. Some say it is
paying off in more healthful diets for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general observation is that . . . the nutritional quality
of the foods that are currently coming through the system are some
of the best I've seen in a very long time,'' said Lisa
Hamler-Podolski, director of the advocacy group Ohio Food Policy
and Anti-Poverty Action Center.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA also prepares its food differently. Where it once
packed fruit in sugar solutions, it now uses natural juice. It
eliminated the use of tropical oils. It developed items such as
lower-fat beef patties and cut the sodium content in cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Government-backed public school lunches _ which low-income
students can eat free or at a reduced cost _ have also gone
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton schools, where 75 percent of students get free or
reduced-price meals, cooks have slashed their dishes' fat and
sodium levels, according to Nutrition Services Director Nancy
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't fried anything to speak of in years _ except french
fries,'' she said. ``And we use olive oil to fry them.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida bans online Viagra prescriptions
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Concerned about the danger of Web sites that
offer Viagra prescriptions without any face-to-face doctor-patient
contact, the state's Board of Medicine said that doctors who
prescribe the drug online could face criminal prosecution or board
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have at least a basic history and physical and an
impotence workup,'' said Dr. Abraham Woods, a urologist and member
of the board. ``This is clearly not an issue you want to treat
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The area of Internet prescriptions is so new that the board had
never before discussed setting rules for the issue, but the board
made it clear that they frown upon online Viagra prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, board members said, is that doctors who
prescribe over the Internet know very little about the patient.
Woods said some patients may be impotent as a result of diabetes or
elevated testosterone levels, and therefore Viagra would not be
appropriate. Also, taking Viagra in conjunction with heart medicine
can be extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need follow-up and care, he said. ``You can't just put a
person on medication and leave them out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Year's end spurs eye-care business
</P>
<P>
   Eyeglasses often make it on the list of holiday purchases _ not
as presents, but as a way for patients to squeeze out the last
dollars of their yearly health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As more employees participate in medical flexible spending
accounts _ a pool of tax-free funds they can use for health-related
expenses _ some discover they did not use as much money throughout
the year as they'd anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   And that means they must find ways to spend it by the end of the
year, or lose it _ one of the few conditions of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see an upswing in business as individuals search for ways
to use their spending accounts,'' said Dr. Peter Gordon, an
ophthalmologist with Eye Physicians and Surgeons. ``Sometimes, they
just buy the frames and wait to buy the lens.''

   FUNERAL _ One night recently, Sandy Whittington stretched out on
her living room floor in Douglasville, Ga., and instructed her
disbelieving son to measure her body. A few weeks later, it
arrived: a mail-order coffin in a packing crate labeled ``Casket _
Empty.'' She had it hauled into the attic, where it holds
out-of-season clothes and waits for the inevitable day that awaits
us all. The American funeral is changing. The standard open-casket,
two-day visitation, earth-burial of a generation ago is giving way
to new customs: shorter services, bodyless commemorations, more
personalized ceremonies, a fast-growing number of cremations. We
trace the history of American funerals by visiting the National
Funeral Museum in Houston and look at the way the industry is
changing as it consolidates into chain operations (the biggest:
Houston-based Service Corp. International) and tries to address
criticisms that funeral homes take advantage of consumers in their

   GREG-HAUPTNER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Meet Greg Hauptner _ a
former long-haired hippie turned savvy (some might say shameless)
self-promoter. Or, as one friend put it, a man who knows how to get
his name in the papers. And in magazines and on TV. Hauptner, 52,
has been featured in People, Vogue, Family Circle and was even
selected by CBS News as one of the six most successful business
people in Florida in the late '70s. One glance at Hauptner's
extensive four page _ yes four page! _ resume shows he's been a
hairdresser (he once owned a string of shops, but is now stylists
director at Elizabeth Arden in Palm Beach Gardens), author (five
motivational-style books), management seminar leader and even
stuntman in the awful 1992 film Cop and a Half (he fought with Burt

   GREG-HAUPTNER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Meet Greg Hauptner _ a
former long-haired hippie turned savvy (some might say shameless)
self-promoter. Or, as one friend put it, a man who knows how to get
his name in the papers. And in magazines and on TV. Hauptner, 52,
has been featured in People, Vogue, Family Circle and was even
selected by CBS News as one of the six most successful business
people in Florida in the late '70s. One glance at Hauptner's
extensive four page _ yes four page! _ resume shows he's been a
hairdresser (he once owned a string of shops, but is now stylists
director at Elizabeth Arden in Palm Beach Gardens), author (five
motivational-style books), management seminar leader and even
stuntman in the awful 1992 film Cop and a Half (he fought with Burt
Reynolds during a barroom brawl). Now you can add another
occupation to Hauptner's job-filled resume _ TV host. (Thompson,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   WASHINGTON _ I am a bit old for this sort of thing, but if I
were to be asked for a Christmas list this year, my top wish would
be that the Monica Lewinsky affair could be erased from the 1998
calendar. That, of course, is not to be. The issue is with us. We
members of the House of Representatives will make a stab at
reaching a decision on impeachment by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   If I were granted a second wish, it would be that we stick to
the facts and not political fantasies as we work to resolve
something that has become a tumor in our society. No one is
comfortable here in Washington these days. We feel sullied and
sidetracked, our loyalties stretched to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fight the problem, decide it,'' George C. Marshall used
to say. It can become oddly enjoyable raking over the details,
lamenting the moral lapses. It helps sidestep the unadorned
thinking required to decide tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   But decide we must, and in a larger sense the main issue is how
to heal, rather than further divide, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Far wiser heads than mine have devoted considerable thought to
the legal and ethical ramifications of impeachment. But all eyes
will probably be on the members of the House next week, when the
issue is likely to go to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   God willing, I will be there. I intend to vote against
impeachment. This may seem a bit premature, since the Judiciary
Committee has yet to send an article of impeachment to the entire
House. But the prosecution has presented its case and given us the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there was conduct unbecoming, and I deplore it. If a
plant manager in the company I used to work for engaged in such
conduct, we would have disciplined him immediately. Maybe even
dismissed him. But we wouldn't have burned him at the stake.
</P>
<P>
   Of course morals and decency and the laws we live by are all
important. But can anyone argue that these threads are made
stronger if we dismiss someone from office instead of issuing a
strong rebuke?
</P>
<P>
   What we are facing is a practical, pre-ordained outcome. Since
there are insufficient votes to impeach in the Senate, President
Clinton will not be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   We may wish it were otherwise. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this case should not be compared to judgments in
the military or other walks of life. Forty-three million Americans,
knowing full well the history of similar charges against the
president, voted Clinton into office _ not once, but twice. And I
say this as someone who went down to the wire supporting George
Bush and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   For 218 people in the House _ the number needed to send a bill
to the Senate _ to consider overturning that verdict strikes me as
a bit presumptuous. For me, at least, an action qualifies as a
``high crime'' only if it is directed against the state, not
inflicted on oneself.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that when the only tool you own is a
hammer, sooner or later everything begins to look like a nail. We
should search for other tools in our tool chest.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to make a plea to the House Rules Committee to
allow another option. Why not recognize our limited field of action
and at the very least end this sad chapter in our history with a
strong statement of rebuke rather than nothing at all?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way, it is almost Christmas time. Anyone for a touch
of forgiveness?

RAYTHEON CHIEF SEES LAYOFFS HALTING AT ANNOUNCED LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co.'s new top executive said he doesn't expect major
layoffs beyond an ongoing reduction of 14,000 jobs announced in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Burnham, who became chief executive of the Lexington,
Mass. defense contractor on Dec. 1, said in an interview this week
that the company intends to avoid further job cuts by becoming more
efficient and winning more military contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and believe it's the last one like this,'' Burnham
said, referring to the current round of layoffs. Two months ago,
Raytheon said it will eliminate 14,000 jobs by the end of 1999 _ up
from its forecast last January that it would cut 8,700 positions. A
total of about 115,000 jobs will remain after the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Employees likely to lose their jobs _ including 1,200 in
Massachusetts _ were all notified last month so as to minimize
uncertainty through the holiday season, Burnham said. ``By
mid-November, everybody knew their situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts come as part of a restructuring meant to improve
productivity and to reduce Raytheon's debt, which now stands at
around $10 billion. Most of the debt was taken on as part of
Raytheon's acquisition streak last year, when it paid $12.5 billion
for the defense operations of Texas Instruments Inc. and Hughes
Electronics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Former Raytheon chief executive Dennis Picard was the architect
of the expansion, part of a broader consolidation in the defense
industry. Picard stepped down as chief executive Dec. 1, and plans
to turn over the chairman's role to Burnham sometime next year.
Burnham, previously vice chairman at AlliedSignal Inc., joined
Raytheon July 1 as president and chief operating officer and was
charged with integrating Raytheon's disparate new units.
</P>
<P>
   To help do so, Burnham said he plans in January to introduce a
quality control program that will provide about 40 hours of
training to every employee.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on similar efforts at AlliedSignal, the program will be
known as Raytheon Six Sigma after the Greek letter used by
statisticians to denote deviations from the norm. (Six-sigma would
indicate fewer than four defects per million units). Burnham said
he wants to reduce manufacturing costs, impose more statistical
controls on operations and improve employee satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is improved productivity and higher profits. ``The most
productive company at the end of the day wins,'' Burnham said. The
program also fits employees' sentiments, he said. In a Dec. 1
letter to employees he wrote that ``You . . . want greater
delegation of authority, less bureaucracy, less disruption, and
more investment in training and development. I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   By making these improvements, Burnham said, the company will be
on track to grow revenue between 6 percent to 8 percent annually
over three years, and to improve earnings between 10 percent to 12
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham cautioned those goals also depend on overall defense
spending by the federal government. But analysts think Raytheon is
on track to meet projections. S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co. analyst Cai Von
Rumohr has rated the company's stock a ``strong buy'' since Burnham
was named over the summer, citing his expectations of cost cuts
from the merged defense businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, 13 analysts surveyed by Nelson's Investment Research
expected Raytheon to earn an average of $3.31 a Class B share. They
expected an increase to $3.77 a share for 1999. In 1997, earnings
were $2.20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's Class B shares closed at 56 1/8, up 7/8. Class A
shares rose 13/16 to 55 7/16.

   The Hearst News Service will file a four-day series called
``Fortress Europe,'' which examines the European Union and its
immigration crisis. The series by the Houston Chronicle is
available for use beginning this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Like the southwestern United States, the EU is grappling with
immigration. Some experts think that up to 1 million people could
try to breach the EU's external borders this year. And many
Europeans are in no mood to play host.
</P>
<P>
   The series was written by Carl Honore with photos by Kerwin
Plevka. The photos, graphics and maps are available on the New York
Times photo service.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-MIGRANTS (Melilla, Spain) _ Like thousands of migrants
before him, like thousands more sure to come, Hamid Uld-Mohamed is
here on a mission: to use this Spanish port on the coast of North
Africa as a springboard to a shiny new life in the European Union.
``Even if they put up electrified fences all along the borders of
Europe, even if they put up the barriers of hell, people will keep
on coming,'' he says. (With two photos, one graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-SMUGGLERS (Prague, Czech Republic) _ As in the United
States, the tightening of border security is forcing would-be
migrants into the arms of professional traffickers. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-PROSTITUTION (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) _ Many women
selling their bodies in the windows of Europe's famous red-light
district are immigrants trapped in sexual slavery. The trafficking
in women is an ugly sub-current in the immigration flow to the
European Union.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-BORDERS (Eissenhuttenstadt, Germany) _ German border
guard Jan Steenfatt patiently scans the woods and fields that fan
out into the distance. The narrow Neisse River down below, which
marks the line between Germany and Poland, is a favorite crossing
point for illegal immigrants seeking a better life in the West.
Across the European Union, governments have tightened immigration
laws and beefed up their borders. But nothing they have done is
enough to staunch the flow of illegal immigrants. (With two
photos.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-TEXAS (Eissenhuttenstadt, Germany) _ On foreign trips,
German border guard Jan Steenfatt likes nothing better than to drop
by the local police station to swap badges and a little chat. His
dream is to spend a day along the Texas-Mexico frontier with the
U.S. Border Patrol. As the European Union fights to secure its own
borders against illegal immigration, the experience along the
U.S.-Mexico frontier stands out as a benchmark. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-ENTRY (London) _ The Schengen agreement, which was
designed to create border-free travel within the European Union,
has been a boon to criminals and illegal immigrants. (With

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAY 3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-FOREIGNERS (Vitrolles, France) _ As Europe seals its
borders against illegal immigrants, sentiment across the continent
builds against foreigners. For example, the extreme right-wing
National Front in France is offering to give ``birth bonuses'' to
villagers who add to the white population. (With two photos.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-SKINHEADS (Magdeburg, Germany) _ For a lot of angry young
men, xenophobia sparks a wave of violence in Germany. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-WELCOME (Badolato, Italy) _ An Italian town has defied
conventional wisdom and has opened its arms to immigrants. (With
two photos.)
</P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAY 4 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-ACCEPTANCE (Antwerp, Belgium) _ In a region proud of its
liberal traditions, many new immigrants, particularly those with
dark skins, say they find it hard to be accepted as equals and to
get ahead in daily life. (With two photos.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-IDENTITY (London) _ Europeans still have a lot of fun
with national stereotypes. The uptight English sipping tea. The
snobbish French dunking croissants in their cafe au lait. The
mechanical Germans searching for a sense of humor. Nowadays,
though, such portraits are largely the stuff of comedy sketches and
cartoons. Defining national identity in Western Europe has become a
subtle and slippery matter. In many countries, a debate is raging
over a question that never needed asking before: What does it mean
to be French or Dutch or English? One reason for the crisis of
identity is European integration. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-SUCCESS (London) _ To most Europeans, buying a suit on
Savile Row means the same thing as it did 200 years ago. Immaculate
craftsmanship. Sky-high prices. Traditional English service. But
the old image of rich white men buying sober suits from staid white
tailors is starting to fray like an aging lapel. Today, Andrew
Ramroop, a black immigrant from the Caribbean island of Trinidad,
owns and runs Maurice Sedwell, a shop on ``The Row.'' Some might
see Ramroop's rise to the top of his profession as a beacon, as a
sign that the immigrant story in Europe is not all exclusion and
failure. (With photo.)

   Come to Germany in December, and you'd think this was the place
that invented Christmas. And in some ways, you'd be right.
</P>
<P>
   After all, didn't the Christmas tree arise from the medieval
German custom of draping evergreen branches in the home with
sausages and apples? And doesn't our image of Santa Claus stem
largely from the pen of Thomas Nast, the 19th-century political
cartoonist who was born in Landau, Germany?
</P>
<P>
   One of Germany's most endearing Christmas customs remains the
Christmas Market, outdoor fairs where ornaments, toys and
gingerbread burden stalls, and the bracing perfume of sizzling
sausages and mulled wine laces the cold air.

<P>
   German cities vie for the loveliest Christmas Market, and
certainly Munich is a leading contender. Christmas in Munich is
also a time for music, when musicians perform the ``Christmas
Oratorio'' by Bach and churches resound with carols.
</P>
<P>
   There is more, of course, to Munich than the sights, sounds and
smells of Christmas. The city has some of Europe's finest museums,
and picturesque neighborhoods, like the old Bohemian quarter in
Schwabing, invite exploration. When snow begins to fall, Alpine ski
resorts lie at the city's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, Munich quickly turns to very different
celebrations _ the raucous and rousing merriment of Fasching, the
Bavarian variety of Mardi Gras, that in 1999, officially starts
Jan. 7 and ends on Feb. 16, the eve of Ash Wednesday, when the
women who tend the stalls at the Viktualienmarkt, the city's vast
outdoor food market, perform their traditional Fasching dance.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The official start of the Christmas Market, in the heart of the
city at Marienplatz, was on Nov. 28, with the lighting of an
88-foot Christmas tree. The market is open weekdays 10 a.m. to 8:30
p.m. (Sundays until 7:30 p.m.), and closes on Christmas Eve at 2
p.m. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   Performances of Christmas music are given daily at 5:30 p.m. at
the balcony of the Altes Rathaus, the Old Town Hall, on
Marienplatz.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve in Munich's splendid Gothic
cathedral, the Frauenkirche, is preceded by music at 9:45 p.m.
Seating is first-come, first-served, so it's wise to be there at
least a half-hour early.
</P>
<P>
   Munich has also assembled a program of concerts and exhibits for
the season. In the week before Christmas, the Munich Symphony will
present a Christmas concert at 8 p.m. on Dec. 17 in the
Prinzregententheater, at 12 Prinzregentenplatz, east of the Isar
River, and at 4 p.m. on Dec. 20 in the rococo Peterskirche, or

   On Dec. 20, Bach's ``Christmas Oratorio'' will be performed at
the Philharmonie am Gasteig, 5 Rosenheimer Strasse, by the Munich
Bach Orchestra. Cantatas Nos. 1 to 3 are at 5 p.m., and Cantatas
Nos. 4 to 6 at 8 p.m. Tickets, which must be bought separately for
each performance, cost $34 to $60; (49-89) 5481-8181.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, the Munich Philharmonic under the direction
of Milan Horvat will perform Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the
Philharmonie am Gasteig, at 5 p.m. Tickets: about $17.50 to $71.
</P>
<P>
   In December and January, the Bavarian State Ballet will perform
the ``Nutcracker Suite'' by Tchaikovsky in the Bayerische
Staatsoper, the national opera, at 2 Max-Joseph-Platz. Performances
are on Dec. 18, 22, 26 and 29, and Jan. 1, 14 and 17. Tickets: $6
to $67; (49-89) 2185-1920.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hansel and Gretel,'' by Humperdinck, also fun for children,
will be performed at the Prinzregententheater on Dec. 10, 16, 17
and 18. Tickets: $18 to $45
</P>
<P>
   The expressionist paintings of Lyonel Feininger are featured in
an exhibit ending Jan. 24 at the Gallery of Modern Art in the Haus
der Kunst, 1 Prinzregentenstrasse. Another show there, closing Feb.
7, has the somber theme of ``Night in European Painting'' _ with
works by Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Goya and Caspar David Friedrich.
Admission: $7.25, and $2.40 for ages 6 to 18, or $10.85 and $3.60
for both shows; (49-89) 2112-7115.
</P>
<P>
   Lola Montez, the notorious dancer (buried in Green-Wood Cemetery
in Brooklyn), whose affair with King Ludwig I of Bavaria was a
factor in his abdication of the throne in 1848, is the subject of
an exhibit at the Munich Stadtmuseum, 1 Sankt-Jakobs-Platz, through
Jan. 31. Tickets: $4.80; (49-89) 2332-2370.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A quick walk through the center of town leads to some of
Munich's most magnificent rococo churches, among them the
Asamkirche, the Church of St. Peter (or Peterskirche) and the Holy
Ghost Church. Of these, the Asamkirche is the most splendid.
</P>
<P>
   Situated along Sendlingerstrasse, it is officially named for St.
John of Nepomuk, the 14th century Czech martyr, but is better known
by the name of Asam, for the brothers, star architects and
sculptors of the Bavarian rococo.
</P>
<P>
   The interior, which should be viewed in the early morning, when
light streams in the enormous facade window, is an explosion of
decorative splendor.
</P>
<P>
   The Peterskirche, the oldest in Munich, contains a magnificent
rococo altar and statuary, though its upper reaches are now hidden
by scaffolding, as work proceeds on the re-creation of 18th-century
ceiling frescoes by the artist Johann Baptist Zimmermann that were
destroyed in World War II. Entry is free.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk from the Peterskirche is the Spielzeugmuseum, or
Toy Museum, on several floors that are reachable by a narrow,
twisting stairway of a tower in the Old Town Hall. It features a
delightful collection of 19th- and 20th-century playthings, with
wood-carved figurines and windup Popeyes; the Barbie dolls include
first-generation models from the 1950s. Tickets: $3, 60 cents for
children; (49-89) 271-1969.
</P>
<P>
   Another fascinating place for young and old is the Deutsches
Museum of science and technology, 1 Museumsinsel on an island in
the Isar River.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of exhibits, many of them mechanical, that
illustrate mining and steel making, bridge building and computer
technology. Press a button and watch a car being assembled.
Admission: $6; (49-89) 21791.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide on a day of skiing in the nearby Alps, trips are
organized by several large sporting goods stores, like Schuster,
just off Marienplatz. Day trips by bus cost about $42, including
lift ticket. Details are available at Schuster Treffpunkt Sport, 4
Rosenstrasse; (49-89) 237-070.
</P>
<P>
   From mid-December, the Bundesbahn, the railway, also offers
one-day round trips, with ski pass, to nearby ski areas like
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and Osterhofen. Tickets: $36 to $54;
(49-89) 1308-5846.
</P>
<P>
   For general information, the main tourist office is downtown at
1 Sendlingerstrasse; (49-89) 233-0300, fax (49-89) 2333-0233.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given Munich's excellent subway system, you don't have to stay
downtown. But if you do, one choice is Hotel am Markt, at 6
Heiliggeiststrasse, a narrow lane behind the Church of the Holy
Ghost. It offers 30 recently renovated if small, rooms, and not all
with bathrooms and showers. Doubles: $66 to $96; (49-89) 225-014,
fax (49-89) 224-017.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of town, and slightly more expensive, is the Hotel
Excelsior, in the pedestrian mall at 11 Schutzenstrasse, which has
113 rooms comfortably furnished in a vaguely Alpine style. Doubles:
$180 to $225; (49-89) 551370, fax (49-89) 5513-7121.
</P>

rooms that look out onto a tree-lined square. Doubles: $60 to $90;
(49-89) 530-306, fax (49-89) 5303-0624.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The Hotel Vier Jahres zeiten, at 17 Maximilianstrasse
amid elegant stores and restaurants, is the queen of Munich
hostelry. A five-minute stroll from the neo-classical opera house
and former residence of the kings of Bavaria, it has 318 sumptuous
rooms with equally splendid bathrooms. Doubles: $307 to $487;
(49-89) 21250, fax (49-89) 2125-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant, yet with more rustic Bavarian flavor, is the
Bayerischer Hof, 2-6 Promenadeplatz, with Alpine antiques in its
hallways and 409 rooms. Doubles: $287 to 407; (49-89) 21200, fax
(49-89) 212-0906.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bavaria is largely pork-and-potato territory, which doesn't mean
that it cannot be done imaginatively and tastefully. It is also
serious beer country, and the favorite is Weissbier, a flavorful,
cloudy type of brew taken in bulbous tankards of at least a
half-liter in size.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants have the character of beer halls, with noise,
bonhomie and often music.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant fare can be enjoyed a stone's throw from the
Viktualienmarkt, at Grune Gans, which seats about 30 in a homey,
dark wood atmosphere at 5 Am Einlass.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two _ a first course of light potato pancakes with
caviar of trout in creme fraiche followed by roast pheasant,
cranberry sauce and champagne kraut, and by a desert of crepes
filled with apple ragout _ with wine, comes to about $90.
Reservations required. Closed Sundays; (49-89) 266-228.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Cathedral, 9 Frauenplatz, is the
justifiably well-know Nurnberger Bratwurst-Glockl am Dom, a cozy
place with dark wood walls and pewter plates that specializes in
delectable pinky-sized sausages from Nuremberg, charcoal-grilled
and served with steaming sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   A meal for two of beef broth with whole egg yolk and a platter
of six sausages with sauerkraut, washed down by a glass of beer or
white wine, comes to about $33; (49-89) 220-385.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known restaurants for dressing up basic Bavarian
ingredients is the cozy Weinhaus Neuner, at 8 Herzogspitalstrasse,
in warm and inviting rooms that have served as an inn for four
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A meal might begin with homemade blood wurst on creamed
sauerkraut with a truffle sauce, followed by venison calf filet in
juniper flavored cream sauce with red cabbage, cranberry sauce and
freshly prepared potato noodles. Dinner for two, with wine: $105.
Reservations are recommended; (49-89) 260-3954.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Munich's best cooking is Italian, given the city's
proximity to northern Italy. A recent entry is La Grotta, 24
Schraudolphstrasse, a bright little place on the edge of the lively
Schwabing neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two with wine _ consisting of shrimp and chanterelle
mushrooms, followed by grilled scampi, and profiterole for desert _
costs about $72; (49-89) 271-6363.
</P>
<P>
   For a totally different experience with the whole family, try
the Movenpick Marche Restaurant, at 19 Neuhauser Strasse, which
offers a big assortment of fresh fish, meat, sausages and pizza,
served cafeteria-style. Lunch or dinner for two, with beer or wine,
comes to about $18; (49-89) 230-8790.
</P>
<P>
   Most fun, however, is to drop by the Viktualienmarkt. A variety
of stalls offer freshly prepared Bavarian specialties, like
leberkas, a flat liver patty, or the deservedly famous weisswurst,
plump white veal sausages served with sweet mustard. Weisswurst for
two, with a pretzel and beer, costs about $10.

<P>
   Come to Germany in December, and you'd think this was the place
that invented Christmas. And in some ways, you'd be right.
</P>
<P>
   After all, didn't the Christmas tree arise from the medieval
German custom of draping evergreen branches in the home with
sausages and apples? And doesn't our image of Santa Claus stem
largely from the pen of Thomas Nast, the 19th-century political
cartoonist who was born in Landau, Germany?
</P>
<P>
   One of Germany's most endearing Christmas customs remains the
Christmas Market, outdoor fairs where ornaments, toys and
gingerbread burden stalls, and the bracing perfume of sizzling
sausages and mulled wine laces the cold air.
</P>
<P>
   German cities vie for the loveliest Christmas Market, and
certainly Munich is a leading contender. Christmas in Munich is
also a time for music, when musicians perform the ``Christmas
Oratorio'' by Bach and churches resound with carols.
</P>
<P>
   There is more, of course, to Munich than the sights, sounds and
smells of Christmas. The city has some of Europe's finest museums,
and picturesque neighborhoods, like the old Bohemian quarter in
Schwabing, invite exploration. When snow begins to fall, Alpine ski
resorts lie at the city's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, Munich quickly turns to very different
celebrations _ the raucous and rousing merriment of Fasching, the
Bavarian variety of Mardi Gras, that in 1999, officially starts
Jan. 7 and ends on Feb. 16, the eve of Ash Wednesday, when the
women who tend the stalls at the Viktualienmarkt, the city's vast
outdoor food market, perform their traditional Fasching dance.

sauerkraut with a truffle sauce, followed by venison calf filet in
juniper flavored cream sauce with red cabbage, cranberry sauce and
freshly prepared potato noodles. Dinner for two, with wine: $105.
Reservations are recommended; (49-89) 260-3954.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Munich's best cooking is Italian, given the city's
proximity to northern Italy. A recent entry is La Grotta, 24
Schraudolphstrasse, a bright little place on the edge of the lively
Schwabing neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner for two with wine _ consisting of shrimp and chanterelle
mushrooms, followed by grilled scampi, and profiterole for desert _
costs about $72; (49-89) 271-6363.
</P>
<P>
   For a totally different experience with the whole family, try
the Movenpick Marche Restaurant, at 19 Neuhauser Strasse, which
offers a big assortment of fresh fish, meat, sausages and pizza,
served cafeteria-style. Lunch or dinner for two, with beer or wine,
comes to about $18; (49-89) 230-8790.
</P>
<P>
   Most fun, however, is to drop by the Viktualienmarkt. A variety
of stalls offer freshly prepared Bavarian specialties, like
leberkas, a flat liver patty, or the deservedly famous weisswurst,
plump white veal sausages served with sweet mustard. Weisswurst for
two, with a pretzel and beer, costs about $10.

   &UR; (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's a white-on-white day with snow dusting the hoarfrost and
fog layering the horizon line. The only hues breaking the
monochromatic color scheme are startling ski jackets, teasing
tassels on striped mufflers, wild woolen caps and rosy cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we visited Jackson Hole, Wyo., a place we thought
we'd never spend any winter days. We don't do snow any more _ not
since our early years in Minnesota and Kansas. We never have
learned how to glide down a hill on two pieces of wood with any
grace.
</P>
<P>
   So what's there to do in Jackson if you don't ski and aren't a
snow lover? Try the nature show:
</P>
<P>
   How about a sleigh ride near a herd of 8,000 elk?
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for this winter-wonderland ride can be purchased at the
National Museum of Wildlife, (307) 733-5771. The vastness of the
white landscape is reduced to Lilliputian size beneath the craggy
Gros Ventre mountain backdrop. Thousands of elk spread across the
valley floor, moving in slow motion, as your sleigh steadily enters
their midst with a creak and lurches over the rutted valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   One ambles slowly toward you, stopping to paw the snow for a bit
of food.
</P>
<P>
   Crack! Two bulls butt antlers in a ballet of sorts, while others
lie on the snow-covered field saving their strength to forage for
food later.
</P>
<P>
   The National Elk Refuge just north of Jackson, Wyo., protects
8,000 to 10,000 elk each winter. The daily sleigh rides for
visitors grew out of early efforts to feed the elk.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, horse-drawn hay wagons were used to distribute
food to the elk, and an occasional visitor was taken along. In
1965, sleigh rides for visitors were started officially, and now
from December through March visitors climb aboard haywagon sleighs
to spend about an hour in the middle of the migrating herd.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the first-come, first-serve elk refuge rides cost
about $10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON SAFARI &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the museum and refuge have whetted your appetite to talk to
the animals, a Wildlife Discovery Safari aboard Serengeti-style
vehicles will bring you even closer to nature.
</P>
<P>
   With sliding windows, opening roofs and binoculars at the ready
for all participants, the safari ride will let you ``play biologist
for a day'' says Tom Segerstrom, founder of the Great Plains
Wildlife Institute. (And you'll keep warm, too!) The institute
operates in Jackson with safaris throughout the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, moose, whitetail mule and bighorn sheep get up close
and personal as Segerstrom explains why ``The more diverse the
ecosystem, the healthier it is'' and that ``bison are not
endangered any more. Your grandchildren will always be able to come
here and see them ...''
</P>
<P>
   Segerstrom lectures every step of the way, letting the
half-dozen people in the van know that ``the best way to be around
wildlife is do what they expect.'' However, he does offer one
warning: Don't force animals up and out of their beds.
</P>
<P>
   The full-day adventure, which is priced at $140 per person,
allows participants the time to locate more species, help with
hands-on wildlife research projects and share stories over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   And if you choose, you can join a brief snowshoe expedition that
may help find, count or track species that are included in the
institute's stewardship projects. Some winters the institute also
offers a shorter sunset or sunrise safari for $80.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (307) 733-2623; write P.O. Box 7580,
Jackson Hole, Wyo. 83002; or visit www.wildlifesafari.com on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSH! &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of our travel companions raved about their dog-sled tours
aboard modern sleds. Musher-guides signaled the sights of wildlife
with the shussing sounds of winter _ wind in their faces, dogs
panting and the sled's runners streaking across the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Full-day dog-sled tours travel 20 to 22 miles round trip for
$225 per person, while half-day tours are 10 to 12 miles for $135
per person.
</P>
<P>
   My friends traveled from Granite Creek Hot Springs trailhead to
the springs, where they took a soak. On their return they ate lunch
in front of a fire in the Granite Creek Ranch lodge.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (800) 554-7388 or write Jackson Hole
Iditarod Sled Dog Tours, P.O. Box 1940, Jackson Hole, Wyo. 83001.
</P>
<P>
   Other dog-sled adventures are available at Grand Targhee, (800)
827-4433; $115 for an adult.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKS VIA SNOWCOACH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 yellow Bombadier snowcoach is not a quiet nor peaceful
ride with its clackety-clack skis and tank-style tracks, but it is
a guaranteed sightseeing route in Yellowstone Park in winter if you
don't cross-country ski.
</P>
<P>
   For $100 a person, the interpretive tour leaves Flagg Ranch just
south of Yellowstone's South Gate at 8 a.m. with stops at Moose
Falls, Tom Thumb Geyser Basin and views of even more wildlife. It's
a round trip totalling 80 miles.
</P>
<P>
   As you and nine others make your way through the park at a top
speed of 35 mph, you find yourself waving at snowmobilers on the
road or sitting within your own cocoon of silence as you get a
glimmer of Mother Nature's artistry in winter _ snowy ermine drapes
on the evergreens and frozen ``statues'' beside the waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into unlikely places are hard-to-spot creatures such as
bison waiting until the warm days of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Time is of the essence as you near Old Faithful, since the
geyser now spouts on a less predictable schedule. When the coach
arrives, head for the geyser, since you'll get only one chance per
tour to see it erupt.
</P>
<P>
   To study Jackson Hole's wildlife more closely, try Elderhostel
programs at Targhee Institute. They stress topics such as wildlife
tracking and snow travel. The price for the week is $400, including
meals.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact Elderhostel Inc. at (877)
426-8056.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE WALL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wapiti Gallery at the National Museum of Wildlife Art is an
interpretive center for the National Elk Refuge. This jewel is
tucked into a jagged landscape and showcases more than 100 artists'
impressions of North American animals in its permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling exhibits each year expand on Western and wildlife
themes. Admission is $5 for seniors, $1 off the regular price. For
more information, call (307) 733-5771.
</P>
<P>
   There's lots to see and do in Jackson _ from art galleries and
shops, to the Cowboy Bar, where you can climb into a saddle aboard
the bar stool to sip your beverage. Energetic types can try ice
skating ($5), hot-air balloon rides ($185) or dinner sleigh rides
in the moonlight (about $50). So what if you don't do snow, you can
still do Jackson in winter.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you DO do snow, there are senior ski values to
explore. A broad range of special packages throughout Jackson Hole
are available through Central Reservations, (800) 443-6931. Call
the Jackson Chamber of Commerce at (307) 733-3316 to get your copy
of the area's ski and vacation planner.

   Gone are the days when a hotel could get away with simply
offering a room for the night. In an ongoing attempt to attract
guests, many hotels have added special services that go way beyond
overnight shoeshines and in-room coffee makers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hilton Hotels &LR;  (9336 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif.
90210; 800-HILTONS) has been a leader in adapting rooms to better
suit guests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they introduced Sleep-Tight Rooms, which feature
blackout drapes, a light box to help adjust circadian rhythms and
noise machines to block out unwanted sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is testing 16 Health-Fit Rooms and Stress-Less
Rooms in nine properties, including the Hilton Chicago O'Hare

   The Health-Fit Rooms come with a Reebok Cross Conditioning
System, an SPRI Xertube for in-room exercises as well as a
20-minute in-room workout plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Stress-Less Rooms boast an in-room fountain to provide
soothing noises, a Massaging Seat Topper seat pad to massage the
body and a Living Yoga beginner's yoga video, among other
amenities.

   New York City's chic  &UR; Soho Grand Hotel &LR;  (310 West Broadway, New

   Gone are the days when a hotel could get away with simply
offering a room for the night. In an ongoing attempt to attract
guests, many hotels have added special services that go way beyond
overnight shoeshines and in-room coffee makers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hilton Hotels &LR;  (9336 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif.
90210; 800-HILTONS) has been a leader in adapting rooms to better
suit guests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they introduced Sleep-Tight Rooms, which feature
blackout drapes, a light box to help adjust circadian rhythms and
noise machines to block out unwanted sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is testing 16 Health-Fit Rooms and Stress-Less
Rooms in nine properties, including the Hilton Chicago O'Hare
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Health-Fit Rooms come with a Reebok Cross Conditioning
System, an SPRI Xertube for in-room exercises as well as a
20-minute in-room workout plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Stress-Less Rooms boast an in-room fountain to provide
soothing noises, a Massaging Seat Topper seat pad to massage the
body and a Living Yoga beginner's yoga video, among other
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's chic  &UR; Soho Grand Hotel &LR;  (310 West Broadway, New
York, N.Y. 10013; 800-965-3000) is owned and operated by Hartz
Mountain Industries. Not surprisingly, dogs and cats are not only
welcome but are catered to with an in-room menu.
</P>
<P>
   A bowl of dry dog food with a bowl of water is $10, a full-body
pillow is $20 while assorted toys are $8 for three toys.

<P>
   POWER-OUTAGE (San Francisco) _ Plunged into a six-hour power
outage, San Francisco's city officials launched a well-rehearsed
plan to maintain vital emergency, medical and transportation
services. Many city officials saw the episode as an almost welcome
test run for a big quake or other major disaster. By CHUCK FINNIE.
</P>
<P>
   POWER-TALES (San Francisco) _ For better or worse, people who
live, work or shop in San Francisco learned firsthand Tuesday just
how much they depend on electrical power. The prolonged blackout
caused a number of inconveniences, discoveries, bright ideas, bad
hair days, missed appointments and excuses for drinking. By RAY
DELGADO.
</P>
<P>
   POWER-ERROR (San Francisco) _ The San Francisco blackout began
when a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. worker forgot to do something
very elementary _ remove a grounding wire before restarting the
power. ``Grounding is a pretty basic procedure,'' said Carl
Bellone, PG&AMP;E's director of distribution operations. ``It's as
basic as it gets.'' By JULIE CHAO, ERIN McCORMICK, ELIZABETH
FERNANDEZ and ANASTASIA HENDRIX.
</P>
<P>
   POWER-BATTERIES (San Francisco) _ San Francisco's information
revolution went to battery power Tuesday morning, showing just how
dependent our communication-rich lifestyles are on the electric
grid. The outage also led some to believe they had witnessed a
preview of the much-ballyhooed Y2K computer meltdown. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   POWER-AIRPORT (San Francisco) _ Nobody was going anywhere.
Planes couldn't take off. Passengers couldn't check in. Baggage
couldn't be picked up. And there wasn't a caffe latte or toasted
bagel to be had for any price. At San Francisco International
Airport Tuesday, when the lights went out, the world stood still.
By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU.
</P>
<P>
   WWI-VETS (San Antonio) _ Three San Antonio area veterans were
young men when they fought on French soil during the Great War.
Now, 80 years later, a grateful French government is honoring them
and other allied veterans with France's highest decoration. By
CARMINA DANINI.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPLANE-SAFETY (Albany, N.Y.) _ Contrary to a nationwide
decrease in near midair airplane collisions, the number of
high-altitude close calls over New York state has doubled since
last year, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Two
harrowing incidents in the past week brought talk of near midair
collisions, or NMACs, into sharp focus. By PAUL ZIELBAUER.
</P>
<P>
   SPACE-DUST (San Francisco) _ The sky is falling _ literally _ in
the form of dust, dropping to Earth from outer space. This rain of
particles may vary in cycles, periodically dimming sunlight and
cooling Earth. The variations may partly trigger ice ages every
100,000 years or so, some scientists think. Others are skeptical.
By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   SAMARITAN-BILL (Sacramento, Calif.) _ The bathroom rape and
murder of a 7-year-old girl, a crime seen in progress but not
reported by UC-Berkeley student David Cash, has prompted three
lawmakers to introduce ``good Samaritan'' laws requiring people to
report assaults they may witness. By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   OLDEST-ARSENAL (Watervliet, N.Y.) _ The U.S. Army's oldest

and downs. We offer some retirement-planning tips for weathering
the best and worst of times. By JO-ANN JOHNSTON.
</P>
<P>
   BOFA (San Francisco) _ Two U.S. senators have asked the head of
the newly merged North Carolina-based Bank of America to

   FOOD (``d'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TAVERN-CHEF (New York) _ It's just before noon on a recent

down to earth despite his high-profile position. By DOUG BLACKBURN.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ This was the third wake-up call
in a week, and this one was without coffee. God is telling us
something, something about stocking up on batteries, food, bottled
water and a camp stove to make our own joe. Stock up at the ATM
too, because the forces of darkness at PG&AMP;E control our cash. By

THINKING DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a Christmas story for you: A cynical journalist, given to
frequent jibes at the expense of Apple Computer Inc., adopts an
Apple iMac computer. Against his will, he's delighted by its
simplicity, thrilled by its impressive performance, moved by its
ineffable cuteness. The journalist becomes a new man _ witty, warm,
filled with love for all mankind except for that wretch Bill Gates.
He has learned to think different.
</P>
<P>
   Well, life's not that simple _ and neither am I. It'll take more
than the iMac to make a convert of me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not warming up for a bout of Mac-bashing. The iMac has
served me well for the past two months. It's like at first sight.
Feast your eyes on the monitor: a 15-incher that looks even bigger,
thanks to its crisp text display and opulent color reproduction.
The iMac also feels good; its keyboard is the most comfortable I've
ever used. It's almost good enough to atone for the iMac's clumsy
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I still resent the iMac's lack of a floppy drive, but I use the
Globe's internal network to move files to a Mac in our graphics
department, which has an Iomega Zip drive. I've got a Zip plugged
into a PC at home. Windows machines will only accept PC-formatted
disks, but Macs read and write to PC disks without a qualm. So I
can easily tote my files home.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I suspect the months of griping over this issue
secretly pleased Apple execs. Otherwise, more people might notice
that the iMac is still just another Macintosh, running Apple's
aging operating system. Five years ago, the Mac OS was much better
than anything offered by Microsoft. Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, I found myself wishing the Mac did things the
way Windows does. Of course, much of this is a matter of taste, or
lack thereof. For instance, I like the way Windows uses a
two-button mouse, so you can use many commands merely by clicking
the right mouse button. I resent the Mac's one-button mouse; others
like its simplicity. It's a judgment call.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mac OS features are flaws, pure and simple. At first,
programs would often refuse to run because of lack of memory. It
seemed 32 megabytes was not enough, even though my PC cruised along
on the same amount. But Windows machines make better use of
``virtual memory,'' a system that lets a computer use blank hard
drive space as imitation memory chips. Windows machines
automatically set the right amount of virtual memory. But on the
``easy-to-use'' Mac, you set virtual memory by hand. Too little,
and programs died. Too much, and they ran so slowly they might as
well be dead.
</P>
<P>
   I bought RAM Doubler from Connectix Corp., a $50 program that
fixed the problem. Then some Apple technicians said the new Mac OS
8.5 and a little more fiddling would do the trick. It did. Still,
why so much trouble over a feature most PC users never even think
about?
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with my iMac nicely tuned up, I can find no compelling
reason to prefer it to a PC. This may change next year, when Apple
unleashes Mac OS X, a promising operating system upgrade based on a
version of the advanced Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier incarnation, OS X was named Rhapsody, and was to
have been available in a version for PCs. That plan was scrapped
last year, so that Apple could focus on its core market, the key to
its survival. By doing this, Apple has missed an immense
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the growing popularity of the Linux operating system,
with 7 million to 10 million users worldwide. It's proof that
people long for Windows alternatives. But why aren't they choosing
Mac OS? In some ways, it's better than Linux; it's certainly easier
to use.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux has one vast advantage. It runs on anything _ Macs,
PCs, even pocket-size Palm Pilots. Opt for Linux, and a universe of
hardware platforms is open to you. Choose the Mac OS, and you have
to buy a Mac _ and lose out on the plunging prices and rapid
innovation found in the PC hardware market.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, with its blue-green shell, is a glowing metaphor of
Apple's problem. It's different all right _ like a lovely beast
that evolved in isolation on the Galapagos Islands, and can't
thrive anywhere else. But I've no intention of moving to the
Macintosh Archipelago, no matter how pretty the computers are
there.

THINKING SMALL, SMALLER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON GARFINKLE   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first machines run by the Microsoft CE operating system
started appearing a little less than two years ago, a lot of people
_ including me _ labeled them toys. The problem with the pocket
organizers was their size: They were simultaneously too big and too
small. That is, they were too big to fit into your pocket, but they
were so small that it was impossible to touch-type on their
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Let it never be said that Microsoft doesn't listen to its
customers and learn from its mistakes. In the time that has passed
Microsoft has taken the jewel that is Windows CE and, working with
hardware manufacturers, redeployed it onto two decidedly different
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Going in one direction, Microsoft shrank the screen and removed
the keyboard; the result is the new generation of palm-size
organizers like the $350 Phillips Nino, designed to compete
head-to-head with the 3Com Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time it was developing the tiny organizer,
Microsoft pushed Windows CE in the other direction and created a
new class of machines that look like a shrunken laptop. This
so-called Jupiter class combines the best features of Windows CE _
such as its ease-of-use, small memory size, and ability to run on
advanced low-power microprocessors _ with a keyboard you can type
on and a screen you can read.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's new Mobilion PV-5000 is one of the most respectable
machines in the class.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things that I like about the Mobilon PV-5000.
For starters, there is its weight _ just 2.7 pounds. Then there's
the price. While $900 is steep in terms of other palm-top
computers, it's cheap compared with other laptops. The PV-5000 has
a very readable 640-by-480 color screen and a built-in modem. It's
got a battery that lasts a whole day in use (Sharp claims eight
hours). It has a PCMCIA slot into which you can slide a digital
camera or a high-speed Ethernet card, both sold separately. And all
of that comes with 16 megabytes of RAM and a zippy MIPS 3000 RISC
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive, the PV-5000 comes with a huge amount of
built-in software. There's also an image editor and an MPEG audio
player. Like previous versions of Windows CE, the PV-5000 comes
with synchronization software that runs on your desktop machine and
lets you upload and download programs, files, names, addresses, and
more between the two.
</P>
<P>
   As an operating system, Windows CE has a lot of advantages over
its desktop cousin. For starters, the Mobilion doesn't need to
boot: Just press the power button and it is ready to go. It rarely
crashes, and when it does, it boots right back up.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Mobilion still doesn't do the one thing that I want:
I can't use it to replace my laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the problem is the software. Pocket Word has gotten a lot
better since I looked at it last; for example, the program can now
open standard Microsoft Word 97 files. But the program still lacks
important features that are needed by serious writers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there are problems that prevent me from creating
complex documents. I can create a bulleted list or a numbered list,
for example, but they can't be multilevel lists. I can't
auto-number my outlines. I can't create tables. I can't even create
page headers and page footers.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Internet Explorer is another problem. Web pages look
wrong, because the layout engine doesn't work the same way it does
in the desktop version. And running on the Mobilion Pocket IE is
very slow. Sharp says the unit has a 33.6 modem, but it seemed the
Web pages were downloading at 14.4 or slower. That's because the
modem is synthesized in software, robbing important CPU power from
other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The PV-5000's keyboard has problems too. Of course the keys need
to be small. But the placement of the keys is far from optimal. The
row of function keys along the keyboard's top row jump you from
application to application, which can be most infuriating when you
accidentally tap them while typing.
</P>
<P>
   As with any new piece of technology there are a few minor
integration problems. For example, I keep getting an error message
that says ``Your backup battery is low or missing,'' and then
warning me about losing data, even though the PC also says that my
``backup battery is good.''
</P>
<P>
   But overall, I was impressed with how sturdy the technology
seems to be. Ultimately, I can see this machine being very popular
among high school and college students. But without a companion
desktop machine, this Windows CE device would be significantly less
useful.

FINALLY, A PLACE TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT AREN'T POLITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why do white people smell like wet dogs when they come out of
the rain?'' asks Cass in Detroit. ``Why do black folks get agitated
when they see the Confederate flag?'' asks Wallace in Suwanee, Ga.
``Why do gay men feel they have to sound gay?'' asks Derek K. in
Duluth, Minn. ``Why do Asian women seem to date more white men than
Asian men?'' asks Victor in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't exactly the kinds of questions you'd overhear in
casual conversation at a crowded train station or in the grocery
checkout aisle. They're the kinds of things an adult might ponder
in private, but only a child would blurt out in a public place. But
they're also whispers on the Web, real questions posted in a
virtual forum where folks are encouraged to seek answers to
questions they'd be too embarrassed to pose in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing fancy or glamorous about this Web site. It's
simply called ``Y? The National Forum on People's Differences.'' It
doesn't offer gee-whiz plug-ins, real-time audio, or images that
gyrate with each click of your mouse. It's just simple text, page
after page of questions typed by users worldwide, from Delhi to
Duluth. And frankly, it's one of the most inventive uses of a
technology that is too often dismissed as a glorified toy or a
gigantic shopping mall. The Web site doesn't make any money, but it
might make the world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y?'' is the brainchild of one Phillip J. Milano, a workaday
newspaper editor for the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville.
Milano, 36, is a self-described ``white kid'' who grew up in the
posh suburb of Glen Ellyn, Ill. ``It was a pretty segregated place,
and I didn't have a lot of contact with too many people,'' Milano
recalls. ``There was one black kid in my high school class.'' The
fifth son of a metallurgical engineer and a homemaker, Milano was
always encouraged to ask questions _ on music or politics or art or
diversity. He was taught that curiosity is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   When he became an editor, he launched a project called the
National Diversity Newspaper Job Bank, an on-line clearinghouse for
positions at newspapers. Then last fall, he had a simple idea. What
if he started a Web site where folks could ask painfully
embarrassing questions in a safe, anonymous environment? What if he
asked others to answer those questions? He set up the computer in
his den, signed up for a Web address (www.yforum.com), and launched
the forum.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Milano wasn't sure it would work. Heck, he wasn't even
sure it was necessary. Are people really that isolated? But then
the questions started to trickle in, and folks started posting
responses. Then a startling query came across his screen: ``What
would take place during a typical weeknight in a black family?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a woman in Philadelphia who was so far removed from
other groups that she couldn't even imagine what it would be like
to live in a black household,'' Milano recalls. ``I went running to
my wife and said, `This is going to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   And it has worked. This low-tech site gets about 400,000 hits a
month, and has a loyal group of followers who check in daily, the
same way a sports fanatic turns to the ESPN Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Clardy, an industrial engineer for Ford Motor Co. who
lives in Southfield, Mich., is one of those regulars. A single
mother who serves on Ford's diversity council and is a member of
its gay and lesbian employee group, she frequently posts answers to
questions about sexuality. ``Some of the questions really surprise
me,'' she says. ``I've never seen so many people who seem to think
other people smell funny. Where on earth do they get these ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that people have these ideas is the very reason Y?
Forum works. This isn't Oprah, where audience members do the
talk-show version of ``We Are the World.'' Nor is it one of those
canned ``town meetings'' on race, where the dialogue is as natural
as a snowman in Bali. The dialogue here can make your face turn
red, but it's also refreshingly honest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its success, the Y? Forum hasn't been able to attract
many sponsors. Milano pays for the site and works on it late at
night, when his three children are asleep. That might change soon,
though. Milano just forged a partnership with a startup interactive
entertainment outfit called EnterMedia Network Co.; together,
they're going to launch a live version of the Y? Forum that starts
preproduction next week and launches in January. It will be a kind
of talk radio on the Web, where a panel will discuss diversity
issues in real time and users can participate in chat rooms and
fire off questions for the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there's nothing new about the concept of live chat on
line. But this isn't idle chatter. It's vital stuff. The question
here isn't why this forum exists. The question is simply, why did
it take so long for someone to think of it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC;  It's comforting to know that people like Milano are using
the Net to ask important questions. But what about Monica? What
would take place during a typical weeknight in her household?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was only a matter of time before someone launched the
``first full-scale Web biography'' of Lewinsky. Earlier this week,
a British on-line publisher called Atlantic Productions was hyping
``Monica: Behind the Myth,'' an on-line book about our own Helen of
the Oval Office. For about 3 British pounds (about $1.65), browsers
can see home movie footage of Lewinsky, and scroll through pictures
from her ``best friend's photo album.'' As a matter of principle,
the only pounds we're interested in losing are the ones we gained
at the dinner table yesterday, so we skipped the salacious details.
But inquiring minds can check it out at www.atlantpro.demon.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
______ &QC;  Search of the week. Monica scribblings aside, where do you
find real books on-line? A good place to start is at the Internet
Public Library (www.ipl.org), an extremely helpful site run by
librarians at the University of Michigan's School of Information.
It starts with this premise: ``The Internet is a mess. Since nobody
runs it, that's no surprise. There are a lot of interesting,
worthwhile, and valuable things out there _ and a lot that are a
complete waste of time.'' Run by librarians, the site sifts through
the dreck and suggests useful places to help folks find useful
information. In addition to exhaustive reference materials, it also
has links to more than 7,700 books on line, featuring the full
texts of classic and contemporary fiction and nonfiction. There's
no time like a holiday weekend to check out what people are saying
about race at the Y? Forum and then curl up at your computer and
scroll through, say, ``Great Expectations.''

 New Panasonic DVD Player Proves You Can Take It With You  
 By Dan Fost   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who hate paying the airlines to watch a second-rate movie
with all the swear words and juicy scenes edited out can now watch
the movie of their choice right on their tray table.
</P>
<P>
   In stores today is the Panasonic PalmTheater, a portable DVD
player that showsdigital movies on a 5.8-inch screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PalmTheater seemed to be a natural,'' said Jodi Sally,
Panasonic's national marketing manager for DVD. ``You can take your
audio music anywhere, why not take your movies?''
</P>
<P>
   DVD _ which stands for digital video disc _ finally is reaching
the mainstream, with more 1 million DVD players shipped to the
retail market. More than 2,000 titles will be available in the
format by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   That helps make the PalmTheater a viable entertainment option.
In addition to its portability _ its rechargeable battery pack runs
for two hours _ the PalmTheater can plug into a television or
stereo system and work like a regular DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   Of course like any new technology, the PalmTheater doesn't come
cheaply. The two-pound device sells for a suggested $1,400.
Panasonic won't comment, but historically, prices have a way of
plunging in the consumer electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   The device folds up to less than 61/2 inches square, has a
screen less than two inches thick and built-in stereo speakers
featuring ``virtual surround sound,'' which Sally described as a
rear-channel surround effect from just two speakers. It also can be
used with headphones, which must be purchased separately.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the PalmTheater offers all the advantages of DVD, which
puts full-length Hollywood movies onto a disc the size of a music
CD. Features include the choice between letterbox or full-screen
viewing and the ability to jump to different scenes.

MICROSOFT'S CLEARTYPE SETS OFF DEBATE ON ORIGINALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One evening last month at an impromptu gathering of reporters at
the Comdex computer trade show, Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft
Corp., enthusiastically described a breakthrough technology for
improving the readability of text on the flat-panel color displays
used on laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique, which he said would be added to Microsoft's
Windows operating system next year, is known as Cleartype, and it
makes text on a portable computer almost as readable as a newspaper
or a book, Gates asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Such an advance could be the key to shifting the balance from
text on paper to computer screens, he added, helping to popularize
electronic books and making online publications legible enough to
read directly from a computer screen for long periods without eye
strain.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Cleartype represents a crucial step in the
evolution of the information age and could mean an economic bonanza
for the computer, Internet and publishing industries.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates' portrayal of the underlying technology as a Microsoft
innovation has set off an intense debate among some computer
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The company says Cleartype is the result of work done by Bill
Hill, a Microsoft researcher who joined Gates on stage for the Las
Vegas introduction of the technology last month. Hill, the company
says, discovered a fundamental new approach to rendering type by
inventing algorithms that draw upon the basic physics of human
vision.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours of the introduction, the Internet was buzzing
with claims that Cleartype was suspiciously similar to approaches
developed many years earlier by researchers at Apple Computer, IBM,
Xerox Corp. and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Microsoft intentionally violated the
patent rights of any other company or individual. The major reason
for the industry's fascination is that the issue speaks to a theme
that winds through the government's landmark antitrust case against
Microsoft now being tried in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony by executives of Netscape Communications Corp. and
Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft has been portrayed as a
high-technology opportunist that often copies and absorbs the
innovations of other, smaller companies but seldom invents much on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   That perception is not new. Despite spending almost $3 billion a
year on research and development, Microsoft is frequently portrayed
as a company distinguished by its ability to capitalize on the
ideas of others.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft became the giant of the industry by purchasing
another company's operating system and licensing it to IBM for its
first personal computer. And Gates once defended Microsoft from
accusations that his company borrowed the look and feel of the
Windows operating system from Apple's Macintosh by insisting that
both companies borrowed a graphical interface pioneered at Xerox's
legendary Palo Alto Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Microsoft insists that ``the techniques
we've developed are significantly different than the claims for
prior art of which we're aware,'' said Dick Brass, a Microsoft vice
president for technology development who is leading the company's
electronic-book development.
</P>
<P>
   But John Seeley Brown, director of the Palo Alto Research
Center, is one of a group of researchers who do not see it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have found a minor twist,'' Brown said, ``but the
idea of how the eye perceives color based on the display of
sub-pixels is where we started this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has refused to disclose details about Cleartype,
saying it did not want to compromise the patent protection it
seeks.
</P>
<P>
   During his impromptu Comdex chat with reporters, though, Gates
divulged that Hill and a small group of Microsoft researchers had
been able to take advantage of the fact that on a liquid crystal
display, or LCD, each picture element, or pixel, consists of three
separate sub-pixels, of different colors. When all three are
switched on simultaneously, the viewer is tricked into seeing a
single white pixel because the individual sub-pixels are too tiny
for the eye to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   This means that LCDs should be able to render type fonts as much
as three times the actual screen resolution, making them far
sharper and easier to read.
</P>
<P>
   The stairstep edges of lines on a typical computer screen give
fonts a jagged appearance, so smoothing type has long been a quest
of software designers. Most settle for one of a variety of
techniques known as anti-aliasing or hinting. The most common
technique is to paint pixels along a character's edge in shades of
gray, which essentially smudges the characters' borders to make
them appear less jagged.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says its sub-pixel approach is ``an unprecedented
innovation in font display technology'' and Gates called it a
``leap forward'' in screen sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry researchers acknowledge that the Cleartype
technology will make screens sharper, but insist that the
underlying concepts have been known for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I objected to is they made such a big deal out
of it,'' said Steve Gibson, a software developer who wrote programs
for the Apple II personal computer. ``I'm afraid they are going to
try to claim it as their own.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gibson decided to stake his own claim to history by creating a
Web page (http://grc.com/cleartype.htm) to document what he calls
the original pioneering work in sub-pixel technology by Steven
Wozniak, designer of the Apple II computer.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wozniak was designing for television screens rather than
for LCD displays, he used a sub-pixel technology to effectively
double the horizontal resolution of the Apple II by blending two
sub-pixels, purple and green.
</P>
<P>
   Wozniak, who now teaches school in Los Gatos, Calif., recalled
in an e-mail interview that the concept ``was actually quite
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my greatest contributions to the first low-cost
computers,'' he wrote, ``was to realize that these properties of
color equaling screen position allowed me to achieve color and
hi-res both, at very low cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Wozniak the only designer to explore color's
relationship with resolution. In 1989, Ronald Feigenblatt, an IBM
expert on LCDs, wrote a technical paper on using color to increase
the resolution of graphical objects, including fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Feigenblatt, who has since left IBM, said that at an academic
conference that year, IBM demonstrated a prototype flat-panel
display using software he had designed that used color sub-pixels
to enhance resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Brass said that neither the work of Feigenblatt nor that of
Wozniak had any bearing on Cleartype's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wozniak patent deals with improving the display of a TV
set receiving an Apple II signal, and the Feigenblatt patent deals
with improving the rendition of color on an early LCD,'' he said.
``Neither of these technologies is about improving font resolution
on a display.''
</P>
<P>
   The most direct challenge to Microsoft's claim of originality,
however, comes from Dpix Inc., a Xerox subsidiary spun off from the
Palo Alto Research Center. Dpix makes a high-resolution, 7
million-pixel color flat-panel display using techniques that seem
to closely parallel Cleartype technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dpix display each pixel is composed of four sub-pixels _
two green and two red-and-blue _ to increase the readability of the
fonts above and beyond the resolution of the screen, which is
already twice that of today's standard flat panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We address the green pixel separately with different
gray-scale data, which gives you a much finer resolution to the
font and a much finer curve,'' said Malcolm Thompson, president of
Dpix and a longtime flat-panel researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said his company had not sought a software patent
because such techniques had been used for many years in military
flat-panel displays for enhancing photographic imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was not aware of the Xerox research, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's application for patent protection for its font
technology is one reason the announcement has stirred controversy.
Software was not routinely patented until the mid-to-late 1980s, so
the Patent Office does not have a rich database on which to draw
when assessing software claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built the whole industry around there not being patents,''
said Dan Bricklin, a developer who invented the spreadsheet. ``The
old-timers don't even think of patenting ideas new-timers think
they invented. It's a real mess.''

 Some Electronic Holiday Products Are So Hot This Year, They're
Cool  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some holiday gifts are so hot, they're cool.
</P>
<P>
   We took a look at the computers and related electronics
available this year and picked out a few items that stand out for
their style and performance. Price also was a consideration _ we
didn't include anything beyond the means of the average
computer-geek consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The following items share one thing in common: They all contain
cutting-edge technology that would make them the star attraction of
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   It's Absolutely Clear
</P>
<P>
   First up is a personal computer monitor unlike any you've seen
before. The ViewSonic VPD150 is one of the new generation of ``flat
panel'' displays that have been under development for years. It's
got a full 15-inch screen, it's just 3 inches deep, and it takes up
almost no space on your desk. It pivots for either landscape
(horizontal) or portrait (vertical) mode. The picture quality is
stunning, offering up to 1,024 x 768 pixels of sharp resolution.
And to top it off, it includes integrated speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Although initially aimed at medical, industrial and government
applications, it would look right at home in a state-of-the-art
home office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer:  &LR; ViewSonic (www.viewsonic.com)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price:  &LR; $995
</P>
<P>
   Printing With Style
</P>
<P>
   Color inkjet printers have become so good that they can
faithfully reproduce photographs. And the cream of this year's crop
is the Epson Stylus Color 640. It combines high-end performance
with a low price that's hard to beat. You get 1,440 x 720 dots per
inch for sharp images, and photo quality when you use special
photographic paper.
</P>
<P>
   The printer comes with a bundle of respectable software,
including Adobe PhotoDeluxe, American Greetings Creatacard and
Broderbund's Print Shop Premiere Edition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manufacturer: &LR;  Epson (www.epson.com)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Price:  &LR; $199
</P>
<P>
   Picture Perfect
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest gifts this holiday season is sure to be
digital cameras, which are rapidly becoming more of a challenge to
traditional cameras in performance while at the same time getting
less expensive. There are several nifty models to choose from, but
one that tops a lot of lists is the Kodak Digital Science DC260.
</P>

Road to telecommuting more likely just a cow path 
By Bill Husted  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am telecommuting today. Instead of sitting behind my
two work computers _ a G3 Macintosh and a Pentium II PC _ that are
connected to a high-speed data line and all the various news
services that pump information into any modern newspaper, I have my
feet propped up on my desk in a spare bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The cat is curled up in the sunshine nearby, and I am
barefooted.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuting is fine for what I am doing at this moment:
writing a column. And if that were all I did in my newspaper job,
there would be no reason to trek into the office at all, unless
someone were retiring and chocolate cake were being served.
</P>
<P>
   But because my job involves so many different things _
discussing stories with reporters who cover technology, sometimes
talking to readers with a question and often pacing around waiting
for a reporter's story to edit _ telecommuting isn't a real
substitute for being there.
</P>
<P>
   In my old-fogey opinion, at least, that daily commute in your
car is unlikely to be replaced _ on a day-to-day basis at least _
with a cyber-office at home.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you picture regular commuting as driving along the
interstate in a modern automobile, this telecommuting stuff amounts
to pedaling to work on a rickety bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if _ despite the appeal of working from home _ it would
work for most folks I know. Among my friends are physicians who
would be hard-pressed to work in a cyber sort of way, a fellow who
installs and maintains commercial roofs (I can't picture him
pouring on an extra layer of tar this way, no matter how fast the
Internet connection) and several graduate students who spend their
days arguing in class. Typing out messages might work for them, but
it sure wouldn't work as well.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that I have spoken before at telecommuting
conferences and certainly despite the fact I like the notion that _
in just a moment or two _ I'll be able to eat some of my sister's
famous Thanksgiving fruit salad and eat it here at my desk, I have
real doubts that telecommuting represents an important future in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot like wrapping a leaking radiator hose with duct tape
_ it works better than nothing but isn't a permanent solution. So
today _ forced to stay home by a stomach that is riding some kind
of internal roller coaster _ I'm glad I can sit here with the cat.
And I'm sure the reporters I edit are happy I am not pacing about
their desk, trying to look unconcerned as I wait for their stories.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many things _ little and big _ I can't do
today. And I won't be able to see how fast the other guy is typing,
or spend a moment to ask about his Thanksgiving. The real problem
isn't goofing off _ I'm typing as fast as I can _ but work without
the human touch is a pretty bland sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Look, there are plenty of folks who disagree, and maybe my
telecommuting today represents some real future. But I'm glad to
tell you what I think anyway. With all the voices for change and
all those eloquent people who explain how technology will make life
better, it is good to have one lonely voice here in the
cyber-wilderness who understands the value of being a human in a
cyber world.

Article helps stamp out Windows 98 bugs 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any piece of software, no matter how good, is a work in
progress. Every company ships programs with lots of bugs, and that
includes the current operating system Microsoft Windows 98. Learn
about what bugs are in Win98 and how to fix at least some of them
in the December issue of Windows magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Windows also includes a comprehensive
guide to Windows NT5, which is Microsoft's industrial-strength
operating system, typically used to run server computers. You'll
find a detailed discussion of NT's strengths and weaknesses as well
as a recommendation on who should use it.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   War and destruction remain popular, at least for computer game
makers. As always, many of the titles released this holiday season
feature war and are aimed at boys. Cavedog Entertainment, for
example, has released the ``Total Annihilation Commander Pack.'' It
includes ``Total Annihilation,'' a popular war game, and two
expansion sets. The pack retails for $44.99 and requires Windows 95
and a 100-megahertz Pentium computer.
</P>
<P>
   For something a little more benign, there's Wizardworks'
``Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer's Magical Sleigh Ride.'' There's
not a single casualty in this computer CD game based on the
soon-to-be-released animated movie of the same name. In this game,
you help Santa gather toys for his ride, locate kids needing gifts
and print out holiday cards. Available for both PCs and Macs,
Rudolph retails for $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan of those little plastic replicas of people like
Darth Vader, check out a new site by Hasbro. It produces a lot of
these figures and now has a database of information about them
online. Called HasbroCollectors.com, the site will both sell these
plastic figures and provide a details about them. There are also
chat rooms where collectors can trade information and discuss their
favorite figures. You'll find the HasbroCollectors.com site at

Going once, twice ... auctions to treasure 
By Frances Katz  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Online auctions prove one of the basic truths of human
nature: One person's trash is another's treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Web auction game is relatively new, and might be a little
too much for Web surfers just getting comfortable with online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you read the directions carefully and ignore the $250
Furbys (unless the money is going to charity), you can find your
own personal pot of gold _ or gold plate _ at an online auction.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular online auction houses are eBay
(http://www.ebay.com) and Yahoo! Auction (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com). On these sites, you'll be able to find nearly
everything your heart desires, from rare coins to collectible
Christmas ornaments, vintage Barbie dolls and Waterford crystal.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a collector, or know someone who is, purchasing a
hard-to-find treasure through an online auction can be fun and
rewarding. A quick survey of collectors of a variety of items
showed that for the most part, initial asking prices on the items
were what a person would expect to pay at a flea market, an
in-person auction or a retail store.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all this in mind, newbies should take care to read
all the fine print before signing up or placing a bid. Once you
have purchased an item, you are conducting business with the person
auctioning the item. Yahoo! and eBay allow you to check up on both
buyer and seller. The eBay system has more checks and balances,
although problems are rare.
</P>
<P>
   There are sites such as Amazon.com, which have perfected the art
of one-click ordering, but eBay and other online auctioneers aren't
the sort of places where you log in, order up and log out. By their
very nature, these sites invite you to stay, take a look around and
see if they have any classic matchbox cars, Fiestaware soup bowls
or vintage rhinestone jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   If you see something you want to buy, that's great, but unlike
online retailers, you've got to register whether you are a buyer or
a seller. That way, if you develop a reputation as a con artist or
a welcher, the whole eBay community will find out via online
postings. And there truly is nothing worse than having a bad
reputation in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   For beginners, there's no better place to learn the ins and outs
of online auctions than eBay, which has an easy-to-follow tutorial,
a list of frequently asked questions and lots of other information
to help you before you bid. And even if you don't want to buy, it's
still fun to look. Recent items on sale at eBay included a 1983
DeLorean auto and a snuffbox featuring a painting of the Titanic
disaster. Yahoo! Auctions is equally easy to use and also requires
registration. There may be fewer items and the organization might
not be as efficient as eBay's, but if they have what you want, it
really doesn't matter what else they may have.
</P>
<P>
   With so much talk about sites that want to build community on
the Web, eBay and others create an instant community of like-minded
souls united by common interests. EBay founder Pierre Omidyar says
there may be only one or two collectors of a certain item in your
hometown, but there could be hundreds online. Here's where you can
find them and gather up some goodies along the way.

 Download That Tune, It's Web Music  
 By Benny Evangelista   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We're the music pirates,
</P>
<P>
   We sail the IR seas.
</P>
<P>
   We rip our favorite albums,
</P>
<P>
   We share our MP3s.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lyrics from ``Pirate This Song,'' by God Ate My Homework.
</P>
<P>
   Homer, Hobbes and Earl Grey T are hardly household names.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a file-squishing technology called MP3 that has
become a grassroots movement on the Internet, their band, God Ate
My Homework, is known by thousands of people. The group says
100,000 Web surfers have visited their site to download tunes like
``Pirate This Song'' and play them on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for three University of California at Berkeley students
who lack a recording contract and whose ``studio'' is small dorm
room and a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of MP3s has provided an instant Internet
audience for weekend musicians like God At My Homework, a new
promotional tool for known artists like Dionne Warwick and the
Beastie Boys, and a major headache for the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone in high school or college or any young adult who has
Internet access has probably downloaded an MP3,'' said Earl Grey T,
who is studying molecular genetics. ``The concept itself is
universally appealing _ the idea of getting free music.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is so appealing that copying, trading by e-mail and
posting songs in the MP3 format is one of the fastest-growing
phenomena on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a techno-underground-punk kinda thing anymore,''
said Michael Robertson, founder of a popular Web portal called
MP3.Com.
</P>
<P>
   Until two weeks ago, the only way to listen to MP3 songs was on
a PC. But just before Thanksgiving, electronics stores began
selling a $199 portable MP3 player, the Diamond Rio PMP300, which
can record MP3-compressed songs from the Internet or a CD and play
them in high-quality stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the hand-held player could have the same runaway
success as the early Sony Walkman, spreading the MP3 phenomenon to
mainstream consumers just in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to sell like hotcakes,'' said Mark Hardie,
senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``It
doesn't skip, the sound is perfect no matter what you're doing. You
could be doing jumping jacks or someone could be punching you in
the head.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of MP3s' popularity is WinAmp, the leading MP3
software player. According to WinAmp's creator, a bored University
of Utah dropout named Justin ``Badino Tarantino'' Frankel, copies
are being downloaded at a rate of 60,000 per day, and more than 5
million have been downloaded since mid-1997. And analysts say MP3s
have become one of the most-requested topics, besides sex, on major
Internet search engines.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s' wildfire popularity has the recording industry nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America, which
represents major recording labels like Sony, Atlantic and Warner
Bros., failed to persuade a federal judge to halt shipment of
Diamond's Rio MP3 player. The association said the player, as well
as MP3 itself, encourages illegal pirating of songs and thus cheats
artists of their royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, San Jose's Diamond Multimedia filed a countersuit
against the industry association, claiming the major record labels
violated antitrust laws by conspiring to ``stifle'' the Rio and
similar devices to protect their own control over music
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot at stake. According to Jupiter Communications, in
New York City, online music sales this year will total $88 million,
just a fraction of overall revenues. But by 2002, online sales will
hit nearly $1.4 billion or nearly 8 percent of the overall market.
And there is no counting how many legitimate music sales are lost
when fans copy songs from pirate MP3 sites.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is setting the standard for an emerging new era in the music
industry _ digital distribution of songs and albums directly to
consumers via the Internet, bypassing traditional distribution
channels like record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Web pages have sprung up offering MP3 songs. Many
of the MP3 tunes online are legal copies of songs or by unknown
artists like God Ate My Homework, who find the Internet a cheap and
effective way to promote themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are titles from such better-known acts as Taylor Dane,
Peter Cetera and the Beastie Boys. And Dionne Warwick's oldie
classic ``Say a Little Prayer'' had 29,000 downloads during a
special MP3 promotion from her record company.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also countless pirate Web sites that feature
illegally copied songs from artists ranging from the Beatles to
Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   A team of record industry association Net surfers breaks links
to pirate MP3 sites as soon as it can find them, and it is
``finding thousands of them every day,'' said Hillary Rosen, the
association's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen insisted her association is not trying to stamp out the
MP3 format entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, she said, is for the recording industry to agree
on an encrypted digital music standard that will keep songs from
being illegally copied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker the record companies move to put legitimate music
online, the less incentive there is for people to search for
illegitimate files,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the major recording companies, which control about 80
percent of the world's copyrighted music, have been sluggish in
picking which technology to use, analysts said. That has allowed
MP3s to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   If the music industry does not act soon, it may have no choice
but to join the MP3 wave, said Forrester's Hardie.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen at the recording industry association said it is
``difficult to quantify'' the revenue lost to illegal MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 promoters believe the music industry is using piracy as a
means to stall MP3s' momentum until it can set a proprietary
digital standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piracy is not a threat, it's a smoke screen,'' said Steve
Grady, vice president for corporate communications with GoodNoise
Corp., a Palo Alto startup that is trying to become the first
record label to distribute music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One 29-year-old San Francisco man said he has downloaded one
gigabyte worth of MP3s from pirate sites and his own CD collection
into his home computer, which is hooked up to a stereo system. He
has created long playlists of songs that he listens to at work
without having to change CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``it may be illegal, but, hey, it's free,'' said the man,
who did not want his name printed for fear of getting a nasty
letter from the industry association.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 fan Kevin Fox, a 29-year-old Web site designer from
Berkeley, said he does not download pirated songs but still has
built an MP3 library of more than 600 songs that he copied off his
own CD collection and ``encoded'' into MP3s. That is legal as long
as he does not sell or distribute the songs.
</P>
<P>
   He has friends who ``each night pop in a CD to encode,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whenever he wants to hear techno groups like Nine Inch
Nails, or an old Beatles tune, or even the soundtrack from ``The
Little Mermaid,'' he has them just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain defiant attitude among MP3 users that the
recording industry cannot take away their freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to defend the right to have this new method of
encoding music,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   And not all record labels see the MP3 as a threat. Independent
label Platinum Entertainment Inc. is allowing free downloads of MP3
songs from Dionne Warwick and The Band with Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Steve Devick said he believes MP3s can
be as important a promotional tool for the music industry as radio
was in the early days of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly what the consumer wants to do,'' Devick said.
``If the public is given a choice, I don't think they want to
violate the law or rip-off artists. But you create piracy when you
don't give people enough alternatives.''

Santa's waiting for e-mail 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You won't be surprised to learn the North Pole is
wired with the latest in T3 high-speed data lines and the finest
and most powerful of servers. Santa Claus, after all, does not mess
around.
</P>
<P>
   Kids have been writing letters to Santa for a long time now.
Each year, the post office routes any letter addressed to Santa
Claus at the North Pole to helpers who answer them if they can.
This is the busy season. If you or a young one wants to write Santa
online, you'll find there are many mysterious ways to reach Saint
Nick.
</P>
<P>
   We'll list some of the Web sites here that offer free letters
from Santa. Your child can write a note to Santa, using the e-mail
address on the Web page, and receive an answer by e-mail. The sites
we will visit today offer this cyber-fast connection to Santa free.
There are also places on the Web that charge _ but no child should
have to pay to get a letter from Santa, so we'll ignore them, and
you probably should, too.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop for the day is a Web site maintained by a
commercial storefront on the Net called the Christmas Store. But
despite the commercial nature of the site, you won't pay to write a
letter to Santa using the link on the page at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .holidaytree.com/xmasnt.html. In fact, you might urge your child
to really pull out the stops and write the best possible letter.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small prize, $100, for the best letter to Santa
received at the site. While that amount might not change your
Christmas dramatically, it sure wouldn't hurt. As you'd expect,
there are also links to various products and services sold from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas, of course, knows no nationality. So don't think it
odd that we're stopping next at the UK Online Pages at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .uk-online.com/christms
</P>
<P>
   /letter.htm. This site makes it easy, if a bit impersonal, to
send Santa a list of presents your child wants. Just fill in the
blanks, hit the button and the letter wings its way to the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom has more than its share of Christmas letter
sites, and we'll visit an excellent one next. It's called Christmas
and Santa Letter and is located at http://www.north-pole.co.uk
</P>
<P>
   /index5.htm. Not only can your child use the link on this site
to write a letter to Santa, there also is a link that will let
anyone send some of the prettiest electronic Christmas cards you'll
find on the Web. There's no cost for that service, either, and the
whole family probably will enjoy this place. The electronic
Christmas cards come in all varieties, including religious themes
and funny ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus Online also offers a fine way to send e-mail to the
North Pole at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .santaclausonline.com/
</P>
<P>
   santapages/letter.html.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a form to fill out on this page. Then, just a bit
after you press the button to send your e-mail to Santa, you'll get
a canned reply. While most of the letter is traditional in nature,
some plugs for the products on the commercial site are included at
the bottom. So some parents may wish to avoid this site if the
notion of blending the commercial with the sublime bothers them.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. This is just a sampling of the places where
your child can write Santa. The selection is so broad you are sure
to be able to find the kind of site that appeals to your family.
Just use your favorite search engine and type in these search
terms: santa, online, letter. You'll get screenful after screenful
of sites that blend the old-fashioned spirit of the season with
this new-fangled Internet.

 Internet-stock investing requires love of risk  
 By Arthur M. Louis   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until three months ago, you probably never heard of eBay, a
little San Jose company that maintains an online flea market where
people can trade things like Beanie Babies, firearms and
aphrodisiacs over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if you haven't heard of eBay, you probably haven't heard
of Monica Lewinsky either.
</P>
<P>
   EBay has become the quintessential Internet stock. Although the
company boasts scant revenues and earnings, its stock market value
is a staggering $7 billion. The company went public on September 24
at $18 per share and closed Monday at $174.25.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest installment of the Great Tulip Craze.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators have been making huge profits this year on
practically any company that promises to exploit the commercial
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, president of Pring Turner Capital in San Ramon, says
today's market reminds him of the late 1960s, when everyone was
looking for the next Xerox. ``If a company's name had an `x' in it,
you bought it. Now, `x' has become `dot com.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If all the ruckus, and those easy profits, tempt you to plunge
into these stocks yourself, you're only human. But don't do it
unless you have money to burn and are willing to accept huge risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, this mania will end _ like all other manias _
with a really stiff correction,'' warns Tony O'Bryan, a technical
analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son in St. Louis. ``It will be across
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Wall Streeters acknowledge that the Internet already ranks
among the greatest technological revolutions in history. And they
expect companies that effectively exploit the Net's commercial
potential to succeed beyond the dreams of avarice.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody can be certain which companies will succeed and which
will fail. What's more, the market prices of virtually all Internet
stocks have risen so sharply that few, if any, still look like good
buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about the future of the Internet _ it's
huge,'' says Will Weinstein, head of Genesis Merchant Group
Securities in San Francisco. ``But the prices of these stocks today
are just an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet stocks can't be evaluated by traditional means.
Price-earnings ratios are meaningless in most cases, because few
Internet companies are profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Internet issues that analysts include among the
``first tier'' _ the most likely to succeed _ are still losing
money.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Santa Clara's Yahoo, which maintains an immensely
popular search engine, and Amazon.com, of Seattle, the dominant
Internet book retailer.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the Virginia Internet service provider that is
generally considered tops among the first-tier companies, eked out
a small profit in the fiscal year ended in June after suffering a
big loss the year before.
</P>
<P>
   People who buy these and other Internet stocks are betting on
the Net in general, and on promising concepts in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But how does one evaluate a concept? Companies that look
promising today could be dead and gone two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of earnings, analysts must look at other ratios.
For example, they are comparing the total market value of a
company's stock to its revenues, or its cash flow, or the number of
daily hits on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has lately been selling for more than 20 times revenues.
AOL, now that it is profitable, sells at an absurdly high 350 or so
times earnings, but only about 13 times revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Those price-to-revenues ratios don't seem so high considering
that Microsoft, a much larger company, currently trades at around
20 times revenues. Can Amazon and AOL grow faster than Microsoft
from here on? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't necessarily warn people away from all Internet
stocks, even at these levels,'' says Jessica Martin-Rice, an
analyst with Chicago's Driehaus Capital Management. Driehaus
pioneered momentum investing, which involves buying stocks that are
moving up rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might want to at least hesitate before buying Yahoo,
which is trading at an eyebrow-raising 120 times revenues, or eBay,
now selling for around 300 times revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Internet stocks can go down as well as up.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's Books-a-Million, until two weeks ago a little-known
chain of retail bookstores in the Southeast, announced on November
25 that it would sell books on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock rose from $4.38 the day before the announcement to $47
three market sessions later.
</P>
<P>
   But investors had second thoughts after the Wall Street Journal
reported that the company's executives were selling shares like
crazy at the lofty new levels. Books-a-Million closed Monay on
Nasdaq at $14.94.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet stocks have soared, many institutional investors
that bought them at much lower prices have either sold them or
stopped buying.
</P>
<P>
   Even some momentum investors are getting scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of money on Internet stocks we've held for a
long time, but now things are getting crazy,'' says Jamie Atwell,
head of Nasdaq trading with Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wrona, co-manager of the PBHG Tech Fund, sold a small
holding in eBay recently. ``We bought it at the time it came out,
and even then it was expensive, but within the realm of reason,''
he says. ``Now it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   With institutions largely on the sidelines, the market for
Internet stocks has lately been dominated by day traders _
individuals who trade in and out of stocks many times per week and
even per day. Appropriately enough, many of them trade on the
Internet itself, through online brokerage sites.
</P>
<P>
   The day traders typically trade an average of only a few hundred
shares at a time, compared to the thousands of shares that an
institution might buy or sell in a single trade. But there are so
many day traders trading so frenetically that the total mounts
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent market day, for example, 8.2 million shares of
Books-a-Million changed hands. The average trade was 437 shares, or
less than $12,000 worth.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the trading volume of General Electric, an
institutional favorite, was 4.8 million shares. The average trade
was 1,171 shares, worth more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Spewing out orders like so many tommy-gun slugs, the day traders
have helped push the turnover in eBay stock to more than 5 million
shares per day five times in the past seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty amazing considering that eBay's float _ the number
of shares held by the public, rather than by management and other
insiders _ is only 3.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Internet stocks may simmer down a bit now that many
online brokers are tightening the rules for investors buying these
stocks on margin.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, DLJ Direct, E-Trade, Charles Schwab, Suretrade and
Waterhouse, among others, recently increased the so-called
maintenance requirements for Internet stocks bought on margin, or
with some borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   They have done this because they fear the stocks will plummet,
causing investors to default on their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms routinely reassess their margin requirements for
individual stocks that become volatile, but they rarely crack down
on an entire industry at once.
</P>
<P>
   Customers with margin accounts can buy stocks with up to 50
percent margin _ meaning that half the price is paid with the
buyer's own money and the other half with money borrowed from the
broker.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, brokers require investors to hold cash or un-margined
securities in their accounts with a total value equal to at least
30 percent of the value of the margined stocks in the account.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the brokers have boosted the maintenance
requirement to between 40 percent and 100 percent for certain
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Schwab boosted its maintenance requirement to 50
percent from 35 percent on 22 Internet stocks starting last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To investors that want to drive these stocks, we're saying you
have to wear seat belts,'' says Schwab spokesman Tom Taggart.

COMPANIES HESITANT TO SHARE YEAR 2000 INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal law aimed at encouraging businesses to share sensitive
information about year 2000 computer problems has produced scant
results in its first month and a half, according to corporate year
2000 specialists, consultants and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress rushed what it called a Good Samaritan law to President
Clinton this fall amid growing concerns that many computers and
software programs could malfunction if they interpret the two-digit
representation of the year _ 00 _ as 1900 or do not recognize it as
a valid year. Many trade groups, including those representing
electric utilities, airlines and the computer industry, have been
telling the government that fear of lawsuits has been stifling the
exchange of information that could help reduce the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, collaboration is essential as time ticks away,'' said
Tim Morton, vice president at Electronic Data Systems Corp., who
oversees a Web site that his Dallas-based consulting and management
company has set up as a public forum where companies can report on
year 2000 issues.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is intended to make it much more difficult for
plaintiffs to attack companies, trade groups and other distributors
of year 2000 information, even if the information turns out to be
faulty or incomplete. Plaintiffs would have to prove that those
sharing the information knew it was wrong or were reckless about
whether it was truthful.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not bar fraud claims and does not cover sales
pitches to consumers. It also does not apply to pending lawsuits or
restrict the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to ask
for year 2000 information and enforce its disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   The new law covers two types of information. The narrower
category, known as year 2000 readiness disclosures, deals only with
the year 2000 status of a company's own products and services. It
covers, for instance, any comments by the Boeing Corp. about its
aircraft and any advice from Citibank about whether consumers can
expect its automated teller machines to dispense cash.
</P>
<P>
   The other category, known as a year 2000 statement, is far
broader, including comments on other companies' products or
projections about the impact of possible year 2000 problems. A
utility trade group, for example, would have some protection if it
estimated how long power plants could operate on stockpiled coal if
railroads were unable to ship new supplies, as would a hospital
that reported to others that a particular medical device failed a
year 2000 readiness test.
</P>
<P>
   The experience so far with the new law raises questions, though,
about how much pent-up desire there is to share year 2000
information freely. At the very least, it suggests that while it is
popular to blame lawyers for discouraging such activities, many
other factors have also been involved. Some companies, for example,
fear use of the information by regulators or competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The new law's main impact has been to send businesses scurrying
to lawyers. Computer users are unsure how much shelter the law
provides and whether taking advantage of it in some cases is worth
the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phones were ringing off the hook as soon as the law
passed,'' said Wynne Carvill, a partner in the large year 2000 team
at Thelen, Reid &AMP; Priest in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The rush for legal counsel stemmed in part from a provision
giving companies a 45-day window to bring some statements made as
far back as Jan. 1, 1996, under the umbrella of the law. That
window, which was opened when Clinton signed the bill into law on
Oct. 19, closed last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The retroactivity provision applied only to readiness
disclosures. Lawyers say there are several twists to the provision
that may undermine its value, including one requirement that
everyone who received the statement be informed that it is being
reclassified as a protected disclosure. Another provision gives any
customer who already relied on the statement 45 days to object to
its being reclassified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my clients think it's not worth the effort to go back
and dig up what they said in the past,'' said Mark Pomeroy, a
lawyer in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Many year 2000 project managers say information is beginning to
flow more freely. But both the managers and lawyers say pressure
from regulators and customers, not the new law, appears to be the
driving force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen people saying more because of the act,'' said
Michael Siavage, an Atlanta lawyer whose firm, the Red Hot Law
Group, has many software companies as clients.
</P>
<P>
   That could change, many experts say, as more industry groups
organize clearinghouses of information patterned after the group
set up by major automakers. John Koskinen, chairman of Clinton's
Year 2000 Council, has been encouraging the formation of such
groups. ``The critical thing is to exchange more technical
information, not readiness statements,'' he said. ``This is a way
to jump-start those who are late into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said he would like to see such information open to the
public but that the crucial thing was to make sure industry groups
made it freely available to everyone in their industries, including
companies that do not participate in trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   George Surdu, global coordinator of the Ford Motor Co.'s Year
2000 efforts, said the law would prove to be helpful in the long
run. ``The speed of enactment sent a strong message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the law are already lobbying Congress to close what
they see as loopholes that limit its protections and to pass other
measures that might limit future lawsuits.

MANUFACTURERS WRESTLE OVER ON-LINE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By VICTORIA COLLIVER   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you want to shop at www.macys.com instead of
trudging down to the mall this holiday season, don't bother looking
for Levi's jeans or Levi's Dockers brand _ you won't find them.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., which started selling Levi's and Dockers on
its Web sites (www.levi.com and www.dockers.com) within a week of
Macy's in November, won't allow Macy's or any other retailer to
sell the products on line. The company wants its cyberstores to be
the only place to buy Levi merchandise through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As an increasing number of manufacturers start to sell directly
to customers through the Internet, a growing concern emerges. It's
known as ``channel conflict'' _ the head-to-head competition
created between manufacturers and the brick-and-mortar retailers
that sell the manufacturer's goods.
</P>
<P>
   Channel conflict is ``a huge problem,'' said Barry Parr, an
analyst with the market research company International Data Corp.
``It is not easy to change a distribution system.''
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers have chosen not to sell on line, either
because they lack the infrastructure to sell and ship merchandise
directly or they don't want to upset the solid relationship they
have established with their resellers. Others are selling on line,
but lessen possible conflicts by opting not to offer any promotions
or special deals.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, channel conflict was more of a fear than a real
problem. Many manufacturers and department stores had World Wide
Web sites for the sole purpose of building customer awareness and
brand image, not for direct transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Web sales have been dominated by on-line retailers, such as the
video store Reel.com and giant bookseller Amazon.com., companies
whose entire business is Web-based. Also relatively quick to go on
line were such retailers as the Gap and L.L. Bean, which compete
with their own stores and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Now traditional stores and manufacturers have realized they will
lose ground to on-line retailers unless they sell directly through
the World Wide Web. New York-based Jupiter Communications estimates
shoppers will spend $2.3 billion through on-line outlets this
holiday season, up from $1.1 billion last year. They also have
become less worried that on-line sales will cannibalize store sales
and are more confident in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be hard pressed in a year or two to find a manufacturer
that doesn't sell something on line,'' said Erina DuBois, digital
commerce analyst for Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif. ``It's an
area you cannot not play in.''
</P>
<P>
   But right now, manufacturer-direct on-line sales are still not
that common. According to an Ernst &AMP; Young study produced with the
National Retail Federation early this year, only 9 percent of
manufacturers currently sell on the Web; an additional 12 percent
have plans to do so eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will continue to be flare-ups, but retailers who get
caught up in that are missing the point,'' Ernst &AMP; Young spokesman
Keith Hark said. ``The point isn't whether or not they are cutting
a little here or there into each other's businesses. You have to
accommodate the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Web watchers say the way this delicate relationship between
manufacturer and distributor will be played out will depend on the
companies, their products and their on-line goals.
</P>
<P>
   What Levi has decided is that a reseller may not have the time
or money to sell Levi products on line the way Levi wants it done.
Levi established www.levi.com in 1995 and www.dockers.com the
following year, but just started selling on the sites last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McSpadden, director of e-commerce for the Dockers brand,
said the company spent the past year interviewing customers about
what they want from an on-line store. The site offers such features
as interactive changing rooms and a ``fit calculator'' for women.
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden said Levi's decision to bar other retailers from
selling its products on line has nothing to do with its
relationship with its resellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an issue between Macy's and Levi Strauss on
this,'' he said. ``This is just a different business model for both
Levi and Macy's.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Anderson, president of Macys.com, said there was no rift
between Macy's and Levi or Dockers. ``I can't explain and do not
know the entire explanation behind why they chose to go this
route,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said no similar problems have arisen with other
manufacturers. He admitted several vendors were reluctant about
Macy's on-line plans when first approached, but changed their minds
once the concept was explained.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taking a different approach is New York-based Estee Lauder Cos.
Inc., which last month launched a selling site for its Clinique
brand. Estee Lauder is also the parent company of cosmetic
companies Aveda, Prescriptives, MAC, Aramis, Bobbi Brown and
Origins.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder maintains that department stores have brought the
company to where it is today and it intends to be sensitive to
those retailers. That means handling on-line sales differently for
each of its brands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinique can be purchased at www.clinique.com, a
site established three years ago that just started selling direct
last month. Estee Lauder also sells Clinique and Estee Lauder
products through Macys.com after successful pilot tests.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bobbi Brown customers log onto the site at
www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com and make a purchase, the transaction is
handled by Neiman Marcus through a joint venture arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, Origins becomes available on-line. The brand
already has its own separate, established distribution network
because it is sold through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an either-or proposition,'' said Angela Kapps,
Estee Lauder's vice president of special markets and new media.
``The reality is our products will be sold on line in a lot of
places. You will be able to buy where it's convenient to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapps likens channel conflict to what happened when designers
opened their own stores. ``Back in the '70s when Ralph Lauren
opened its first store down the street from Bloomingdale's, people
said, how could you do that?'' she said. ``But then it wound up
increasing sales in both places.''
</P>
<P>
   DuBois advocates a sort of ``happy medium'' approach toward
dealing with the manufacturer-reseller relationship. She said
exclusive selling sites are not ideal in forming those
relationships, but manufacturers may want to limit the number of
sites that sell their products to ensure quality control.
</P>
<P>
   Parr, of International Data Corp., said there are no easy
answers, but on-line selling will become virtually mandatory for
manufacturers and traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not selling on the Web, you've got a big problem,''
Parr said. ``When these kind of shifts take place in the
marketplace, you may find you're damned if you do, damned if you
don't.''

MICROSOFT SETS PUSH FOR CORPORATE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., put the matter
succinctly while speaking in New York last week. The next
battleground for the personal computer industry, he said, is
industrial-strength corporate computing _ the lucrative province of
hardware and software suppliers like IBM, Sun Microsystems and
Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of that battle, according to Gates, is not much in
doubt. He spoke of the supremacy of the ``PC model'' _ hardware and
software as separate businesses (Microsoft, of course, dominates
the software side). ``The PC model will take over the rest of the
industry,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer forces, led by Microsoft, are already
moving up the computing food chain from their desktop stronghold.
In the last couple of years, Microsoft's hub software for feeding
information to and from many users at once _ called Windows NT
Server _ has captured the market for corporate networks that span a
few hundred desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft has not really cracked the sizable market for
heavy-duty computing chores, like securities trading or travel
reservations systems, in which workers typically use powerful work
stations running Unix software or terminals connected to mainframe
computers. The standards of performance, availability and
reliability for these systems, which must handle millions or
billions of transactions a day, have been regarded as beyond
Microsoft's reach.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption, however, may be challenged by an announcement
planned for Monday that the Nasdaq stock market intends to move one
of its key systems from a mainframe onto a cluster of powerful PC
server computers, running Windows NT. The system monitors trading
and feeds the data to Nasdaq's in-house regulators and, if
necessary, to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It tracks
trades as they occur and crunches the data to spot trades that
appear to be errors or suspicious _ and must recognize them within
90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq has decided to move its market-monitoring system off its
Tandem Computers mainframe mainly because its proprietary software
tended to make the system inflexible, said Gregor Bailar, chief
information officer of the National Association of Securities
Dealers Inc. To analyze fast-moving markets and the proliferation
of new securities, he explained, Nasdaq felt it needed a more open
technology in which many third-party developers were making
software tools for the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq took bids from both Unix and Windows NT suppliers, and
Bailar said he had some qualms whether Windows NT would be up to
the task. ``This is a mission-critical system for us, and I wanted
to be convinced,'' Bailar said. The leading Windows NT proposal was
put through 30 different benchmarking tests, including handling up
to 4 billion daily transactions. ``I was a bit surprised by NT's
performance,'' Bailar said.
</P>
<P>
   David Osborne, chief technology officer for Micro Modeling
Associates, the lead consultant on the project, predicts that
Nasdaq's move will attract a lot of attention on Wall Street. Many
Wall Street firms use Windows NT as a desktop operating system,
said Osborne, whose consultancy works for many investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the major Wall Street firms have been watching closely to
see if Windows NT is really going to work on the server side for
big, high-transaction systems,'' he said. ``The Nasdaq project is a
bellwether for NT.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry analysts note that winning a single showcase
project, like the one at Nasdaq, scarcely means that the markets
for large Unix systems and mainframes are facing an imminent threat
of Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a notable milestone for NT, but it has a long way to
go before it is widely deployed across the top tier of corporate
computing uses,'' observed Dwight Davis, an analyst for Summit
Strategies, a research firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even Microsoft, which has been criticized in the industry for
making inflated claims about Windows NT, which was introduced in
1993, is speaking carefully these days. ``We're not saying there
isn't a lot more work to be done at the high end, but we've come a
long way,'' said Edmund Muth, marketing manager for the Microsoft
group responsible for so-called enterprise, or corporatewide,
customer networks. ``In that context, the Nasdaq project is
directional.''
</P>
<P>
   In the server business, Microsoft is pursuing its tried-and-true
formula of focusing first on the high-volume, less-costly end of
the market as its launching pad. From there, it gathers a primary
community of users, software developers, resellers and consultants
_ and moves up toward higher tiers of the corporate computing
market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year for the first time, for example, computer systems
running Windows NT Server software passed Unix server systems in
terms of units sold worldwide, according to International Data
Corp., a market research firm. In the first half of this year, IDC
reported that sales of server machines running Windows NT reached
472,505, compared with 258,320 for all Unix suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   When measured by revenue, however, the Unix leadership in
heavy-duty corporate computing remains intact. In the first half of
1998, sales of Unix servers were $11.6 billion, compared with $3.3
billion for server machines running Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   At the upper end of corporate computing, a supplier's services
and skills often matter as much or more than the cost of hardware
and software. And increased competition has brought sharp declines
in the price of large Unix systems and mainframes. One result is
that even the mainframe, once seen as a technological dinosaur and
a corporate albatross for IBM, has made a comeback.

 How to Get Your Web Site in the Limelight  
 By Peter Sinton   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I am a small e-commerce business owner trying to
grow my business online. How can I promote it, the inexpensive way,
besides getting listed in the search engine?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Getting your name listed on search engines such as
Yahoo and Excite is definitely a place to start. It can help spread
word of your business and requires simply filling out a form at
each site. But so many businesses are lining for free references
that it might take days or weeks to get listed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is important to use all means available _ online
and off _ to promote an e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco consultant Mitchell Friedman, who teaches college
courses about public relations on the Internet, says this includes
setting up links to your site from other sites; identifying
newsgroups, forums, chat rooms and other appropriate venues to
promote your venture; and using mailing lists to inform potential
customers via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman recommends several Web sites: You can locate
appropriate mailing lists at www.liszt.com, create a free mailing
list of your own at www.listbot.com, discover news groups at
www.dejanews.com, find Web forums at www.forumone.com and create
your own forum by visiting www.delphi.com.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and CompuServe also offer many forums that might
be places to discuss your work. However, you need to subscribe to
these proprietary services to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, you should mention your Web site in all printed
materials (such as business cards, brochures, letterhead,
advertising, invoices and phone directory listings) and any other
ways you reach prospects, including voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Relocation Checklist
</P>
<P>
   Q: My two partners and I have a technology consulting business
that we have been able to run out of a live/work space in the
Mission District. We recently agreed to lease actual office space
and wonder if there is some sort of checklist to help a company
plan its move?
</P>
<P>
   A: There isn't the same standard checklist for businesses
planning to take off for a new location. Beyond obvious chores like
getting a new phone lines and letterhead and changing your mailing
address, San Francisco's Burr, Pilger &AMP; Mayer accounting and
consulting firm has some suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   You might start by analyzing your physical space requirements.
Specifically, what are your current needs? Is there room for future
growth? Do you want to be a subtenant or have one?
</P>
<P>
   Landlord-tenant negotiations can be especially complex, says
Jenise Gaskin, a Burr, Pilger partner. ``Three years ago, there was
plenty of space available and tenants were able to negotiate all
sorts of improvements,'' she said. ``Now that's much harder so
there are plenty of hidden costs if you have to pay for walls or
put in computer wiring.''
</P>
<P>
   It is important to ask whether tenant improvements are included
in the lease. Can you put the improvements out to bid, or are you
required to use a specified contractor? What about
repair/maintenance costs for your space and common areas?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Moving arrangements &LR; . Do you have to use union or nonunion
movers? When can you move in? During business hours? Should you get
damage insurance?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Utilities. &LR;  What is covered in the lease and what is
considered ``extra?'' How is the building metered for public
utilities?Is each space metered separately? Is the building
air-conditioned, and if so, what are the hours of operation?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Insurance. &LR;  What is a tenant's liability? Check the lease for
minimum coverage required by landlord. You also are required to get
Workers' Compensation insurance for any workers and might consider
comprehensive general liability, nonowned auto liability, fire and
theft property loss, earthquake damage, business interruption, and
errors and omissions coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Parking and storage. &LR;  What is available and what are the
costs?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Options &LR; . Can you get options for additional space or first
right of refusal for upcoming space in the building? Can you get an
option for a lease extension?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Real estate taxes &LR; . If taxes and operating costs increase over
time, what is considered the ``base year?'' Is there an adjustment
if the building is not fully occupied?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Rules and regulations. &LR;  What sort of security and safety
training does the building owner provide? How often are fire drills
conducted? What are the procedures for after-hour arrivals and
departures, and delivery of packages? How does the janitorial
service operate? Are there sign requirements or restrictions? Does
the building regularly perform air quality testing and what are the
results?
</P>
<P>
   If you are moving, you probably need new equipment such as
phones, answering and/or paging service, fax and copy machine,
computers and network cabling, postage meter and furniture. You can
rent, lease or buy.
</P>
<P>
   If you are hiring more employees, you should check the laws for
a company your size. If you need to offer health insurance to
attract employees, consider HIPC (Health Insurance Plan of
California) for organizations with fewer than 50 employees. Obtain
federal and state employer ID numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are plenty of self-help books, Gaskin advises
getting an attorney to review your lease on new office space before
signing it. You might also study the literature or consult
professionals on the appropriate structure for your business (such
as partnership versus incorporation) as well as tax and other
filing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Year-End Bonuses
</P>
<P>
   Q: My company is doing OK but not great but wants to reward its
employees. Any suggestions for making employees feel good and
giving them incentives to work even harder without breaking the
bank?
</P>
<P>
   A: Awards can be tricky. Bonuses should not generally be a
surprise, says Jim Horan, an El Sobrante business consultant and
owner of Rent.a.CFO. He believes employees should know what the
specific goals are all year and realize if they are on track or
not. While surprises are nice, they do not re-enforce desired
behavior year-round.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for most small businesses to impress their employees
with year-end cash grants because either it's never enough or they
know a neighbor, friend or fellow employee who got more. And if you
gave $1,000 last year and can only afford $500 this year, it's
bound to be taken badly.
</P>
<P>
   If your company has limited cash, Horan recommends other types
of recognition as inexpensive as a catered lunch, specially printed
T-shirts or plain old praise.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling ``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus'' author
John Gray's observation that men get ``the same number of points''
whether they give a single rose or a dozen, it might be better to
give a single rose 12 times a year. In other words, recognize
employees throughout the year for their accomplishments. Make it
part of your culture, and if you can afford it, make it part of
your business plan and budget.

AMAZON REPORTED READY TO LINK TO OTHER MERCHANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the rapidly expanding online store, is about to
introduce a new service in which it will refer its customers to
other Internet merchants selling goods that it does not carry,
according to people briefed by the company on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com plans to place links marked ``Shop the Web''
throughout its online store early next week, these people said.
This will allow consumers to search for items in a number of
categories including apparel, toys, computers and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Such a search would display items from a selection of
participating vendors. The vendors include some mainstream
merchants, like L.L. Bean, the Gap and F.A.O. Schwarz, as well as
some Internet-only merchants like Brainplay.com, a high-end
Internet toy store.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Amazon.com declined to comment on its specific
plans. But she said the company had made no secret of its intention
to introduce such a service since it bought a company called
Junglee in August. Junglee has created software enabling Internet
users to compare the prices and features of products for sale on
any number of sites spread across the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has been moving at a breakneck pace to transform itself
from its original business as an online bookstore into something
closer to an electronic department store. It started selling music
last summer and then last month introduced videos and a gift
section with toys, consumer electronics and games.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Shop the Web'' service, using Junglee, is still
somewhat of a test, the people briefed on the plan said. At first
the link promoting the service will be placed in an unobtrusive
place on each page. After the initial bugs are worked out, Amazon
intends to create a button shaped like an index tab on the top of
all of its pages, referring shoppers to other sources of books,
music, movies and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The intention is primarily to help consumers find items that
Amazon itself does not stock. But with the Junglee capabilities,
there may very well be instances of Amazon's steering customers to
other vendors or better prices of goods that the company has on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon would still receive revenue in such cases. Initially,
the participating online merchants will pay Amazon a fee for each
customer who clicks on a link provided by the service to visit
their site. Eventually, they may be required to give Amazon a
percentage of each sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Amazon users who surf off to other online stores by
using the referral service may be able to buy things using Amazon's
one-click purchasing system, which stores customers' shipping
addresses and credit card information.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is quite a race on by a number of Internet
companies to combine shopping directories with services that make
buying items faster and easier. For example, the Excite search and
portal service has introduced a holiday gift shop with 300 items
drawn from about 20 online merchants. Excite offers to keep a
user's address and credit card information on file and send it to
each merchant that a customer buys goods from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Excite creates a massive, searchable index of Web
sites, Excite will create a massive searchable database of products
available online,'' said Andrew Halliday, Excite's vice president
for electronic commerce.

<P>
   A Watershed Year for Sex
</P>
<P>
   What with matters Lewinsky and the Viagra sensation, 1998 has
been a watershed year for sex, in the view of Rufus Griscom,
editor-in-chief of the online magazine Nerve (www.nerve.com).
Previously unutterable topics have infiltrated public discourse,
and this can only be good news to someone in the business of
offering readers ``literate smut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom Brokaw says `erectile dysfunction' on the air, when
puritanism is pushed back, it's permanent,'' Griscom said.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, at the onset of a holiday season that many have
proclaimed an ``e-Christmas,'' Griscom feels that his magazine's
foray into electronic commerce is well timed. As with its stories
and essays, which have been contributed by established authors like
Erica Jong, Nerve's online store leaves much to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone asks us, `Are you selling lotions and sex toys?'''
Griscom said. ``We clearly, very intentionally, decided not to do
that.'' Instead, there are provocative gifts like silk pajamas and
candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it should come as no surprise that apple pie is the
scent American males find most arousing. If you're not the sort to
bake your man a pie (or whisk your woman off to an ocean bluff),
put our aromatherapy candles to work for you,'' reads the
promotional copy for the ``Nerve Boutique: Supplies for the
Thoughtful Hedonist.''
</P>
<P>
   But pushing for a renaissance of the game Twister _ ``people
should get their limbs entwined with other people's limbs as often
as possible'' _ is just one facet of Griscom's efforts to extend
the 18-month-old Nerve brand.
</P>
<P>
   In raising money and signing deals, Griscom (who has a scholarly
demeanor and an Ivy League degree) has learned that perhaps even
more than love, sex is vastly misunderstood _ particularly when the
word ``intelligent'' is used to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to turn people on but to make people think
about it,'' he said. ``Erotica tends to follow the arc of the
sexual act and is more about arousal, whereas what we tend to
publish is more thoughtful and might make people feel decidedly
unaroused.''
</P>
<P>
   In this paradox, Griscom finds an intriguing challenge for the
new millennium, a time in which e-mail and chat rooms factor
increasingly into the romantic lives of a great number of people.
To accommodate the shift, the site will soon allow the creation of
personal home pages, the better to swap personal data and one's own
erotic writings.
</P>
<P>
   A television show is also possible, and a book _ ``Nerve:
Literate Smut'' _ is already on the stands.
</P>
<P>
   _ LISA NAPOLI &QR;
</P>
<P>
   From the Electronic Innards to the Everyday Cash Register
</P>
<P>
   Is the Cisco brand moving to a store shelf near you?
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the impression that John Chambers, chief
executive of Cisco Systems, gave last week. After speaking at the
president's electronic commerce news conference in Washington on
Monday, Chambers said his company, the No. 1 manufacturer of data
communications equipment, was seriously considering ways to move
into the retail consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to the Panasonics and Sonys of the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A vast majority of Cisco's business is selling products to other
businesses. But as high-speed data communications become available
to more people through cable modems and the telephone wire
technology known as DSL, a market opportunity may open to Cisco in
selling directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most people who use an advanced data service get their
modem-like device directly from the company that provides the
service, with few choices _ similar to the way the cellular
telephone market operated years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the wireless market, people can often choose their
phone first and their service provider second. And if a similar
evolution occurs in the high-speed data market, Cisco wants to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Panasonics and the Sonys, Chambers said, Cisco is
preparing itself for the day when advanced communications
capabilities are built into consumer electronics of all sorts.
Cisco would love the makers of VCRs and cameras, for instance, to
point out that their products include Cisco technology, just as
some PC makers boast of ``Intel inside.''

COMPANIES FIND WAYS TO MANAGE DELUGE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WENDY TANAKA   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Electronic mail is increasingly becoming the
preferred mode of correspondence. But for some businesses, e-mail
has become too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are deluged daily with hundreds of messages they can't
possibly respond to in a timely fashion, if at all. As a result,
customer service can lag and business opportunities can slip away.
</P>
<P>
   To counteract these potential losses, some companies have
created internal systems that use software designed to sort, direct
and answer e-mail queries automatically. Others are contracting
with companies in the growing e-mail call center industry to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Brigade Solutions Inc. is set up like a traditional call center,
employing 50 ``cyber representatives'' in San Francisco and in
India _ where lower-cost, highly skilled labor is plentiful _ who
read e-mail questions sent to businesses and shoot back answers,
usually within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Brigade was launched in February with $300,000 in seed money
from its founders, Brian Jeffries and Russ Cohn. The company is now
awaiting an infusion of about $2.5 million from a venture capital
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Fortune 500 companies out-source customer service,'' said
Jeffries, 32, the president and chief operating officer of Brigade.
``It's a pain not to out-source what's not the core of your
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The company so far has three corporate clients, including San
Francisco-based Intellipost Corp., an on-line direct marketing
company. For confidentiality purposes, Brigade would not name the
other two customers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Brigade started percolating a few years ago when
Jeffries and Cohn were working as management consultants in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian and I built call center operations for large telecom
firms,'' said Cohn, 28, the chief executive. ``We saw the Internet
as a way to do this better, faster and cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurs said Brigade charges clients significantly
less to sort, direct and answer e-mail than it would cost if the
customer had its own system.
</P>
<P>
   For answers to simple e-mail inquiries, Brigade charges between
$1 to $2 per response. This compares with about $4 per response
using an internal system, according to Forrester Research Inc., a
market analysis company in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Brigade representatives start by writing answers to the most
frequently asked questions received by a client. Then those
responses go into a ``knowledge base.'' Jeffries said about 70
percent of the responses can be answered through the knowledge
base, with minimal tweaking. The remaining 30 percent of e-mail
requires more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Using Chevron Corp. as a hypothetical client, Jeffries said,
``Chevron might get e-mails about where the closest service station
is. That doesn't take a rocket scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more technical question about how Chevron gasoline is
formulated, he said, a Brigade representative would need to forward
it to an appropriate Chevron manager.
</P>
<P>
   Brigade is targeting large companies, those that receive at
least 3,000 electronic inquiries a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to build a small number of very large accounts,''
Cohn said. ``The death of many service companies is that they have
too many customers, and not enough services. We're not following
the FedEx model. We're not stamping out parts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cohn notes that one of Brigade's largest accounts right
now is Intellipost, he sees opportunities outside the technology
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pretty big market for us in any industry,'' Cohn
said. ``High-tech companies get the most e-mail, but banks and
airlines should care the most.''
</P>
<P>
   John McCormick, an analyst with Frost &AMP; Sullivan Inc., a
technology research company in Mountain View, Calif., said Brigade
likely would capture a small segment of the growing e-mail call
center industry.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said industry sales are about $11 million. He
predicted that by 2002, sales will jump to $103 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at live services,'' he said, referring to
companies such as Brigade. ``I think it's going to be a niche
market because they're much more expensive than automated
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Automated solutions are the handful of software companies that
sort, direct and answer e-mail queries. McCormick said the one-time
cost of acquiring this software could run from $900 to about
$14,000 _ much less than the $1 million annual revenue stream
Brigade is looking for from each customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies don't really like recurring costs,'' McCormick said.
``If you buy automated solutions, you can take the hit up front.
It's like buying a house or renting.''

MARINE WHO BLASTED CLINTON IS REPRIMANDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDLER, Ariz. - A Chandler Marine reserve major who wrote an
opinion piece calling for President Clinton's impeachment has been
taken to the woodshed by his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Maj. Daniel J. Rabil said Tuesday, his military
career is over.
</P>
<P>
   Rabil, 34, was placed on inactive reserve and had an official
counseling letter placed in his personnel file last weekend after
meeting with Marine authorities in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my career is effectively over,'' Rabil said. ``I can
hang around, but it's very clear that I won't be going anywhere.
Having an official counseling note in your file is a career
killer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maj. Paula Buckley, spokeswoman for the commander of Marine
reserves in New Orleans, disputed Rabil's interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even call this action punishment,'' Buckley said.
``He retains his rank and is just being placed in the same reserve
status as he was in when he left active duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an administrative action which is intended to be
corrective.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabil, who works as a commodities trader in the southeast
Valley, wrote an opinion piece published in the ``Washington
Times'' last month attacking Clinton's sexual misconduct with
Monica Lewinsky and calling for the president's removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Rabil referred to Clinton as a ``morally
defective leader with a demonstrated disregard for his troops'' and
a ``highly skilled perjurer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabil also called the president a ``known criminal,'' ``lying
draft dodger'' and an ``instinctively anti-American man.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,
officers on active duty are prohibited from making critical remarks
of the president and other civilian leaders. The code does not
address the question of freedom of speech as it applies to reserve
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rabil is not on active duty and did not write the article
during his one weekend a month with the reserves, Marine officials
indicated initially that he might not be punished at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rabil said he also thought he might be in the clear after not
hearing anything for three weeks from Marine commanders. But all
that changed when he was summoned to New Orleans late last week to
meet with Maj. Gen. David Mize, commander of Marine reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Rabil was chastised by Mize and another commander during a
30-minute meeting that Rabil described only as being ``very
formal.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Rabil's article was published, Marine Maj. Shane
Sellers, who works at the Defense Intelligence Agency, received a
written warning after writing a column for the ``Navy Times.'' In
that column, Sellers referred to Clinton as ``an adulterous liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley said that the Marine high command sent an e-mail to all
general officers after Sellers' column appeared, reminding them of
Article 88 and the restriction on criticizing civilian leaders.
Rabil said he never saw a copy of the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would have mattered. Rabil is unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is that the senior leadership took it the wrong
way. I'm doing the right thing by the Marine Corps. You don't
strengthen an organization by tolerating those who are trying to
weaken it,'' Rabil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we have a president who is untrustworthy. Why not
use the facts now to remove him before later on, when soldiers are
sent off for whatever questionable reasons? It would be more
honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabil served four years on active duty as a lieutenant in the
late 1980s before entering the reserves in 1990. Most recently, he
had been attached to an active reserve unit assigned to Camp
Pendleton, Calif. &QL;

BEN AND JERRY SHARE SECRETS OF SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The secret ingredient to Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc.'s
success isn't just in the milk from growth-hormone-free cows or the
intense flavors that tantalize Ben Cohen's taste buds.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of high-quality products, against-the-grain
marketing and strong corporate conscience have taken Cohen and
partner Jerry Greenfield way past the Vermont ice-cream parlor they
started for fun in 1978. Twenty years later, the adventure they
launched with a $5 correspondence course and $12,000 in savings and
loans has grown into a publicly traded company selling $174 million
in ice-cream products a year.
</P>
<P>
   The ice-cream entrepreneurs were in the Pheonxi area last week
to address small-business owners at US West Communications' New
Ventures Forum. For Greenfield, it was a bit of a homecoming _ he
lived in Tempe in the early '80s while his wife attended graduate
school at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   Still sporting a collegial look of untucked T-shirts and no
ties, Cohen and Greenfield recalled that their product came at a
trendy time for homemade ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``What ice-cream manufacturers had been making up until that
time was ice cream that was easy to make, that machines were
designed to make, as opposed to making ice cream the way people
really wanted to eat it,'' Greenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   But selling their super-premium version during Vermont winters
was difficult, even when they dropped prices along with the
temperature. To survive, they turned to the wholesale market where
their products _ hand-mixed with chunks of cookies and candy _
stood out against the air-filled, inexpensive ice cream sold then.
</P>
<P>
   Their down-home image also differed from the concoctions labeled
with foreign-sounding names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out with Ben &AMP; Jerry's, being very honest about who
was making it, where it was being made, putting our faces on the
cover, not trying to be eloquent and classy, but trying to be
essentially what we are. And that broke through the clutter,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The final ingredient, he said, came from building a company that
gives back to the community and uses its power to solve social
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can relate to your customers on the basis of values,
when the customers believe in the company, believe what the company
stands for, as opposed to basing it on advertising and . . . a
really cool ad campaign, the latter is much more ephemeral, and
it's only as good as your latest ad campaign,'' Cohen said. ``But
building this strong values-based relationship with the customers
ends up with long-term customer loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Those loyal customers have done everything from flood Ben &AMP;
Jerry's with 22,000 entries in an ``I Want to Be CEO'' contest to
suggest new names and flavors for ice cream. The idea for Cherry
Garcia, for example, came via an anonymous postcard from a Grateful
Dead fan, Greenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two can point to successes now, there were plenty
of low points.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three or four years, all they did was work and try
to pay the bills, Greenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my strongest memories is of walking outside and seeing
Ben lie down in the gravel,'' he said. ``He just fell asleep, right
on the gravel.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time a 1,000-gallon tank of liquid ice cream
mix went horribly rancid.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time that was just a huge financial hit for us, plus I
had to go into the bulk tank and clean it out,'' Greenfield
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, so torn by the '60s perception that business takes
advantage of employees and the community, the pair put Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Homemade up for sale. They changed their minds when a
friend convinced Cohen that he didn't have to run his business that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real turning point,'' Greenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the company's ``two-part bottom line'': profits, and the
quality of life in its community. Yet the company has wrestled with
the fact that resources devoted to one take away from the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized the solution to the dilemma is to choose the ones
with a positive effect on both,'' he said. Consequently, Ben &AMP;
Jerry's buys its dairy ingredients from family farms and its
brownies from an inner-city bakery.
</P>
<P>
   They rewrote the business book with their first stock offering
to the Vermont public, done to raise $750,000 to upgrade vintage
facilities. Advisers thought they were crazy, Greenfield recalled,
when they refused to seek venture capital and decided to make
Vermonters owners of the business.
</P>
<P>
   They registered as stockbrokers, set a per-share price of $126,
and took their show on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real way for us to try to take a hold of our values
and integrate it into our need for financing,'' Greenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, however, their distrust of the business world
proved true.
</P>
<P>
   When Pillsbury Co. bought Haagen-Dazs and insisted distributors
drop Ben &AMP; Jerry's, they were mad enough to sue but frustrated that
the courts were full of similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   That spawned a ``What's the Doughboy afraid of?'' campaign aimed
at the public, complete with ads in ``Rolling Stone'' and on the
sides of buses, an 800 number and T-shirts supporting their legal
defense fund. Today, Haagen-Dazs distributors also carry Ben &AMP;
Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
   Growing and going public have posed new conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Where gut and heart used to help with decisions, millions of
dollars now goes into market research, ``which ends up coming out
no better,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation philosophy has changed, too. Originally, to let
people know their work was valued, the highest-paid person made no
more than five times that of the lowest-paid person. Four years
ago, in a move to hire a CEO to take over day-to-day operations,
the policy, symbolic as it was, was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very controversial decision,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   After a switch in CEOs and two years of flat earnings, sales are
back up at Ben &AMP; Jerry's. Greenfield credits price increases,
better operations and ``a real shift back to eating ice cream and
away from good-for-you products.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has 170 retail outlets, including one in Tempe, and
plans to add 30 a year for the next five years. It also is
expanding internationally, including stores in Japan, Israel and
France.
</P>
<P>
   As the business grows, Greenfield admitted, keeping the passion
for it is hard. The feeling around the company, now up to 700
employees and three manufacturing plants, is much different than 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to have a mission that includes more than just making
money is a way that can make the job and the work more meaningful
to people,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Mini movie reviews of ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' and ``Mendel''
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' (PG-13) _ Think ``Romancing the
Stone'' . . . only without the romance or the adventure. Harrison
Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne Heche is a New York magazine
editor. They wind up stranded on an island near Tahiti _ an
abandoned place, except for some pirates. The pair bicker, bond and
kick some pirate butt. Available in VHS and DVD. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mendel'' (Not rated) _ In the years after World War II, a
young Jewish boy comes to terms with his identity in this
affectionate drama. But he doesn't understand why his questions
about the Holocaust disturb his parents, who have emigrated from
Germany to Norway. Interweaving everyday chatter with nightmare
visions of the Holocaust, the film captures the tension between the
need to start a new life and the necessity of remembering the past.
In Norwegian with subtitles. Grade: B

 &HT;    Ritzy remake of Disney classic a fantasy worth checking out
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Parent Trap'' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe Baby Boomers won't ever get over the cultural
touchstone of Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills singing ``Let's Get
Together.'' But this affectionate remake of the Freudian fantasy,
with newcomer Lindsay Lohan, will keep kids enthralled. Lohan plays
Hallie and Annie, twin sisters separated as tykes, and unaware of
the others' existence. That is, till they're reunited at a summer
camp for the cell phone set . . . and plot to reunite their
estranged parents by switching places. Adults will dig the sexy
pairing of Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson as the parents.
Plus, there's the eye-candy of their conspicuous-consumption
lifestyles: He's a Napa Valley vineyard owner, she's a London haute
couture designer. Like we said, it's a fantasy. Priced to buy,
$22.99. Grade: B

 &HT;    New titles sure to please the guys on your list
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   20th Century Fox got into the DVD game late, but the company has
launched a small flotilla of ``older'' titles in time for the
holidays. Most are for the boys _ Steven Seagal in ``Marked for
Death,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``Predator,'' the one, the only,
the original ``Porky's.'' For the girls, well, there's ``Hope
Floats.'' It just came out on video, but it looks better on DVD.
And you can watch it with Spanish subtitles if you're in the mood.
</P>
<P>
   A more classic choice for the DVD fan on your list might be
``Gone With the Wind,'' based on the book about Atlanta that Tom
Wolfe didn't write. The soundtrack has been digitally remastered,
the original technicolor tint restored and, thanks to the DVD
format, you can jump directly to your favorite scene.

 &HT;    Kick the Christmas habit with these flicks
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movies of Christmas are as familiar as our favorite tree
ornaments. The original ``Miracle on 34th Street.'' ``A Christmas
Story.'' ``Home Alone.'' The various versions of ``A Christmas
Carol.'' And the shining, can't-ignore-it star on top of the tree,
``It's a Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you want something a little less obvious, a little
less traditional. If you've had your fill of Tiny Tim and ZuZu's
petals, here are some alternatives. Consider them outsider
Christmas flicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Midnight Clear'' (1991)
</P>
<P>
   Here, as Rod Serling might say, is a carol for another
Christmas. It is 1944 in the Ardennes Forest on the French-German
border in the waning winter days of World War II. A small squad of
young GIs, led by the movie's narrator (Ethan Hawke), occupies a
deserted chateau. Their mission: to monitor enemy troop movements.
Trouble is, the enemy refuses to behave like an an enemy. Based on
an antiwar novel by William Wharton (``Birdy''), this literate,
funny, harrowingly self-aware film is a minor classic.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsel tip: Look for a then-unknown Gary Sinese as one of the
soldiers. And film buffs may recognize director Keith Gordon's
name. In his former life as a teen actor, he starred in ``Dressed
to Kill'' and ``Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fanny and Alexander'' (1983)
</P>
<P>
   This glorious plum pudding of a movie is not, strictly speaking,
limited to Christmas. Set in Sweden in 1907, it actually follows an
extended theatrical family through the plots of several Dickens
novels (not literally, but close enough). The first hour, however,
is the most festive Christmas celebration ever committed to film.
It's the feast, the presents, the arriving friends and family, all
seen through the eyes of 10-year-old Alexander. A breathtaking
evocation of everything Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsel tip: In his autobiography, director Ingmar Bergman said
that it was while making this film that he decided to quit making
films. Nothing catastrophic, just, ``I had seen too many of my
colleagues falling in the ring like tired clowns, bored by their
own dullness.'' Of course, he has since returned to the camera with
a film called _ I'm not kidding _ ``In the Presence of a Clown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter's Friends'' (1992)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's more of a pre-New Year's Eve bash (and bashing),
but the decorations are still up and everyone's trying to summon up
that holiday cheer. Directed by Kenneth Branagh (he's part of the
acting ensemble, too), this Brit spin on ``The Big Chill'' brings
six old college friends _ plus assorted lovers, spouses, etc. _
together for a 10-years-after reunion. It's the sort of
well-meaning house party where too much wine is drunk and too many
truths _ some hilarious, some not _ are told.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsel tip: Popular stand-up comic Rita Rudner wrote the script
and plays Branagh's wife, a very-Hollywood TV diva. And the titular
Peter is Stephen Fry, who turned in an Oscar-worthy performance
earlier this year as Oscar Wilde in ``Wilde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tales From the Crypt'' (1972)
</P>
<P>
   The first short film in this collection of five stories taken
from the old EC Comics is called ``All Through the House.'' It
stars Joan Collins as a single mother celebrating Christmas Eve
with her little boy. Everything looks set for a picture-perfect
Christmas. Then she hears on the radio that a psycho wearing a
Santa suit has escaped from the local asylum. Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsel tip: Though not exactly what you'd call a prestige
production, this nifty little horror anthology attracted a pretty
classy cast. Try, Sir Ralph Richardson and Peter Cushing. The
director, Freddie Francis, is also an A-list cinematographer. Among
his films: ``The Elephant Man'' and the remake of ``Cape Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   A final consumer tip: If you want to know more about Christmas
flicks, famous or obscure. check out American Movie Classics'
special ``Great Christmas Movies,'' which premieres at 10 p.m. Dec.
15. There's also an excellent companion book to the program called
``Great Christmas Movies'' (Taylor, $29.95.)

<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ It's been well more than a month since
Hurricane Mitch walloped Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the storm's wrath didn't end with the rains for the
shell-shocked people packed like animals inside an emergency
shelter at the Leovigildo Cardona Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   In one tiny classroom, a very pregnant Aida Celeste sleeps on a
piece of cardboard, without a pillow, on the cold, cement floor.
</P>
<P>
   She shares the damp space, which is marked off by desks, boxes
and stacks of old clothes, with at least a dozen strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to relief workers, she has all the tins of tuna fish and
cans of green beans she could possibly ever want.
</P>
<P>
   Now what she really needs is money to rebuild her makeshift
house, swallowed by a mudslide during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take anything with me when my house fell down; I just
ran for my life,'' said Celeste, 23, a shy, soft-spoken woman with
a 2-year-old son. ``I sit here each day with my son, wondering if I
will ever have a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Her predicament is all too common.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch meandered over Honduras and neighboring
Nicaragua, for nearly six days in late October, destroying or
damaging tens of thousands of homes and leaving displaced nearly 2
million people, or 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Most are holed up in the unaffected houses of family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 200,000 people have been herded into temporary
shelters, mostly in schools, but also in churches and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa alone, at least 20,000 people have been squeezed
into the close confines of 130 shelters, where they live in almost
unbearable conditions, with no privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In San Pedro Sula, the country's second-largest city, thousands
have been packed into the new soccer stadium, which has been turned
into a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped quarters force healthy people to live alongside sick
ones suffering from rashes, infections and conjunctivitis, and
women must sleep beside men they hardly know.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what will happen once many of these shelters are
closed in January to prepare for the beginning of school in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers worry that absolute poverty -- no home, no income
-- will give these people little choice but to live on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some shelters, men who don't belong there have come in and
tried to rape the girls,'' said Brenda Martinez, who works for
CARE, an Atlanta-based relief organization. ``I don't think anyone
has succeeded, but it is just not a good situation for the women.''
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran government, with the help of foreign aid, plans
over the short-term to build at least 3,000 new homes in and around
Tegucigalpa, the country's capital city.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not nearly enough to accommodate the country's legion
of homeless, meaning it may take years before many lives return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   At the shelter at the Jorge Roberto Maradiaga Elementary School
here, Paula Valladares, 23, shares a cot and one blanket with her
three children, ages 5, 3 and 1, while her husband sleeps on the
floor beside them.
</P>
<P>
   They live with three other families in a dingy classroom that's
no bigger than a living room in a typical home in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They hang a torn bedspread from the ceiling when they want to
discreetly change clothes, and heat rice and beans over an open
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to make tortillas and then sell them for money, but now
I don't have any materials to make tortillas,'' said Valladares,
who wears one of the few garments she owns, a flimsy, see-through
nightgown. ``My husband is trying to do some construction work, but
I don't know how we will find money to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have no choice but to remain at the school, which
provides shelter to more than 120 other people.
</P>
<P>
   With no electricity or running water, the smell from six
overflowing toilets is almost suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, relief workers deliver several barrels of water to
the shelter weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Women wash their mostly tattered clothing by hand, hanging it on
ropes to dry in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard, dozens of children, many wearing only
flip-flops and oversized T-shirts, chase each other and toss a ball
back and forth, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Babies crawl at their feet, most with runny noses and no
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, on the other hand, look dazed as they sit on the
ground swapping stories for the umpteenth time about the torrential
downpour that attacked like a biblical plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls of my house started cracking, and it was nighttime,
so it was dark, but still I just knew that the house was going to
fall down,'' said Olga Vaquis, 22. ``I grabbed my two children out
of bed and just started running, and it was muddy and, we fell, but
we just kept going because we were scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families are from Colonia Soto, a working-class
neighborhood overlooking the Choluteca River that virtually buckled
under the weight of the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm, the community included 800 homes. Today, there
are fewer than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Already the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,
after Haiti, Honduras bore the brunt of Hurricane Mitch, which
killed 10,000 people across Central America.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,657 people are dead, 8,058 are missing, and 12,272
are injured in the Honduras alone.
</P>
<P>
   Total losses are estimated at $4 billion -- or roughly the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 72 hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in
50 years,'' said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse.
</P>
<P>
   Food and supplies have poured in from around the world, so much
so that relief workers now warn that it could destroy the local
market.
</P>
<P>
   More goods have been flown in to Central America than during the
Berlin Airlift of 1948, when the United States was forced to drop
food from airplanes when the Soviets blocked the German city at the
beginning of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, which has sent more than 3,600 troops to
Central America to help distribute supplies and rebuild
infrastructure, has handed out 2.3 million pounds of food and
863,000 pounds of medicine in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aid to the region now totals more than $280 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the best way to have an immediate impact now is to
give a cash contribution because it can be directed toward the most
urgent needs, such as providing permanent housing for all those
people who need it,'' said Mark Schneider, assistant administrator
for Latin America for the U.S. Agency for International Development
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by actor-activist Edward James Olmos,
who spent five days touring the devastation in Honduras last month.
``I've helped after Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and other disasters, but this was the worst thing I've
ever seen,'' said Olmos, a spokesman for UNICEF. ``We have 20 to 30
years of work to do in Honduras to get that country back to where
it was just six weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tegucigalpa, a city of 1.3 million, appears
deceptively normal these days, at least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Burger Kings are bustling with customers, and Nissan dealerships
are overflowing with crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Water service has been restored to many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the cliff-like hills that ring the city look like they've
been blasted by a bomb, with houses replaced by piles of mud,
stones and scattered tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a bowl-shaped valley, poor migrants for years have
built settlements on steep mountains when they couldn't afford
flatter, safer land.
</P>
<P>
   They've destroyed trees and vegetation to have building sites,
fuel to cook with and construction supplies.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm hit, the rains triggered landslides along the
deforested hills, gobbling up everything in their paths.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a recurrence of this tragedy, a new law has been
passed that prohibits the rebuilding of houses in dangerous zones.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how well this rule can be carried out
in a country where so many people are eager to build homes.
</P>
<P>
   One person who might have helped was Mayor Cesar Castellanos,
who worked for years to move people out of unstable areas but was
killed in a helicopter crash last month while surveying the
hurricane's damage.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses and nonprofit groups plan to help with
reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot, for example, has given CARE a credit
of $10,000 for building materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is going to be a hard, long-term effort because we
have to create whole new communities, since we can't put people
back where they were,'' said Marc de Lamotte, CARE's director in
Honduras. ``Meanwhile, I ask myself whether I would be able to live
with my family in a shelter under such poor conditions, and I
really don't think I could.''

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ Three years after the Dayton
Peace Accords ended the ethnic war here, a lot of progress has been
made in the reconstruction of Bosnia. Bridges and roads have been
rebuilt, schools reopened, electric lines re-connected. Food
shortages are a thing of the past, as is the systematic violence of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the peace here remains tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, and the result, is 1.1 million Bosnian refugees who
haven't gone home yet, people like Jusif Mujic and Ilic Marko.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Peace Accords, signed in Paris three years ago
Monday(Dec. 14), divided Bosnia into two states: the Serb Republic,
and the Muslim/Croat Federation. The two states are largely
autonomous, each with the right to elect its own president and
parliament, maintain its own military and even negotiate agreements
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Mujic, a Muslim schoolteacher, fled his home at the beginning of
the war when Serbian special forces stormed into his hometown. Now
he lives in the Federation in an apartment owned by Serbs who fled
that area. The apartment he owns, now in the Serb Republic, is
being occupied by Serbs who fled fighting somewhere else in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Marko's case is similar. A retired engineer and a Serb, he fled
his home when his town was taken by Muslim forces. He's living in a
Muslim's home in the Serb Republic while the house he owns is being
occupied by a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Peace Accords reached at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, accomplished the most important goal,
ending the war and the ethnic cleansing that so horrified the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been unable to undo the resulting damage. Bosnia is
still sharply divided along ethnic lines. And while enabling people
to go home wasn't the first goal of the peace plan, it remains the
one that cannot be achieved. That failure has confounded all other
attempts to rebuild Bosnia into a country that doesn't need
international peacekeepers to prevent it from tumbling back into
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a quantum leap forward in the coming year,'' said
Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's international supervisor. ``This
country is not going to be reconstructed unless there is a degree
of multi-ethnicity, unless people are living together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Accords give Westendorp extraordinary powers over
Bosnia. He can impose legislation, suspend laws passed by Bosnian
lawmakers and even remove officials from office. But that power
does not reach into the hearts of people, and he is frustrated by
his inability so far to solve the critical problem at the core of
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail, then I am very pessimistic about Bosnia,''
Westendorp said. ``Last year, we had only 30,000 returns. With
every year that passes, the number reduces by half. People get used
to living where they are. In a way, it's now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Accords also included guarantees that refugees would
be allowed to go home. But it didn't anticipate that some would
refuse, like a tragic game of musical chairs in which some of the
players refuse to get up when the music starts.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Bosnia began after Communist Yugoslavia fell apart in
1991. While the other republics of Yugoslavia had ethnic majorities
that controlled politics, Bosnia's society was a mixture of Croats,
Muslims and Serbs. The three groups fought each other, with the
Croats and Serbs getting help from neighboring Croatia and Serbia,
for 44 months. At the end of the war, there were almost no
multi-ethnic communities left.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, less than 300,000 Bosnians have gone home and of
those, only about 55,000 went to areas where they were ethnic
minorities. Another 800,000 refugees are still scattered around
Bosnia, most of them occupying homes of other refugees. And more
than 300,000 are living in other countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of waiting to go home, Mujic and Marko have
done exactly what Westendorp feared they and others like them would
do. They've given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was sure I'd go home after the war ended,'' Mujic
said. ``But I still don't feel safe here. And the people in my
apartment, they're just not leaving. They don't want to go home.
They like my apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men met on the street in Brcko, in northern Bosnia, one
morning this fall. Over a beer in a small cafe, the Serb and the
Muslim, perfect strangers until that morning, discussed exchanging
the apartments they owned before the war because they had given up
on ever returning to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any problem with each other, Serbs, Muslims,
Croats, as people, individuals,'' Marko said. ``But so much has
happened. At some point, you just have to forget about life ever
being the way it was before the war and make a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the war ended, politics here have been dominated by ethnic
nationalists who have done little to help the country recover. The
economy, social services, taxes, none of those are issues in
election campaigns here. The only issue is the degree of
nationalism of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb Republic has usually chosen the most fervent
nationalists. NATO bombed the Serbs here in order to bring them to
the negotiating table and end the war. Many feel like the peace
that was negotiated left them as second-class citizens of a nation
they fought a war against.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Serb Republic elected a hard-line,
anti-Western, anti-Dayton president.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Poplasen, a former political science professor and
military leader during the war, is cagey with the media. He has to
walk a thin line, satisfying the people who voted for him while
placating the international community. He knows Westendorp can
remove him from office if he says too much.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen declines to say what he thinks the future holds for
Bosnia or for the Serb Republic, saying only that he hopes the
people will decide their own future. If a referendum were held to
decide whether the Serb Republic should be allowed to break away
from Bosnia, he would vote for secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I would try to vote several times,'' he said, laughing.
Then he got serious. ``But that would be possible only if the
Muslims and the Croats agreed. Otherwise it would lead to violence.
I'm not inclined to resolve political problems with violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she didn't vote for him, Natasha Predojovic, a
20-year-old Serb interpreter working for the international
community in the Serb Republic, agrees with Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself, my friends, my family, we didn't want to be part of
Bosnia. We didn't vote for that,'' she said. ``It was imposed on
us. I don't have any feelings for my country. I would never cry at
the national anthem. You might as well tell me I'm Romanian or
Bulgarian.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of refugees going home, she's not sure it will
ever be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can't live together anymore, but at least we can be
good neighbors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb Republic and the Federation exchange very few refugees
each month. But even within the Federation, Bosnians are having
trouble being good neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there have been 70 violent incidents, mostly arsons
but also two murders, prompted by Muslims trying to return to Croat
neighborhoods in the Mostar area. Though the Croats and the Muslims
formed an alliance against the Serbs towards the end of the war,
and though they agreed to live in the same state when Dayton was
signed, they haven't been able to reconcile their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of Bosnia, says reasonable
Bosnian citizens of all three nationalities will never be able to
reconcile their difference with the extreme nationalists among the
Serbs and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say why can't we agree, the answer is, why didn't
you agree with Hitler,'' he said. ``It was impossible. The man
wanted a racially pure land.''
</P>
<P>
   Silajdzic, a Muslim, believes justice is the only thing that can
guarantee peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Bosnia can have justice, he said, is for all the
refugees to return to their homes. Thats the only thing that would
undo the results of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have territory under Serb control in which close to one
million Serbs lived,'' he said. ``They are not there now. So who
lost? We all lost by allowing that to happen. The project (of
ethnic cleansing) still lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Silajdzic resorts to the same answers Poplasen does when
talking about refugees who want to return to his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those now in Sarajevo were expelled from their homes,'' he
said. ``They came here because this was the only safe point. What
should we do with them? Expel them again?''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of the continuing divisions in Bosnia, and the
Bosnian government's inability to overcome them, sometimes borders
on the absurd. To call Bosnia from another country, the caller must
first determine which part of Bosnia he's calling. There are three
phone systems here, a Croat system, a Serb system and a Muslim
system, each with a different country code. An operator on the Serb
system, asked recently how to make a call to a phone on the Croat
system, said it simply couldn't be done.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Westendorp ordered the government to fix the phone
system. He has also ordered the issuance of passports, a common
currency and car license plates that didn't reveal the driver's
ethnicity. And when it came to something that might seem simple,
like adopting a national anthem, his office took over the job after
the Bosnian government failed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's economy is as unreconstructed as its government.
Unemployment hovers around 40 percent, higher in some regions.
Westendorp says the economy is growing at about 35 percent a year,
but he qualifies that by pointing out that there was no economy
here when the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war interrupted a normal transition from communism and a
lack of a market towards democracy and a free-market economy,'' he
said. ``We've had to start almost from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marinko Misic's daughter and son-in-law, the economy is the
reason they won't come home. Even though they are Croats and
welcome in their hometown of Sarajevo, seven months ago they moved
from Germany, where they spent the war, to Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a house here, but no job. That's why they didn't
come back,'' he said. ``The international community, they give
someone a new roof. But what can that man do now that he has a new
roof? He doesn't have a job. We need jobs before we can be a
country again.''
</P>
<P>
   Westendorp knows the governments of the world are beginning to
wonder how much more they'll have to spend making Bosnia into a
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosnia is dependent on the international community, of course,
right now,'' he said. ``This dependency syndrome must
little-by-little disappear. We must do things here and then say to
them, 'OK, this is your responsibility. We are not going to support
you forever.' But more risky and more expensive would be to
withdraw the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks to the small steps that have been taken here as proof
that international efforts are working, however slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Lipovac is one of those small steps. The tiny village was on the
frontlines during the war and was completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But Lipovac is going to be rebuilt because the 31 families who
used to live there, some of them Serb, some Muslim and some Croat,
have decided they can live together again.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, humanitarian organizations, eager to
encourage multi-ethnicity, will have rebuilt almost all the houses
in the village. It may be the first truly multi-ethnic village in
all of post-war Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Lipovac offers hope that lasting peace may be
attainable, it shows why the wounds of war are too deep to be
healed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Risto Djokic, a Serb from Lipovac, went back to
see his farm after the war, he ran into one of his old neighbors, a
Croat man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, 'Screw Alija, screw Tudjman, screw Milosevic,
screw Karadzic. They caused all this.''' Djokic related. His
neighbor was referring to the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and
Serbia and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, 'Alija and Tudjman and Milosevic and Karadzic,
they didn't do this to my house. They weren't here with the
dynamite. My neighbors did this.'''
</P>

   PALANKA, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ Sevala and Suad Pobric were
supposed to move into their new house on May 1, 1992. The young
couple had spent their entire savings building the four-bedroom
house, their dream house, with plenty of room for the family they
wanted to raise together.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 28, a unit of the Serbian Special Forces arrived in
their hometown of Brcko and the Pobrics, who are Muslims, had to
flee. More than six years later, they still can't go home.
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian family that fled fighting in another part of the
country is now living in the Pobric's house. Sevala has met them,
even had coffee with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing, when you go to your house, is when you go
outside and the lady there goes inside and closes the door and you
have to go God knows where,'' she said, tears welling up yet again
as she looked around the tiny apartment without running water where
she and her husband are trying to raise their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The Pobrics, and the Serbian family occupying their house, are
among the more than one million Bosnian refugees who either aren't
able or aren't willing to return to their pre-war homes. They are
all survivors of ethnic cleansing and war. And three years after
the conflict ended here, they each represent a weakness of the
fragile peace here.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Pobric went to visit her house, she brought a bag
of clothes her daughter had outgrown for one of the girls living
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children aren't guilty of anything,'' she said. ``Only
stupid people at the top think we can't live together. We're both
bad off. It's not impossible for us to live together. We did for
years before.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of the people displaced by the war, her husband
can't find steady work. The family lives from week to week on the
tips he makes at a black market restaurant. Before the war, he and
Sevala worked in a battery factory -- he a manager, she a clerk --
both making good salaries. They had plans to send their daughters
to college.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're trying to decide where to send their oldest
daughter to high school. If she goes to the nearest high school, a
trade school, she won't be able to go to college. But the nearest
pre-college high school in the Muslim part of the country is two
hours away. With no car to take her every morning, the 14-year-old
would have to rent a room and live by herself.
</P>
<P>
   She could go to one of the pre-college high schools in Brcko,
just 20 miles away, if her family could move back there.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Sevala Pobric serves a
thrown-together lunch of chicken and canned peppers to a group of
relatives and a reporter who dropped by without notice. Without a
phone, she never knows when she'll have company. She has to go
downstairs to borrow eating utensils from a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life of a refugee,'' she says, laughing as she comes back with
two forks and a spoon. But a shadow crosses her face as she
explains that none of the furniture in her apartment is hers, that
even some of the clothes she owns are donations from refugee aid
centers where she lived during the war.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dayton Peace Accords ended the fighting here in
December 1995, she remembers being so hopeful. The war was bad, but
it was over. Everything would be normal again soon, she thought.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she's thinking about immigrating to the
United States. Her cousin has a daughter in Atlanta who's been able
to find work and even buy a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard, not having anything when you used to have
things,'' she said. ``I hope someday, we'll be like the United
States or Germany, where no one can take away what I made with my
10 fingers. But things are going so slow here.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she received a certificate verifying the home she
and her husband built is indeed theirs. She applied for the
certificate two years ago. It doesn't give her the right to go
home, but it's a start. The international community here has vowed
not to put anyone out on the street, so the family staying in her
home will probably be able to stay as long as they want. And she'll
have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the future and the plans she used to have for it,
Sevala can't help crying. Maida, her four-year-old, asks her why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy's just a little disappointed, that's all,'' Sevala tells
her.

   WHO RUNS BOSNIA? A LOOK AT THE SIX MEN IN CHARGE:
</P>
<P>
   CARLOS WESTENDORP -- A Spanish diplomat, Westendorp has been
Bosnia's international supervisor since June 1997 when he replaced
French diplomat Carl Bildt. The Office of the High Representative
was established by the Dayton Peace Accords to oversee the plan's
implementation. Westendorp has the authority to remove public
officials from office and order the adoption of laws or even
suspend laws after they've been passed by local legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ZIVKO RADISIC -- Chairman of the three-person national
presidency, Radisic is a moderate Serb and member of the Socialist
Party of the Serb Republic, a party advocating the reintegration of
Bosnia. He was a hard-line communist before the war and is
therefore not trusted by some Serbs. However, he defeated an
ultra-nationalist candidate in the September elections. Not much is
known about him.
</P>
<P>
   ANTE JELAVIC -- The Croat member of Bosnia's three-person
presidency, Jelavic is the Bosnian leader of the Croatian
Democratic Union Party, a party based in neighboring Croatia. Born
in Croatia, he was a general in the Croatian Army during the war.
His party has resisted integration of the Muslim/Croat Federation,
one of the two states in Bosnia, and has argued that Croats in
Bosnia should be allowed to establish a special relationship,
almost like a treaty, with Croatia. He is seen as slightly more
moderate than some of the leaders of his party, though still a
hard-line nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   ALIJA IZETBEGOVIC -- The president of Bosnia throughout the war
and leader of the Bosnian Muslims, Izetbegovic was re-elected to
the national presidency in September almost without opposition.
Before the war he was imprisoned in Yugoslavia in the 1980s for his
extremist writings on the future of Islam. His apologists point out
that he never wrote anything calling for Bosnia to become a Muslim
state and most in the international community believe he is fair to
the other ethnic groups, even if his support of an integrated
Bosnia-Hercegovina is sometimes weak.
</P>
<P>
   EJUP GANIC -- President of the Muslim/Croat Federation, one of
the two states within Bosnia, Ganic is a moderate who favors the
re-integration of the country and cooperation with international
officials. A U.S.-educated engineer, he was born in Serbia and
served in the Bosnian government during the war. He was
instrumental in negotiating the peace agreement between the Muslims
and the Croats that preceded Dayton. He is considered a crafty
politician.
</P>
<P>
   NIKOLA POPLASEN -- The president of the Serb Republic, the other
state in Bosnia, Poplasen is a member of the Serbian Radical Party.
The party based in neighboring Yugoslavia with goals of uniting all
Serbs in one country. Poplasen says he would never work toward
those ends because that would violate the Dayton Peace Accords,
however, he's shown little interest in working with members of the
international community either. Before the war he was a political
science professor. During the war, he was a leader in the Serbian
Army.

PATTEN SEEKS CONSENSUS ON POLICING IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ It's a Monday morning, and Chris
Patten already looks bleary-eyed. He knows this is the first of
many days of angry crowds, of hurt feelings, of people who want
things to change, of people who want things to stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   As the last British governor of Hong Kong, Patten knows the
complexity of managing historic change. But as the man now in
charge of the commission that will recommend how to make the police
force reflect the seismic changes in Northern Ireland's political
landscape, Patten faces a task perhaps even more difficult than
preparing Hong Kong for its handover to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Hong Kong, hello ding-dong,'' fundamentalist
preacher-politician _ and foe _ Ian Paisley greeted Patten one day.
</P>
<P>
   Patten managed a smile, because he knows Northern Ireland,
having served here in the 1980s as a junior Cabinet minister before
taking on Hong Kong. He knows that Belfast people in particular
have great, dark senses of humor. Ding-dong, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But Patten also knows this is no laughing matter. Many people
believe that if the peace in Northern Ireland is to hold, the way
the police conduct themselves is likely to prove to be the cement
that holds it all together, or the corrosive that brings it all
crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, without the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the IRA
would not exist today. But if not for the constabulary, the IRA
would have killed far more people than it has.
</P>
<P>
   It was the heavyhanded reaction by police to modest demands by
the Catholic civil rights movement in the 1960s that breathed life
back into what was an IRA that existed largely in name only.
</P>
<P>
   After the police beat peaceful Catholic demonstrators and stood
by while Protestant extremists burned out nationalist
neighborhoods, the IRA was flooded with a new generation of young
men who decided only violence could change Northern Ireland.
Overzealous policing guaranteed that generations of Catholics would
respond to arbitrary searches and gratuitous beatings by joining
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are many good and some remarkably brave men and
women in the RUC, and they are credited by the Protestant community
with holding the line against an IRA they believe was determined to
exterminate them. More than 300 police officers have been killed by
republicans over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Patten and seven other people, including a former
Massachusetts public safety secretary, Kathleen M. O'Toole, are now
charged with reconciling those two conflicting images of the RUC.
They must recognize what the force does right and change what it
does wrong so that the force is acceptable to both communities in
Northern Ireland. On the table are issues such as making the
Protestant-dominated force more reflective of Northern Ireland's
divided religious heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his modest office on the third floor of the
Interpoint building in downtown Belfast, Patten says he is aware of
the importance of a job that cynics say is by its nature a
Catch-22. He exudes a confidence that many admire and that some
criticize as arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be judged by how successfully we can offer a
vision of policing in Northern Ireland that can command the maximum
support,'' he said. ``It's a difficult job, but not an impossible
one.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the difficulties is that so many people claim the
commission's work is a foregone conclusion. Protestant unionists,
who want to remain British citizens, see Patten as someone too
quick to appease nationalists. Some recall he was the official who
in the 1980s approved changing the name of Londonderry district
council to Derry, the name used by nationalists. Some, like
Paisley, say Patten can't be trusted because he is Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme nationalists in Sinn Fein, the party that represents
republicans, those who say violence is justified in trying to bring
about a united Ireland, say the RUC must be disbanded. Many of them
dismiss Patten as a British establishment figure. As someone who
served under Margaret Thatcher, the British figure most hated by
republicans, Patten labors in her shadow, even though he was
appointed to his new post by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Having worked here before, Patten is aware of the tendency of
both sides to assume the worst about British politicians,
especially English ones. But he thinks many of the complaints about
his and the commission's appointment were ``formulistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I may be vainglorious for a moment, I think my appointment
was pretty well received,'' he said. ``I think most people knew
from my time as a junior minister in Northern Ireland that I've
been committed to the community, continued to be in touch with it,
that I care about what happens here. I don't think my Catholicism
mattered greatly to moderate unionists any more than my former
status as a Conservative Cabinet minister mattered greatly to
moderate nationalists.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, Patten hinted at the commission's strategy, to
find the common ground occupied by moderates on both sides who
helped the politicians make a historic compromise with the Good
Friday Agreement, then endorsed the agreement by nearly 3-to-1 in
May's referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Patten's plan to find consensus on policing is centered on
holding some 30 public hearings over the next month. He has made
O'Toole, now an administrator at Boston College, his chief deputy.
In order to get the broadest possible sampling of opinion, Patten
is heading one group while O'Toole leads another, crisscrossing the
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very keen that everybody will get the chance to express
their concerns, their anger, their passions, their aspirations,''
said Patten. ``I hope the process can lead to a more informed
discussion about our conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe those conclusions have already been reached.
A recent report in The Irish Times purported to have an early draft
of the commission's conclusions. Just where the document came from
remains unclear. In his office, Patten dismissed the report as
unfounded, the product of dirty tricks. But he will not issue
public repudiations of purported leaks, which are expected to
become a flood as the commission's report is prepared for release
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that every time one of these stories comes out,
you can't get led into denying the specifics because otherwise
you're announcing your report as you go along,'' he said. ``What
this persuades me of is we should get on with our work as rapidly
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearings so far have been well attended, and passionate. In
Crossmaglen, the bastion of republican resistence, speakers
bitterly criticized Peter Smith's membership on the commission. A
Belfast lawyer, Smith represented two British soldiers who shot and
killed a local man who allegedly ran an army checkpoint eight years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Ballymoney, three police officers, speaking in a personal
capacity, said it would be an insult to the memory of their dead
colleagues if, as has been proposed, the name of the RUC is changed
to make it more acceptable to nationalists. One officer described
poignantly how his father was shot dead by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole said she has been impressed by ``the intelligence of the
submissions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't find the apathy you did at home,'' said O'Toole, in
a veiled reference to her efforts to reform the Massachusetts State
Police, which fell largely on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Although she jokingly calls Patten ``a slave driver,'' she
admires his determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris understands the seriousness of the job at hand,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after he made his party's submission to the
commission here last week, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin
said republicans do not believe that a commission appointed by the
British government is capable of recognizing that the RUC is by its
nature unacceptable to nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RUC was not created to protect the people. It was created
to protect unionism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patten is determined to press ahead, critics be damned. Time, he
says, is of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one lesson I got from government is that the doctrine of
unripe time is always, always wrong,'' he said, preparing to hit
the road yet again. ``There are some things when it's never the
ripe time.''

THE CLASS OF JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- American journalism has marinated in wretched
excess in 1998 and the year closes with the ultimate deprivation
and indignity. This month, Russell Baker files his final column for
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   For readers, this means losing that rare sense of anticipation,
glancing at a byline as a guarantee. Baker's byline delivers good
writing, good humor, and a ruthless honesty about himself. He does
not bluff or pontificate. Readers know: Character counts. Russ
Baker's sensibilities have enriched the op-ed page of the Times
since 1962, longer than any other columnist on that newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Ink-stained wretches still in harness will miss him as a role
model, which in journalese means an object of fierce and
unrelenting envy. The green-eyed monster squats daily over every
newsroom word processor, presiding over pointless arguments: ``I
may not be good, but I'm fast'' vs. ``I may not be fast, but I'm
good.'' But the most bathetic braggarts and most lubricated louts
among us never thought we were as good or as fast as Russell Baker.
</P>
<P>
   He has written three million words for the ``Observer'' column,
few of them out of place. His lasting contribution to American
letters was ``Growing Up,'' his 1982 memoir, which ignored
politicians to focus on his mother, Lucy, who hectored him about
``gumption'' and often said, ``Don't be a quitter, Russell.''
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly that. He began reporting for the Baltimore Sun in
1947, as he wrote, ``studying the psychology of cops, watching
people's homes burn'' while trolling the same precincts as H.L.
Mencken 50 years earlier. Instead of Mencken's bile, he infused his
prose with bemusement. He moved from street reporter to rewrite
with no illusions: ``I knew that journalism was essentially a task
of stringing together seamlessly an endless series of cliches.''
Gulp. Also ouch.
</P>
<P>
   A profile in The Washingtonian this year quoted Calvin Trillin
on Baker as a 1950s guy: ``No complaining, no dancing in the end
zone.'' One lesson of ``Growing Up'' is that war and depression are
more character-building than peace and prosperity, so Baker sought
no slack and no short cuts, which were notoriously unavailable at
the Washington bureau of The Times, which he joined in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days plain English was under suspicion at the
Times,'' he once recalled. ``Many stories read as if written by a
Henry James imitator with a bad hangover. Incomprehensible English
was accepted as evidence of the honest, if inarticulate, reporter;
plain English bothered people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the copy desk yielded. Because Baker knew the difference
between ``disinterested'' and ``uninterested,'' because he could
navigate the perilous waters between ``flaunt'' and ``flout,'' his
news stories penetrated the philistine phalanx with lines like:
``Senator Everett M. Dirksen, the Illinois Republican and orator,
looking Byronically disheveled . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Such a phrase would vanish in the hyena cacophony that passes
for political discourse on television today. It is all the more
fitting that Baker has become a TV star as host of ``Masterpiece
Theatre.'' In 1993, when PBS searched for Alistair Cooke's
successor, Christopher Lydon and others lobbied heroically for
Baker, one of the best-read reporters ever to meet a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Baker admired his fellow Virginian, Murray Kempton, the
columnist who set out in New York every day to take the luck of the
day. Writing in retirement, Baker hopes to ``take the luck of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In an ancient newspaper joke, a butler informs his employer that
``Some reporters are here to see you, sir, and a gentleman from The
Times (or Transcript or Tribune).'' He may still identify with the
typical Washington correspondent of his day, a dirty-fingernailed
hustler ``who services a string of small papers in the Gadsden
Purchase.'' But Russell Baker adorns this increasingly rude trade
because he is a true gentleman.

THESE OLD HANDS HAVE WORTHWHILE ADVICE ON OFFICIATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They didn't listen to him two decades ago because of who he is,
and they won't listen to him now.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Davis was right then, and he is right now.
</P>
<P>
   At a league meeting back when the late Pete Rozelle was NFL
commissioner, Davis threw out a bold proposal. But unfortunately,
no one listened. If they had, the league most likely wouldn't have
the problem it is having with game officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the league to build and fund a facility in the middle
of the country _ someplace like Dallas or St. Louis, a central
location _ to train the game officials,'' said Davis, the principal
owner of the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to have pro football's version of NASA. The
complex would have three or four football fields, living quarters.
It would be the headquarters for the officiating in our league.
Everything would be done out of there, not the league headquarters
in New York. We would still have part-time officials, but they
would have to spend a lot more time doing their job than they do
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the league did nothing about it. They want to control the
officials out of the league office in New York. I don't think that
is the best way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least once a month, I think every official in the league
should be brought up to speed on what is going on on the field
during games. You'd bring them into the central facility _ I called
it a training academy or something like that at the time _ on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both during the season and in the offseason, you bring the
officials in and work them out, in the field and in the classroom.
Meanwhile, you have a lot of young people who want to be officials
in the NFL training there trying to get good enough to work in our
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be regular film study and workouts _ actually
bring them out on the field and work on their positioning. Go over
every one of their calls individually. Go over all the bad calls
that have been made to see why things happen and how they can be
corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the many recent controversial calls, the league
office has raised the possibility of using instant replay for the
playoffs. Davis doesn't see that happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, there is no way they can get the votes for it
at this time in the season,'' he said. ``But we should have instant
replay. We should have a system that works.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bill) Parcells was right the other day when he said we as a
league should do everything we can to make sure the right call is
being made, and instant replay would certainly help. Howie Long
said the other day on TV that we have the technology to drop a bomb
from 45,000 feet out of a plane and down someone's chimney, but we
can't get technology to help make the right call?''
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm, the former Dallas Cowboys general manager and, like
Davis, one of the most creative minds in the history of the game,
is recognized as the father of instant replay in the NFL. He was
chairman of the Competition Committee and got it passed back in the
1980s when Rozelle was commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do bring instant replay back for the playoffs, I hope
they do not use what happens to judge using it in the future,''
said Schramm. ``Anything is better than what they have now, but the
NFL has to bring it back and use all of the electronic technology
available to make it better than ever in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare the electronic technology when we started
replay in the '80s to where it is today. Hell, you can't compare it
to seven years ago when they last used replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league should have instant replay. The problem we had when
I was there was that it was only voted in one year at a time. You
never had enough time to experiment to make it better for the
future. We were battling every year to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like to see happen is the league bring it back,
but with a five-year commitment. Not for a year at a time. Make a
long-term commitment and then bring in all of the best technicians
from the television industry as consultants on how the league could
best use what these people have developed in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``These officials are good people. They want to get the calls
right. But it is a tough job. When the league had replay, we did
not take the right approach. We used former game officials and
people out of the league office to be the replay official at 14
games around the league each week. We put a lot of people in jobs
they should not have been doing. We did not go out and get the best
people available. Like everything else, there are just some people
who would have a better aptitude for a job like this compared to
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Dallas, we had a coach name Ermal Allen. You
never saw a guy who could break down film, and make the right call
every time, as fast as he did it. He just had that knack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should develop a test to find this kind of a person, just
like they do when they test for astronauts. You test their
judgment, their reaction time. But most importantly, don't do
replay unless you are going to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners seem to be afraid of technology. This is not the
game of the 1940s and 1950s anymore. Officials could get away with
mistakes because that was before (games on) television and long
before replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many fans today do you think realize that the quarterback
has a transmitter in his helmet and they send all of the plays in
electronically? I bet no more than 10 percent would realize that.
Yet we've had it for years, and the owners didn't want it at first.
It is no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be impossible to put some kind of computer chip in a
football that would tell if the ball went across the goal line?
They have minicams in race cars and little cameras on the heads of
catchers in baseball. No one would have thought of these things 10
years ago, and now they are the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in this business nearly 60 years ago, the three
big sports in this country were baseball, horse racing, boxing.
Baseball is dying. And the other two are close to dead compared to
what they used to be. The NFL better realize that it might not
always be the great game it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Schramm told a little story that illustrates the plight of the
present official in the NFL:
</P>
<P>
   ``This was back a few years ago when we had instant replay. I
was talking with one of our game officials, and he told me that if
he made a bad call during a game and it cost the losing team that
game, he has the worst trip to the airport. The worst flight home.
The worst night's sleep. He said he welcomed replay to help because
it could change his mistake. All he wanted was to make the right
call. He didn't want to cost any team a game. The NFL should feel
the same way as a league.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Schramm realize that officiating in the league should
head in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with Tex the other day,'' said Davis. ``We talked
about the central training facility for officials. We talked about
it being the experimental laboratory for replay officials.
Officiating is so much a part of our game that we should do
everything we can to perfect it as much as we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you an example. We lost to Denver twice this year.
In those two games combined, the NFL told us that Denver scored
five touchdowns _ three in one game and two in another _ that
should have not been allowed if the right calls were made. That's
not me saying that, this is the NFL in the report that comes back
to us. I'm not saying we would have beaten Denver if those plays
were called right. That's not the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am trying to say is that if we trained the officials as
hard as we train the players, and we scouted and recruited the
officials as hard as we do to get the the best players, and then we
combined it with the best possible instant replay system, there is
no question that these things would make the officiating better
than it is now.''

IN HONDURAS, A HOSPITAL HAS FALLEN ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Normally at the Hospital Escuela, nine
elevators work. Now, only two of them do.
</P>
<P>
   A clock in the main lobby marks 8:37, but no one can remember
when it stopped running. Nearly everywhere along the white ceiling
panels of the country's largest medical facility are plate-sized
water stains. And a musty stench wafts through the narrow hallways
near the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   These, however, are the minor problems facing Honduras's only
teaching hospital, whose name in English means, ``school.'' Now,
almost two months after Hurricane Mitch barrelled through this
country with heavy winds and nearly four straight days of heavy
rains, the doctors, nurses and administrators here are finding
harder than ever to keep people healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more of everything,'' Carlos Bueso, the hospital's
44-year-old director, said Tuesday while sitting in his office,
filled with a pyramid of boxes of recently donated supplies. ``We
need more medicines and more doctors, but we especially need more
nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   As the country continues to rebuild itself after Mitch, health
officials are concerned that diseases such as cholera,
leptospirosis, malaria and dengue could spread to epidemic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, scores of medical teams are combing the cities and
countryside to examine and vaccinate residents. Tegucigalpa has
three other public hospitals, but Escuela remains the country's
main healthcare institution.
</P>
<P>
   Escuela, which opened 31 years ago, is a rambling,
salmon-colored structure that sits in the heart of the capital,
Tegucigalpa. As the country's population has grown, so has the
hospital, which now holds 1,500 beds and operates several
out-patient clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital treats about 4,500 patients a day, Bueso said. It
has about 250 staff physicians, 910 nurses and another 80
post-graduate residents.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the hurricane, Escuela's annual budget of about $12
million was running close to $1 million a month. That figure is
probably higher now, Bueso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take in patients from all over Honduras, most of them very
poor,'' he added. ``And on top of all that, we got hit with
Mitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the hospital has seen an increase in patients with
fevers, diarrhea and other symptoms typically associated with
exposure to contaminated mud and water, although not the kind of
large-scale epidemics that the government reportedly stated last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Escuela was hit hard by Mitch. The storm severely
damaged its water piping system and left it without usable water
for the first few days after the hurricane. Its supplies of
vaccines are running low.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the elevator problem, most of the staff and visitors
had to climb dimly lit stairs, while patients on gurneys and in
wheelchairs were forced to wait in long lines to get to their next
lab test or back to their rooms. Those patients who could walk made
their way slowly up the stairs, holding tightly to the metal
railing.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials don't know exactly how many people have died
at Escuela since Mitch. As of Tuesday, four children have died from
dengue, a mosquito-borne fever which, in its most serious form, can
cause pain and deadly hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   On the hospital's sixth floor, which serves male patients with
varying illnesses, four men lie in a room where beds are two feet
apart. There are no IVs, and the closest bathroom was in the main
hallway. The toilet and sink were backed up.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors scurried in white coats and sneakers, examining doe-eyed
boys and frail old men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to fill out all these forms just to get my patient into
surgery,'' said one young doctor. ``With all this bureaucracy and
the time we'll have to wait, he'll probably die.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of another hall, Mariano Lobo, 55, sat on the edge of
his bed next to a plastic bag filled with his clothes. After
arriving to the hospital two weeks ago with deungue-like symptoms,
he was feeling better and ready to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person next to me had the same symptoms, but he died,''
said Lobo, a watch repairman whose face, arms and eyes were still
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Rolando Galdanez, 42, another patient in the same room
who contracted malaria, fidgeted as he talked about the work he'd
missed over the last seven days that he has been in Escuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with pigs, so that's probably how I got sick,'' he
said. ``But I'm very bored in here and I need to get back to work.
I think I have to be more careful about the things I touch from now
on.''

CULTURAL RECIPES BRIGHTEN THIS YEAR'S COOKBOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life moves so fast it's hard to squeeze everything in _ even the
nightly family supper. Perhaps that's why this year's cookbooks
have a girl-next-door quality, offering volumes about familiar food
or enticing dishes integral to faraway cultures. As the century
rushes to a close, we seem drawn to slower times. In past years,
this emotion translated into nostalgia for, say, meatloaf and
mashed potatoes. Today's writers are more sophisticated, better
traveled, and less satisfied with the ordinary. Recipes might still
carry a homespun quality, but they're intriguing in the kitchen,
loaded with surprising flavors, yet true to their origins. These
days, someone else's mother, who might live at the end of a dirt
road in Turkey, Tunisia, or Thailand, is now invited to unravel
family fare for our dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   The new cultural aspect to cookbooks is one of the most exciting
elements of the modern kitchen. You can make a recipe using
ingredients you've used all your life, yet the way they're prepared
for the pot can teach you something new. An ingredient or technique
adapted to classics in your own repertory is a gift. Finding a
recipe that becomes a family ritual is worth the price of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The writer who practically invented cultural cookbook writing is
Paula Wolfert. After 30 years, she remains the master. Her sixth
book, ``Mediterranean Grains and Greens'' (HarperCollins, $27.50),
covers grains from the earliest civilizations and greens that might
have been collected by hunters and gatherers. Wolfert has a cult
following among restaurateurs because she can sift through the
markets in a foreign country and come up with the one ingredient
chefs will fall on. In ``Grains and Greens,'' she offers Maras
peppers from Turkey, which are delightfully smoky, and hot but not
fiery, and the Spanish paprika ``pimenton,'' made from peppers
dried over wood fires. Her main ingredients include nettles,
salsify greens, wild mustard, borage leaves, farro, couscous,
barley couscous, bulgur, and rice.
</P>
<P>
   The list does seems to add up to an odd stew but, stoveside,
``Grains and Greens'' is fascinating. Even if you aren't foraging
for greens before you begin, you do have to hunt for a superb
specialty market or Middle Eastern store because her seasonings are
what make this food exceptional. In her Spanish gratin of leafy
greens and crispy potatoes with smoky paprika and whipped eggs,
layers of sauteed greens go into the baking dish with sliced roast
potatoes and an egg custard. Seasoned with the Spanish pimenton,
the dish is beautiful _ mildly bitter, sweet, creamy, and smoky all
at once. Her tabbouleh is mostly salad with only a little grain,
seasoned with cinnamon, cumin, and Turkish red peppers. Mustard
greens with black-eyed peas, rice, and ground lamb was an
intriguing pilaf-style dish, simmered with tomato paste, red pepper
paste, and hot pepper flakes. Arugula, cabbage, and spinach, a
salad from Cyprus with cilantro and olives and plenty of lemon, is
delightfully tart. Wherever you open this book, you'll find some
exciting flavor or technique never written about before.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wolfert, Barbara Kafka just keeps getting better. Her
``Soup, A Way of Life'' (Artisan, $35) is part cookbook, part
culinary memoir, filled with stories of the important people in her
family: her grandmother Dora, poor but generous, willing to water
down the chicken soup to put one more plate at the table; her
grandmother Sara, who supported 13 children by running a bakery and
inn; her mother, Lilian, who served her father split-pea soup made
with laundry starch, so he was forced to hire a cook for the
family. ``When I am tired and want comfort,'' writes Kafka, ``when
I want to share happiness, or when I want flavor, my first desire
is soup.'' Recipes include Vietnamese chicken soup, Chinese chicken
in the pot, white bean soup with confit and tomato, Portuguese cod
soup. In the recipe for red Russian soup, Kafka explains that her
heritage is a long line of socialists rather than observant Jews,
so she prefers to make borscht with pork. You can also use beef
short ribs. It is an endless amount of work, but certainly worth
the effort.

   When Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid came to Boston last month
to lecture to the Culinary Historians of New England, Duguid
mentioned that Publishers Weekly had called the couple
``agricultural geeks.'' ``The name suits us perfectly,'' she said.
So it does. This husband-wife team travels several months of the
year, including long stretches with their two young sons, in search
of growing fields. Their subject this time took them through China,
Japan, India, and the Mediterranean. ``Seductions of Rice,'' by
Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid (Artisan, $35), is a comprehensive
guide to every major rice in the world, a cultural glance at the
way people in rice-eating regions live, at how they grow and
harvest the grain, feed their families, and spend their days.

   ``The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook,'' by Christopher Kimball
(Little, Brown, $27.95), recalls meals at a time when life in
America moved more slowly, when families had Sunday dinner after
church, and when no one had to guess what was in the food. Kimball
writes nostalgically about the yellow farmhouse he visited as a boy
in Vermont, near the country house he now owns with his wife and
four children. As in his magazine Cook's Illustrated, what you get
here are perfect renditions (with excrucriatingly exact
instructions) of very familiar recipes. What saves the book is that
they work (gorgeous baking powder biscuits among them) and they're
not altogether predictable.

   Legal Sea Foods threw its consulting chef Jasper White a book
party earlier this year and the food _ all from ``Lobster at Home''
(Scribner, $30) _ was fabulous. The foodie crowd dined on crunchy
lobster pad Thai, rich lobster tomalley toasts, hot Vietnamese
cabbage salad with lobster, and refreshing gazpacho with lobster.
``Lobster'' is White at his best. He understands this rich
crustacean and, as an adopted New Englander and former restaurant
owner, he brings a refreshing palate to some tired regional
specialties. His celebrated ``Jasper White's Cooking From New
England'' (Biscuit Books, $14.98) is a reprint, issued by a
division of Jessica's Biscuit of Newton. Creamy haddock chowder,
made with fresh and smoked fish, salt pork, and new potatoes,
garnished with chopped hard-cooked eggs and common crackers that
are split, buttered, and toasted, is the gold standard. At least in
my house.

   The traditional Jewish cooking of Joyce Goldstein's Crown
Heights, N.Y., childhood was turned upside down when she went to
live in Italy and happened to stay in an Italian Jewish home. What
it had in common with her family table, she writes in ``Cucina
Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish Kitchen (Chronicle Books,
$29.95), was watery chicken soup and dry meat. But it made
Goldstein curious to learn more about the Sephardic cooking of
Roman Jews, one of the oldest Jewish communities in the West. This
cuisine was established before the New World, so tomatoes, peppers,
and potatoes, foods that give the cuisine character today, were not
in the old recipes. But there was an affinity for the sweet-sour
foods that Arab traders brought, along with eggplant, pine nuts,
rice, raisins, and artichokes. Goldstein, who used to own Square
One restaurant in San Francisco, researched the cooking for years.
Some of it ended up on her restaurant menu, much adapted to modern
tastes. She felt obliged to shorten cooking times, she writes, add
more seasoning, and make the food delicious _ not just authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Authenticity has its shortcomings. It can sometimes drive the
cook away. I stuck with ``The Basque Table,'' by Teresa Barrenechea
with Mary Goodbody (Harvard Common Press, $22.95), because I know
the French Pays-Basque. Basques seem like cowboys, which is fitting
when you consider that they live, fairly isolated, in the
mountainous region of the Pyrenees. On the Atlantic side, the
coastline is very rugged, filled with fishing boats. The food lives
up to this coarse landscape, loaded as it is with oil, rich fish,
and meat. Nothing is particularly light, but it's all very good.
``The Basque Table'' offers the Spanish tradition. Barrenechea, who
comes from Bilbao, where the new Guggenheim Museum is located, owns
the Marichu restaurants in New York.

 &HT;    Crumble cookie rut with gift ideas from Web
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides the gifts we give to our nearest and dearest, the
holiday season presents an opportunity to show our appreciation and
give back something to the people we come in contact with every
day, who make a difference in our daily lives. From the security
guard who bids us good morning, to the waitress at the coffee shop,
the teller at the bank, the bus driver, mailman, parking lot
attendant, store clerk _ all familiar people who often make our day
with a smile but whom we may take for granted during the year.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours spent in a warm, cozy kitchen can yield gifts for
all these people and engender good feelings throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar kitchen gifts around the holidays include jams
and jellies, fudge, brownies, chocolate chip cookies and, of
course, fruitcake, mostly packaged in colorful tins. While these
more predictable homemade gifts are always appreciated, they may be
a bit ho-hum. With the help of the Internet, this may be the year
to think out of the box (or the tin, if you will) and go for the
squeal of delight instead of the polite, ``how thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of sites on the Internet offer innovative
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   You will find easy recipes for Crunchy Biscotti, Chocolate
Truffles, Almond Bark, Rum Balls and Peanut Brittle, all in
imaginative containers, listed at
http://www.systechcanada.com/christmas/gifts.html. If you are
determined to continue the fudge, brownie and cookie tradition,
that's fine, too, but how about varying the container from a tin to
a jar to add interest? At http://members.aol.com
</P>
<P>
   /kyrene/kitgifts.html you'll find directions and ideas for
putting baked goods in jars.
</P>
<P>
   To get away from the sweet stuff, take a look at
http://members.aol.com/kyrene/kitgifts.htmlEasy for easy-to-make
cheese spreads, glazed nuts and homemade vanilla extract.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual jams and jellies are featured at
http://soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/jams/index0.html, where you will
find things like garlic, horseradish and apricot-jalapeno jelly,
all guaranteed to be one-of-a-kind gifts.
</P>
<P>
   At http://secure.foodwine.com/food/egg/egg1096/slth1096.html
find a list of simple-to-put-together beverage mixes that you can
make from available ingredients. For instance, a cappuccino mix
needs only instant nondairy creamer, chocolate milk mix, instant
coffee, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. A few years ago, flavored oils
were a popular homemade gift. If you are thinking of going in that
direction, better check out http://www.news.uconn.edu/rel95422.htm,
which is a university study indicating the dangers in making
flavored oils that you may as well avoid.
</P>
<P>
   For the best-all-around site for kitchen gifts, we nominate 
http://www.kitchenlink.com/cgi/publicautoframes?dir &QC; holiday&AMP;page &QC; mer
rygifts. There are the requisite imaginative recipes, including
those for candies, jellies and liqueurs, but also articles from
newspapers and magazines on homemade gifts and information on
containers and precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you decide to make, you will know that a gift made in
the heart of the home, the kitchen, comes from the heart of the
giver.

   Cookbook author Barbara Kafka, who admits she frequently uses
canned beans, says that this soup gives good results in a hurry.
It's easy to put together using store-bought ingredients; she
recommends making the pesto sauce yourself, without nuts. But it,
too, can be picked up at a grocery store. Our tester notes it would
also be good pureed.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock or broth
</P>
<P>
   5 cups cooked small white beans, or two 19-ounce cans small
white beans, drained and rinsed

   A hearty filler for cold winter nights from Atlanta caterer
Robbin Churchill of To Dine For, this soup makes a good main course
for a gathering of friends.
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 cups cubed eggplant ( 1/2-inch cubes), about 1 large
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped fennel or celery
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground or crushed fennel seed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casing removed
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 29-ounce can heavy tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   In a 4-to-5-quart saucepan, heat 1/3 cup olive oil. Add the
eggplant and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Saute over medium-high heat,
stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until just tender.
Transfer the eggplant to a bowl. In the same pan, heat the
remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the onions, fennel or
celery, garlic, fennel seed, pepper, bay leaves, remaining teaspoon
of salt, basil and thyme. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring
frequently, for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the sausage and saute, breaking
up the meat into small pieces with a spoon. Add the chicken stock,
tomato puree, chopped tomatoes with their juice and the eggplant.
Cover and simmer 10-15 minutes. If the soup seems too thick, add
more stock. Remove bay leaves before serving.

   Retired caterer Linda Wible, who tends a community herb garden
in Buckhead, has been making this wonderfully rich stew for years.
She cooks soup at least once a week and shares the extra. It's her
holiday gift to neighbors, ladled out once a week throughout the
year. With this recipe, she recommends using thyme to add piquancy
without overwhelming the oysters. This stew makes a good first
course for an elegant dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, chopped (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 8-ounce bottle clam juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup white wine (optional if you want soup thinner)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh thyme or chives, or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried
</P>
<P>
   1 pint oysters
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley (for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   4 half-teaspoons butter (for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan, melt butter and add oil over medium-high
heat. When butter has melted, add onion and shallots and cook until
soft but not brown, about 3 minutes. Add flour to make a light
roux; cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, but do not brown.
Add salt, white pepper, cream (adjust quantity for desired
consistency of soup) and clam juice. If you'd like a thinner soup,
add the white wine. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until slightly
thickened, about 10 minutes. Add thyme or chives and oysters. Cook
oysters just until edges are curled, about 1 minute. To serve,
ladle soup into bowls and top with a sprinkling of chopped parsley
and a pat of butter. _ From Linda Wible

   Dill and almonds elevate the flavor of this soup above the
everyday, and bright colors give it a visual punch. Wild rice makes
it even more special. Wild rice is expensive (we paid $4.29 for the
12 ounces the recipe calls for), and some supermarkets may not
carry it. If you have trouble finding it, check out a farmers
market. Try to get hand-harvested rice; it has a softer texture and
subtler flavor than machine-harvested rice.

AMID MERGERS, N.E. ELECTRIC DOESN'T PLAN TO BE LEFT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does New England Electric System have the juice to compete in
the rapidly consolidating electric utility market?
</P>
<P>
   That's the big question following the formal announcement Monday
that BEC Energy, parent of Boston Edison Co., will acquire
Commonwealth Energy System for $950 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   New England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., is expected
to respond to the combination of its two big Massachusetts
counterparts by doing some shopping of its own, according to
industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England Electric has to look at other utilities in
high-density areas that can give them some cost advantages without
too many problems, while at the same time fielding inquiries from
out-of-state utilities that want a foothold in New England,'' said
Stephen Maloney, president of Devonrue Ltd., a Hingham consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sergel, New England Electric's chief executive, was not
available to comment Monday, according to a company spokesman. But
Sergel has said previously that his company, which serves 970,000
customers in 146 cities and towns in Massachusetts, will expand
through acquisitions. Like BEC Energy, New England Electric sees
its future as the predominant distributor of electricity in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Just how both large companies would compete _ BEC/Commonwealth
Energy together will have 1.3 million customers _ has fueled
renewed speculation of a possible deal between them. Such a
combination was considered more than 20 years ago but was rejected
as monopolistic.
</P>
<P>
   But much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   New rules took effect in March that will allow businesses and
eventually consumers to choose their electricity supplier much like
they pick a long-distance telephone company. Investor-owned
utilities have decided to exit the power generating business and
focus on providing services to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like BEC and New England Electric _ and state
regulators _ view mergers and acquisitions as a potential way to
lower rates by spreading costs over a larger base of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until 1994, regulators were skeptical about mergers and
acquisitions because the premium one company paid for another would
limit any benefits to consumers, so we looked at deals on a
case-by-case basis,'' said Janet Gail Besser, commissioner of the
state Department of Telecommunications and Energy, which regulates
utilities. ``But with competition, we recognize that combinations
of companies will reduce costs to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people believe the utility industry will consolidate
and the Boston Edison-Com/Energy deal is the first step,'' said
John Stephens, president of Boston-based Eastern Utilities
Associates, which serves about 200,000 customers in Southeastern
Massachusetts and 100,000 customers in Rhode Island. ``In fact, we
have said publicly that we too are open to a merger or
acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike California, which is served by just three investor-owned
electric utilities, Massachusetts has six investor-owned companies
and more than 30 small municipal-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, the consultant, maintains New England Electric may
consider some of the municipal firms or some of the other
investor-owned utilities in Massachusetts such as Eastern Utilities
_ deals that would expand the company's customer base with
relatively few problems.
</P>
<P>
   Larger potential candidates from outside the Bay State would
present New England Electric with significant hurdles, adds
Maloney. Central Maine Power, for example, recently said that
Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. had backed out of a deal to purchase its
generating plants. United Illuminating Co. of New Haven is burdened
by a high cost structure and aging electric generation facilities.
</P>
<P>
   And the big wild card is Northeast Utilities, New England's
largest electric company with operations spread across western
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. The Berlin,
Conn.-based company has been hobbled by financial, operational, and
regulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England Electric is in a good position as one of the
strongest and best run companies, but they want to be the acquiring
company, not the acquiree,'' said Stephen M. Tuleja, president of
Alternate Power Source Inc., a Westwood energy broker.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Monday, BEC Energy will pay $950
million, or $44.10 a share, for Commonwealth Energy, based in
Cambridge, Mass., and assume $600 million in debt.

</P>
<P>
   Roasted Red Pepper Soup With Corn Bread Croutons
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 55 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Silky smooth and richly flavored, this soup lets you enjoy
garden goodness even in dreary winter weather. Its colors _ deep
red, dotted with green marjoram _ make it especially nice for a
holiday meal.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 small potato, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped marjoram, plus extra for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 large red bell peppers, roasted and coarsely chopped
(procedure follows)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sweet paprika
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly milled pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 quart water or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   Balsamic vinegar to taste
</P>
<P>
   Corn bread croutons (procedure follows)
</P>
<P>
   To roast peppers: Cut off the top of the peppers, then slice
them in half lengthwise, remove the seeds and veins and press down
on each half to flatten. Brush the skins with olive oil, then set
them, skin side up, on a cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees or broil
5 to 6 inches under the heating element until the skins are
blistered and charred, about 15-20 minutes. Remove peppers, stack
on top of each other and place in covered bowl or plastic bag to
let steam for 15 minutes. Rub off the skins and discard them.
</P>
<P>
   For croutons: Cube a couple of pieces of room-temperature corn
bread and place on a cookie sheet at 200 degrees. Bake about 15
minutes, or until dry throughout. To save time, we bought corn
bread from a restaurant rather than baking our own, then followed
the steps above for turning it into croutons. It worked just fine.
</P>
<P>
   For soup: Heat the oil in a soup pot and add onion, potato,
garlic, bay leaf and marjoram. Saute over high heat, stirring
often, until potato and onion begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Add
tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Add the peppers, paprika and 1
teaspoon salt. Pour in the water or stock and scrape the bottom of
the pot. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, partially
covered, for 25 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and blend the soup
until smooth. Taste for salt, season with pepper and add a teaspoon
or so of vinegar. Put croutons and a sprinkling of chopped marjoram
on top. _ Adapted from Deborah Madison's ``Vegetarian Cooking for
Everyone'' (Broadway Books, $40)

   Potato, Escarole and Country Ham Soup
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 48
minutes
</P>
<P>
   Another colorful soup, this one combines a traditional Southern
favorite, country ham, with some unexpected ingredients. Get the
best ham you can find, because its taste figures so prominently in
the soup. The ground black pepper really pops the flavors in this
soup.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 leek, white and light green portions, washed and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk celery, trimmed and diced
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (about 8 ounces) escarole, cleaned and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced country ham
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Heat the butter in a soup pot over low heat; add the onion,
leek, celery and garlic and stir until they are evenly coated with
butter. Cover the pot and cook until tender and translucent, 6 to 8
minutes. Add the broth, potatoes and thyme. Simmer the soup until
the potatoes are beginning to disintegrate, 15 to 20 minutes. Add
the escarole and diced ham and simmer the soup for another 12 to 15
minutes, or until all ingredients are tender. Add salt and generous
amounts of pepper to taste. Serve in a heated soup tureen or
individual bowls. _ From the Culinary Institute of America's ``An

   Pretty is as pretty does, and this soup, courtesy of dick &AMP;
harry's restaurant in Roswell, is pretty delicious as well as
good-looking, with its coral-pink apple garnish over a
pumpkin-colored puree. The soup can be blended until very smooth,
or left slightly chunky. It also can be made ahead and frozen. If
you're going to freeze it, don't add the cream.
</P>
<P>
   Spiced apples:
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise
</P>
<P>
   2 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean split in half or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups maraschino cherry juice (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 medium apples (Fuji, Mitsu, McIntosh or Cortland), peeled,
cored and quartered
</P>
<P>
   Soup:
</P>
<P>
   5 pounds (3 or 4) butternut squash
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions
</P>
<P>
   3 leeks
</P>
<P>
   5 ribs celery
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 gallon chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon mace, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup molasses, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 cups warmed heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   For the spiced apples: Blend spices, juice and sugar in medium
saucepan. Bring to a boil and turn off heat. Add apples and let
cool while preparing soup.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can use the juice from two 16-ounce jars of maraschino
cherries and return the juice to the jars after using with the
apples.
</P>
<P>
   For the soup: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cut squash in half
and remove seeds and strings. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick
cooking spray and roast the squash, cut side down, for 45 minutes
or until tender.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, saute the onion, leeks and celery in a small
amount of oil in a heavy stockpot until the vegetables are
transparent, about 7 minutes. Scoop out the squash and add to the
pot, discarding the skins. Add the chicken stock and mace. Simmer
until all the vegetables are tender. In a food processor, puree the
soup in batches and return to the pot. Add molasses and salt and
pepper and adjust the seasonings. Stir in the cream. Drain the
apples and garnish each serving with 1 quarter-apple. _ From Harold
Marmulstein, chef of dick &AMP; harry's restaurant in Roswell

   Cookbook author Barbara Kafka, who admits she frequently uses
canned beans, says that this soup gives good results in a hurry.
It's easy to put together using store-bought ingredients; she
recommends making the pesto sauce yourself, without nuts. But it,
too, can be picked up at a grocery store. Our tester notes it would
also be good pureed.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock or broth
</P>
<P>
   5 cups cooked small white beans, or two 19-ounce cans small
white beans, drained and rinsed

stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until just tender.
Transfer the eggplant to a bowl. In the same pan, heat the
remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the onions, fennel or
celery, garlic, fennel seed, pepper, bay leaves, remaining teaspoon
of salt, basil and thyme. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring
frequently, for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the sausage and saute, breaking
up the meat into small pieces with a spoon. Add the chicken stock,
tomato puree, chopped tomatoes with their juice and the eggplant.
Cover and simmer 10-15 minutes. If the soup seems too thick, add
more stock. Remove bay leaves before serving.

   Retired caterer Linda Wible, who tends a community herb garden
in Buckhead, has been making this wonderfully rich stew for years.
She cooks soup at least once a week and shares the extra. It's her
holiday gift to neighbors, ladled out once a week throughout the
year. With this recipe, she recommends using thyme to add piquancy
without overwhelming the oysters. This stew makes a good first
course for an elegant dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, chopped (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 8-ounce bottle clam juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup white wine (optional if you want soup thinner)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh thyme or chives, or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried
</P>
<P>
   1 pint oysters
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley (for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   4 half-teaspoons butter (for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan, melt butter and add oil over medium-high
heat. When butter has melted, add onion and shallots and cook until
soft but not brown, about 3 minutes. Add flour to make a light
roux; cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, but do not brown.
Add salt, white pepper, cream (adjust quantity for desired
consistency of soup) and clam juice. If you'd like a thinner soup,
add the white wine. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until slightly
thickened, about 10 minutes. Add thyme or chives and oysters. Cook
oysters just until edges are curled, about 1 minute. To serve,
ladle soup into bowls and top with a sprinkling of chopped parsley
and a pat of butter. _ From Linda Wible

   Dill and almonds elevate the flavor of this soup above the
everyday, and bright colors give it a visual punch. Wild rice makes
it even more special. Wild rice is expensive (we paid $4.29 for the
12 ounces the recipe calls for), and some supermarkets may not
carry it. If you have trouble finding it, check out a farmers
market. Try to get hand-harvested rice; it has a softer texture and
subtler flavor than machine-harvested rice.

   Melt butter in large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add celery,
carrots, onions and almonds and cook until slightly softened,
stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Mix in dill, bay leaves and
turmeric. Bring 3 quarts of stock, wild rice and white rice to boil
in large pot. Reduce heat. Add celery mixture and simmer 30
minutes, adding more stock if soup is too thick. Add chicken and
mushrooms. Discard bay leaves and simmer 10 minutes or until
chicken and mushrooms are heated through. Salt and pepper to taste.

 &HT;    Spoonfuls of hearty nourishment add a festive fillip to the
holidays
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tired, hungry man walks into a village. By the time he leaves
the next day, he's wrangled a soft bed, an evening of good cheer
and a hearty meal _ all courtesy of a promise to make soup.
</P>
<P>
   Potent stuff, that Stone Soup.
</P>
<P>
   The power of soup is more than folklore, though. Think about the
healing taste of chicken soup, the camaraderie of sharing a pot of
chili and a Falcons win, even the souped-up recipe enhancements of
the ubiquitous canned cream of mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   Comforting stuff, soup.
</P>
<P>
   Comforting for the cook, too. After the rigors of preparing a
multi-course Thanksgiving dinner, there's something seductively
simple about just fixing soup for a crowd _ even potions as dressed
up for holiday entertaining as shiitake mushroom and artichoke or
wild rice soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes me feel cozy,'' says Barbara Kafka, author of
``Soup: A Way of Life'' (Artisan, $35). ``It's loving and
undemanding. Somehow the food itself says, `I'll take care of you,'
which is pretty good for a food.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good, indeed. Kafka's book lists a couple of soups as
day-after-the-party hangover remedies, for those brave enough to
slurp up menudo or onion soup on a queasy stomach.
</P>
<P>
   But before overindulging, think about another benefit of soup:
It's filling. Serve it as a first course, and diners might be less
likely to overeat during the rest of the meal _ a welcome gift to
them during the holiday party season.
</P>
<P>
   Consider serving a rich oyster stew to start a New Year's Eve
dinner, or, for Christmas Eve, a festively colored roasted red
pepper soup. Save chicken noodle soup and other home-
</P>
<P>
   style fare for dreary January and February; now's the season to
dazzle, to spoon in the wild rice, wild mushrooms, fresh herbs and
seafood with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Best yet, such soups aren't as complicated to make as they
sound. ``If you can boil water, you can make soup,'' promises
Kafka. ``Soup is very relaxed cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also very tolerant cooking, ``Seinfeld's'' Soup Nazi
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Don't have time to make chicken stock? Use canned, low-sodium
broth. Feel like experimenting? Try wild mushrooms instead of
buttons, pumpkin instead of butternut squash, seafood instead of
chicken or beef. Make a mistake? Chances are it won't be noticeable
or can be fixed by adding more ingredients and enlarging the
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   If soup's the main course, it's even easier to throw a
get-together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a huge pot of soup on the stove, and everyone helps
themselves,'' says Jenny Levison, who recently opened the
from-scratch soup restaurant Souper Jenny's in Buckhead. ``You make
a salad, and that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Easiest of all _ convince your guests to bring the ingredients,
while you supply the stockpot, the water, the fire and a nice,
smooth stone.
</P>

TORAH DETECTIVE TAKES ORTHODOX APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only in New York could there be a cop like Mordecai
Dzikansky.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever anyone steals a Torah in this town, Dzikansky is the
guy who roams the rambling backstreets of Brooklyn and the Lower
East Side, goes undercover, snares the thief, and recovers the
missing treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Dzikansky, 36, is chief detective of the New York Police
Department's Torah Task Force. And New York, whose metropolitan
area is home to one-third of the nation's 6 million Jews, is the
only city in America that could support such a crime-fighting unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah _ the parchment scroll containing the first five Books
of the Old Testament, known as the Five Books of Moses,
painstakingly inscribed in Hebrew _ is the most sacred object in
any Jewish synagogue and the centerpiece of its religious services.
</P>
<P>
   A fine Torah, handwritten over the course of a year by a trained
scribe and emblazoned with crowns and breastplates made of inlaid
silver and gold, is worth more than $25,000, in some cases much
more.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Dzikansky noted, ``every few years, there's a rash of
Torah thefts.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force came into being six years ago, when 15 Torahs
were stolen over nine months from synagogues all over the city, as
well as from such facilities as Mount Sinai Hospital and the Jewish
Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Dzikansky, a 16-year police veteran, was brought in on the case
for obvious reasons. He is a practicing Orthodox Jew. His father,
now retired, was for many years a prominent rabbi at Yeshiva
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were left to an average police officer, they wouldn't
know where to begin,'' said Lieutenant George Pagan, commanding
officer of the four-man task force and of the Midtown North
detective squad, where the task force works.
</P>
<P>
   Dzikansky knew the city's Jewish community, especially the
insular world of the second-hand Judaica shops concentrated in the
tiny Orthodox enclaves around Essex and Hester streets on
Manhattan's Lower East Side, in the Williamsburg and Borough Park
sections of Brooklyn, and Kew Gardens in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in these shops are very legitimate,''
Dzikansky said. ``But some of them, I wouldn't buy a sandwich
from.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most celebrated Torah-theft busts, some of these
secondhand dealers served as middlemen between the robbers and the
innocent purchasers, who were usually in Israel, where an expanding
number of synagogues provided a ready-made market.
</P>
<P>
   The shop owners, decent and corrupt alike, were a tough bunch to
penetrate _ old men with beards who eye even non-Orthodox Jews,
much less gentile police officers, with hostile suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Dzikansky, by dint of his background, could gain their trust.
</P>
<P>
   One problem in tracking down stolen Torahs, especially if the
suspected thief is Jewish, is that the Torah, which Orthodox Jews
read literally as God's word, forbids testifying against a fellow
Jew in a secular court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a wall we face,'' Dzikansky said.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike just about any other New York detective, Dzikansky
knew a way around the wall.
</P>
<P>
   By the same Jewish law, he noted, ``the Torah is considered as
holy as a human life. You're allowed to do whatever is possible to
rescue a human life that's been kidnapped. So that pushes aside the
prohibition about testifying against another Jew. It's a powerful
tool. There's not a rabbi who can argue with that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as the Torah Task Force became widely known among the
dealers, they grew more hesitant to take in goods that seemed
remotely hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you came in eight years ago and tried to sell a Torah,
there'd be no problem,'' Dzikansky said. ``Now, they'd be more
apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The first cases that the task force cracked, the spate of 15
thefts in 1992-93, all turned out to be the work of one thief. He
was not caught until early 1996, and then by pure luck, or as
Dzikansky put it with a smile, ``divine intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   The thief, Richard Stevens, was caught trying to break into a
room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which is in a part of town
covered by the Midtown North detective squad. Dzikansky, who works
there as a general detective when he's not solving Torah thefts,
happened to be in on the arrest and the debrief.
</P>
<P>
   When he started routinely asking about knowledge of other
crimes, Stevens admitted to stealing all those Torahs. He also
named the fence who put him up to the thefts and sold the
merchandise to dealers. The fence was a Hasidic Jew named Markus
``Morty'' Fogel, who ran a silver shop on West 47th Street, the
heart of the diamond district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished that a Jew could do this,'' Dzikansky
recalled. ``That someone who understands the significance of a
Torah could desecrate it by stealing one _ it's reprehensible to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force set up a sting operation, wiring Stevens and
sending him to Fogel with a Torah to sell. Fogel took the bait, the
arrest was made, both pleaded guilty, and were sent to prison.
Stevens was recently released.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent case, which took place just last October,
involved two Torahs stolen from a synagogue in Englewood, N.J. By
now, the task force's operations have become so routine, it took
just two weeks to solve.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Englewood police department called the task force in
for help. Then, its members _ among them Detective Mitchell Parker
and Sergeant Brian McCabe _ made the rounds and the phone calls,
alerting dealers and others to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   When one source called back to say he had just been offered two
Torahs, Dzikansky set up a meeting place, went there dressed up as
a rabbi, and offered to buy the Torahs for $30,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a bargain,'' he said with a laugh. Each of them
was worth over $40,000. The transaction was made, then the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The seller, it turned out, was also the thief. ``He'd rehearsed
a story of how he came to have the Torahs,'' Dzikansky said. It
belonged to a friend in Israel who died, the story went, and his
family needed the money. ``To a layman, it would have sounded
convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force had an easy time making a criminal case because
both Torahs had been treated with unique markings by the Universal
Torah Registry.
</P>
<P>
   The registry was the brainchild of David Pollock, head of the
Jewish Community Relations Council, a New York-based organization
that regularly works with the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock came up with the idea in 1980, during an earlier spate
of Torah thefts, but it took several years to take hold, until a
panel of scientists figured out a way to mark the parchment without
defacing it. (A Torah consists of 60 sections sewn together; the
technique involved making 30 nearly invisible markings along the
seams.)
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of rabbis, worldwide, are registering their
Torahs, making it easier for police to recover stolen scrolls and
to prove where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the registry, it would be hard to prove that this is
the Torah the guy stole because you could say all Torahs look
alike,'' Dzikansky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market for used Torahs is fairly limited to begin with,''
Pollock added. ``So if you can convince people that it is hard to
sell a stolen Torah, you have most of the battle won.''

WHERE WHITEWATER GUSHED, DIRT REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLIPPIN, Ark. _ This is the land that time and Kenneth Starr
forgot.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress drives this week toward a historic vote on whether
to impeach the president, the Whitewater Estates development that
started it all is nowhere on the agenda, nowhere in the independent
counsel's report, nowhere but here.
</P>
<P>
   In the national conversation, the only remnant is the Whitewater
name, used as shorthand to suggest presidential misdeeds, though
even that has been supplanted by the more salacious ``Lewinsky
affair.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Washington and the rest of the country have moved on,
anticipating a rendezvous with destiny over a rendezvous with an
intern, this Ozark Mountain home to 1,364 souls remains in its own
idiosyncratic orbit, stubbornly resistant to change yet in some
ways altered forever by its brush with notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all got caught up in something political, and it ruined the
deal for us, as far as privacy is concerned,'' said Whitewater
resident John Lauramoore, who has become the answer to a Whitewater
trivia question as the owner of the only home the Clintons ordered
built on the property.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Flippin Police Sergeant Tom Fleming, continues to
marvel that ``so much was made over a bunch of dirt and scrub. I
mean, it's two ticks and a rock, is all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a bit more than that: all 44 lots in the 230-acre
development have been sold _ the last one just a few months ago _
and the going rate has been around $1,000 an acre, though some
riverfront property is worth much more. Pitted dirt roads are the
only way around. To call it inhospitable is to be kind.
</P>
<P>
   But once, in the minds of Bill and Hillary Clinton, it was going
to be so much more. And once, in the eyes of Starr and his
prosecutors, it was Exhibit A in the unmaking of a president.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Whitewater goes through Flippin, a four-hour drive
north from Little Rock. The winding, undulating route glances past
the town of Toad Suck and plows directly through Clinton, Ark. It's
a lot farther from Hope, the town as well as the concept.
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile into town is a banner with the official slogan:
``Welcome to Flippin. A Place for All Seasons.'' Pontoon boats fill
some driveways, pickup trucks rule the road, and Confederate flags
snap in the wind, some with a woven patch that reads: ``I ain't
coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime is low and unemployment is lower. There are more jobs than
people, in fact, as long as factory work doesn't offend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains popular, and almost everyone seems to have a
story of meeting him _ at a Chamber of Commerce dinner, during a
campaign stop, at a leadership breakfast, at a high school
graduation. ``Bill Clinton could be reelected governor of Arkansas
tomorrow, and I'm a Republican,'' said Ron Lechtenberger, an
accountant from nearby Mountain Home.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists still come to town to see what all the fuss was about,
but the pace has slowed to a trickle. ``Just about two a month
nowadays. They want to tell their friends they saw Whitewater, but
all they see is trees and rocks,'' said John Thompson, clerk at the
101 Handy Mart near the development.
</P>
<P>
   There once was a sign at the entrance to Whitewater, but someone
stole it several years ago, said Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a nice little town,'' insists Brenda Young,
Flippin's clerk-treasurer. ``Whitewater put us on the map, but we
pretty much take it all in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy to say now, with the Arkansas grand jury having
closed up shop _ after 15 criminal convictions _ and Starr saying
last month he had developed no proof of impeachable offenses by
Clinton related to Arkansas activities. Some interpreted it as
exoneration of Clinton on Whitewater, but Starr said he would still
pursue wrongdoing by Clinton on land issues. Still, Whitewater
won't be Waterloo or Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   The story, briefly, dates to 1978. The Clintons, while Bill was
attorney general, teamed up with political friends Jim and Susan
McDougal to make money in what is known affectionately here as the
dirt business.
</P>
<P>
   The partners borrowed $203,000 to buy the land, most of it from
the Citizens Bank &AMP; Trust in Flippin. Shaped vaguely like an
elephant's trunk, the Whitewater site is at the junction of the
White River, famous for trout, and Crooked Creek, renowned for
bass. The partners carved out roads and awaited buyers, using
Flippin real estate agent Chris Wade as their chief salesman.
</P>
<P>
   But their timing couldn't have been worse. When interest rates
hit the high teens, Arkansas vacation homes became untouchable,
even at prices below well below $40,000. To spur sales, the
partners had a prefabricated home built on Lot 13, but even that
didn't help much. That home, dubbed the ``Hillary House,'' is the
one now owned by Lauramoore and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   One month after winning the White House, the Clintons sold their
remaining interest to McDougal for $1,000. The First Family
estimated its Whitewater losses at $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr, the question was whether the project was an ill-fated
real estate deal or an illicit way to funnel money to the
ambition-rich but dollar-poor Clintons. Similar suspicions drew
Starr to scrutinize a later, larger McDougal development outside
Little Rock, called Castle Grande, financed by loans from the
Madison Guarantee Savings and Loan Association.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, founded by McDougal, failed in 1989, at a cost to
taxpayers of more than $65 million. The investigation by Starr
included questions of whether fraud played a role and whether
Clinton, as president, tried to block Starr's inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Whitewater investigation never reached the president,
among those convicted were the McDougals and one local player:
Wade, the real estate broker and one of Flippin's most prominent
citizens. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison after pleading
guilty in 1995 to bankruptcy fraud and making a false loan
application; he said he entered the plea only because the
independent prosecutor wore down his will to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wade is out of prison now, back at work at his Ozark Realty Co.
on Main Street. On the wall inside is a framed plot plan of
Whitewater Estates. Next to it is evidence of a moneymaking scheme
Wade dreamed up when the media hordes descended: ``dirt deeds''
signed by the McDougals that entitle the bearer to one cubic foot
of Whitewater dirt. Price: $19.95, shovels extra.
</P>
<P>
   Wade has sold dozens of the deeds, but other than that,
``nothing good has come out of any of this,'' said Darla Pemberton,
an agent in Wade's office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has few fans here, and others are even more harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a simple land deal that shouldn't have made the
front page of the local Yellville newspaper and turned it into a
multiyear, multimillion-dollar investigation,'' said local banker
Ron Proctor, who oversaw the Whitewater loan for more than a decade
and eventually testified about it to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the development, the Lauramoores end their day by
cozying up in front of the television in the Hillary House. It is a
modest, three-bedroom home, with wood-paneled walls and furniture
longer on comfort than style. They paid $28,000 a decade ago;
though it was sold by the Clintons, the Lauramoores said they dealt
only with Wade, the broker.
</P>
<P>
   A large man in bib overalls, John Lauramoore sat back in a
chair, spat some tobacco and complained about the media, the
government, and the loss of privacy. Then he offered a comment that
could apply not just to himself but also to the Clintons, the
McDougals, the town of Flippin, and even to Starr:
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out for us to be a complete flop, for what we
wanted, what we thought it would be. Nothing but trouble. More
trouble than it's worth.''

NUN ARTFULLY BEARS CROSS OF CRITIC'S FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her assistant prefers not to meet at the hotel restaurant
because he worries that fans would interrupt too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to meet her, it seems,'' said David Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   This sought-after celebrity is not a movie or music star. She's
a Roman Catholic nun who lives with an order of sisters in England
who spend most of their lives cloistered in a country monastery.
</P>
<P>
   But Sister Wendy Beckett _ with her trademark smile and
ankle-length black habit _ has emerged from behind monastery walls
to possibly become the most unlikely and famous television art
critic of our time.
</P>
<P>
   She has starred in three British television series about art,
the most recent of which, ``Sister Wendy's Story of Painting,'' was
broadcast last year in the United States and has won her a loyal
and growing following here.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Wendy was recently in Boston, where she spent several
days at the Museum of Fine Arts on a new project for US public
television focusing on six great American museums. The series of
six one-hour programs on museums in New York, Los Angleles,
Cleveland, Chicago, Boston, and Fort Lauderdale will be aired
sometime in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got an awful lot of good stuff,'' said Sister Wendy,
68, when asked why she chose the MFA as one of the great US
museums. ``It's a wonderfully thought-out museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Wendy seems a bit perplexed, even bothered by her growing
renown. She doesn't enjoy traveling to make television programs or
to promote her books, including her latest, ``Sister Wendy's
Nativity.''
</P>
<P>
   She would be just as happy, she says, leading a secluded,
anonymous life in her trailer on the grounds of the Carmelite
monastery in Quindenham in Norfolk, England. ``But this is what God
intends for me to do and so if this is the cross I must bear, so be
it,'' said Sister Wendy, who uses a wheelchair because of her
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Her celebrity happened quite by accident. Sister Wendy had
written about art for British newspapers and magazines for years,
and was asked in 1991 to participate in a program on the National
Gallery by the British Broadcast Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, as she tells it, one of the network's executives said
to other network officials: ``The only one we understood was Sister
Wendy. Give her a series.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Wendy's plainspoken but well-informed commentaries have
fueled her popularity. That style, along with her rapturous and
sometimes quite sensuous descriptions of the sexual overtones of
famous masterpieces, have Sister Wendy in high demand on the
lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has got the capacity to respond to art,'' she said,
sitting in a quiet corner of a Back Bay hotel lobby during a break
from studying the MFA's collection of American decorative arts.
``Great art is about beauty, about being open to life. Art can free
us from the prison of our involvement in day-to-day concerns. It
can, at least for a moment, transport us to another dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sister Wendy doesn't want her work as an art critic
regarded as having religious overtones, she does see a connection
between art and God. ``If I can show people what art truly is, they
have come nearer to God because, after all, God is beauty and
truth,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She was never tempted, she said, to become an artist or art
professional instead of a nun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born wanting to be a nun,'' she says. ``I wish I could
tell you why, but I can't. I just don't remember ever having to
decide what I wanted to do with my life. But I wouldn't recommend
it today. I would recommend young girls need to experience a bit of
life before making such a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she belongs to a cloistered order, Sister Wendy had to
get permission from the other sisters to travel the world promoting
art. ``They have been enormously supportive and encouraging,'' she
said. ``As I get older and as I move around I feel closer and
closer to God. I have never wavered about the choices I have made.
To be surrounded by such beautiful things and to have God. I am a
very lucky woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion Notes
</P>
<P>
   Facing a growing shortage of priests, the Canadian Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton may have to close as many as half
of its 166 parishes.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese, which covers much of the province of Alberta
and has about 300,000 Catholics, is dealing with the same critical
issue affecting the Catholic church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a phenomenon that is hitting every diocese in
North America and Western Europe,'' said John Acheson, author of a
110-page report, ``Faithful into the Future,'' which makes the
recommendations on closing half the Edmonton archdiocese's
parishes.
</P>
<P>
   With only 79 priests serving 166 parishes, Mass in some churches
is said only once or twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ecumenical News International, the Geneva-based
religion news agency, the recommendations have been accepted by
Archbishop Joseph MacNeil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to move ahead with the recommendations,'' Acheson
told reporters in Canada. ``At the same time,'' he added, this is
not to be seen as a crisis for us. I think society is changing, so
our church has to change.''

PUBLIC SCHOOL ON PRIVATE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts is spending hundreds of millions of public dollars
a year to close the spending gap between rich and poor school
districts. But in the end, the haves find ways to retain their
advantage over the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Brookline High School kicked off a fund-raising
campaign with a tony $10,000-a-head cocktail party for some of its
most illustrious _ read, affluent _ alumni. The goal is to create a
$10 million endowment.
</P>
<P>
   A $10 million endowment? For a public school? Do we really think
this is what Horace Mann had in mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel we'll ever bridge the gap between rich and poor
because you are never going to end one-upsmanship,'' said William
Samaras, the principal of Lowell High School, who admires the
initiative of Brookline High headmaster Robert Weintraub even as he
envies his roster of rich alums.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising drive in Brookline is just the latest move
among many that is effectively privatizing public education in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee for Parental Choice in Education in Massachusetts
this week fell only 2,000 signatures shy of the 57,100 required for
a ballot question on the use of public funds for private schools.
The broad support for such a voucher program reflects a national
trend: A majority of Americans tell Gallup pollsters they favor the
use of tax money to pay for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy time to be a public school administrator, even
in Brookline. Tempting as it might be to dismiss Brookline's
endowment drive as yet another scheme to help the rich get richer,
the realities of education funding are not that simple. When the
courts ordered Massachusetts to equalize public funding for
education in 1993, wealthier communities saw their share of state
money shrink as resources were redirected to long-neglected, more
impoverished cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good thing, to correct the imbalance and send the
money to Holyoke and Chelsea and Lowell and Lawrence. I support
that, but the reality is it left me in Brookline with declining
resources in an extremely demanding community'' says Weintraub.
``To do more things with less money, I need to find new
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But, given the unequal distribution of millionaires
in the Commonwealth, headmasters in places like Brookline
inevitably will have more and deeper wells to tap than principals
in places like Lowell. An endowment drive might yield big bucks in
Brookline, but how would a similar effort fare in Athol or Fall
River?
</P>
<P>
   Former governor Michael S. Dukakis is one of the Brookline grads
who traded quips with Conan O'Brien, the late-night television talk
show host (Class of '81) and Mike Wallace, the ``60 Minutes''
correspondent (Class of '35) at the endowment kickoff party Monday
night. There is an equity issue only if other school systems fail
to follow Brookline's lead, Dukakis insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every community has its proud, successful graduates,'' Dukakis
contended. ``I will be disappointed if this idea doesn't spread to
other cities and towns. This is not a substitute for state aid,
fairly distributed, but why shouldn't we do all we can to support
our schools?''
</P>
<P>
   The $50 million in state funds that the Massachusetts Education
Reform Act has directed to Lowell in the last few years has gone a
long way toward redressing years of neglect, but Samaras says
principals in poorer communities still have to hustle to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``No principal can sit around and wait for his superintendent to
tell him what his budget is. I have to get out there and raise
money to keep competitive. Bob Weintraub is smart to do what he's
doing. Public schools today are competing with charter schools,
with parochial schools, with vouchers, with the public's negative
image of public schools. Could I use a $10 million endowment out
here? Sure I could.''
</P>
<P>
   A $10 million endowment is pocket change compared to the
endowments of many elite Massachusetts prep schools, of course. The
endowment of Phillips Academy in Andover alone is a stunning $367
million, larger than that of many colleges. And alumni associations
and private foundations have always raised money to supplement
local public school budgets and to pay for scholarships for local
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Weintraub has much more ambitious plans than a kitty to
pay for extra school supplies or field trips. He wants to endow
faculty chairs, to allow teachers to take sabbaticals to write
books or to further their education. He wants to expand the school
day to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the private schools.

   WASHINGTON _ I am a bit old for this sort of thing, but if I
were to be asked for a Christmas list this year, my top wish would
be that the Monica Lewinsky affair could be erased from the 1998
calendar. That, of course, is not to be. The issue is with us. We
members of the House of Representatives will make a stab at
reaching a decision on impeachment by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   If I were granted a second wish, it would be that we stick to
the facts and not political fantasies as we work to resolve
something that has become a tumor in our society. No one is
comfortable here in Washington these days. We feel sullied and
sidetracked, our loyalties stretched to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fight the problem, decide it,'' George C. Marshall used
to say. It can become oddly enjoyable raking over the details,
lamenting the moral lapses. It helps sidestep the unadorned
thinking required to decide tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   But decide we must, and in a larger sense the main issue is how
to heal, rather than further divide, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Far wiser heads than mine have devoted considerable thought to
the legal and ethical ramifications of impeachment. But all eyes
will probably be on the members of the House next week, when the
issue is likely to go to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   God willing, I will be there. I intend to vote against
impeachment. This may seem a bit premature, since the Judiciary
Committee has yet to send an article of impeachment to the entire
House. But the prosecution has presented its case and given us the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there was conduct unbecoming, and I deplore it. If a
plant manager in the company I used to work for engaged in such
conduct, we would have disciplined him immediately. Maybe even
dismissed him. But we wouldn't have burned him at the stake.
</P>
<P>
   Of course morals and decency and the laws we live by are all
important. But can anyone argue that these threads are made
stronger if we dismiss someone from office instead of issuing a
strong rebuke?
</P>
<P>
   What we are facing is a practical, pre-ordained outcome. Since
there are insufficient votes to impeach in the Senate, President
Clinton will not be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   We may wish it were otherwise. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, this case should not be compared to judgments in
the military or other walks of life. Forty-three million Americans,
knowing full well the history of similar charges against the
president, voted Clinton into office _ not once, but twice. And I
say this as someone who went down to the wire supporting George
Bush and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   For 218 people in the House _ the number needed to send a bill
to the Senate _ to consider overturning that verdict strikes me as
a bit presumptuous. For me, at least, an action qualifies as a
``high crime'' only if it is directed against the state, not
inflicted on oneself.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that when the only tool you own is a
hammer, sooner or later everything begins to look like a nail. We
should search for other tools in our tool chest.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to make a plea to the House Rules Committee to
allow another option. Why not recognize our limited field of action
and at the very least end this sad chapter in our history with a
strong statement of rebuke rather than nothing at all?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way, it is almost Christmas time. Anyone for a touch
of forgiveness?

<TEXT>
<P>
   One fall day last year, 15-year-old Lucy Weber and a friend
returned from a field hockey game to her dorm at The Middlesex
School and discovered a virulent anti-Semitic note on her dresser.
</P>
<P>
   A swastika followed, and later, a note in the shower: ``Gas for
the Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   As more notes appeared over the next two months, Lucy quickly
went from victim to suspect; from school legacy _ the
great-granddaughter of the library benefactor _ to school outcast.
The prestigious Concord, Mass. prep school asked her to take a
lie-detector test and then, according to her parents and others,
whispered to parents, students, and trustees that the test's
results were inconclusive only because Lucy had a multiple
personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Though a police investigation was suspended and the case was
never solved, the school sent a letter to parents strongly
suggesting that Lucy had written the notes to herself. Lucy,
frustrated, withdrew from the school. And in the clubby
constellation of East Coast prep schools, the gossip went out: Lucy
was troubled, mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of chatter, Middlesex last month was forced to pay
a settlement and issue an apology to avoid a lawsuit threatened by
two prominent attorneys hired by Lucy's parents, who say the school
sacrificed their daughter's reputation to save its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were victimized more by the administration than we were by
the notes,'' says her mother, Katherine. ``The administration of
that school was motivated by expediency above all. They tried to
protect the school's image, by saying it was Lucy Weber who wrote
these notes. Because if Lucy Weber wrote the notes, then there was
no hate crime at The Middlesex School. They needed it to be Lucy,
and they rammed that square peg into that round hole.''
</P>
<P>
   At the school's insistence, neither Middlesex nor the Webers and
their attorneys could disclose the amount of the settlement, though
several sources say the school compensated the family for tuition
covering the three months remaining in the year Lucy withdrew from
the school, as well as legal fees, for a total of several tens of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The school unequivocally denies it was motivated by public
relations. ``Its entire motive in this matter was to get to the
bottom of what was going on so that it could remedy it,'' says John
Mason, the school's lawyer, who works at the Boston firm Ropes &AMP;
Gray. ``The school very much wanted to protect its people. It
wanted to protect Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Webers say the school ignored evidence implicating
others, coming up with a series of theories to implicate Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not their problem if it's my problem,'' says Lucy,
sipping a Diet Coke at the restaurant across from her new prep
school in Connecticut. ``They totally made it my problem.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Middlesex, one of the nation's most exclusive prep schools,
counts former governor William F. Weld, actor William Hurt, and US
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson among its alumni. Its sprawling
grounds and colonial dorms are so much the picture of the New
England prep school that they were the setting for the 1980s movie
``School Ties,'' a film about anti-Semitism that Middlesex shows
freshmen every fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Weber's great-grandfather, FDR brain trust member James P.
Warburg, had perhaps the family's first encounter with
anti-Semitism at Middlesex as a student there in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   When he would pass his papers to the front of the class with
``J. Warburg'' on top, they would inevitably come back with an
``e'' in between the ``J'' and the ``W.'' That, Katherine Weber
says, was the reason he began using his middle initial.
</P>
<P>
   But Warburg liked the school enough that he sent his sons there
and even co-donated the library.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy, who is of mixed Jewish-Protestant ancestry, wasn't
thinking of family ties when she chose Middlesex. ``We never wanted
to trade on the family connection,'' Katherine says. Still, when
Lucy's acceptance letter arrived at her Conecticut home in 1996,
the Webers became, in Katherine's words, ``a Middlesex family.''
Katherine rushed to the car to affix the Middlesex decal on the
rear window. By her first month, Lucy was so happy that she vowed
in a phone call home that she would send her own children to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   There were slight glitches: a falling out with a friend, the
theft of her wallet and Prada handbag, and of the $200 that arrived
on her birthday in October. But her reports home at midterm glowed:
Lucy was ``wonderful,'' ``a delightful young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really happy there,'' Lucy says. ``That was probably the
happiest I've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   In early November, Lucy says, she discovered the first note.
Middlesex ordered an all-school assembly, at which it identified
Lucy, attending with her father, as the recipient of a hate note
and insisted that the school would not tolerate hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, when the swastika appeared, Middlesex called
Concord police.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy returned home for Christmas and told friends that despite
the nastiness, she loved Middlesex and wanted to go back. Yet, when
she returned in January of this year, Lucy says, she and the same
friend who discovered the first note discovered the note in the
shower. Within days, there were more notes, one with unprintable
language, and a fifth one reading, ``Lucy should have her head
smashed in by a train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember being surprised that someone could hate me
that much,'' says Lucy, now 16. ``I didn't know I had any enemies.
It was a pretty unpleasant way to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The school fixed a camera outside one door of her suite to try
to catch anyone leaving the notes. Around that time, the Webers
say, the school began to suspect Lucy, because she was always
around when the notes were found. The school's student newspaper
had reported an earlier incident where a black student reported a
hate note, then confessed to writing it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A report by a handwriting expert suggested the school had asked
the expert to analyze whether Lucy might have copied another
suspect's handwriting. The report says the expert could not exclude
that possibility, but neither could she rule out the other suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The school asked Lucy to take a lie-detector test, and Lucy
eagerly agreed. Katherine Weber says the polygrapher told her Lucy
passed, and complimented her on raising a lovely daughter. The
school says the polygraph was inconclusive, that Lucy neither
passed nor failed.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Lucy says, she found her field hockey team picture
scrawled with the words, ``Can't catch me ugly bitches.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after that, Lucy's father, Nick, got a call on his cell
phone from Deirdre Ling, the head of the school, as he rode home on
the New York commuter train to New Haven. Lucy, he recalls Ling
saying, was ``splitting'' between her multiple personalities, and
would have to be taken home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking we would sell our house to send Lucy to Austen
Riggs,'' he says, referring to the Stockbridge, Mass. hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents brought Lucy to a New Haven psychologist, who called
and wrote to Ling that there was no sign of mental disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The school said it would hold a judiciary committee meeting to
decide whether Lucy wrote the notes.
</P>
<P>
   At home, with Ling not returning her calls, Katherine went out
into the rain and scraped the Middlesex decal off the car.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary committee posted its verdict a week later, and a
letter from Ling went out to parents March 10. The police, the
letter said, had completed an exhaustive review and determined
there was no hate crime, ``and that the student apparently targeted
by the notes may herself have been the author of some or all of
them.'' The letter went on to note that the judiciary committee
``could not conclude that the evidence definitely implicated the
student apparently being targeted by the notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy met with Ling and the head of the judiciary committee, a
group of teachers, who told her, she says, that she had brought ``a
dark cloud'' to the school, and that there would be a dark cloud
over her integrity.
</P>
<P>
   She could stay, they told her, but Lucy said she was leaving.
She returned to public school. But over the summer, she kept
hearing stories that parents and students were saying she had been
expelled, or was mentally ill. Her roommate's mother reported being
told by Ling that Lucy was disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made it clear that she felt that Lucy had some
psychological problems,'' says the mother, Ann Guite. ``It seemed
like it was part of her defending or explaining why she was
convinced that Lucy had done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the chatter was so widespread it would affect her
prospects for college, her parents hired noted Boston lawyer Harvey
Silverglate and former assistant US attorney John Markham, who
wrote a letter to the school's trustees.
</P>
<P>
   They met with Mason and several trustees at his office, and over
several hours reached the settlement. Mason told the Webers the
school would love to take Lucy back, and denied, as he still does,
that anyone told the Webers or anyone else that Lucy was mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, a letter went out to parents, staff, and trustees
from Ling and James M. Oates, president of the school board of
trustees, apologizing for ``misleading statements'' in the March
letter. There had been no police report, it admitted, and, rather
than an exhaustive investigation, the investigation was suspended.
The implication that Lucy had written the notes was ``regrettable
and unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason, the school's lawyer, who said he would speak for Ling and
the trustees, responds, ``The school was confronted with
circumstances which it viewed as possibly pointing to Lucy. The
school did not believe the evidence was conclusive, and that's why
it didn't take any action. It also recognizes that reasonable
people can disagree on this, as to whether the school had any
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webers and their lawyers insist there was no evidence that
Lucy had written the anti-Semitic notes herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was supposition without any reason for it, except their
despair,'' says Nick Weber. ``You recognize your kid in agony, just
as you recognize your kid telling a half truth about a minor
matter. This was totally different from a minor matter. These
horrible things happened to her.''

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Long before NASA's robotic Pathfinder rumbled across the rocky
soil of Mars, Ray Bradbury owned the Red Planet in the popular
imagination, courtesy of ``The Martian Chronicles'' (1950).
 &HT;    His 600-plus short stories have laid claim to other worlds as
well. For example, ``The Veldt'' (1950) inspired a generation of
smart-home and virtual-reality pioneers. ``A Sound of Thunder''
(1952) illustrated chaos theory's butterfly effect years before the
theory existed.
 &HT;    And the character fireman Montag's dash for freedom, televised
by pursuing helicopters in ``Fahrenheit 451'' (1953), could easily
be on Fox-TV's fall schedule. In fact, cameras are ready to roll on
Mel Gibson's version of ``Fahrenheit 451,'' and Avon Books is
reissuing many of the 78-year-old author's titles.
 &HT;    The man who once said ``Give me an ounce of fact and I will
produce you a ton of theory by tea this afternoon'' is today also
an urban design consultant. His ideas have contributed to Disney's
Epcot and the revitalization of downtown Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Here Bradbury talks about how far we've come from the future he
envisioned in the '50s.
 &HT;     -0- 
 &HT;    JOHN GEIRLAND: Describe the city of the future.
 &HT;    RAY BRADBURY: Disneyland! They've done everything right. It has
hundreds of trees and thousands of flowers we don't need, but which
they put in anyway. It has fountains and places to sit. I've
visited Disneyland 30 or 40 times over the years, and there's very
little I would change. Of course, Paris is where Walt Disney
learned all of his lessons.
 &HT;    I once called John Hench at Disney Imagineering: ``John, for
God's sake, I just noticed Viollet-le-Duc's Notre-Dame spire on the
side of Sleeping Beauty's castle.''
 &HT;    ``That's right,'' he said. ``Walt put it there.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What other lessons can we take from the City of Light?
 &HT;    A: The secret of cities is the conviviality of food. Paris has
20,000 restaurants _ if you build a city with 20,000 restaurants,
you have a social city. The United States, and especially Los
Angeles, has forgotten how to eat, how to dine. We need cities
where people can meet, shop and enjoy themselves. That's all cities
are, and all they ever will be.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You want to shut down LA's freeways. Is that practical?
 &HT;    A: We can eliminate cars and get back to public transit. I've
lived in Los Angeles 64 years and I don't have a driver's license.
Cars have destroyed cities. And the reason there's traffic on the
freeway is because the freeway is there. Freeway driving has
nothing to do with real business needs. It's an excuse for getting
out of the office.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Once the freeways are gone, you propose to build 80 plazas
throughout the LA area. What do you have in mind?
 &HT;    A: I created a blueprint for an ideal plaza _ 400 tables, a
thousand chairs in the open, all kinds of restaurants surrounding
it and theaters at the four corners: a motion picture theater, a
silent motion picture theater, a theater for dramatic presentations
and a music hall presenting all kinds of things, including
symphonies and rock. You have to have a social mix.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: A lot of your work has predicted the future.
 &HT;    A: Yes, and almost everything in ``Fahrenheit 451'' has come
about, one way or the other: the influence of television, the rise
of local TV news, the neglect of education. As a result, one area
of our society is brainless. But I utilized those things in the
novel because I was trying to prevent a future, not predict one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The authorities in ``Fahrenheit 451'' also eliminated porches
to reduce social interaction. Has this come to pass?
 &HT;    A: It varies from territory to territory. I was in Omaha
recently and, my God! the size of the lawns and porches and the
feeling of community was incredible. We've been so busy building
outside the city that the city centers are falling apart. Now we're
building substitute cities, such as malls _ substitutes for what we
used to have in every downtown in America.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How would you change the educational system?
 &HT;    A: President Clinton says he wants to wire every schoolroom. I
say it should happen in third grade, maybe, but kindergarten
through second grade has got to educate kids to read and write,
otherwise they have no tools. Get education back on a local level
where it's controlled by teachers, parents and students. What do
governments know about education? Nothing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Somewhere in a third-grade class there is a 9 year old who
will be walking on Mars in 2020. How should we prepare that kid?
 &HT;    A: We already are _ my fellow writers and myself. Albert
Schweitzer said: Do something wonderful, people may imitate it. If
you dream the proper dreams, and share the myths with people, they
will want to grow up to be like you. All the astronauts I meet tell
me they have been influenced by me to grow up the way they did. If
you and I dream properly and creatively, then the future will be
secured. But reality will kill you unless you deal with it through
myths and metaphors. The trouble with people who write
realistically is that they want to electrocute you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What myths should we share?
 &HT;    A: Space travel is our final, greatest dream. If we can reach
the nearest solar system, then we can live for an extra million
years. But ultimately, the particular myth is not important _ it's
how to fall and stay in love. Teach students to be in love with
life, to love their work, to create at the top of their lungs. I
love what I'm doing and started loving it when I was 12. Find
something to love when you're young. Archeology, mythology,
Egyptology, even computerology. Then you can change the future.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Are PCs and the Internet making the future friendlier for
community?
 &HT;    A: No, you've got to make personal contact. Go to the library
and build a network of personal friends, a half dozen or so, as
I've done over the years with other writers. Stop talking on the
telephone, stop talking on the stupid Internet. It's a waste of
time.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So, no Internet, no computer, not even a driver's license. Is
the modern world passing you by?
 &HT;    A: You don't miss what you've never had. If people talk about
sex when you're 12 years old, you don't know what they're talking
about. I don't know what people are talking about when they talk
about driving. I grew up with roller skates, a bicycle, using the
trolley and bus lines until they went out of existence. No, you
don't miss things.
 &HT;    Put me in a room with a pad and a pencil and set me up against
100 people with 100 computers. I'll outcreate (everyone) in the
room.

DESERVING KANSAS STATE SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED

   The coach doesn't strike me as being particularly warm and
cuddly, so let's not worry about him.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Snyder is not the issue. Kansas State as a team is. What
they _ and ``they'' know who ``they'' are _ have done to this team
is an embarrassment and a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State is screaming, and well it should be. We're all
supposed to be big boys and girls, and thus in full possession of
the knowledge that life is most manifestly not fair, but what the
football establishment has done to this team by relegating it to
the Alamo Bowl and its relatively modest $1.1 million payout is, if
not criminal, absolutely shameless and cold-blooded.

   Tennessee, unbeaten after leading a Perils of Pauline existence
all season, plays for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl.
Florida State, a loser to 7-4 North Carolina State, will be the
opponent. Wisconsin, which lost to 9-3 Michigan, goes to the Rose
Bowl, where it will play UCLA, which lost to 8-3 Miami. Ohio State,
which lost to 6-6 Michigan State at home, will play Texas A&AMP;M
(11-2), K-State's double-overtime conqueror, in the Sugar Bowl.
Syracuse (8-3) will play Florida (9-2) in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these eight teams will get between $11 million and $13
million for participating in what we now refer to as the Bowl
Championship Series. Kansas State, whose loss to Texas A&AMP;M on a
neutral field in a bizarre game stands out as the ``best'' of all
the solo miscues, and which is actually ranked No. 1 by one of the
ratings systems employed by the folks who bring you the BCS, is
left on the sidewalk much sadder and presumably wiser than it was a
week ago. Now the purple-clad Wildcats know that it doesn't so much
matter how you play in 1998 as it does who you are in the eyes of
football power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Kansas State Wildcats, what they are in the
judgment of the people who matter is an annoying insect buzzing
around the picnic table. Alter a play here and there, such as
quarterback Michael Bishop being impeded by his own teammate on
what might have been a game-winning touchdown jaunt, and Kansas
State would be making plans for Tempe. Now the Wildcats are stuck
in San Antonio Dec. 29, and that's not meant as an insult to San
Antonio, where a feller has been known to have a good time. San
Antonio is a fine place. But at this point in time, it's just not
the proper place for a team as deserving as Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas State people must face facts. They are not considered
members of The Club. The stated reason for their exclusion from the
Orange Bowl in favor of Florida is the assumption that the Gators
will bring a sufficient amount of people to fill the stadium.
That's probably true, but to suggest that K-State would not have
brought people in huge numbers is a huge lie. K-State has proven
itself to be an exceptional ``traveling'' school during its recent
rise to football prominence. You give 'em a bowl game, and their
fans will come and they will spend money. You can look it up.
</P>
<P>
   Let's declare this BCS business to be a farce and move on. Its
proponents say, au contraire, it has done its job, which was to
select Nos. 1 and 2 for the national championship game. Well, maybe
it did and maybe it didn't. Jeff Sagarin, whose computer still has
K-State No. 1, is very comfortable with those findings. And trust
me, he is no, as he puts it, ``Wally Cox'' who wouldn't know a
linebacker from a linotypist. He is a flesh-and-blood fan who
``shut off the telephone during the Ohio State-Michigan game.'' He
can't help it if his Maker also gave him an aptitude for
mathematics that enables him to marry the two pursuits _ math and
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kansas State were playing Tennessee, Florida State, Ohio
State, or anyone else in this discussion on a neutral field and I
were being forced to wager $100,000 in a pick-'em game,'' says
Sagarin, ``I'd pick Kansas State. Their `on' game is better than
anyone else's `on' game.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that they are 11-1 and Tennessee is 12-0? Doesn't faze
Sagarin a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any good sports fan knows that the best team doesn't always
win,'' he points out. ``They lost a strange game to a team, Texas
A&AMP;M, that everyone has ranked in their Top 7. These things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   No system that sends Syracuse to a potential $13 million bowl
game and Kansas State to one worth $11.5 million less can be
considered to have anything to do with justice. But justice is not
the goal, anyway. The goal is to make these damnable bowl people
happy, which means full houses, period.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed. We are where we were a year ago, 10 years
ago, and 50 years ago; that is to say, we are without an acceptable
way to determine a national collegiate football champion.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not that hard. You have two obvious choices to come up
with an eight-team, three-week tournament.
</P>
<P>
   1. Do what they do in basketball for the NCAA tournament. A
committee, armed with charts and its own humanity, selects the
at-large teams and seeds them. Period. It's not perfect, but it
gets the job done.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, your committee, which has representatives from
administration (i.e., knowledgeable athletic directors), the
coaching ranks, and the media, picks the eight participants in the
NCAA football tournament. Eight is plenty. Four is generally
enough, but eight would make more people happy. You pick the eight,
you seed them, and you play. Period.
</P>
<P>
   2. Keep the current BCS mechanism and apply it to the task at
hand. Let the computer spit out eight teams and then let them play.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't this eliminate the bowl games, you say? Yes! And
hallelujah! Who cares about the Blazer People? This bowl game
nonsense has gone on long enough.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing that would happen would be an unhappy No. 9
team. Boo-hoo. I'd rather have that than an unfairly trashed No. 1,
2, or 3, which is the absolute least you can say about Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the money, it's the principle. Oh, well, so what if it
is about the money? K-State was hosed. We all know that.

<P>
   The memory of a brief conversation nags me whenever I think
about Asia's future. The conversation took place shortly after the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, during a secret meeting with a leader
of China's underground democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   We met in a quiet corner of a Beijing restaurant, where he
tapped the table suspiciously to see if it was bugged. This was a
man whose vision I admired, so I listened intently when the
waitress stepped away and he leaned forward to disclose his plans
for promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese,'' he said brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to kill Japanese businessmen. That'll scare them
so they won't invest here. And then the government will really be
screwed!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not serious?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're serious. We can't demonstrate these days and
we can't publish. The only thing we can do for democracy is kill
Japanese businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   I protested that it seemed odd to promote human rights by
murdering innocent businessmen. But he just smiled at my
narrow-mindedness, with a ``you-will-never-understand-Asia'' grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Japanese,'' my friend said dismissively. ``Japanese
devils.''
</P>
<P>
   He never did kill anyone. But the vitriol in his voice
underscored Asia's historical tensions, which are especially
intractable because they exist between peoples, not governments.
</P>
<P>
   While Asia has seemed remarkably peaceful since the end of the
Vietnam War, the peace is a fragile one, concealing dormant
antagonisms and disputes that could still erupt. Now the recent
economic crisis has increased the risk of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   With nations as with households, tempers fray when the money
runs out. And insecure regimes may try to boost their legitimacy by
picking a fight, distracting discontented citizens with military
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the tension in Asia lies Japan's failure to
apologize meaningfully for its wartime brutality. While anti-Japan
sentiment among the Chinese and Koreans has deeper roots, it
largely derives from Japan's behavior before and during World War
II. Japan must therefore come to grips with its past before the
region can move forward.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for Americans (not to mention the Japanese) to fathom
how deep the historical fault lines run. Some assume that Asia's
resentment of Japan will die with the World War II generation. In
another decade, they think, with the old folks gone, the issue will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes that should visit a certain hill in Kyoto,
one few Japanese know of and few guidebooks mention. Of course,
every Korean knows about it.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Ear Mound, it contains the ears and noses of perhaps
100,000 of their countrymen whom Japanese warriors slaughtered in
the late 16th century. The few Japanese who have heard of it
consider the Ear Mound a grisly but irrelevant relic of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot say that cutting off ears or noses was so atrocious
by the standards of the time,'' argued a plaque at the site in the
1960s (eventually removed after Koreans complained). To most
Koreans, however, the Ear Mound is another example of Japanese
brutality _ and Japan's reluctance to face up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at Japan continues to simmer in its former victims in
Asia, from Indochina to Indonesia. The hostility is only moderate
in most Asian nations, and almost nonexistent in Taiwan, but
remains dangerously intense in Korea and China. The signs are
everywhere in these two countries. When foreigners learn Chinese,
they are sometimes taught that the character ``hen,'' for hatred,
represents the feeling Chinese have for the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, South Korea, in violation of trading rules, bans the
import of Japanese books, movies and magazines. Elderly Koreans,
schooled in Japanese during the occupation, often refuse to speak
the language.
</P>
<P>
   The resentment has provoked minor crises. When a Beijing
newspaper ran an expose on Chinese waitresses kneeling to serve men
in Japanese restaurants _ as do all waitresses in fine Japanese
restaurants _ a wave of public fury arose at the idea of Chinese
prostrate before their ancient enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in Tianjin, four Chinese employees of a Japanese
software company refused to work on a computer game about World War
II, which they denounced as a monument to Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The four became local heroes when the company threatened to fire
them, and the Japanese eventually backed down.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Beijing newspaper poll, 51 percent of Chinese
rank Japanese businesses as the least desirable employers. Only 4
percent cite American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many Chinese and Koreans hate Japan? World War II is
an obvious explanation, as is Japan's stubborn failure to show
contrition for its behavior. Japan has never adequately apologized
for the war. Indeed, a sizable segment of the population feels
little remorse and vehemently opposes any apology.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese, especially in rural areas, firmly believe their
country did nothing particularly bad during the first half of this
century. Seisuke Okuno, a former cabinet minister who led 161
members of the Diet (Japan's legislature) in opposing an apology
for World War II, suggests that if any country is guilty of war
crimes it is the United States, for dropping atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's purpose for invading its neighbors was, he insists,
entirely noble: ``These countries had been colonized and oppressed
by whites. Our purpose was to free and stabilize them.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of this view was dramatically demonstrated by the
success of the film ``Pride,'' Japan's biggest box-office hit of
early 1998, which paints wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo as a
national hero. Tojo comes off as a kind and honorable man, thrust
into war by the West and then unfairly executed as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   While real questions remain about the fairness of the Allied
war-crimes tribunals, one cannot imagine such a movie being made
about Hitler or Goebbels, or even a similar depiction of General
Westmoreland and the American role in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese diplomats insist that movies like ``Pride'' are merely
a tribute to pluralism, and that their country has apologized many
times for its wartime conduct. But Japan's statements of regret
always end up sounding hollow and calculating, as if they come from
some committee in the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, then Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama did make a genuine
effort to wrench a forthright apology from the Diet, but the result
only undermined the party line on Japan's supposed contrition.
Drafters of the resolution replaced the word ``apology'' with
``hansei,'' and ``aggressive acts'' with ``aggressive-like acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, legislators ascribed the acts in question to all
countries, not just Japan. Even in this gutted form, only 230
members of the 511-seat chamber voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing at the start
and end of every conversation and many times in between _ which
makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even more remarkable.
If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a nuisance, even when
they are not, why will they not show regret for the slaughter of
millions?
</P>
<P>
   Apart from cultural explanations, such as a Confucian reluctance
to speak critically of one's elders, there is a more obvious
answer: Nations, even more than individuals, hate to say sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, after all, has never formally apologized for
enslaving Africans, invading Mexico and Canada, stealing Texas,
colonizing the Philippines and Guam or carpet-bombing Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Japanese know very little of their country's dark
past, and thus may be genuinely ignorant of what there is to
repent. For decades, the Japanese government urged textbook
publishers to excise any hint of the brutalities committed by the
army. Thanks to court intervention, recent Japanese textbooks have
improved somewhat. But they skimp on details, giving youngsters
little sense of the horrors committed in their country's name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is unrelenting anti-Japanese propaganda in
Asian schoolbooks and Asian society. Common Chinese and Korean
epithets characterize the Japanese as dwarfs, pirates, charlatans
and crooks. This racism arises from history, but can also be
attributed to jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian countries envy Japan's economic and past military
success. For proud nations like Korea and China, which helped
civilize and educate Japan in the first place, it has been galling
to see the upstart outstrip its tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, of course, is not the only continent where the past
overshadows the present. French-German rivalry plagued modern
Europe for decades, making stability impossible until that
relationship improved. Like France and Germany in the interwar
years, China and Japan now stare suspiciously at each other across
a gulf of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   High stakes freight every American action in Asia with intense
symbolic value. Thus the recent U.S. effort to boost military
cooperation with Japan sent China into a sulk. And Japan felt
snubbed when President Clinton flew to Beijing but neglected to
drop by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering Asian fear of Japan, while irrational, remains genuine
and can shape policy. According to Chinese officials, China
downgraded Russia as a security threat at the end of the Cold War
while upgrading Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as is now known, the West drifted close to war with
North Korea _ though few Americans realized it at the time _ and
probably only the intervention of Jimmy Carter prevented armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States prepared for battle, it quickly became
clear that Japan could not be counted on to negotiate a solution or
give military support. It even was unclear whether Japan would lend
doctors to treat wounded GIs or send ships and planes to help
rescue Americans in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Japan, Germany was forced long ago to confront its past;
victim countries like France and Israel scrutinized every German
statement and protested when dissatisfied. Until recently, Japan
never faced such scrutiny, thanks in part to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Cold War over and Asia fracturing, the United
States should encourage Japan to confront its responsibility,
apologize and provide some redress to its former sex slaves and
other victims who are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   So far Japan has refused to pay official compensation to the
``comfort women,'' insisting that such issues have already been
settled on a government-to-government level.
</P>
<P>
   That argument has some legal, but no humanitarian, basis. A
forthright Japanese apology and an attempt to help its victims
would allow Japan to play a more important international role.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, most Americans held virulently racist
opinions of the Japanese, much worse than the stereotypes held by
Chinese or Koreans today. A 1944 poll found that 13 percent of
Americans favored the extermination of all Japanese people after
the war (the question was never asked about Germans), and according
to another poll from late 1945, 23 percent of Americans regretted
that Japan had surrendered before more atomic bombs could be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such hatred, American racism toward Japan has largely
dissipated in the years since the war. Japan surrendered and
accepted American occupation and involvement. The bond subsequently
forged between these former adversaries has come to be described as
the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan could overcome American racism in 1945, it can overcome
the animosities that linger in Asia in 1998.

answer: Nations, even more than individuals, hate to say sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, after all, has never formally apologized for
enslaving Africans, invading Mexico and Canada, stealing Texas,
colonizing the Philippines and Guam or carpet-bombing Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Japanese know very little of their country's dark
past, and thus may be genuinely ignorant of what there is to
repent. For decades, the Japanese government urged textbook
publishers to excise any hint of the brutalities committed by the
army. Thanks to court intervention, recent Japanese textbooks have
improved somewhat. But they skimp on details, giving youngsters
little sense of the horrors committed in their country's name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is unrelenting anti-Japanese propaganda in
Asian schoolbooks and Asian society. Common Chinese and Korean
epithets characterize the Japanese as dwarfs, pirates, charlatans
and crooks. This racism arises from history, but can also be
attributed to jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian countries envy Japan's economic and past military
success. For proud nations like Korea and China, which helped
civilize and educate Japan in the first place, it has been galling
to see the upstart outstrip its tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, of course, is not the only continent where the past
overshadows the present. French-German rivalry plagued modern
Europe for decades, making stability impossible until that
relationship improved. Like France and Germany in the interwar
years, China and Japan now stare suspiciously at each other across
a gulf of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   High stakes freight every American action in Asia with intense
symbolic value. Thus the recent U.S. effort to boost military
cooperation with Japan sent China into a sulk. And Japan felt
snubbed when President Clinton flew to Beijing but neglected to
drop by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering Asian fear of Japan, while irrational, remains genuine
and can shape policy. According to Chinese officials, China
downgraded Russia as a security threat at the end of the Cold War
while upgrading Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as is now known, the West drifted close to war with
North Korea _ though few Americans realized it at the time _ and
probably only the intervention of Jimmy Carter prevented armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States prepared for battle, it quickly became
clear that Japan could not be counted on to negotiate a solution or
give military support. It even was unclear whether Japan would lend
doctors to treat wounded GIs or send ships and planes to help
rescue Americans in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Japan, Germany was forced long ago to confront its past;
victim countries like France and Israel scrutinized every German
statement and protested when dissatisfied. Until recently, Japan
never faced such scrutiny, thanks in part to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Cold War over and Asia fracturing, the United
States should encourage Japan to confront its responsibility,
apologize and provide some redress to its former sex slaves and
other victims who are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   So far Japan has refused to pay official compensation to the
``comfort women,'' insisting that such issues have already been
settled on a government-to-government level.
</P>
<P>
   That argument has some legal, but no humanitarian, basis. A
forthright Japanese apology and an attempt to help its victims
would allow Japan to play a more important international role.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, most Americans held virulently racist
opinions of the Japanese, much worse than the stereotypes held by
Chinese or Koreans today. A 1944 poll found that 13 percent of
Americans favored the extermination of all Japanese people after
the war (the question was never asked about Germans), and according
to another poll from late 1945, 23 percent of Americans regretted
that Japan had surrendered before more atomic bombs could be
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such hatred, American racism toward Japan has largely
dissipated in the years since the war. Japan surrendered and
accepted American occupation and involvement. The bond subsequently
forged between these former adversaries has come to be described as
the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan could overcome American racism in 1945, it can overcome
the animosities that linger in Asia in 1998.

IN FINLAND, IT'S A RIVALRY REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the United States women's ice hockey team plays Canada
Thursday in the first game of the annual Three Nations Cup, the
archrivals will face each other for the first time since the Nagano
Olympics. There, the US surprised Canada with a 3-1 victory to win
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's more difficult to come back from a big win than
a big loss,'' said Julie Sasner, who will coach the US team for
this tournament, when asked about a letdown. ``But most of them are
just thrilled to be skating together again.''
</P>
<P>
   While both rosters feature a solid core of Olympians, there are
some notable absences. In addition to several retirees, including
Massachusetts defensemen Colleen Coyne and Vicki Movsessian and
forward Sandra Whyte, a number of key players from that magical
fortnight in Nagano _ including A.J. Mleczko, Angela Ruggiero, and
Tara Mounsey _ are in the thick of their college hockey seasons and
are not a part of the US Select Team that left Monday for Finland,
although they may opt to vie for a spot on the US team that will
play for the World Championship, also in Finland, in early March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we have more youth, and we have more speed (than the
Olympic team),'' said Sasner, who will gain some valuable
international experience before returning the reigns to Ben Smith
for the World Championship. ``We have a little less size and a
little less experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasner, who played on the 1990 national team as Julie
Andeberhan, recently left her coaching post at Cornell for the
University of Wisconsin, which launches varsity hockey next season.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, only Chris Bailey and Sue Merz return from the
Nagano squad. Joining them are Winny Brodt (Roseville, Minn.) and
Amy Coehlo (North Truro), both of whom were on the 1996 US Select
Team; Kelli Halcisak, a Michigan high schooler; and Catherine
Hanson (Providence College).
</P>
<P>
   Sara DeCosta returns to goal, where backup Lauren Goldstein of
Milton and Brown University will see her first international
competition. Sarah Tueting, in net for the gold-medal game, has
returned to Dartmouth College as a pre-med student, although she,
too, could be back for the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   At forward, the US brings back a wealth of talent. Cammi
Granato, Karyn Bye, Laurie Baker, Alana Blahoski, Tricia Dunn,
Katie King, Shelley Looney and Jenny Schmidgall all return. Meaghan
Sittler, Colby's all-time leading scorer and a member of the 1996
national team, will join them, as will Brandy Fisher, the all-time
leading scorer at the University of New Hampshire and last year's
Patty Kazmaier Award winner as the outstanding player in women's
college hockey; Krissy Wendall, a Minnesota high schooler; and
Natalie Darwitz from Eagan, Minn., who just turned 15 on Oct. 13
and becomes the youngest woman every named to a US Select Team.
</P>
<P>
   For Canada, the most glaring change is in goal, where neither
Manon Rheume, who is pregnant, nor Leslie Reddon return. Also
absent will be Hayley Wickenheiser and Harvard freshman Jen
Botterill, who will instead compete for Canada in an Under-22
tournament later this month. But the team led by Danielle
Sauvageau, who had been an assistant to ousted Olympic coach
Shannon Miller, will abound in experience: witness the return of
32-year-olds Danielle Goyette, the second-leading scorer in Nagano,
and Therese Brisson, the top-scoring defenseman. France St. Louis,
who has been on the national team for a decade, turned 40 in
October _ almost 25 years to the day older than Darwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an obvious look at the rivalry between the US and
Canada, but Finland is on the verge,'' cautions Smith. ``Finland is
doing what we were trying to do, and that's climb over somebody.
This tournament gives them the chance to get in that mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, the US signaled it was ready for Nagano
by beating Canada in the championship game of the Three Nations
Cup, the first time it beat Canada, still the reigning world
champions, in an international tournament.

 &HT;    
 By R.W. APPLE JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I came to Washington, I always thought, with all the right
stuff: an Ivy League degree, a job on a big-time newspaper, a belly
full of skepticism and a brain littered with assorted information
on throw-weights, T-bills and reapportionment.
 &HT;    I knew who George W. Norris and Arthur Vandenberg and Rexford G.
Tugwell were, and I knew the difference between grands crus and
grand larceny.
 &HT;    I had once had tea at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's.
 &HT;    That pretty well did the trick in the 1970s and 1980s, but not,
alas, in the 1990s. I'm out of some pretty important loops now,
status-wise, because I know little about television and less about
movies. Now that Hollywood narcissism has displaced Rhodes-scholar
earnestness as Washington's controlling ethos, with Barbra
Streisand and David Geffen supplanting George Stephanopoulos and
Robert Reich as prototypical Buddies of Bill, you have to have a
Tinseltown-size appetite for celebrity to keep up in the capital.
 &HT;    Time was, a stiff, black-on-ecru invitation to one of the
soirees given by the grandes dames of Washington was the premier
status symbol. At Evangeline Bruce's or Pamela Harriman's houses,
you might meet the head of the CIA or the members of the permanent
Establishment, those people who had long outlived the
administration that first brought them to town. You might impress
them by your knowledge of the minutiae of politics and government.
 &HT;    The Clintons were launched into Washington by a gala dinner at
Harriman's, come to think of it, but they have long since turned
their backs on most of the people listed in the Green Book,
choosing the glamorous over the grandees.
 &HT;    Me, I still get invited to the British Embassy once in a while,
and before relations between The New York Times and the Clintons
turned testy, I even got asked to the White House a time or two.
But when I failed to recognize Annette Bening at a star-studded
reception at the time of the Clinton inaugural, some of my friends
pitied me. And when I expressed doubts about colleagues who were
trying to turn themselves into celebrities through the pundit
circuit, others dropped me.
 &HT;    The litmus paper changed color especially quickly at the annual
springtime black-tie dinners for Washington reporters and their
guests. They used to be an occasion for us groundlings to chat with
publicity-averse administration officials. (I remember getting Bob
Haldeman in a corner once, the only time I ever talked to him.)
 &HT;    Now, in an effort to make the other guests forget the cheap wine
and the lame jokes, the newsies ask Robert De Niro and Kim Basinger
(and one year, disastrously, the New York shock-jock Don Imus) as
well as Lloyd Cutler and Colin Powell.
 &HT;    The new Washington ought to adopt Suzanne Stone as its mascot.
She was the rapacious small-town weather girl in ``To Die For''
(played by Nicole Kidman, I think) who said you're nothing if
you're not on television. ``What's the point of doing anything
worthwhile,'' she asked, ``if nobody's watching?''
 &HT;    Good question, thinks Washington, vintage 1998, and it has made
Larry King, Tim Russert and Sam and Cokie _ or rather their air
time _ the real forum of American political discourse, eclipsing
the Senate and the House.
 &HT;    During the debate in October about impeachment hearings, Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, gave the game away. He said that
he wanted to tell his colleagues, ``in the most friendly and
respectful way that I know,'' that he and Rep. Robert Barr, a
Georgia Republican, were scheduled to appear that evening on the
``Crossfire'' program, so he planned to postpone his comments in
the House ``in an effort not to ruin the show.'' No wonder it's
been said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people.
 &HT;    Everybody's avocation in America is show business, said the man
who wrote ``To Die For,'' Buck Henry. So I guess it's not all that
surprising that President Clinton has got into the game, playing
his sax and discussing his underwear on TV. Or that he spends
almost as much time at fund-raisers in the ballroom of the Century
Plaza as producers, stars and starlets spend in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
 &HT;    Plenty of other Washington heavy-hitters have been fascinated by
Hollywood. But past Presidents kept their psychic distance. John F.
Kennedy was always the star, not the Rat Pack. Bill Clinton, the
unabashed fan of Elvis, is the first star-struck president. I
didn't know Marilyn Monroe, but I know Markie Post is no Marilyn
Monroe.
 &HT;    The president does favors for movieland friends, like arranging
for his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to brief a group
led by John Travolta on the administration's stand on Scientology.
They, in turn, do favors for him. It's all very chummy.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, former presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford and eminent senators such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan don't
waste their breath defending Clinton. To the chattering classes of
Georgetown and Cleveland Park, Washington seems critically short of
political heroes these days. But maybe they don't listen to the
right people or read the right publications.
 &HT;    For Hollywood has a whole different take on Clinton's
difficulties. Discussing the president with Elle magazine this
fall, the actress Sharon Stone said this: ``I think Clinton's a
fantastic president. He's done so much good in the world. And
people do not want to assign him the successes of his office. They
only want to assign him the failures. It's really ugly.''
 &HT;    Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer of ``Thirtysomething,''
said recently that Hollywood was more forgiving of Clinton than
other people because it does not see marriage as ``a monolithic
simple entity.''
 &HT;    And Bette Midler told Larry King: ``I feel that he and his wife
have been hounded for the past six years, actually, since they
walked in the door. ... I think he's the smartest guy we ever
had.''
 &HT;    Nowhere else, except in the Congressional Black Caucus and among
the trial lawyers _ surely not among his former aides and onetime
enthusiasts in the universities _ does Clinton get that kind of
unconditional praise.
 &HT;    Maybe it's not surprising that in Washington and in California,
the gossips _ the same ones, now that politics is a subset of
celebrity _ keep whispering that Clinton will go to work one day
for Dreamworks, the entertainment company that Geffen runs with two
other Clinton enthusiasts, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
and live next door to Tom Hanks.
 &HT;    He certainly won't move to Georgetown, where I live, along with
a lot of other people who don't quite fit the new mold. I admit
that I'm of two minds about the status revolution in Washington. I
rather enjoyed playing the old game _ when inside information was
the coin of the realm _ and so naturally I wish I knew more about
the new rules and the redrawn playing field.
 &HT;    But I fear, square that I am, that the whole culture of
celebrity worship has tainted the country, its politics and my
trade as well. In Washington, as elsewhere, fame and fortune, not
talent and perseverance, are now what's most widely respected.
Ex-actors and ex-athletes and relatives of ex-politicians occupy
more and more seats in Congress.
 &HT;    They have instant ``name recognition,'' which is almost as
useful in campaigns these days as money, which propels other people
into high office. You have to wonder whether Abe Lincoln _ homely,
provincial and poor _ would have had a shot at the modern White
House.
 &HT;    Note too that candidates have adopted the techniques of show
business and of marketing, its comrade in hoopla. Both politicians
and producers know that violence sells; as with car chases and gory
murders in movies, TV commercials filled with distorted and
negative language dominate our barren campaigns.
 &HT;    Candidates for important offices no longer proclaim programs and
ideas first and invite people to support them. They take polls to
discover what people think and then develop policies. In other
words, they convene focus groups (cf. sneak previews in Hollywood)
before editing their ideas (cf. recutting the picture).
 &HT;    Politicians' debilitating and humiliating loss of privacy is, of
course, related to the celebrification of politics; we eavesdrop on
Leonardo DiCaprio's love life _ why not on Bill Clinton's? The
voyeur that lurks in each of us has been given more room to do his
stuff, denying it all the while.
 &HT;    Similarly, journalists' loss of standing must have something to
do with the fact that they have emerged from relative anonymity,
reporting less and talking more, part of an ever-growing mountain
of commentary resting on an ever-shrinking base of fact.
 &HT;    I don't blame the man in the street for making very little
distinction between what I do and what Geraldo Rivera does, and
thinking little of either of us. But I don't pretend to like that
particular change in status.

 By R.W. APPLE JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I came to Washington, I always thought, with all the right
stuff: an Ivy League degree, a job on a big-time newspaper, a belly
full of skepticism and a brain littered with assorted information
on throw-weights, T-bills and reapportionment.
 &HT;    I knew who George W. Norris and Arthur Vandenberg and Rexford G.
Tugwell were, and I knew the difference between grands crus and
grand larceny.
 &HT;    I had once had tea at Alice Roosevelt Longworth's.
 &HT;    That pretty well did the trick in the 1970s and 1980s, but not,
alas, in the 1990s. I'm out of some pretty important loops now,
status-wise, because I know little about television and less about
movies. Now that Hollywood narcissism has displaced Rhodes-scholar
earnestness as Washington's controlling ethos, with Barbra
Streisand and David Geffen supplanting George Stephanopoulos and
Robert Reich as prototypical Buddies of Bill, you have to have a
Tinseltown-size appetite for celebrity to keep up in the capital.
 &HT;    Time was, a stiff, black-on-ecru invitation to one of the
soirees given by the grandes dames of Washington was the premier
status symbol. At Evangeline Bruce's or Pamela Harriman's houses,
you might meet the head of the CIA or the members of the permanent
Establishment, those people who had long outlived the
administration that first brought them to town. You might impress
them by your knowledge of the minutiae of politics and government.
 &HT;    The Clintons were launched into Washington by a gala dinner at
Harriman's, come to think of it, but they have long since turned
their backs on most of the people listed in the Green Book,
choosing the glamorous over the grandees.
 &HT;    Me, I still get invited to the British Embassy once in a while,
and before relations between The New York Times and the Clintons
turned testy, I even got asked to the White House a time or two.
But when I failed to recognize Annette Bening at a star-studded
reception at the time of the Clinton inaugural, some of my friends
pitied me. And when I expressed doubts about colleagues who were
trying to turn themselves into celebrities through the pundit
circuit, others dropped me.
 &HT;    The litmus paper changed color especially quickly at the annual
springtime black-tie dinners for Washington reporters and their
guests. They used to be an occasion for us groundlings to chat with
publicity-averse administration officials. (I remember getting Bob
Haldeman in a corner once, the only time I ever talked to him.)
 &HT;    Now, in an effort to make the other guests forget the cheap wine
and the lame jokes, the newsies ask Robert De Niro and Kim Basinger
(and one year, disastrously, the New York shock-jock Don Imus) as
well as Lloyd Cutler and Colin Powell.
 &HT;    The new Washington ought to adopt Suzanne Stone as its mascot.
She was the rapacious small-town weather girl in ``To Die For''
(played by Nicole Kidman, I think) who said you're nothing if
you're not on television. ``What's the point of doing anything
worthwhile,'' she asked, ``if nobody's watching?''
 &HT;    Good question, thinks Washington, vintage 1998, and it has made
Larry King, Tim Russert and Sam and Cokie _ or rather their air
time _ the real forum of American political discourse, eclipsing
the Senate and the House.
 &HT;    During the debate in October about impeachment hearings, Rep.
Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat, gave the game away. He said that
he wanted to tell his colleagues, ``in the most friendly and
respectful way that I know,'' that he and Rep. Robert Barr, a
Georgia Republican, were scheduled to appear that evening on the
``Crossfire'' program, so he planned to postpone his comments in
the House ``in an effort not to ruin the show.'' No wonder it's
been said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people.
 &HT;    Everybody's avocation in America is show business, said the man
who wrote ``To Die For,'' Buck Henry. So I guess it's not all that
surprising that President Clinton has got into the game, playing
his sax and discussing his underwear on TV. Or that he spends
almost as much time at fund-raisers in the ballroom of the Century
Plaza as producers, stars and starlets spend in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
 &HT;    Plenty of other Washington heavy-hitters have been fascinated by
Hollywood. But past Presidents kept their psychic distance. John F.
Kennedy was always the star, not the Rat Pack. Bill Clinton, the
unabashed fan of Elvis, is the first star-struck president. I
didn't know Marilyn Monroe, but I know Markie Post is no Marilyn
Monroe.
 &HT;    The president does favors for movieland friends, like arranging
for his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to brief a group
led by John Travolta on the administration's stand on Scientology.
They, in turn, do favors for him. It's all very chummy.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, former presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford and eminent senators such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan don't
waste their breath defending Clinton. To the chattering classes of
Georgetown and Cleveland Park, Washington seems critically short of
political heroes these days. But maybe they don't listen to the
right people or read the right publications.
 &HT;    For Hollywood has a whole different take on Clinton's
difficulties. Discussing the president with Elle magazine this
fall, the actress Sharon Stone said this: ``I think Clinton's a
fantastic president. He's done so much good in the world. And
people do not want to assign him the successes of his office. They
only want to assign him the failures. It's really ugly.''
 &HT;    Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer of ``Thirtysomething,''
said recently that Hollywood was more forgiving of Clinton than
other people because it does not see marriage as ``a monolithic
simple entity.''
 &HT;    And Bette Midler told Larry King: ``I feel that he and his wife
have been hounded for the past six years, actually, since they
walked in the door. ... I think he's the smartest guy we ever
had.''
 &HT;    Nowhere else, except in the Congressional Black Caucus and among
the trial lawyers _ surely not among his former aides and onetime
enthusiasts in the universities _ does Clinton get that kind of
unconditional praise.
 &HT;    Maybe it's not surprising that in Washington and in California,
the gossips _ the same ones, now that politics is a subset of
celebrity _ keep whispering that Clinton will go to work one day
for Dreamworks, the entertainment company that Geffen runs with two
other Clinton enthusiasts, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg,
and live next door to Tom Hanks.
 &HT;    He certainly won't move to Georgetown, where I live, along with
a lot of other people who don't quite fit the new mold. I admit
that I'm of two minds about the status revolution in Washington. I
rather enjoyed playing the old game _ when inside information was
the coin of the realm _ and so naturally I wish I knew more about
the new rules and the redrawn playing field.
 &HT;    But I fear, square that I am, that the whole culture of
celebrity worship has tainted the country, its politics and my
trade as well. In Washington, as elsewhere, fame and fortune, not
talent and perseverance, are now what's most widely respected.
Ex-actors and ex-athletes and relatives of ex-politicians occupy
more and more seats in Congress.
 &HT;    They have instant ``name recognition,'' which is almost as
useful in campaigns these days as money, which propels other people
into high office. You have to wonder whether Abe Lincoln _ homely,
provincial and poor _ would have had a shot at the modern White
House.
 &HT;    Note too that candidates have adopted the techniques of show
business and of marketing, its comrade in hoopla. Both politicians
and producers know that violence sells; as with car chases and gory
murders in movies, TV commercials filled with distorted and
negative language dominate our barren campaigns.
 &HT;    Candidates for important offices no longer proclaim programs and
ideas first and invite people to support them. They take polls to
discover what people think and then develop policies. In other
words, they convene focus groups (cf. sneak previews in Hollywood)
before editing their ideas (cf. recutting the picture).
 &HT;    Politicians' debilitating and humiliating loss of privacy is, of
course, related to the celebrification of politics; we eavesdrop on
Leonardo DiCaprio's love life _ why not on Bill Clinton's? The
voyeur that lurks in each of us has been given more room to do his
stuff, denying it all the while.
 &HT;    Similarly, journalists' loss of standing must have something to
do with the fact that they have emerged from relative anonymity,
reporting less and talking more, part of an ever-growing mountain
of commentary resting on an ever-shrinking base of fact.
 &HT;    I don't blame the man in the street for making very little
distinction between what I do and what Geraldo Rivera does, and
thinking little of either of us. But I don't pretend to like that
particular change in status.

 By WARREN HOGE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The royal train, sleek and black with pencil-thin red trimming,
is hurtling toward Newcastle, and inside one of the armored middle
cars, Charles, the prince of Wales, is taking his breakfast.
 &HT;    He's dressed down in an open-collar white-and-burgundy striped
shirt, blue cardigan and khaki trousers, and as I enter the cabin,
his look of welcome is mixed with one of concern.
 &HT;    ``I do hope you managed to get some sleep,'' he says, motioning
me to sit across from him.
 &HT;    Gales and lashing rain had rolled in from the North Sea as we
made our midnight departure from Perth, and the heir to the throne
seems to be apologizing for turbulence in the realm.
 &HT;    ``Ghastly night,'' he says.
 &HT;    Freshly done up in blond wood with little ornamentation, the
coach reflects a new reduced configuration aimed at cutting the
train's operating cost. Part of royal downsizing? I ask.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' he nods. ``What you see is the anorexic British
monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a corner bookcase, there is a small vase of flowers and a
picture of the Queen Mother, said to be Prince Charles' favorite
member of the family. Earlier her two corgis, Dash and Rash, had
taken their morning stroll through the carpeted corridors, friskily
tugging at the leash held by her footman, Leslie Campbell.
 &HT;    The prince's face is ruddy from a blustery weekend at his home
on the Balmoral estate in Scotland, and gray is making a debonair
debut in his thinning hair. His ears are large, as advertised, but
they ride closer to his head and in happier proportion to it than
cartoonists' pens would have you believe.
 &HT;    He speaks so softly that I have to strain to hear him even in
the stillness of the cabin, with its thick, bulletproof windows
keeping out the clatter of our passage along England's northeastern
coast.
 &HT;    Smartly turned out crewmen in navy blazers, charcoal gray
trousers and black shoes shined to a military gloss place before
the prince a silver tray with small jars of preserves and honeys
and a bowl of wheat germ and cereal grains, all of which meet his
high threshold for unadulterated, healthful food.
 &HT;    He reaches for a container of honey, opens it and spoons the
golden spread directly into his mouth. I think I am observing royal
prerogative.
 &HT;    ``I actually don't eat very much at all,'' he says, confirming
the warnings I had received minutes earlier from the butlers and
security men in the mess car as they tucked into their heaping
platefuls of eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, bacon and toast.
 &HT;    In fact the atmosphere around the prince and his once-embattled
retinue is assured and upbeat these days. Not long ago the most
reviled member of the British royal family, Charles was able on his
50th birthday in November to look back on a year in which he was
liberated from the competition with Diana, the princess of Wales,
for attention and approval.
 &HT;    He also was given credit previously denied him for being a
sensitive parent to his two sons; was celebrated by the new Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair for the pioneering social
work his Prince's Trust has done; and was encouraged by
significantly growing public endorsement of him as the next
sovereign and of his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, as his
private life companion and possible wife.
 &HT;    He has turned the most convulsive moment in his life _ the death
in August 1997 of his former wife, Diana _ into an opportunity for
staging his own revival and for staking a strong claim on the role
of guiding the monarchy into the 21st century.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, his progress has freshened the image of the monarchy.
Mutinous feelings in Britain toward the royals have subsided, and
the major player in disarming the public has surprisingly been
Prince Charles.
 &HT;    For a long time the percussive, single-syllable words like
``twit,'' ``wimp'' and ''prat'' that Britons use to dress down
their well-born often accompanied mention of his name. The product
of an undemonstrative mother, a chastising father and the decidedly
uncozy Windsor household, Charles suffered from self-doubt and
appeared hesitant and distracted in the face of the burdensome
demands of his awesome inheritance.
 &HT;    The question he most commonly puts to people he encounters now
on his official rounds _ ``What do you do?'' _ is one he might have
best avoided years ago for fear someone might ask him back.
 &HT;    When he got around to doing something, he only made matters
worse, uttering ill-thought-out and crudely stated condemnations of
modern architecture, medicine and education. By the time Diana
began attracting favorable attention for her visits to AIDS wards
and refugee camps, Charles had marked himself as something of a
young fogy, dismissing new approaches to old problems as
``fashionable.''
 &HT;    What's more, he was conducting a personal life that became an
ongoing tabloid saga complete with confessional television
interviews and smutty tape recordings of stunningly graceless
sexual small talk.
 &HT;    Recently, however, newspaper and magazine articles and new books
assessing him in connection with his birthday have portrayed a
new-look prince and declared him an underacknowledged overachiever
whose good works went unnoticed in the press onslaught on his
shortcomings.
 &HT;    Anthony Holden, a royal biographer considered hostile by the
prince's supporters and denied all cooperation for his new book,
``Charles at Fifty,'' concluded that ``the human qualities well
known to his inner circle, for all the battering they took during
the Diana years, have come back to the fore. If not entirely at
peace with himself, he is more so with the world around him. Throw
in the shrewdest advisers he has had since his youth, extending
beyond his own office to the inner councils of government, and you
have a public figure suddenly and unexpectedly at the peak of his
powers, bloodied but unbowed by his past, with cause for unwonted
optimism about his future.''
 &HT;    The prince's schedule for this day alone calls for him to spend
seven hours opening a home for the aged, a glass museum, a
job-training center and, most improbably, an oil rig. True, there's
nothing new about the prince of Wales going off to lay cornerstones
and plant trees. In 1997, he had 513 engagements like this.
 &HT;    What is new is that he is no longer alone with his ceremonial
shovel. People are paying attention, and they are doing so because
the ideas of a man long associated with the country's past now seem
very much a part of its future.
 &HT;    Back in the staff mess car, one of Charles' aides confided that
he believed the most significant factor in the changing fortunes of
the prince was the election in May 1997 of Tony Blair and the Labor
Party: ``Suddenly his views became part of the political language
of this country.''
 &HT;    It is a breathtaking fact that many of the reforms the Labor
government is pursuing _ getting private enterprise engaged in
public service and opening up opportunities for young people,
minorities and the unemployed _ are ones that have been undertaken
for years by a member of the famously out-of-touch British
monarchy. On issues such as the environment, genetically modified
food and organic farming, the prince has even bolder prescriptions
than the government.
 &HT;    Where the queen just this year rode in her first public taxi,
walked into her first McDonald's and visited her first pub, Prince
Charles has been tramping through housing projects for two decades.
In 1976, he began a program that made loans available to young
people whom banks wouldn't go near, and the idea is credited with
having helped more than 40,000 people to start new businesses.
 &HT;    Several people who run sections of the Prince's Trust said they
know Charles was motivated to act in the 1980s by evidence that
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic revolution was leaving
Britain's poor unprotected and marginalized.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't that he used her name,'' said one executive close to
the prince. ``He spoke out when it was very unfashionable to have
these concerns, and he was the one who persuaded business it had to
enter areas that the government was abandoning.''
 &HT;    Financed by the consolidation of three royal trusts and by
contributions from corporations and individuals, the trust today
manages an endowment of $125 million.
 &HT;    Blair's people have praised the prince for his foresightedness,
and the prince has expressed his pleasure that Labor has found
inspiration in his good works. One gleeful Labor official said,
``He was a Blairite before Blair.''
 &HT;    In contrast, the queen is not known to have any political
viewpoints, and in her long years on the throne she has never been
caught out expressing one. She and Prince Philip are reported by
biographers to be put off by their eldest son's social activism in
general and the perception that he could be playing favorites in
Britain's public life.
 &HT;    The prince has not responded to the grumbling in the House of
Commons about his role, but he has long said the monarchy of the
future should be ``a contributing monarchy.''
 &HT;    In a letter to Tom Shebbeare, the head of the trust, five years
ago, he addressed the question, saying, ``I have no 'political'
agenda _ only a desire to see people achieve their potential.'' He
reasoned that his ability to get attention made him ``a catalyst to
help produce a better and more balanced response to various
problems.''
 &HT;    The prince has known the prime minister since 1990, when Blair
was Labor's shadow employment secretary and took an interest in the
work the Prince's Trust was doing in the area of youth employment.
Their relationship was to deepen in the immediate aftermath of the
death of Diana, as the royal family found itself tone-deaf to the
sorrow and anger of the nation and looked to the newly triumphant
Labor government for help tuning in.
 &HT;    Blair and the prince spoke by phone during the flight Charles
made to Paris to bring Diana's body back to Britain, and associates
of the prime minister played a prominent role in planning the
funeral and in encouraging the royal family to respond to the
outpouring of grief. The prince is the member of the family
credited with convincing the palace that it was too remote, and
much of his counsel came from Blair officials.
 &HT;    Today, on the prince's staff are none of the advisers who
counseled him to confess his adultery in a 1994 television
interview, a strategic decision he now regrets.
 &HT;    While the queen has kept her private secretaries for decades at
a time, Charles has had six since 1985, a measure of his
temperamental leadership. He has now settled down and reached out
to the worlds of politics and entertainment for help. By design,
his staff is no longer all male, all white, all Oxford- and
Cambridge-educated.
 &HT;    Often at odds with their more tradition-bound counterparts in
Buckingham Palace, the prince's people are busy putting forth their
man as the voice of the monarchy's future, even going so far as to
set up his own Web site _ www.princeofwales.gov.uk.
 &HT;    The prince's current honeymoon with the British press began
after a simple act of reconciliation suggested by his new aides.
For 10 years, he had not directed a personal word at any of the
reporters covering him.
 &HT;    Then, on a trip between South Africa and Swaziland last year, a
shirt-sleeved prince walked back to the economy section of the
plane where the press was riding and struck up conversations. He
captivated the surprised reporters with a few jokes on himself, and
by the same afternoon The Evening Standard was on the streets of
London with a front page saying, ``Chattering Charles Plays Royal
Tour Joker.''
 &HT;    The charm offensive was on. Public appearances increased and
Charles began to be seen at West End first nights, film openings,
Spice Girl concerts _ in short, the circles where Diana once
reigned. The usual titled guests at dinners at St. James' Palace
and at Highgrove found themselves seated next to Charles' new
friends, such as Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson, whose comic
creation Mr. Bean has come, like the prince, to represent the
lovable side of English awkwardness.
 &HT;    The Sun, Britain's largest-selling tabloid and long a Charles
tormentor, became the recipient of leaks from the prince's office
and made a rapid conversion to the rehabilitation cause. The prince
and his organic garden at Highgrove were lovingly chronicled in
celebrity magazines such as Hello!
 &HT;    Charles took his sons to Vancouver, where they publicly
frolicked in the caps of the Canadian Winter Olympics team. And, in
a gesture interpreted as a truce, the prince agreed to serve as
patron for a new press ball.
 &HT;    At a televised birthday gala, the prince became the star of the
show, appearing in a skit with the actors Stephen Fry and Roger
Moore. The scene was a restaurant, and look-alikes of Michael
Jackson, Tina Turner, Madonna and Humphrey Bogart appeared on stage
as Fry and Moore, the diners, tried unsuccessfully to guess who
they were.
 &HT;    Charles, an accomplished college actor at Cambridge, then walked
on, playing a waiter with a cloth napkin slung over his forearm and
a pen and pad at the ready. When the cheers died down, he
recommended the organic vegetables and cookies made from the
Highgrove granary. ``They're damn good,'' he said.
 &HT;    Moore pondered the prince's performance. ``I know who you're
supposed to be, but you are going to have work on your voice a
bit,'' he said to the laughing crowd.
 &HT;    The aides who have helped engineer the turnabout in public
opinion are encouraged about the future. ``We find doors flying
open everywhere now where we had to really struggle before,'' one
said.
 &HT;    Though the recognition of the prince's pioneering
accomplishments and the public sympathy for him as a single parent
have given him new balance, Charles can still stumble over his
bulky collection of resentments.
 &HT;    There is, first and foremost, the somewhat icy, always
complicated relationship with his parents. It is clear too that the
prince has not fully freed himself from the sense of anger he felt
a year ago at being cast as a villain who betrayed a saint, a
careless adulterer who married a virgin for dynastic reasons and
then destroyed her emotionally.
 &HT;    ``You know the prince thought that Diana was on a mission to
destroy him,'' one courtier explained. He recalled a night in which
Charles could talk of nothing else until the aide, a relative
newcomer to the staff, said: ``You can't keep going on like this.
You must get on with your future.''
 &HT;    The prince agreed that he was being ``obsessive'' but insisted
on talking on. ``Unless you hear what went on in the past,'' he
said, ``you won't understand how I am today.''
 &HT;    How he is today, friends say, is a lot more pleasant than he
used to be, and the behavior figures prominently in his
rehabilitation.
 &HT;    ``He's actually doing the same things he did before,'' said a
Prince's Trust executive, ``but he is much more relaxed and
confident that he can do things on his own. It helps not having
someone out there saying, 'I can do that better than you can.'''
 &HT;    Of course, he is still far from taming his notorious moodiness
or mastering his tantrums, but the best antidote to them, Camilla
Parker Bowles, is more frequently at hand.
 &HT;    ``He is a world-class, wall-to-wall whinger,'' one of his
closest aides said, invoking the English word for whining that
makes self-pity sound even more insufferable.
 &HT;    A woman who heads up one of his charities looked aghast at the
recollection of a moment when she lost patience with the prince and
apparently lost track of whom she was speaking to. ``He does moan
about so,'' she said. ``One day I just said to him: 'Stop
complaining. We all have problem parents.'''

   WALPOLE, Mass. _ The same faceguard that protected Cammi
Granato's smile failed to hide it as she circled back to her
teammates last week, high-fiving during a lively drill at Iorio
Arena. She was back on the ice. With the US team. Still in love,
after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Those who thought Granato might retire in well-deserved glory
after leading the US women's ice hockey team to a gold medal at the
Olympic Games in Nagano this past February are hereby required to
think again. The 27-year-old Olympic captain is now the only player
who has been with the national team since it was born in 1990, and
_ despite pursuing some post-hockey career options _ she is far
from ready to say die.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's enough for you then, yeah, that's a wonderful way to
go out, because there might not be a better way,'' Granato said
last week after practice for the Three Nations Cup, which begins
Thursday in Finland with a US-Canada rematch of the Olympic gold
medal game. ``I don't think there is. But if you have a lot of
passion still left in you and you still want to play the game of
hockey, it's very much a part of what you enjoy, then you can't
give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither, in the US at least, can you play it regularly after
college. So just when Granato thought her stereotype-smashing,
gate-crashing days were history, she signed a three-year contract
this fall as radio commentator for the Los Angeles that made her
only the second woman NHL broadcaster, following sportswriter
Sherry Ross, who was with the New Jersey Devils from 1992-1995.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer to the booth, Granato has sometimes struggled.
Knowing when to talk, knowing when to be silent, and quickly
organizing thoughts into concise snippets does not come as
naturally for her as playing the game itself. ``It's not like
picking up a hockey stick,'' she acknowledged. ``It's pretty much
the biggest challenge I've ever had to deal with. Some days, the
real world is a lot harder than playing hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the reaction of listeners, who sometimes are
skeptical despite Granato's credentials. ``I'm the only woman, so
I'm in the spotlight,'' she said. ``You don't get to be just a
rookie, there's a lot of focus on it. I'm a little uncomfortable
with it. I keep saying it builds character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Smith, the Gloucester native and Olympic coach, said he's
sure it does. ``She's not somebody who backs away from anything,''
he said. ``She doesn't know a word that begins with the letter Q.''
</P>
<P>
   The job definitely brings its perks: games of three-on-three
after practice; tips on how to beat defensemen from Kings coach
Larry Robinson, who played the back line for 17 years with the
Montreal Canadiens; help from Luc Robitaille in finding a strength
trainer; time off to play in international tournaments. And each
new broadcast brings with it less unease, fewer glitches, and more
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really fortunate because the experience I'm gaining,
you can't replace it,'' she said. ``It's an amazing opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also miss hockey so much,'' she said. ``I watch the guys
every day, we'll go to the hotel and they'll be gearing up for
their pregame meal and it's like it's not my . . . we're not
playing a game. I envy what they have. We got to live that
lifestyle for a year (while preparing for the Olympics) and then
they take it away from you. It's kind of bittersweet. I honestly
said I haven't smiled more in my life than I did last year, just
because something that we were passionate about, we were given the
chance to do. You're given it, and then it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said other team members have expressed the same longing _
not for the glory of the gold, but simply for the chance to play
their sport again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's a double-edged sword,'' said Smith. ``Not
only are they coming down off the height of their personal lives,
but when they come down they realize the sport just isn't up to
their speed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   With several plans for a women's professional hockey league on
indefinite hold for lack of financing, ``it kind of settles back to
the college level as the highest level of play in the country,''
said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised Granato didn't retire after Nagano,
Smith paused. ``Yes and no. I know there's a part of me that says,
why would I want to coach again, because it was so exciting and
fulfilling. But coaching is what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing is what she does. Why not? She's fit and strong,
with a lower back that's healthy again after aching throughout the
Olympic campaign. (``She's such a marked player,'' said Smith of
Granato keeping the injury quiet. ``She doesn't need any more
attention on the ice than she normally gets.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, yeah, I would like to be there (in 2002), only because
this is it for us,'' said Granato. ``This is our pinnacle. That's
basically our pro league, our Stanley Cup, that's where we can
flourish as athletes, where we can be elite athletes. That year
last year, and I'm not even talking about the Olympics, I'm talking
about the pre-Olympic tour, that's what I enjoyed the most. Being
on the ice every day at this level, being with my teammates, having
games, focusing on being a team, being in hotels. And I want to do
it again. I miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Cammi Granato will never again be the first female hockey
player to have a gold medal put around her neck, as she was in
Nagano. She knows that. She will never again be part of a team that
goes from such obscurity in October (women play ice hockey?
really?) to such fame in February (the White House, not to mention
Letterman's Top 10). She knows that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no replacing how special that moment was in our
lives,'' she said. ``That is something we will all cherish. But you
can't stop living. There are so many more beautiful things in life
to enjoy. There's more than one special moment in your life. Who
knows? There could be something out there.''

GOP'S LOPSIDED LEADERSHIP PRESSING FOR IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Over-the-Cliff Society, also known as the Republican
congressional leadership, to employ the oxymoron, is about to risk
the stability of the nation's economy and foreign policy on an
inept, incompetent, doomed effort to impeach a president who needs
nothing more than a good dressing-down.
</P>
<P>
   The closer this lame-duck House of Representatives comes to
impeaching Clinton, the more likely that the House elected 23
months from now will turn Democratic. And the Senate may also
revert to the Democrats. If Al Gore or some dark horse Democrat
becomes president, this GOP leadership team will have blown it
bigtime.
</P>
<P>
   They shut down the government and got clobbered; they pinned
their political star to smearing Clinton with Whitewater,
Travelgate, Filegate, and Monicagate, and the first three of those
went poof! Never before has a political party with majorities in
both branches been so fellatio-fixated, betting the House's thin
majority and the Senate on bringing down a popular, twice-elected
president with the public holding consistently at a solid 2-1 for
letting him finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time, the Republican dunderheads raise partisan
posses to shoot down Clinton. Soon-to-be-ex-Senator Al D'Amato
tried it, Senator Fred Thompson tried it, House Chairman Dan Burton
tried it, and they went oh-for-three. Now it's Henry Hyde and the
Judiciary Committee trying to raise Monicagate to the level of high
crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   When will they learn? One big reason for the Republicans'
impeachment death-wish is the leadership's lopsided tilt. Nine of
10 GOP leaders in the two branches are from the south or west. In
the House, where Louisiana's Speaker-elect Bob Livingston of takes
over from Georgia's Newt Gingrich, all of the leadership
Republicans are antiabortion southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Armey is from Texas, as is Tom Delay, the former
exterminator-turned-majority whip, who's been bullying the GOP
moderates to get them to vote to impeach. Delay's nickname is ``the
Hammer.'' Which makes me think of the Republican members
collectively as ``the Thumb.'' The new faces include Tom Davis of
Virginia, replacing a Georgian as head of the Republican
Congressional Committee, the fund-raising entity. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, the GOP's only black member, defeated an Ohio man, John
Boehner, to chair the party caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Mississippi's Trent Lott kept his job as majority
leader despite loud grumbles over the GOP's failure to improve on
its 55-45 edge. Many more Republican seats than Democrat are at
risk next time, when the presidential turnout is much larger and
usually boosts Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's team? The whip is Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, who's
regarded as a lean and hungry Cassius ready to pounce on Lott when
he feels he has the votes to topple the leader. The chairman of the
GOP Senate Campaign Committee is Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the
Darth Vader of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde is from Illinois, the heavy work in tearing down
Clinton is done by a pair of Sun Belt sons, Bob Barr of Georgia and
Bill McCollum of Florida. Barr is the one who looks like the
villainous forecloser harassing Scarlet in ``Gone With the Wind.''
McCollum is the one who looks like Howdy Doody.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is a popular insider, ``a Louisiana deal-maker,'' in
the words of one northern Democrat. His ``Bob PAC'' raised $1
million in three weeks from lobbyists to finance his leadership
bid. But he's been astonishly silent as the House mud-wrestles with
Monica-gate, beyond saying he hopes impeachment moves out of the
House one way or another while Gingrich is still at the throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston seems to have been muscled aside by Delay and the
rest of the Get Clinton crowd. Unless he takes charge of the
runaway locomotive, Livingston's first significant action will be a
failure. It'll mean he whiffed on impeachment, the biggest decision
he'll ever face. What a way to begin your reign. If the House votes
to impeach, Livingston will likely be a one-term speaker, a job he
holds by the barest majority.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans elected in the north and east, and Republican
governors who tend to be less ideologically sharp-edged than their
congressional brethren, don't want impeachment to bog down the
Senate and risk either the economy or foreign policy in a partisan
parliamentary train wreck. Governors Cellucci of Massachusetts and
Rowland of Connecticut, Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York, and a lot
of other GOP officials, say: Don't go there!
</P>
<P>
   The regional cleavage in the ruling congressional party is
dramatic when you look at committee chairmanships. Southern or
western senators run Appropriations, Armed Services, Budget,
Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources, Foreign Relations,
Governmental Affairs, Indian Affairs, Judiciary, Rules, Small
Business, and Intelligence. In the House, southerners or westerners
run Agriculture, Appropriations, Commerce, Oversight, National
Security, Resources, Small Business, Ethics, Veterans Affairs, Ways
and Means, Intelligence, and Taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The Deep South, the Bible Belt, and the Sagebrush Rebellion crew
want Clinton impeached. The rest of the country does not.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In death as in life, Jason Altom managed to be both extremely
methodical and extraordinarily good-hearted.
 &HT;    On the warm, humid day in mid-August when he ended his life, he
walked up to the third-floor bedroom of the Somerville, Mass.,
house he shared with two fellow graduate students at Harvard
University, drank a liquid laced with cyanide procured from the
very chemistry laboratory where he was considered an unusually
gifted student and lay down on his bed.
 &HT;    Having accounted for the remote possibility that his own death
might endanger others, the 26-year-old doctoral candidate left a
warning note on the bed.
 &HT;    ``Do Not Resuscitate,'' it read. ``Danger: Potassium Cyanide.''
 &HT;    As one of his roommates explained to me later, ``I think he was
worried, in his meticulous way, that someone might try to give him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.''
 &HT;    It is not for that note, but rather for the three suicide notes
Jason left on the nightstand next to his bed, that his death has
had reverberations far beyond Harvard.
 &HT;    One was addressed to his parents, a second to the chairman of
Harvard's chemistry department and the third to his graduate
adviser, the Nobel laureate Elias J. Corey.
 &HT;    Work in the chemistry labs ground to a halt that weekend as word
of Jason's death swept through one after another of Harvard's 16
chem lab groups and then, by phone and E-mail, out into the
tightknit international community of chemists, some 600 of whom had
trained with Corey over the last half century.
 &HT;    Any suicide is shocking, but this one was especially so. Widely
known and well liked, Jason was by all accounts the golden boy of
the Corey group, perhaps the finest synthetic organic chemistry
laboratory anywhere in the world.
 &HT;    The following Monday morning, Corey, a vigorous 70-year-old,
delivered the devastating news to the department chairman, James G.
Anderson. ``He was just shocked and dismayed and heartbroken,''
Anderson said later. ``I had never seen him so distraught.''
 &HT;    Four weeks later, the Altom family shared with The Harvard
Crimson the contents of Jason's suicide note to the chemistry
department chairman. The paper published excerpts in its Sept. 14
issue.
 &HT;    ``This event could have been avoided,'' the note began.
``Professors here have too much power over the lives of their grad
students.'' The letter recommended adoption of a three-member
faculty committee to monitor each graduate student's progress and
``provide protection for graduate students from abusive research
advisers. If I had such a committee now I know things would be
different.''
 &HT;    It was the first time, a columnist for The Crimson observed
later, that a suicide note took the form of a policy memo.
 &HT;    Like a raw, angry Rorschach blot, the notes inspired different
interpretations in different quarters. Some graduates of Harvard's
chemistry program volunteered the opinion that Altom's letter
eerily and lucidly confirmed longstanding concerns about the
pressures of the Harvard chemistry program in general and the Corey
lab in particular.
 &HT;    As every ensuing bit of coverage dutifully noted, it was the
second suicide to hit the Corey group in less than two years and
the third since 1980. Others felt Corey was being unfairly
tarnished.
 &HT;    By the time I went up to Cambridge, the much-publicized suicide
had already inspired a number of changes, including the
three-member thesis committee suggested by Jason, a program of
lectures to stress alternative careers for Ph.D.s, more
opportunities for social interaction between students and free
confidential access to a therapist, with Harvard picking up the
tab. The suicide note, in short, had catalyzed major changes.
 &HT;    But as I began to speak with Jason's friends and colleagues, I
quickly learned that the situation was more complicated than the
notes had implied.
 &HT;    The people who knew Jason Altom best were as stunned and
confused by the anger of his letters, which Jason's family later
shared with them, as by his death. No one had had the slightest
inkling that Jason felt unfairly treated by his adviser _ not the
roommate who watched TV with him the night before his death, not
the postdoc with whom he shared a lab (and who marveled at the
amount of attention Jason received from Corey), not the six friends
with whom he socialized during his five years in Cambridge, not the
other roommate who furiously pedaled his bicycle home on a Saturday
morning in August when he'd been told that something terrible had
happened.
 &HT;    That roommate, Andrew Black, could imagine a burglary, a fire, a
calamity to another resident in the house, but never something to
do with Jason. ``I can't tell you how shocking it was,'' he said.
 &HT;    If Jason's death may not have had much to do with the incendiary
accusations contained in his letters, as many of his friends seemed
to suggest, it was nonetheless inextricably linked to the pressures
of graduate-school life _ not just at Harvard but at every
top-flight university where competitive overachievers aspire to
become scientists.
 &HT;    And if it were indeed an avoidable death, the reasons may have
less to do with the reforms already in place and more to do with
chemistry of a different sort _ not the textbook chemistry of
orbitals and bonds, but the more mysterious and nuanced kind
between two extremely bright human beings locked in a typically
intense graduate-school relationship.
 &HT;    Every year in October, when the Nobel Prizes in chemistry,
physics and medicine or physiology are announced, the predictable
parade of American honorees is reported on television and in the
papers with a combination of patriotic glee and almost total
befuddlement about the nature of the work being honored.
 &HT;    Hardly anyone pauses to think about the educational system that
has been so fabulously productive in turning out scientists in this
country. It is a system limited to about 120 research institutions,
and at the upper, rarefied reaches of that system are the elite
universities.
 &HT;    As James Anderson, chairman of Harvard's chemistry department,
puts it: ``The students here are spectacularly good, very bright,
very committed. They want to win Nobel Prizes, and some of them
will, and some of them want to do it before they're 30.''
 &HT;    Graduate study in the sciences, however, is a very unsentimental
education. It requires the intellectual evolution from undergrad
who can ace tests of textbook knowledge to original thinker who can
initiate and execute research about which the textbooks have yet to
be written.
 &HT;    What is less often acknowledged is that this intense education
involves an equally arduous psychological transition, almost a
second rebellious adolescence. The passage from callow,
eager-to-please first-year student in awe of an often-famous
faculty adviser to confident, independent-minded researcher willing
to challenge, and sometimes defy, a mentor is a requisite part of
the journey.
 &HT;    Harvard's Mallinckrodt Laboratory is one of the premier
factories for producing outstanding academic and industrial
chemists. The building stretches for an imposing length of Oxford
Street in Cambridge, its formal entrance flanked by stolid white
pillars, its double green doors topped by an entablature with all
the modesty of a Federal Reserve bank.
 &HT;    On its four floors, and in two adjoining buildings that form the
complex of chemistry buildings at Harvard, corridors open on
laboratory upon laboratory, reagents stacked on shelves, the
ventilated work areas known as hoods constantly sucking fumes away,
the entire building literally throbbing with ventilation.
 &HT;    There are 16 professors with lab groups in these buildings, in
organic and inorganic and physical chemistry, with expertise
ranging from the composition of the ozone hole to the enzymatic
reactions of creatures on the ocean floor. To people who have spent
enough time here, each group has its distinct smells (depending on
the chemistry being done) and each its distinct social tone
(depending on the personality and style of the lab chief).
 &HT;    At this level of achievement, there are no more A's for effort.
As a sign in one lab had it: ``Don't Try. Do.''
 &HT;    The young people who walk through those green doors enter a
world that has aspects both of a foreign country, with its own
language and customs, and of Dante's nine circles of hell, complete
with acrid odors and licking flames. In any given year, there are
roughly 350 young scientists _ half of them graduate students, half
postdoctoral fellows _ who toil in the buildings.
 &HT;    For the five or six years it typically takes to acquire a Ph.D.,
time is both a burden and a gift. Aside from taking classes their
first year, students have the freedom to pursue original research.
Their monthly stipends, after taxes, amount to little more than
$1,000 a month. They are expected to work 60 to 80 hours a week.
 &HT;    ``If it's felt that you're not working hard enough, you feel
that pressure more from the group than from your adviser,'' said
Reed Konsler, a fifth-year graduate student and co-chairman of the
chemistry department's Quality of Life Committee.
 &HT;    These pressures are not unique to Harvard. At the country's
other elite graduate chemistry programs _ at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley,
the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the
Scripps Research Institute _ the stresses are said to be
comparable, but according to some experts, they may be getting
worse.
 &HT;    ``The life of the graduate student is so pressured because the
future is so uncertain,'' said Dr. Edward M. Hallowell, a
psychiatrist who took courses in chemistry at Harvard as an
undergrad and is now on call to the university's chemistry
department. ``Whether you're a graduate student in English
literature or a graduate student in chemistry, there's no guarantee
that you're going to be able to find a job. And then you add the
self-imposed pressures of the students themselves. They want to win
a Nobel Prize yesterday.''
 &HT;    In some fields of chemistry, the job market has never been
better, but Hallowell argues that coping with the overall pressure
has become more difficult. ``I think the kind of supports that used
to be there for people aren't there anymore, like family and
extended family and community and religion, so you get more
isolation,'' he said, ``and isolation is the big enemy.''
 &HT;    Jason was exactly the kind of student Harvard and every other
top-notch science department looks for: bright, outgoing, likably
confident, intellectually mature, and with an inner reserve of
self-reliance that is indispensable to any researcher working on
the cutting edge.
 &HT;    He was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn., the son of Donald and Dianna
Altom. He attended the University of North Carolina with the intent
of studying business, according to friends, but graduated in 1993
as one of its most accomplished chemistry students ever.
 &HT;    With a long, narrow face and an engaging grin, he was known for
his good sense of humor, the methodical way in which he threw
himself into any task (including hobbies) and a taste for setting
the highest goals and challenges for himself and the unrelenting
drive to achieve them.
 &HT;    He was the kind of person who attended to every detail, no
matter how small, in both his science and his spare time: When
assigning friends to bring wine for one of the wine-tasting parties
he occasionally threw, he parenthetically provided the correct
pronunciation of ``chianti.''
 &HT;    By the beginning of 1994, after only four months of graduate
study, Jason chose the adviser he wanted to work with and was
accepted into the laboratory of E.J. Corey.
 &HT;    ``E.J. Corey is one of the most important chemists of our
century,'' says Peter Dervan of Caltech.
 &HT;    Born in Methuen, Mass., and educated at MIT, Corey is one of the
most prolific organic chemists of this century. His area of
specialty is synthetic organic chemistry _ that is, developing new
reactions and building naturally occurring chemical compounds from
scratch. In the course of a career whose productivity is almost
without precedent, he and the members of his lab have synthesized
more than 100 naturally occurring chemical compounds, many of them
with significant medical or industrial implications.
 &HT;    ``He was born brilliant and he'll die brilliant,'' says A.I.
Meyers of Colorado State University. ``I would rank him as one of
the two or three greatest scientists in the century, and the entire
pharmaceutical industry has been living off his chemistry for
years.'' The extended family of Corey group members has published,
by one estimation, a phenomenal 100,000 scientific papers.
 &HT;    Even his most unforgiving critics admit Corey is a gifted
chemist with great intuition, passionate about science above all
else, caring and loyal toward students who show the same passion;
but even his most unabashed admirers admit that his lab is an
intense place.
 &HT;    ``It is stressful,'' says K.C. Nicolaou, a chemistry professor
on the faculties of both the University of California at San Diego
and the Scripps Research Institute. ``To do a Ph.D., very
infrequently does one have a pleasant ride all the time. But I
would do it all over again with Corey. He's a great mentor.''
 &HT;    Meyers agrees: ``He is just an incredibly bright guy, and he
expects everyone around him to perform at a similar level.''
 &HT;    A stressful environment is, at some level, precisely the desired
effect: serving to separate those who have the emotional as well as
intellectual toughness to become scientists from those who don't.
 &HT;    The problem, according to a former graduate student who asked
not to be named, was that Corey cares so much that ``he doesn't
realize the emotional effects of his driving. When you're a
professor, you're not just doing research,'' this student said.
``You're dealing with people during a very difficult transition in
their lives. In the Corey lab, those things don't come into the
calculation. It's just chemistry.''
 &HT;    For his research project, Jason had chosen to synthesize a
molecule called haplophytine, which is, in the words of one lab
mate, ``an obscenely complex compound.'' His initial work had gone
exceedingly well, but on the Saturday he discovered a mistake,
Jason, extremely distraught, phoned his parents in Tennessee.
 &HT;    ``There was a clear concern that he had misidentified the
compound and had provided misleading information to Professor
Corey,'' Donald Altom said in an interview. ``He didn't know how to
discuss that with Professor Corey.'' He was so upset, according to
his parents, that they considered traveling immediately to
Cambridge, but when he seemed better during a phone call the
following Monday, Aug. 3, they felt that he was going to be OK.
 &HT;    At some point in his last two weeks, his friends now believe,
Jason's sense of self-worth became inextricably entangled with
solving that bond.
 &HT;    Corey, who finally consented to an interview after declining
several requests, like everyone else, insisted that he'd had no
idea of the depth of Jason's distress.
 &HT;    ``I would have done everything conceivable to help Jason if I
had had any inkling of his problem,'' Corey said in his plain,
soft-spoken voice. ``But I didn't. He was the last person in the
world I would have expected to commit suicide.''
 &HT;    We spoke in his spacious, sunny, book-lined office on the third
floor of Conant Lab, a plaque on one wall commemorating his Nobel
Prize and numerous sticklike models of chemical structures appended
like talismans to the bookshelves. When the subject was science, a
smile came quickly to his face, but when it turned to suicide, he
became guarded, his arms tightly crossed.
 &HT;    ``I feel badly that I didn't know more about Jason's background
and his day-to-day life,'' he admitted, and was able to recall, by
date and context, many of his extensive last conversations with
Jason, describing with evident pride his student's ``beautiful''
research.
 &HT;    ``If he had troubles, personal troubles,'' Corey said, ``why
wouldn't he seek help from me?''
 &HT;    One possible reason, I suggested, was the atmosphere of fear I
had encountered in the chemistry building. Almost every student I
interviewed was concerned about being quoted by name, and when I
asked why, the answer was always the same. They weren't sure how
their graduate advisers would take it, and it might affect their
careers.
 &HT;    Corey said he felt he had a partnership with his students that
overrode constraints in communication, but as even he admitted,
``Because lines of communication are there doesn't mean there will
be communication.''
 &HT;    In the end, despite all his scientific imagination and insight,
Corey was no less confused than anyone else. ``The more I think
about it,'' he said, ``the more helpless I feel to understand it.
It's beyond my comprehension.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In death as in life, Jason Altom managed to be both extremely
methodical and extraordinarily good-hearted.
 &HT;    On the warm, humid day in mid-August when he ended his life, he
walked up to the third-floor bedroom of the Somerville, Mass.,
house he shared with two fellow graduate students at Harvard
University, drank a liquid laced with cyanide procured from the
very chemistry laboratory where he was considered an unusually
gifted student and lay down on his bed.
 &HT;    Having accounted for the remote possibility that his own death
might endanger others, the 26-year-old doctoral candidate left a
warning note on the bed.
 &HT;    ``Do Not Resuscitate,'' it read. ``Danger: Potassium Cyanide.''
 &HT;    As one of his roommates explained to me later, ``I think he was
worried, in his meticulous way, that someone might try to give him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.''
 &HT;    It is not for that note, but rather for the three suicide notes
Jason left on the nightstand next to his bed, that his death has
had reverberations far beyond Harvard.
 &HT;    One was addressed to his parents, a second to the chairman of
Harvard's chemistry department and the third to his graduate
adviser, the Nobel laureate Elias J. Corey.
 &HT;    Work in the chemistry labs ground to a halt that weekend as word
of Jason's death swept through one after another of Harvard's 16
chem lab groups and then, by phone and E-mail, out into the
tightknit international community of chemists, some 600 of whom had
trained with Corey over the last half century.
 &HT;    Any suicide is shocking, but this one was especially so. Widely
known and well liked, Jason was by all accounts the golden boy of
the Corey group, perhaps the finest synthetic organic chemistry
laboratory anywhere in the world.
 &HT;    The following Monday morning, Corey, a vigorous 70-year-old,
delivered the devastating news to the department chairman, James G.
Anderson. ``He was just shocked and dismayed and heartbroken,''
Anderson said later. ``I had never seen him so distraught.''
 &HT;    Four weeks later, the Altom family shared with The Harvard
Crimson the contents of Jason's suicide note to the chemistry
department chairman. The paper published excerpts in its Sept. 14
issue.
 &HT;    ``This event could have been avoided,'' the note began.
``Professors here have too much power over the lives of their grad
students.'' The letter recommended adoption of a three-member
faculty committee to monitor each graduate student's progress and
``provide protection for graduate students from abusive research
advisers. If I had such a committee now I know things would be
different.''
 &HT;    It was the first time, a columnist for The Crimson observed
later, that a suicide note took the form of a policy memo.
 &HT;    Like a raw, angry Rorschach blot, the notes inspired different
interpretations in different quarters. Some graduates of Harvard's
chemistry program volunteered the opinion that Altom's letter
eerily and lucidly confirmed longstanding concerns about the
pressures of the Harvard chemistry program in general and the Corey
lab in particular.
 &HT;    As every ensuing bit of coverage dutifully noted, it was the
second suicide to hit the Corey group in less than two years and
the third since 1980. Others felt Corey was being unfairly
tarnished.
 &HT;    By the time I went up to Cambridge, the much-publicized suicide
had already inspired a number of changes, including the
three-member thesis committee suggested by Jason, a program of
lectures to stress alternative careers for Ph.D.s, more
opportunities for social interaction between students and free
confidential access to a therapist, with Harvard picking up the
tab. The suicide note, in short, had catalyzed major changes.
 &HT;    But as I began to speak with Jason's friends and colleagues, I
quickly learned that the situation was more complicated than the
notes had implied.
 &HT;    The people who knew Jason Altom best were as stunned and
confused by the anger of his letters, which Jason's family later
shared with them, as by his death. No one had had the slightest
inkling that Jason felt unfairly treated by his adviser _ not the
roommate who watched TV with him the night before his death, not
the postdoc with whom he shared a lab (and who marveled at the
amount of attention Jason received from Corey), not the six friends
with whom he socialized during his five years in Cambridge, not the
other roommate who furiously pedaled his bicycle home on a Saturday
morning in August when he'd been told that something terrible had
happened.
 &HT;    That roommate, Andrew Black, could imagine a burglary, a fire, a
calamity to another resident in the house, but never something to
do with Jason. ``I can't tell you how shocking it was,'' he said.
 &HT;    If Jason's death may not have had much to do with the incendiary
accusations contained in his letters, as many of his friends seemed
to suggest, it was nonetheless inextricably linked to the pressures
of graduate-school life _ not just at Harvard but at every
top-flight university where competitive overachievers aspire to
become scientists.
 &HT;    And if it were indeed an avoidable death, the reasons may have
less to do with the reforms already in place and more to do with
chemistry of a different sort _ not the textbook chemistry of
orbitals and bonds, but the more mysterious and nuanced kind
between two extremely bright human beings locked in a typically
intense graduate-school relationship.
 &HT;    Every year in October, when the Nobel Prizes in chemistry,
physics and medicine or physiology are announced, the predictable
parade of American honorees is reported on television and in the
papers with a combination of patriotic glee and almost total
befuddlement about the nature of the work being honored.
 &HT;    Hardly anyone pauses to think about the educational system that
has been so fabulously productive in turning out scientists in this
country. It is a system limited to about 120 research institutions,
and at the upper, rarefied reaches of that system are the elite
universities.
 &HT;    As James Anderson, chairman of Harvard's chemistry department,
puts it: ``The students here are spectacularly good, very bright,
very committed. They want to win Nobel Prizes, and some of them
will, and some of them want to do it before they're 30.''
 &HT;    Graduate study in the sciences, however, is a very unsentimental
education. It requires the intellectual evolution from undergrad
who can ace tests of textbook knowledge to original thinker who can
initiate and execute research about which the textbooks have yet to
be written.
 &HT;    What is less often acknowledged is that this intense education
involves an equally arduous psychological transition, almost a
second rebellious adolescence. The passage from callow,
eager-to-please first-year student in awe of an often-famous
faculty adviser to confident, independent-minded researcher willing
to challenge, and sometimes defy, a mentor is a requisite part of
the journey.
 &HT;    Harvard's Mallinckrodt Laboratory is one of the premier
factories for producing outstanding academic and industrial
chemists. The building stretches for an imposing length of Oxford
Street in Cambridge, its formal entrance flanked by stolid white
pillars, its double green doors topped by an entablature with all
the modesty of a Federal Reserve bank.
 &HT;    On its four floors, and in two adjoining buildings that form the
complex of chemistry buildings at Harvard, corridors open on
laboratory upon laboratory, reagents stacked on shelves, the
ventilated work areas known as hoods constantly sucking fumes away,
the entire building literally throbbing with ventilation.
 &HT;    There are 16 professors with lab groups in these buildings, in
organic and inorganic and physical chemistry, with expertise
ranging from the composition of the ozone hole to the enzymatic
reactions of creatures on the ocean floor. To people who have spent
enough time here, each group has its distinct smells (depending on
the chemistry being done) and each its distinct social tone
(depending on the personality and style of the lab chief).
 &HT;    At this level of achievement, there are no more A's for effort.
As a sign in one lab had it: ``Don't Try. Do.''
 &HT;    The young people who walk through those green doors enter a
world that has aspects both of a foreign country, with its own
language and customs, and of Dante's nine circles of hell, complete
with acrid odors and licking flames. In any given year, there are
roughly 350 young scientists _ half of them graduate students, half
postdoctoral fellows _ who toil in the buildings.
 &HT;    For the five or six years it typically takes to acquire a Ph.D.,
time is both a burden and a gift. Aside from taking classes their
first year, students have the freedom to pursue original research.
Their monthly stipends, after taxes, amount to little more than
$1,000 a month. They are expected to work 60 to 80 hours a week.
 &HT;    ``If it's felt that you're not working hard enough, you feel
that pressure more from the group than from your adviser,'' said
Reed Konsler, a fifth-year graduate student and co-chairman of the
chemistry department's Quality of Life Committee.
 &HT;    These pressures are not unique to Harvard. At the country's
other elite graduate chemistry programs _ at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the University of California at Berkeley,
the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the
Scripps Research Institute _ the stresses are said to be
comparable, but according to some experts, they may be getting
worse.
 &HT;    ``The life of the graduate student is so pressured because the
future is so uncertain,'' said Dr. Edward M. Hallowell, a
psychiatrist who took courses in chemistry at Harvard as an
undergrad and is now on call to the university's chemistry
department. ``Whether you're a graduate student in English
literature or a graduate student in chemistry, there's no guarantee
that you're going to be able to find a job. And then you add the
self-imposed pressures of the students themselves. They want to win
a Nobel Prize yesterday.''
 &HT;    In some fields of chemistry, the job market has never been
better, but Hallowell argues that coping with the overall pressure
has become more difficult. ``I think the kind of supports that used
to be there for people aren't there anymore, like family and
extended family and community and religion, so you get more
isolation,'' he said, ``and isolation is the big enemy.''
 &HT;    Jason was exactly the kind of student Harvard and every other
top-notch science department looks for: bright, outgoing, likably
confident, intellectually mature, and with an inner reserve of
self-reliance that is indispensable to any researcher working on
the cutting edge.
 &HT;    He was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn., the son of Donald and Dianna
Altom. He attended the University of North Carolina with the intent
of studying business, according to friends, but graduated in 1993
as one of its most accomplished chemistry students ever.
 &HT;    With a long, narrow face and an engaging grin, he was known for
his good sense of humor, the methodical way in which he threw
himself into any task (including hobbies) and a taste for setting
the highest goals and challenges for himself and the unrelenting
drive to achieve them.
 &HT;    He was the kind of person who attended to every detail, no
matter how small, in both his science and his spare time: When
assigning friends to bring wine for one of the wine-tasting parties
he occasionally threw, he parenthetically provided the correct
pronunciation of ``chianti.''
 &HT;    By the beginning of 1994, after only four months of graduate
study, Jason chose the adviser he wanted to work with and was
accepted into the laboratory of E.J. Corey.
 &HT;    ``E.J. Corey is one of the most important chemists of our
century,'' says Peter Dervan of Caltech.
 &HT;    Born in Methuen, Mass., and educated at MIT, Corey is one of the
most prolific organic chemists of this century. His area of
specialty is synthetic organic chemistry _ that is, developing new
reactions and building naturally occurring chemical compounds from
scratch. In the course of a career whose productivity is almost
without precedent, he and the members of his lab have synthesized
more than 100 naturally occurring chemical compounds, many of them
with significant medical or industrial implications.
 &HT;    ``He was born brilliant and he'll die brilliant,'' says A.I.
Meyers of Colorado State University. ``I would rank him as one of
the two or three greatest scientists in the century, and the entire
pharmaceutical industry has been living off his chemistry for
years.'' The extended family of Corey group members has published,
by one estimation, a phenomenal 100,000 scientific papers.
 &HT;    Even his most unforgiving critics admit Corey is a gifted
chemist with great intuition, passionate about science above all
else, caring and loyal toward students who show the same passion;
but even his most unabashed admirers admit that his lab is an
intense place.
 &HT;    ``It is stressful,'' says K.C. Nicolaou, a chemistry professor
on the faculties of both the University of California at San Diego
and the Scripps Research Institute. ``To do a Ph.D., very
infrequently does one have a pleasant ride all the time. But I
would do it all over again with Corey. He's a great mentor.''
 &HT;    Meyers agrees: ``He is just an incredibly bright guy, and he
expects everyone around him to perform at a similar level.''
 &HT;    A stressful environment is, at some level, precisely the desired
effect: serving to separate those who have the emotional as well as
intellectual toughness to become scientists from those who don't.
 &HT;    The problem, according to a former graduate student who asked
not to be named, was that Corey cares so much that ``he doesn't
realize the emotional effects of his driving. When you're a
professor, you're not just doing research,'' this student said.
``You're dealing with people during a very difficult transition in
their lives. In the Corey lab, those things don't come into the
calculation. It's just chemistry.''
 &HT;    For his research project, Jason had chosen to synthesize a
molecule called haplophytine, which is, in the words of one lab
mate, ``an obscenely complex compound.'' His initial work had gone
exceedingly well, but on the Saturday he discovered a mistake,
Jason, extremely distraught, phoned his parents in Tennessee.
 &HT;    ``There was a clear concern that he had misidentified the
compound and had provided misleading information to Professor
Corey,'' Donald Altom said in an interview. ``He didn't know how to
discuss that with Professor Corey.'' He was so upset, according to
his parents, that they considered traveling immediately to
Cambridge, but when he seemed better during a phone call the
following Monday, Aug. 3, they felt that he was going to be OK.
 &HT;    At some point in his last two weeks, his friends now believe,
Jason's sense of self-worth became inextricably entangled with
solving that bond.
 &HT;    Corey, who finally consented to an interview after declining
several requests, like everyone else, insisted that he'd had no
idea of the depth of Jason's distress.
 &HT;    ``I would have done everything conceivable to help Jason if I
had had any inkling of his problem,'' Corey said in his plain,
soft-spoken voice. ``But I didn't. He was the last person in the
world I would have expected to commit suicide.''
 &HT;    We spoke in his spacious, sunny, book-lined office on the third
floor of Conant Lab, a plaque on one wall commemorating his Nobel
Prize and numerous sticklike models of chemical structures appended
like talismans to the bookshelves. When the subject was science, a
smile came quickly to his face, but when it turned to suicide, he
became guarded, his arms tightly crossed.
 &HT;    ``I feel badly that I didn't know more about Jason's background
and his day-to-day life,'' he admitted, and was able to recall, by
date and context, many of his extensive last conversations with
Jason, describing with evident pride his student's ``beautiful''
research.
 &HT;    ``If he had troubles, personal troubles,'' Corey said, ``why
wouldn't he seek help from me?''
 &HT;    One possible reason, I suggested, was the atmosphere of fear I
had encountered in the chemistry building. Almost every student I
interviewed was concerned about being quoted by name, and when I
asked why, the answer was always the same. They weren't sure how
their graduate advisers would take it, and it might affect their
careers.
 &HT;    Corey said he felt he had a partnership with his students that
overrode constraints in communication, but as even he admitted,
``Because lines of communication are there doesn't mean there will
be communication.''
 &HT;    In the end, despite all his scientific imagination and insight,
Corey was no less confused than anyone else. ``The more I think
about it,'' he said, ``the more helpless I feel to understand it.
It's beyond my comprehension.''

EATON THRIVES ON THE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Long moments after the Patriots reached
their locker room in Pittsburgh Sunday afternoon, defensive line
coach Ray Hamilton was still sitting in an unusual position _ on
the bench in front of a player's locker, one particular player's
locker.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Eaton's locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally got this guy playing a little bit,'' Hamilton
said as a media member approached. ``It's about time he did
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious pride in Hamilton's voice could not be hidden by the
joshing of his star pupil. Eaton has developed immensely this
season, becoming clearly one of the most improved defensive linemen
in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been kicking him all year,'' Hamilton went on, ``and
he's finally done something. 'Bout time, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, all joshing aside, Hamilton said some heartfelt words to
Eaton: ``Good job, Chad. You did a really good job out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the question was put to Eaton: How has it all happened?
</P>
<P>
   So the lineman turned to the coach and did his own joshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be the coaching, huh?'' said Eaton. ``Ray Hamilton's a
great coach.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that the New England defense has played two
stronger games than it had been playing since Eaton returned after
a leg injury. Eaton has played two immense games, leading the team
in tackles against the Bills and again against the Steelers, also
sacking Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart three times and
causing a key fumble in the second half when he knocked the ball
out of Jerome Bettis's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Eaton _ who always speaks his mind _ said before the
Buffalo game that the Patriots would do a better job stopping the
Bills' running game than they had two weeks earlier. The
difference? ``I'm the difference,'' said Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills obligingly posted Eaton's words on their locker-room
bulletin board, but he backed them up. Buffalo had gained 213 yards
rushing against New England in the first meeting _ when Eaton was
out of the lineup _ but was held to 99 in the rematch at
Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   But in Pittsburgh, Eaton topped that effort. That's because he
was often going against Dermontti Dawson, who is almost universally
regarded as the most dominant center in the NFL. But it was Eaton,
not Dawson, who dominated that matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Was this his best game ever?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Eaton. ``Wasn't it last week against the
Bills?''
</P>
<P>
   For once, Eaton gave a stock answer when asked to explain more
about his superlative play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just being healthy,'' said the lineman. ``It's just
coming back from injury and being healthy enough to make the
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, any rational observer would have said that Eaton
would be the last player in the NFL to ever be in such a spotlight.
He seemed a fringe player at best, and a frivolous one going
through a Dennis Rodman phase, dyeing his hair a different hue week
by week.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, after a dramatic 28-25 come-from-behind victory over
the Bills in Foxborough in 1996, Eaton shocked media members when
they chatted with him the next day. ``Did we win?'' he asked with a
straight face.
</P>
<P>
   But now Eaton's hair is his natural blond color week to week,
and his fame, if not notoriety, is being earned on the field, not
off it. Word of defensive linemen spreads slowly in the NFL, as
does a growth in reputation, but any who watch the tapes of Eaton
against Dawson would have to come away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's great _ the best,'' said Eaton. ``No question about
it, he's the best. He's amazing. I had to have a game like this to
develop confidence for myself. You know, for me to say, `If he's
the best and I play well against him . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton let that thought remain hanging. But the thought can be
completed by any who watched the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? I'm maturing,'' Eaton said. ``I'm becoming
a good defensive tackle here in the NFL. But the real thing
happening is the way our defensive line works together. We work
together to shut down the run and we make them throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That's happened two weeks in a row, against teams supposedly
with strong running attacks, as first Doug Flutie had to throw and
scramble more than expected, and then Stewart had to do what he
does not do particularly well _ throw time and again from the
pocket. Even then, the pressure from Eaton and the Patriots'
blitzing left Stewart with little time to make the right throw. And
with Stewart strangely no longer a running quarterback, the New
England defense held the upper hand. All told, the Steelers gained
just 54 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   All this happened with Ted Johnson gone from the field with a
torn biceps two plays into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't let down then,'' said Eaton. ``Out on the field,
you can't sit there and say, `Oh, it's over with, Ted's gone, we're
screwed.' We needed guys to step up then. Marty Moore stepped up,
and a lot of guys stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   None more so than Chad Eaton.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Crashed on the couch, head back, legs stretched
forward, Jackie Burke breathed deeply through the tube in her nose.
She felt something. She was sure of it. She just wasn't sure what.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nose itches, I know that,'' she said after 20 minutes of
gentle inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Added her friend Gail Nesbitt, ``I just wish it was quieter. I
wanted the most out of my air.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Burke and Nesbitt felt, they said it wasn't bamboozled,
even though they had just paid $15 a pop for flavored,
oxygen-enriched air. For their money, they had gotten to hang out
at a new West Hollywood hot spot, the aptly named O2, and get in on
a trend before it takes off or dies. As Burke, a freelance producer
with the E Entertainment Network, put it, ``I just thought, `Where
else can you go to buy air that tastes like orange or mint?' ''
</P>
<P>
   O2 _ owned by actor and hemperor Woody Harrelson, his wife Laura
Louie, and a physician and holistic healer who goes by the moniker
Dr. D _ pitches itself as the place to rejuvenate in smoggy LA.
Located on Sunset Boulevard, across the street from Spago's and a
block from the Viper Room, where actor River Phoenix died of a drug
overdose, O2 is anti virtually everything in the neighborhood _
except, of course, celebrity. Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, and
Bill Maher all hooked up to oxygen tubes for the October opening.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weeknight, the crowd was less recognizable but clad
in head-to-toe black. The live music was jazzy, and the mood was
calculatedly earthy in a see-and-be-seen way. With only four
tables, the front-room restaurant that serves uncooked organic
vegan food and has a domed ceiling replete with painted clouds and
stars was full for hours. The bar was packed with people ordering
$6 drinks that contain no alcohol but are still purported to pack a
punch. The pungent herbal and fruity concoctions, with names like
``Don Juan Colada'' and ``Fast Screw'' are supposed to boost the
libido, banish anxiety, or make mind magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no hangovers here, but people still get off,'' said
Dr. D, whose real name is Richard DeAndria. ``You won't see the
walls melting, but you will become more open to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the oxygen sold in the back room is what makes O2, well, O2.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen, as Dr. D explained, run through a device that
extracts it from the air then remixes it in purer form. There are
no storage requirements, no fire hazards. Flavors are optional, for
$2.
</P>
<P>
   The customers swig the oxygen through clear plastic nose tubes,
just like the kind hospitals use. They are, obviously, disposable
and recyclable. But the overall effect is less medical than
mystical; the tubes are attached to tall eastern smoking pipes
known as hookahs, giving the room a playful casbah feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel all tingly,'' said Andriano Serafini, an actor who was
buying oxygen for the first time the other night. ``My senses are
aware. My nose, my eyes, my skin. . . . Curiosity made me do it
this time. I think I'd do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Douglas Walth, a billboard printer who was sitting
cross-legged with his eyes closed on the couch that takes up an
entire wall. Sandwiched between strangers, he was inhaling oxygen
flavored with ``Joy,'' and insisted it was having the desired
effect. The taste was ``incredible,'' he said softly, plus he felt
``light and energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, reported feeling no buzz at all.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through her 20 minutes, the standard ``hit'' of enriched
air, administrative assistant Oksana Lynyova was still waiting for
the oxygen to kick in. But, she added, she hadn't had any
expectations and so it was impossible to be disappointed. And this
being LA, she added that she was glad for the New Age-y experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd come back, but only for the food,'' Lynyova said. ``It's
an excellent idea, because it's a new way of experiencing things.
But I can tell you that for me, meditation is much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical community, in fact, is divided over the benefits of
oxygen-enriched air. While few oppose it, many doctors do stress
that there is sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere for most people,
except those who have special breathing problems. Too much of it,
some say, can even be unhealthy, oxidizing certain tissues and
speeding up aging _ anathema in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of extra helpings of oxygen say a deficiency can
make people more susceptible to allergens and infections, and cause
cell degeneration. The US Food and Drug Administration approves of
oxygen therapy for migraines and headaches, among other medical
problems. And O2 isn't the only, or even first, oxygen bar. New
York, Toronto, even Hong Kong, can claim them, too, but Boston
can't yet.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dr. D said he gulps oxygen every day and he looks
healthy enough in his green wool cap, beaded hemp shirt, and
fashionably baggy pants. Then again, he hasn't eaten meat products
in seven years and doesn't even cook his food anymore, preferring
to preserve every possible nutrient. When he's not at O2, he runs a
West LA practice that combines Chinese medicine, chiropractic, and
other alternative medical therapies, including oxygen therapy. Dr.
D declines to give his age _ saying he will when someone can give
him a good definition of time. But he must be in his 30s, though he
looks to be in his 20s. The oxygen, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a place where there was good, nutritious food for the
body, oxygen as a deep breath for the soul, and mind-altering
drinks,'' said Dr. D, who approached fellow vegan Harrelson with
the idea for O2. ``Oxygen has different effects, depending where
you are. It brings you back to zero point. If you're jittery, it
calms you. If you have a headache, it'll help relieve it. If you
get stuck in traffic and feel uptight, you go in there for 20
minutes of oxygen and you're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen, according to Dr. D, also works on hangovers. Since
O2 serves no alcohol, it can stay open until 4 a.m., turning it
into an after-hours club for the drinking crowd. Twenty minutes on
the nose tube and a couple of $6 herbal mixes later, Dr. D said,
and the unhealthy are almost but not quite as healthy as new. At
least they feel that way, and fads have been born from less.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When she died, a multitude came down to the old dwelling off the
Bowery to pay their respects, the way people had come to Catholic
Worker houses for soup ever since the Depression. There were
Catholic Workers, social workers, migrant workers, the unemployed;
addicts, alcoholics, anarchists; Protestants, Jews and agnostics;
the devout and the strident and the curious, there to see what a
saint looked like.
 &HT;    Dorothy Day died in 1980, at the age of 83. She was one of the
greatest religious figures of the century, and one of the most
paradoxical. She was a Catholic and she was an anarchist. She
condemned poverty and she advocated it.
 &HT;    She founded the Catholic Worker, a loose aggregation of ``houses
of hospitality,'' communal farms, newspapers and round-table
discussions for ``further clarification of thought'' _ and called
her memoirs ``The Long Loneliness.'' The movement was wary of
authority, yet revered her as its leader. She humbled herself
before God and sat for a portrait by Richard Avedon.
 &HT;    ``Don't call me a saint _ I don't want to be dismissed that
easily,'' she once said, to no avail. A year ago, to mark what
would have been her 100th birthday (Nov. 8 would have been her
101st), John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, a lifelong admirer,
announced that he would take up the cause for her canonization.
``If anybody in our time can be called a saint, she can,'' he said.
 &HT;    It was an honor, and it was another paradox. For the prospect
that Dorothy Day might be declared a saint was welcomed by
everybody except the Catholic Workers, the very people pledged to
emulate her sanctity today.
 &HT;    The old-time Catholic Workers who were close to Day support the
canonization effort wholeheartedly. But many Workers, especially
the younger ones, see the church remaking a rebel for its own
purposes, and find her synthesis of rock-ribbed Catholicism and
radical politics impossible to attain today.
 &HT;    They find it twisted that Day, a pacifist who opposed even World
War II, should be celebrated by Rear Adm. John J. O'Connor,
retired, a former head chaplain to the U.S. Navy. They object to
his notion that Day _ who became a Catholic after having an
abortion _ could become a poster saint for the church's
anti-abortion efforts.
 &HT;    ``People feel that Dorothy's too good for the church, and are
afraid of what will happen once the church gets its mitts on her,''
says Robert Ellsberg, a former Catholic Worker, now the editor in
chief of Orbis Books, a progressive Catholic press.
 &HT;    When Day's sainthood was first brought up 15 years ago, one of
her nine granddaughters called the idea ``sick.''
 &HT;    Then the high priest of the Catholic left weighed in. ``Her
spirit haunts us in the violated faces of the homeless in New
York,'' Daniel Berrigan wrote. ``Can you imagine her portrait, all
gussied up, unfurled from above the high altar of St. Peter's?''
 &HT;    The conflict has since taken shape as a battle over property,
with the Workers claiming squatter's rights to Day's legacy while
the church exercises its power of eminent domain. Those in favor of
sainthood depict her as ``a loyal servant of the church Jesus had
founded'' (her words) who prayed the rosary on the barricades.
 &HT;    Those opposed are afraid the Vatican's saint-making priests will
evict her from the underworld of tenements, flophouses, rallies and
jails and recast her as the Patron Saint of Soup Kitchens, a
kindhearted woman who dabbled in anarchism on the side.
 &HT;    ``They're going to take the best of Dorothy and remove it, like
a lobotomy,'' says Jeff Dietrich, a Catholic Worker in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Saints, in the Catholic tradition, are holy people who call
forth the devotion of the faithful, even after they are dead. Since
becoming pope in 1978, John Paul II has canonized 280 saints, more
than any previous pope. And the Vatican has simplified the process,
reducing from four to two the number of miracles needed (say, the
inexplicable cure of a person who prayed for the saint's aid) and
doing away with the ``devil's advocate,'' who argued against the
prospective saint's cause.
 &HT;    Why so many saints? John Paul doubtless has a number of
objectives. The new saints reflect the worldwide presence of the
church and stand in contrast to the modern cult of the self. But
mainly they embody John Paul's view of history. Whereas many popes
have seen the church as above or outside of history, he sees the
church in the thick of it. So he has made saints of people who made
history, however controversially.
 &HT;    In October, for example, when he canonized Edith Stein, a Jewish
philosopher who converted to Catholicism, became a nun, then was
killed as a Jew at Auschwitz, he affirmed _ defying scruple _ in
effect that the church was on the right side of history during the
Holocaust, suffering with the Jewish people.
 &HT;    The ensuing controversy hung on whether Stein died as a Catholic
or as a Jew. The controversy over Day is different. Nobody would
deny that she was a Catholic, and most people think she was a
saint, even those who care little for the church. What complicates
matters is that these people don't agree about what it was that
made her saintly.
 &HT;    The tussle over her legacy is no simple tug-of-war between the
Catholic left and the Roman right. It involves a range of
conceptions of what it means to be Catholic, and the one that
prevails very likely will be the prevailing form of Catholicism in
the next century.
 &HT;    O'Connor went to Rome in September, taking a sheaf of
recollections of Day written by her old friends. Meanwhile, in
flats and tumbledown farmhouses and ``houses of hospitality,''
Catholic Workers are watching his every move. Their friend and
foundress is their pearl of great price. Each day she passes
further out of their hands and into those of the church. If they
are a touch possessive, who can blame them?
 &HT;    Before she was a saint, Day was a bohemian in Greenwich Village,
drinking all night and wandering into strange churches at dawn. She
rallied for the masses, went to jail, married on the rebound, wrote
a novel, fell in love and bore a child, all before she abruptly
became a Catholic at age 30 in 1927. Her lover scorned her. So did
her radical friends.
 &HT;    Twice a year, the patrons of the Radical New York Walking Tour
pause at St. Joseph House on East First Street to hear this story
of Dorothy Day.
 &HT;    One afternoon in 1932 she returned home to find Peter Maurin, a
French ``troubadour of God,'' waiting for her. They founded the
Catholic Worker there and then.
 &HT;    Day called her Catholic Worker column ``On Pilgrimage,'' and she
crisscrossed the country by bus to visit Catholic Worker houses,
taking her breviary, her diary and a jar of instant coffee. She
went to Cuba to meet Castro and to Rome to fast in St. Peter's
Square for peace, yet was so identified with the Lower East Side
that people would invariably show up at St. Joseph House and expect
her to greet them at the door.
 &HT;    The house still looks the way it did when Day was in charge,
furnished with beat-up chairs and a cast-iron stove out of a Grimm
tale. A pot of coffee brews perpetually. The movement names no
leaders; in New York, the closest thing is Carmen Trotta, a
musclebound 35-year-old man with thick brown hair.
 &HT;    He and I set out to join a few old-time Workers for further
clarification of thought at a local bar. ``In the old days,'' he
says, ``the Workers would stand on the corner selling copies of the
paper until they had enough change for a drink. You'd have to sell
an awful lot of papers today.''
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker newspaper still costs a penny a copy. It is
still a broad sheet full of articles about labor, politics and the
life of faith, with a statement of ``Aims and Means'': yes to
``personalism,'' manual labor and a green revolution, no to usury
and bureaucracy. But the subject between the lines is change.
 &HT;    While Day and Maurin aspired to ``build a new society within the
shell of the old,'' today a new society is being built in the shell
of the old Lower East Side. Galleries and boutiques have replaced
the junk shops and flophouses. The Workers used to serve 300 meals
a day; now they serve half as many.
 &HT;    Some people have suggested that the Catholic Workers have
outlived their mission in the Village, but they are there to stay,
questioning change. How should they respond to gentrification _ by
protesting, by homesteading or by founding a satellite house in the
Bronx? Should they welcome Ivy League volunteers who want to pad
their resumes, or insist on poverty as a way of life?
 &HT;    These questions are usually answered through further
clarification of thought. So Trotta spends many hours with the
old-timers asking them what Dorothy would have done.
 &HT;    Yet Day's refusal to institutionalize the movement has left
Catholic Worker houses elsewhere free to experiment. Unity Kitchen
Committee in Syracuse offers ``lavish hospitality'' _ dinner with
china, cutlery and fresh flowers _ as a response to Day's adage
that ``nothing is too good for the poor.'' Casa Juan Diego in
Houston provides English classes, sanctuary for illegal aliens,
first aid for battered women and coffins for the dead.
 &HT;    After the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced plans to build a
new cathedral _ estimated cost, $163 million _ Catholic Workers
broke into the old one and hung a banner out the bell tower: ``We
Reclaim the Church for the Poor.''
 &HT;    So it is no great surprise that the Catholic Workers have as
many ways of being Catholic as of serving soup. A house in
California sponsored ``a gay marriage'' (the two men later
``divorced''), and one in Denver held a mock Mass led by some
Sisters of Loreto. ``There are some crazy joints out there, some
things that would turn a bishop's hair a little whiter,'' says Tom
Cornell, an old Worker who now lives at Peter Maurin Farm in
upstate New York.
 &HT;    How vital is the Catholic faith to the Catholic Worker's
mission? Ann O'Connor of Unity Kitchen thinks the Worker must be
more faithful to the church. Jeff Dietrich thinks the church must
become more like the Worker, strengthening its ``prophetic
dimension'' through street protests.
 &HT;    And while Mark and Louise Zwick of Casa Juan Diego in Houston
think prayer and worship are as vital as rice and beans (when
supplies run low, they pray), the Workers at St. Francis of Assisi
House in Chicago say that they are first and foremost anarchists.
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker is Catholic, but it is unsure how or why.
Its members hold beliefs ranging from traditionalism to the radical
fringe, with each deciding for himself or herself what the faith
is. It is like the Catholic Church throughout the United States,
that is, and the question _ in the movement, and in the church _ is
whether this diversity is a form of strength or a kind of religious
decadence.
 &HT;    ``Dorothy Day was a romantic of poverty _ she saw poverty as a
sign of God's presence,'' says Francis Cardinal George, the new
archbishop of Chicago. ``Her view is important. It will always be
important. But it will always be on the fringes of the church as a
corrective, not as mainstream Catholicism. Anarchy is not
mainstream Catholicism.''
 &HT;    And one would expect this view from a traditional Catholic
churchman, celebrating a holy woman for her fidelity to the church.
 &HT;    Indeed, Day must be held up as an ordinary, decent Catholic whom
the people in the pews can emulate, even as they vote their
pocketbooks. ``For Catholic Workers, the soup line is the think
tank and the seminar room,'' says Patrick Jordan, an editor of
Commonweal and a former Catholic Worker. ``That's where you make
policy.''
 &HT;    When Day became pregnant in 1919, the father threatened to leave
her unless she aborted the child. She did so, but he left her
anyway. When she became pregnant again, this time by a man she
loved, ``I knew that I was going to have my baby baptized a
Catholic, cost what it may,'' she said. It cost her her lover. Her
conversion followed.
 &HT;    Today, while many, even most, Catholic Workers see abortion as
an act of violence that must be resisted, they see the church's
campaign against legal abortion as an attempt to enlist the state
to enforce holiness.
 &HT;    When USA Today reported O'Connor's remark that Day might become
``the patron saint of the pro-life movement,'' many Workers were
alarmed.
 &HT;    At a meeting in Nashua, N.H., an old Worker named Jack Cook rose
in his chair and denounced the plan as ``a form of spiritual
abuse.'' He was applauded. ``She could have, at any time, come out
publicly and politically against abortion,'' Cook explained. ``She
did not. ... When she spoke of abortion, it was in terms of
forgiveness, not criminality.''
 &HT;    Day's response to abortion is crucial to the canonization
process because she is a role model for thousands of Catholic women
in the United States, an American Mother Teresa. The two figures _
who met in India in 1970 _ are often cast as the two archetypes of
contemporary Catholic activism: one a nun who stressed charity, the
other a lay woman who called for justice.
 &HT;    In a talk last year, though, the Jesuit priest Thomas Reese
stressed what they had in common _ not as women but as devout
Catholics who had devoted themselves to fixing the world rather
than reforming the church.
 &HT;    Reese went on to ask why so many Catholics are bent on the
latter, why the conflicts among Catholics often seem like quarrels
over a brand name, with the players so worked up over what it means
to be Catholic that they lose sight of the holy.
 &HT;    The obvious reason is that the church stands in need of reform.
But there are reasons behind the reasons. It may be that the
Catholic leaders who would confront society _ the Mother Teresas
and Dorothy Days _ are in short supply.
 &HT;    The experts expatiate on the shortage of priests, but the real
shortage is of authentic Catholic leaders of any kind _ of the
saints among the living, that is.

 &HT;    Yet Day's refusal to institutionalize the movement has left
Catholic Worker houses elsewhere free to experiment. Unity Kitchen
Committee in Syracuse offers ``lavish hospitality'' _ dinner with
china, cutlery and fresh flowers _ as a response to Day's adage
that ``nothing is too good for the poor.'' Casa Juan Diego in
Houston provides English classes, sanctuary for illegal aliens,
first aid for battered women and coffins for the dead.
 &HT;    After the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced plans to build a
new cathedral _ estimated cost, $163 million _ Catholic Workers
broke into the old one and hung a banner out the bell tower: ``We
Reclaim the Church for the Poor.''
 &HT;    So it is no great surprise that the Catholic Workers have as
many ways of being Catholic as of serving soup. A house in
California sponsored ``a gay marriage'' (the two men later
``divorced''), and one in Denver held a mock Mass led by some
Sisters of Loreto. ``There are some crazy joints out there, some
things that would turn a bishop's hair a little whiter,'' says Tom
Cornell, an old Worker who now lives at Peter Maurin Farm in
upstate New York.
 &HT;    How vital is the Catholic faith to the Catholic Worker's
mission? Ann O'Connor of Unity Kitchen thinks the Worker must be
more faithful to the church. Jeff Dietrich thinks the church must
become more like the Worker, strengthening its ``prophetic
dimension'' through street protests.
 &HT;    And while Mark and Louise Zwick of Casa Juan Diego in Houston
think prayer and worship are as vital as rice and beans (when
supplies run low, they pray), the Workers at St. Francis of Assisi
House in Chicago say that they are first and foremost anarchists.
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker is Catholic, but it is unsure how or why.
Its members hold beliefs ranging from traditionalism to the radical
fringe, with each deciding for himself or herself what the faith
is. It is like the Catholic Church throughout the United States,
that is, and the question _ in the movement, and in the church _ is
whether this diversity is a form of strength or a kind of religious
decadence.
 &HT;    ``Dorothy Day was a romantic of poverty _ she saw poverty as a
sign of God's presence,'' says Francis Cardinal George, the new
archbishop of Chicago. ``Her view is important. It will always be
important. But it will always be on the fringes of the church as a
corrective, not as mainstream Catholicism. Anarchy is not
mainstream Catholicism.''
 &HT;    And one would expect this view from a traditional Catholic
churchman, celebrating a holy woman for her fidelity to the church.
 &HT;    Indeed, Day must be held up as an ordinary, decent Catholic whom
the people in the pews can emulate, even as they vote their
pocketbooks. ``For Catholic Workers, the soup line is the think
tank and the seminar room,'' says Patrick Jordan, an editor of
Commonweal and a former Catholic Worker. ``That's where you make
policy.''
 &HT;    When Day became pregnant in 1919, the father threatened to leave
her unless she aborted the child. She did so, but he left her
anyway. When she became pregnant again, this time by a man she
loved, ``I knew that I was going to have my baby baptized a
Catholic, cost what it may,'' she said. It cost her her lover. Her
conversion followed.
 &HT;    Today, while many, even most, Catholic Workers see abortion as
an act of violence that must be resisted, they see the church's
campaign against legal abortion as an attempt to enlist the state
to enforce holiness.
 &HT;    When USA Today reported O'Connor's remark that Day might become
``the patron saint of the pro-life movement,'' many Workers were
alarmed.
 &HT;    At a meeting in Nashua, N.H., an old Worker named Jack Cook rose
in his chair and denounced the plan as ``a form of spiritual
abuse.'' He was applauded. ``She could have, at any time, come out
publicly and politically against abortion,'' Cook explained. ``She
did not. ... When she spoke of abortion, it was in terms of
forgiveness, not criminality.''
 &HT;    Day's response to abortion is crucial to the canonization
process because she is a role model for thousands of Catholic women
in the United States, an American Mother Teresa. The two figures _
who met in India in 1970 _ are often cast as the two archetypes of
contemporary Catholic activism: one a nun who stressed charity, the
other a lay woman who called for justice.
 &HT;    In a talk last year, though, the Jesuit priest Thomas Reese
stressed what they had in common _ not as women but as devout
Catholics who had devoted themselves to fixing the world rather
than reforming the church.
 &HT;    Reese went on to ask why so many Catholics are bent on the
latter, why the conflicts among Catholics often seem like quarrels
over a brand name, with the players so worked up over what it means
to be Catholic that they lose sight of the holy.
 &HT;    The obvious reason is that the church stands in need of reform.
But there are reasons behind the reasons. It may be that the
Catholic leaders who would confront society _ the Mother Teresas
and Dorothy Days _ are in short supply.
 &HT;    The experts expatiate on the shortage of priests, but the real
shortage is of authentic Catholic leaders of any kind _ of the
saints among the living, that is.

<P>
   Remember back in preschool when you learned the primary colors?
Red was red. Black was black. And your parents could order clothes
from a catalog easily.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, are those days over. Now, no one dares use a boring name
like yellow. By order of marketing gurus everywhere, it seems it
was decided: to be chic, color names must be as obscure as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this year we have the Eddie Bauer holiday preview book,
which includes ``tobacco'' cardigans (not smoking jackets, merely
dark brown sweaters); ``maritime'' corduroy pants (they're navy
blue but not necessarily for the sea) and ``saddle'' coats (tan and
not to be confused with riding jackets).
</P>
<P>
   Flip through J. Crew's latest book and you'll find a ``port''
sweater (burgundy), a ``stone'' coat (off-white, although it could
have been pink when you consider all the colors of stones in the
world), and a ``barley heather'' sweater ( a.k.a.beige).
</P>
<P>
   L. L. Bean's fall catalog offers ``rich navy'' (as opposed to
dull navy?), ``banker's gray'' (is there any other kind?), and
ocean green (is the ocean green?). And the Donna Morgan book is
downright appetizing with a ``cappuccino'' pant suit, a
``portabello'' satin evening dress, and a ``cafe latte'' satin
gown.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say shoppers can thank the cosmetics industry for the
silly trend, which started in the late 1980s and gained momentum in
the '90s among clothing companies. ``Cosmetics companies have new
palettes every season,'' says Jill Carey, an assistant professor of
fashion at Lasell College in Newton. ``They give them these really
rich-sounding names. It's all part of attractive advertising . . .
and young people love it. It's like a status symbol somehow. They
know the colors of their makeup and the palettes of their garments.
If I say `I like your lipstick,' they say `It's MAC and it's
cappuccino.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion houses insist the trend isn't a marketing gimmick _ that
fabric mills worldwide require them to make up quirky names every
season so the mills can distinguish one dye from another over the
years. ``There's a specific formula for each color,'' says Sharon
Goldsmith, design assistant at Donna Morgan in New York. ``They
have a formulation for brown. If we change the fabric slightly,
they can't use the word brown again. So we say cappuccino . . .
It's really very technical,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And it's become such a headache for fashion houses like Morgan
to come up with original names that they're now turning to flower
and plant encylopedias, spices, foods, precious stones, metals,
mother nature, and even museum exhibits for ideas. ``For us, it's
hard,'' says Goldsmith. ``We might have 15 different colors per
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the darn marketing department to please. Some color
names are deemed too wordy. Others are too silly. Still others _
like ``pastoral green'' _ just too vague. Morgan's sales department
nixed it for ``kiwi.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, with copywriting like this, there's the issue of
redundancy. How many different shades of greens are there, for
heaven's sake? Eddie Bauer uses celadon, basil, alpine green, dark
pine, cactus, mallard, juniper, dark spruce, and thyme. Its blues
include peacock, lagoon, twilight, loganberry, patriot blue,
brilliant blue, admiral blue, bluebell, and oh, blue.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the problem of consistency. Just when a shopper
gets used to the shade of ``twig'' in one book, he or she may find
it a very different tone in another. The mills, theoretically,
could have a dark ``twig'' recipe for Donna Karan and a light
``twig'' recipe for Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   After all the effort involved in making up fabulous color names,
one has to wonder _ do customers really want to consult color
charts and dictionaries before they decide on an order? Why can't
the industry revert to the old days and just have one color formula
for black? ``I just want to buy something that's red,'' groans
Marilyn Santiesteban, president of the image consulting firm First
Impressions in Newton. ``What they've done to colors is complicate
the whole thing . . . Catalog shopping is supposed to be easy.''
</P>

names on the left with the descriptions on the right. The answers

 By PAUL ELIE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When she died, a multitude came down to the old dwelling off the
Bowery to pay their respects, the way people had come to Catholic
Worker houses for soup ever since the Depression. There were
Catholic Workers, social workers, migrant workers, the unemployed;
addicts, alcoholics, anarchists; Protestants, Jews and agnostics;
the devout and the strident and the curious, there to see what a
saint looked like.
 &HT;    Dorothy Day died in 1980, at the age of 83. She was one of the
greatest religious figures of the century, and one of the most
paradoxical. She was a Catholic and she was an anarchist. She
condemned poverty and she advocated it.
 &HT;    She founded the Catholic Worker, a loose aggregation of ``houses
of hospitality,'' communal farms, newspapers and round-table
discussions for ``further clarification of thought'' _ and called
her memoirs ``The Long Loneliness.'' The movement was wary of
authority, yet revered her as its leader. She humbled herself
before God and sat for a portrait by Richard Avedon.
 &HT;    ``Don't call me a saint _ I don't want to be dismissed that
easily,'' she once said, to no avail. A year ago, to mark what
would have been her 100th birthday (Nov. 8 would have been her
101st), John Cardinal O'Connor of New York, a lifelong admirer,
announced that he would take up the cause for her canonization.
``If anybody in our time can be called a saint, she can,'' he said.
 &HT;    It was an honor, and it was another paradox. For the prospect
that Dorothy Day might be declared a saint was welcomed by
everybody except the Catholic Workers, the very people pledged to
emulate her sanctity today.
 &HT;    The old-time Catholic Workers who were close to Day support the
canonization effort wholeheartedly. But many Workers, especially
the younger ones, see the church remaking a rebel for its own
purposes, and find her synthesis of rock-ribbed Catholicism and
radical politics impossible to attain today.
 &HT;    They find it twisted that Day, a pacifist who opposed even World
War II, should be celebrated by Rear Adm. John J. O'Connor,
retired, a former head chaplain to the U.S. Navy. They object to
his notion that Day _ who became a Catholic after having an
abortion _ could become a poster saint for the church's
anti-abortion efforts.
 &HT;    ``People feel that Dorothy's too good for the church, and are
afraid of what will happen once the church gets its mitts on her,''
says Robert Ellsberg, a former Catholic Worker, now the editor in
chief of Orbis Books, a progressive Catholic press.
 &HT;    When Day's sainthood was first brought up 15 years ago, one of
her nine granddaughters called the idea ``sick.''
 &HT;    Then the high priest of the Catholic left weighed in. ``Her
spirit haunts us in the violated faces of the homeless in New
York,'' Daniel Berrigan wrote. ``Can you imagine her portrait, all
gussied up, unfurled from above the high altar of St. Peter's?''
 &HT;    The conflict has since taken shape as a battle over property,
with the Workers claiming squatter's rights to Day's legacy while
the church exercises its power of eminent domain. Those in favor of
sainthood depict her as ``a loyal servant of the church Jesus had
founded'' (her words) who prayed the rosary on the barricades.
 &HT;    Those opposed are afraid the Vatican's saint-making priests will
evict her from the underworld of tenements, flophouses, rallies and
jails and recast her as the Patron Saint of Soup Kitchens, a
kindhearted woman who dabbled in anarchism on the side.
 &HT;    ``They're going to take the best of Dorothy and remove it, like
a lobotomy,'' says Jeff Dietrich, a Catholic Worker in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Saints, in the Catholic tradition, are holy people who call
forth the devotion of the faithful, even after they are dead. Since
becoming pope in 1978, John Paul II has canonized 280 saints, more
than any previous pope. And the Vatican has simplified the process,
reducing from four to two the number of miracles needed (say, the
inexplicable cure of a person who prayed for the saint's aid) and
doing away with the ``devil's advocate,'' who argued against the
prospective saint's cause.
 &HT;    Why so many saints? John Paul doubtless has a number of
objectives. The new saints reflect the worldwide presence of the
church and stand in contrast to the modern cult of the self. But
mainly they embody John Paul's view of history. Whereas many popes
have seen the church as above or outside of history, he sees the
church in the thick of it. So he has made saints of people who made
history, however controversially.
 &HT;    In October, for example, when he canonized Edith Stein, a Jewish
philosopher who converted to Catholicism, became a nun, then was
killed as a Jew at Auschwitz, he affirmed _ defying scruple _ in
effect that the church was on the right side of history during the
Holocaust, suffering with the Jewish people.
 &HT;    The ensuing controversy hung on whether Stein died as a Catholic
or as a Jew. The controversy over Day is different. Nobody would
deny that she was a Catholic, and most people think she was a
saint, even those who care little for the church. What complicates
matters is that these people don't agree about what it was that
made her saintly.
 &HT;    The tussle over her legacy is no simple tug-of-war between the
Catholic left and the Roman right. It involves a range of
conceptions of what it means to be Catholic, and the one that
prevails very likely will be the prevailing form of Catholicism in
the next century.
 &HT;    O'Connor went to Rome in September, taking a sheaf of
recollections of Day written by her old friends. Meanwhile, in
flats and tumbledown farmhouses and ``houses of hospitality,''
Catholic Workers are watching his every move. Their friend and
foundress is their pearl of great price. Each day she passes
further out of their hands and into those of the church. If they
are a touch possessive, who can blame them?
 &HT;    Before she was a saint, Day was a bohemian in Greenwich Village,
drinking all night and wandering into strange churches at dawn. She
rallied for the masses, went to jail, married on the rebound, wrote
a novel, fell in love and bore a child, all before she abruptly
became a Catholic at age 30 in 1927. Her lover scorned her. So did
her radical friends.
 &HT;    Twice a year, the patrons of the Radical New York Walking Tour
pause at St. Joseph House on East First Street to hear this story
of Dorothy Day.
 &HT;    One afternoon in 1932 she returned home to find Peter Maurin, a
French ``troubadour of God,'' waiting for her. They founded the
Catholic Worker there and then.
 &HT;    Day called her Catholic Worker column ``On Pilgrimage,'' and she
crisscrossed the country by bus to visit Catholic Worker houses,
taking her breviary, her diary and a jar of instant coffee. She
went to Cuba to meet Castro and to Rome to fast in St. Peter's
Square for peace, yet was so identified with the Lower East Side
that people would invariably show up at St. Joseph House and expect
her to greet them at the door.
 &HT;    The house still looks the way it did when Day was in charge,
furnished with beat-up chairs and a cast-iron stove out of a Grimm
tale. A pot of coffee brews perpetually. The movement names no
leaders; in New York, the closest thing is Carmen Trotta, a
musclebound 35-year-old man with thick brown hair.
 &HT;    He and I set out to join a few old-time Workers for further
clarification of thought at a local bar. ``In the old days,'' he
says, ``the Workers would stand on the corner selling copies of the
paper until they had enough change for a drink. You'd have to sell
an awful lot of papers today.''
 &HT;    The Catholic Worker newspaper still costs a penny a copy. It is
still a broad sheet full of articles about labor, politics and the
life of faith, with a statement of ``Aims and Means'': yes to
``personalism,'' manual labor and a green revolution, no to usury
and bureaucracy. But the subject between the lines is change.
 &HT;    While Day and Maurin aspired to ``build a new society within the
shell of the old,'' today a new society is being built in the shell
of the old Lower East Side. Galleries and boutiques have replaced
the junk shops and flophouses. The Workers used to serve 300 meals
a day; now they serve half as many.
 &HT;    Some people have suggested that the Catholic Workers have
outlived their mission in the Village, but they are there to stay,
questioning change. How should they respond to gentrification _ by
protesting, by homesteading or by founding a satellite house in the
Bronx? Should they welcome Ivy League volunteers who want to pad
their resumes, or insist on poverty as a way of life?
 &HT;    These questions are usually answered through further
clarification of thought. So Trotta spends many hours with the
old-timers asking them what Dorothy would have done.
 &HT;    Yet Day's refusal to institutionalize the movement has left
Catholic Worker houses elsewhere free to experiment. Unity Kitchen
Committee in Syracuse offers ``lavish hospitality'' _ dinner with
china, cutlery and fresh flowers _ as a response to Day's adage
that ``nothing is too good for the poor.'' Casa Juan Diego in
Houston provides English classes, sanctuary for illegal aliens,
first aid for battered women and coffins for the dead.
 &HT;    After the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced plans to build a
new cathedral _ estimated cost, $163 million _ Catholic Workers
broke into the old one and hung a banner out the bell tower: ``We
Reclaim the Church for the Poor.''
 &HT;    So it is no great surprise that the Catholic Workers have as

 &HT;    It is a rainy day several months before the peace agreement in
Kosovo, and I have come to find out about the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the ethnic-Albanian guerrilla movement fighting for
independence from Serbia.
 &HT;    Nobody seems to know how the group started or who is in charge
of it, but word among Albanians in New York is that Triangle's
owner, Florin Krasniqi, is one of its principal fund-raisers.
 &HT;    The 34-year-old contractor has a muscular build, dark, serious
eyes and a no-nonsense manner. He is friendly, but it is clear he
has things to do and talking to me is not one of his priorities. I
ask if he raises money for the guerrilla army.
 &HT;    ``I thought you knew that,'' he says matter-of-factly. He hands
me an Albanian newspaper, ``Zeri i Kosoves,'' The Voice of Kosovo,
which has an ad for a ``Homeland Calling'' fund that lists accounts
in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Austria,
Norway, Denmark, France, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and Canada.
 &HT;    A mobile phone rings, and even though he speaks in Albanian, I
sense that the news is not good.
 &HT;    ``The Serbs seized a convoy of our weapons,'' he says, looking
down for a second before looking up with a mischievous smile.
``They didn't kill any of our guys, though. They were waiting for
us. We walked right into their trap, and they didn't manage to kill
one of our guys, not a single one!'' He brushes off the incident as
a minor setback.
 &HT;    Florin has been a leading supporter of the KLA for nearly three
years, helping raise between $12 million and $15 million while
changing a once-obscure clutch of rural militants into an
insurgency. His business has suffered as a result, forcing him to
cut down from 32 employees to 10.
 &HT;    But that's no longer his primary concern. Under U.S. law, a
citizen may legally aid a foreign army as long as it is not
considered a terrorist organization by the State Department. The
KLA is not, so Florin is confident that he is doing the right
thing, morally and legally.
 &HT;    The rebel army is amorphous, Hydra-headed, disorganized and
plagued with infighting. It is certainly no match for Serbian Army
and police forces. But the KLA has put Kosovo, a tiny province of
fewer than 2 million people, at the top of the international
agenda.
 &HT;    Even though the Western powers are united with Serbia in
opposing an independent Kosovo, nobody seems able to dissuade the
rebels from their goal. The KLA is like a chronic infection that
periodically flares and subsides; it is unruly, persistent,
seemingly indefatigable.
 &HT;    Florin points to the photograph on the wall. ``Did you see the
picture of my cousin Adrian?'' It's a rhetorical question _ the
photograph is impossible to miss _ so Florin doesn't wait for an
answer. ``He was one of the first KLA fighters to die. I'm doing
this for him.''
 &HT;    While Kosovo has drawn a lot of attention lately, the conflict
dates to 1989 when Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president,
revoked Kosovo's autonomy within the Yugoslav federation, fired
Albanians from state-run institutions and banned teaching of the
Albanian language and literature.
 &HT;    Long a part of Serbia, Kosovo had become increasingly populated
by ethnic Albanians _ and deserted by Serbs, who left in droves for
the more comfortable surroundings of Serbia proper. By 1989, the
population was 90 percent ethnic Albanian, assuring that
Milosevic's decree would stir widespread resentment. Ultimately,
that coalesced in the murky form of the KLA.
 &HT;    Florin and his extended family began their revolutionary
activity in 1995. At the time, Adrian was a 23-year-old engineering
student with wholesome good looks and a masterful chess game. In
March, after one of his friends was killed by the Serbian police,
he tried to organize a student demonstration. He was stopped, not
by the Serbs but by his fellow Albanians.
 &HT;    Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovar political leader, feared _
correctly, as subsequent events would bear out _ that active
resistance would provoke a Serbian crackdown.
 &HT;    Adrian protested Rugova's decision, circulating a petition that
was signed by 900 students. When the Serbian police found out, he
was arrested, locked in a dark cell and beaten unconscious. Upon
his release, he fled to Albania to buy a gun. When he returned
three months later, he killed his first Serbian cop.
 &HT;    ``I was furious about it,'' Florin says. ``I tried to get him to
calm down, but Adrian was stubborn. He said he wouldn't stop until
we were liberated.''
 &HT;    That was back when Florin still believed in the politics of
peace. A former geometry teacher, he left Kosovo in 1989 as part of
a wave of more than half a million refugees who sought political
asylum abroad, principally in Germany and the United States.
Eventually he found his way to Brooklyn.
 &HT;    Like many of his compatriots in the diaspora, Florin donated 3
percent of his income to Rugova's political party and kept his
faith that the Albanians would be rewarded by the West for their
peaceful struggle.
 &HT;    But at the end of 1995, Florin snapped. ``It was Dayton,'' he
says. The Dayton peace accord ended the war in Bosnia, but left the
status of Kosovo unresolved.
 &HT;    Every other disgruntled minority in Yugoslavia _ the Slovenes,
the Croats, the Bosnians _ fought for independence and got it, he
says. The Albanians took the peaceful road and were ignored.
``That's when I realized fighting was the only way. Peaceful
resistance brought us nothing.''
 &HT;    He started small, sending two-way radios, flashlights,
camouflage uniforms, bulletproof vests. But after Adrian was killed
during an attack on a police station in October 1997, he decided to
dedicate his life to the KLA.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't easy raising money at first,'' he says. The
estimated 300,000 Kosovar refugees in the United States _ clustered
mainly in New York, Detroit, Chicago and Boston _ supported Rugova.
``Things have changed now,'' Florin says in April. ''Everyone
realizes Rugova is not the answer. The money is coming in so fast
that we don't know what to do with it.''
 &HT;    While exact figures are hard to come by, refugee groups claim to
have raised in excess of $100 million to support Rugova and, now,
the armed resistance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    I fly to Albania to meet Florin's family and see where the money
is going. Bajram Curri, in the desolate and lawless north of
Albania, sits on the edge of the Sar Mountains. Even at the end of
June, snow still lies deep on the 8,000-foot peaks that overlook
the villages of Kosovo.
 &HT;    The eight-hour trek there from Tirana, the Albanian capital,
involves three legs _ five hours on a narrow, winding road, two
hours on a ferry and another hour by car. The ferry runs once a
day, snaking its way along the turquoise Drin River between jagged
cliffs. The scenery is spectacular, but the beauty seems lost on
most of the passengers, who are preoccupied with their livestock
and weapons. Chickens, goats and cows are crammed in between vans
and trucks loaded with guns.
 &HT;    Poverty in northern Albania rivals that of undeveloped Africa.
The villagers of Bajram Curri still use the barter system, and most
of their energy goes into fulfilling the basic needs of food and
shelter. Blood feuds are the law of the land _ children live
indoors for fear of being gunned down if they set foot outside. The
lack of formal institutions means the only things that really
matter in Bajram Curri are how big you are, how many guns you have
and whom you know.
 &HT;    Besnik Krasniqi, Florin's uncle, is big, well armed and knows
everybody. I find him sitting in a cafe on the town's main
boulevard. He is a burly man in his mid-50s with a massive belly
and Florin's mischievous smile. He and his family were isolated
from the rest of the Krasniqi clan in Kosovo.
 &HT;    I introduce myself to Besnik and tell him Florin sent me. When I
say I would like to visit a KLA training camp, he eyes me
suspiciously. ``Nobody is supposed to see the training camps,''
Besnik says. ``But if Florin says it's OK, you will be able to do
everything.'' We agree to call Florin by satellite telephone.
 &HT;    Besnik's house is full of KLA soldiers, Kosovars who have
recently returned from Germany, Switzerland and the United States
to fight. Stacks of ammunition boxes clutter his courtyard, and
pistols and rifles are strewn around inside. Besnik's wife and
daughter spend their days cooking for the soldiers.
 &HT;    His two sons, who have returned from studying in Switzerland and
Pakistan, shuttle soldiers and guns in his two four-wheel-drives.
Six Albanians from Alaska have just arrived with a briefcase of
cash they raised among Alaska's 300-strong Albanian community. They
are sunburned and complaining about the heat, which even in the
evenings is stultifying.
 &HT;    When I manage to reach Florin by phone in Brooklyn, I tell him I
am at Besnik's house. ``That's where everything started,'' he says.
``On the second floor.''
 &HT;    Back in 1996, soon after Florin started sending supplies to
Adrian, the Serbian police accused Adrian of terrorism. To avoid
arrest, he fled across the border to Albania, where he moved in
with Besnik and ran small quantities of arms over the border to
Kosovo.
 &HT;    So things stayed until early in 1997, when the Krasniqi boys hit
the jackpot. A string of fraudulent pyramid-type investment schemes
collapsed in Albania, bilking thousands of average people out of
their life savings. In the violent antigovernment demonstrations
that followed, people stormed military arms depots, taking anything
they could get their hands on.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there were guns everywhere, and it didn't take all
that much money to accumulate a sizable cache of arms. ``You could
walk up to a fruit stand and behind the watermelons there would be
weapons,'' Florin says.
 &HT;    ``Kalashnikovs were going for $10 each. The villagers were
giving us ammunition for free.'' As the motherland imploded, the
Krasniqis quietly collected all the arms they could and stored them
in a farmhouse, which became the KLA's rear base. Adrian meanwhile,
began moving weapons across the border to Kosovo with convoys of
horses and mules.
 &HT;    ``I had to show him how to pack a horse,'' Florin laughs. ``He
probably would have kept carrying the guns himself.''
 &HT;    But in October 1997 Adrian was shot and killed. Serbian
television repeatedly showed Adrian's corpse with a grenade in his
hand, instantly transforming him into a martyr for Kosovo's
independence movement. An estimated 13,000 people attended his
funeral.
 &HT;    The poster of him with his AK-47 and battle fatigues _ the same
one that decorates the wall in Florin's Brooklyn office _ became a
fixture in Albanian homes and the centerpiece of a suddenly potent
KLA fund-raising effort.
 &HT;    From Brooklyn, Florin explains that the old camp is gone but
that the KLA has set up a new base that I can visit. I hand the
phone to Besnik, who speaks for about 30 seconds and hangs up.
``Come over at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,'' he says.
 &HT;    The KLA camp, in the mountains a few miles north of Bajram
Curri, is something of an anticlimax. It sits forlornly in an
abandoned army barracks. Inside, hundreds of bedraggled recruits
are bedded down on the hard floor; more sleep on the grass outside.
They have no cooking or bathing facilities. Trucks and minivans
drive in and out, adding more guns, grenades and ammunition to the
already sizable cache inside the base.
 &HT;    I had heard rumors that Iranians, Chechens and Albanians who had
fought in the Bosnian army were training the raw KLA recruits, but
the squalor and disorder of the camp suggest there is no training
at all. Rather, the camp is a staging post for Kosovars to rest and
get a weapon and a patch with the Albanian two-headed eagle before
heading back across the border.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, young men and boys _ some no more than 13
_ set out from the camp in groups of 100 or so with convoys of
mules and horses loaded with weapons. In less than three months,
following the Serbs' winter offensive, the KLA mushroomed from a
collection of rural militants into an insurgency.
 &HT;    But by the beginning of July, the young men in the camp say they
are having trouble crossing into Kosovo. Serbian forces have moved
in along the border to stop the arms-smuggling, and it seems to be
working.
 &HT;    Two weeks after my visit, at the end of July, Milosevic's forces
embark on an offensive ostensibly aimed at eliminating the KLA. In
fact, Serbian troops roll through village after village with tanks
and heavy artillery. The KLA and the civilians flee in advance of
the army, which means there is very little actual fighting. Serbian
police follow the army to loot valuables and set homes on fire. The
KLA is in retreat.
 &HT;    I go to Vranoc, Florin's family's hometown, in mid-August while
the Serb offensive is still under way. They haven't leveled Vranoc
yet, but they've reached the neighboring village. It is only a
matter of time.
 &HT;    It's another month before I speak to Florin again, and the news
is bad, though hardly unexpected. ``Vranoc was leveled,'' he says.
There is a wire story in The New York Times reporting that 40,000
refugees are on the run in western Kosovo. Florin's family is
missing. They are probably among the refugees.
 &HT;    On Oct. 2, Florin leaves Brooklyn for Albania to deliver another
supply of cash for the KLA. He has got word that his family is safe
in Pec, the city nearest Vranoc.
 &HT;    The KLA, for the most part, appears to have been thoroughly
routed by the Serbs. There are about 300,000 new refugees, some 400
villages have been destroyed, hundreds have been killed and the
Western powers are threatening airstrikes if Serbian police and
military forces do not pull out of Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``As long as NATO airstrikes are a possibility, we will keep
confrontations at a low level,'' Florin says. ``If they start
bombing, the KLA will be back within 10 hours. But I don't think
that will happen. Milosevic will pull back at the last minute.''
 &HT;    I ask him about Adrian. ``If Adrian were alive, he would be
commanding the KLA He had lots of energy and he was a bad loser.
His only problem was that he had no patience. I knew he would get
killed. He didn't know when to stop.''
 &HT;    I ask him about a few other KLA soldiers. He says he knows
nothing about them. ''I don't like to know personal things. I
always know which ones are going to die. That's why I don't get too
close.''
 &HT;    It's mid-October when we meet again at his house on Chester
Street in Brooklyn. Just a couple of days earlier, the U.S. envoy,
Richard C. Holbrooke, had brokered a peace providing for a Serb
withdrawal and the placing of international monitors. A month
hence, it would become clear that the KLA had risen again, newly
energized. But even now, it is clear that it won't be vanquished.
 &HT;    ``We want to wait for Milosevic to pull back as much as possible
and for as many monitors as possible to come into Kosovo. With the
monitors on the ground, the Serbs won't be able to attack our
civilians.
 &HT;    ``Then,'' he says quietly, ``we can fight man to man.''

   How time seems to fly when there's so little of it left _ I mean
BEFORE THE MILLENNIUM. Da-da-da-da! Are you ready? We sure are! And
what a year we've had getting ready for THE BIG EVENT!
</P>
<P>
   (I'm hoping for one of those big Hollywood comets, or maybe a
nice, quick thermonuclear war to wipe the slate clean so I can free
myself from this den of losers.)
</P>
<P>
   You know how good Jon is with computers. . . . Well, he's
turning that Year 2000 problem you read so much about to his
advantage! That's right! He's become a high-priced Y2K consultant!
</P>
<P>
   (What a scam! For once, I'm envious, and for once we're able to
send the mortgage check out on time. Jon and his crew of jailbait
hackers are like those Animal Control crooks who charge $50 to
remove a skunk from your property, and then dump it in your
neighbor's yard!
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Jon's gang spends a few days lobbing virus
bombs at the Web site of some clueless business. Then Jon shows up
on their doorstep, blows some Y2K smoke in their faces, and bingo!
Sooner than you can say Thomas Penfield Jackson, the bozos hire Jon
for $1,000 a day, plus expenses. And what do you know? After a few
weeks, the ``problem'' mysteriously vanishes. Good work if you can
get it!)
</P>
<P>
   Jon Jr. is back in college, slaving away. The year off in
California gave him some helpful perspective. Now he knows he
doesn't have to rush through school just to get a minimum-wage job
wrapping up bean sprouts in some flaccid tortilla. He's wisely
decided to enhance his skill set before joining the work force.
</P>
<P>
   (Six years at UMass! That's like what? A high school equivalency
degree? That 1.5 GPA is OK for the basketball players, but alas,
the school's not quite as flexible where the Ultimate Frisbee JV is
concerned. Maybe we could get him diagnosed . . .)
</P>
<P>
   How's ``baby'' Johanna? Baby, you should see her now!
Five-foot-two, eyes of blue _ the rest of it is up to you . . . to
imagine. She's taking a break before going off to college, and with
her superb presentation skills, she's already landed a
high-commission sales job!
</P>
<P>
   (What's her street name? Tiffany Amber? Or is that Billy Joel's
daughter? Everybody's a hooker these days. What the heck, she's of
age. I keep my eye glued to the police blotter, waiting for the day
that Hugh Grant picks her up on one of his swings through town. If
the cops call, I'll say I don't know her. Sooner or later these
kids have to leave the nest.)
</P>
<P>
   I know you're curious about my Appalachian cuisine catering
business. Well, I'm sorry to report that ``Deliverance'' is no
more. I had so many customers that I had to make a choice between
becoming the next Martha Kostyra _ sorry, Stewart _ and being a
wife and mother. Luckily, one of my partners was eager to take over
the business.
</P>
<P>
   (Some partner _ those fershlugginer bankers! Believe me, I'll
have Jon's virusniks blowing up their back office systems soon
enough. But every cloud does have a silver lining. Now the IRS, the
INS, the Department of Labor, and the health inspectors are their
problem, not mine.)
</P>
<P>
   But you know me _ I'm no quitter! I've got a business plan that
I hope will be the salvation of us all!
</P>
<P>
   (My new business? Pure gravy! Not too many people noticed the
Pope's recent announcement that the Catholic Church will be
granting indulgences again, to celebrate the Year 2000 Jubilee.
Guess what? I've landed the New England franchise! When my Web site
www.Send$500You'reSaved.com goes up, we'll be millionaires! In your
face, Martin Luther! God bless the Millennium! Hallelujah!)
</P>
<P>
   Got to run! Here's hoping that 1998 has been as fun and
productive for your family as it has been for ours! Happy holidays
and Joye-ous New Year to one and all! Stay in touch!

   There is cross-fertilization here with other Spanish cookery, as
in the famous tortilla de patata, the potato omelet served as
tapas, and angulas a la cazuela, baby eels in sizzling garlic.
Barrenechea keeps making the point that her restaurant food and the
food in this book are completely authentic. But a
delightful-sounding roast duck cooked with carrots, onions, apples,
and dates _ fruit is probably an influence from the Moors, early
settlers in this region _ never instructs the cook to remove the
excess duck fat from the pan. Will it be edible? Then a chicken
dish asks you to combine peppers and tomatoes cooked in six
tablespoons of olive oil with chicken sauteed in another six
tablespoons of oil. So for pork simmered in milk, I felt perfectly
comfortable cutting down on the oil, and it did produce beautifully
tender meat. There was much too much sauce, and no instruction to
turn the meat. In addition, the milk curdles so badly during
cooking that if you weren't familiar with this sort of recipe
(blending later smooths it out), you would surely think you erred.
</P>
<P>
   When I made two pie pastry recipes from ``The Pie and Pastry
Bible,'' by Rose Levy Beranbaum (Scribner, $35), I almost gave up
before I began. I've baked from Beranbaum for years, but I don't
remember the recipes being this nit-picky. I couldn't make the
deluxe flaky pie pastry because I couldn't get pastry flour. So I
made basic flaky pie crust with unbleached, rather than bleached,
flour. She lists ingredients in cups, ounces, and grams, which is
hard to read (probably a service for pastry chefs). Persevere, I
told myself.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you've got to freeze one portion of butter, refrigerate
another. Then you have to freeze the flour. And when the pastry is
done, you can't bring it together to form a dough. But you know
it's done because if you pinch it, it'll hold together. Then you
pack it into a plastic bag and you land up smushing the dough
together and kneading it through the bag. Is this woman for real?
It did bake into a nice crust, but I'd never repeat the process.
Ditto for flaky vegetable shortening pie crust. Beautiful when
baked. Too weird.
</P>
<P>
   Elinor Klivans is much more compatible. ``125 Cookies to Bake,
Nibble, and Savor'' (Broadway Books, $25) is perfectly sweet, page
after page. What I like about Klivans, who lives in Camden, Maine,
is that she's not trying to knock my socks off. There are ordinary
cookies here and if something is complicated, you can always stop
before the tricky parts set in. I made triple-chocolate-topped
chocolate butter cookies and though instructions said to roll them
in my hands, the dough was too wet. So I dropped them off a spoon
and that worked perfectly. I couldn't get the melted chocolate to
drip smoothly off the tines of a fork as instructed, though the end
result, lumpy chocolate lines and all, looked quite nice and tasted
wonderful. Parisian toffee crisps were just as easy. Again, no luck
in forming balls of dough in my palms, but it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   I keep Saveur magazines long past their shelf life because I'm
enchanted by the photography and layout. ``Saveur Cooks Authentic
American,'' by the editors of Saveur magazine (Chronicle Books,
$40), captures the best of their regional American stories with
dishes like smoked trout hash made with Maine's Ducktrap smoked
fish (delicious, though they give the wrong, too-long cooking time
for the potatoes), and Georgene's fluffy rolls, a recipe from a
cook in Memphis. (so sweet they have a cakey quality). It's a good
overview of some of the things we do best: lobster, steak, ham,
fried chicken, sandwich bread, mac and cheese. Beautiful
photography and interesting vignettes on the cooks are dropped
throughout the text.

   Many years ago I had lunch with Lorenza de'Medici at her
11th-century estate, where Badia a Coltibuono wines and olive oils
are bottled. We drank gorgeous wines with her husband, Piero
Stucchi-Prinetti, and ate tomatoes stuffed with tuna fish salad.
De'Medici sat in a dining room from another era and she looked like
a duchess and the tomatoes in the center of the dish were pure
Family Circle. I was thoroughly charmed by the contradiction.
Today, she produces grand-looking cookbooks that are evocative but
not weighty. Of course, she has little to do with the paper and
design. The cooking is hers. And often, it sounds a lot like those
stuffed tomatoes. ``Lorenza's Antipasti'' (Clarkson Potter, $40)
has some ordinary food, photographed on distressed plates and
backgrounds and then processed so the photographs have their own
salvaged-from-the-ruins look. This is the first I've seen of this
vampy photography, probably in vogue in Europe right now. I look to
Lorenza for inspiration and use her books as reference. I loved her
finger food and one hungry afternoon I was so taken with
zucchini-omelet sandwiches _ very thin slices of bread filled with
very thin wedges of frittata _ that I could have pulled them off
the page. Maybe I'm still snowed by that lunch at her winery.

   Last year a group of friends gathered at someone's house and
produced a Turkish banquet. Several of us had been to Istanbul and
we wanted to see what we could reproduce. We had all sorts of
books, but what we really needed was ``The Sultan's Kitchen, A
Turkish Cookbook,'' by Ozcan Ozan (Periplus Editions, $29.95),
which is a gem. Ozcan (pronounced Urz-jon) Ozan owns Sultan's
Kitchen in the financial district, where the specialty of the house
is lamb kebab with yogurt sauce and salads with finely chopped
vegetables. This is real Old World cooking and perhaps you need a
team of people to work from this book (the first sultan's kitchen
in Topkapi had 1,000 cooks). But there are simple things from
Ozan's mother's kitchen, like red lentil and bulgur soup garnished
with paprika and mint; lamb stew on a bed of creamed eggplant; and
rice pilaf with chicken, almonds, and pistachios. There are stuffed
pastries that are too difficult for most home cooks and not enough
dreamy text to match the breathtaking array of and inspiring
photographs.

   Longteine ``Nyep'' De Monteiro is a long way from home. She was
raised in an upper-class Cambodian household where many servants
did the cooking and food played an important role in the family. As
the wife of a diplomat, she entertained all the time. When Cambodia
fell to the Khmer Rouge, she and her husband, Ken, were living in
Taiwan. They went to the French southwest and opened a restaurant.
In 1991, when she and her daughter and son-in-law, Nadsa and Bob
Perry, opened Elephant Walk in a basement in Somerville, no one
could have predicted its success. ``The Elephant Walk Cookbook,''
by Longteine De Monteiro and Katherine Neustadt (Houghton Mifflin,
$35), recalls this chapter in De Monteiro's life, with her saga
about Cambodia, her family there, the history of the country, and
the marketplace. Now that the family has opened Carambola, in
Waltham, many of these dishes appear on their menu. Classic
Cambodian chicken and rice works as promised, but it seems to be
missing an ingredient or technique, since it doesn't taste like the
restaurant's. The chicken broth that is combined with the rice is
good enough, but at the restaurant it contains tiny dried shrimp,
which add lots of depth. So the results are slightly disappointing.
Spicy sauced pork contains both fish powder and fish sauce and
still isn't a bit salty. Even though no coconut milk was added, the
dish had a nutty creaminess. Fresh cilantro stems added a nice,
clean taste to the spice paste. No ``lesser galangal'' was in the
markets, just regular galangal, which worked out fine. To cook from
this book, you have to be invested in an ingredient search.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you can go to the supermarket to cook from
``Vegetables,'' by James Peterson (William Morrow, $35), and make
something, he writes, that you would serve after rushing in from
work on a Wednesday evening. This is a book for new cooks, who need
to look up how to trim artichokes or glaze carrots.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of ``The Figs Table,'' by Todd English and Sally
Sampson (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25), are the shots of the extremely
photogenic English in action at his restaurants, Olives and Figs,
and the details of ingredients and simple foods photographed there
as well. English's voice doesn't come through here, but all is
forgiven when you make his fig pizza, spread with a jam made from
dried mission figs and balsamic vinegar, then topped with
Gorgonzola and prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   When the guests are gone, when the doors are closed, and the
curtains are pulled tight, all I really want is a big bowl of soup.
So that's what I do all winter long, varying the pot from week to
week, beginning with homemade stock, and tossing oddments into the
soup as the week progresses. ``Saved by Soup,'' by Judith Barrett
(William Morrow, $23), whose recipes are all low-fat and simple to
execute, will be my January salvation. I'm dipping into shiitake
mushroom soup with Thai rice noodles in an Asian broth, three-bean
minestra with Swiss chard, and creamy carrot soup that has no
cream. After a brutal December, my figure will be saved by soup.

PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ADDIE 
A Memoir 
By Mary Lee Settle 
University of South Carolina Press, 257 pp., illustrated., $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime after the death of her husband in 1907, Addie Tompkins
made herself a coat of many colors out of his old silk ties _ a
Joseph coat, she called it, pieced together with her own rickrack
feather stitching. Years later, when the house was closed up, Miss
Addie's granddaughter, Mary Lee Settle, found the coat lying on the
floor. She had always loved it, so she picked it up and took it
home; today it hangs as a talisman in the room where she wrote
``Addie,'' a memoir of her grandmother and of her family _ ``I
inherited the residue, as we all do, of habits, gestures, genes,
hopes, fears and lies which are called Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Settle is now 79 and one of the best American novelists. Her
proudest achievement is probably a quincunx of books collectively
known as the ``Beulah Quintet,'' which survey centuries of American
history as they were experienced in daily life in a valley in West
Virginia where Settle's own ancestral home stands _ Cedar Grove,
built by money from the salt mines back in 1844. ``Addie'' tells us
directly the source of many details in Settle's other books, and
indirectly reveals where all of them came from, because the book is
a portrait of the artist as a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Settle's profound conviction is that ``An autobiography that
begins with one's birth begins too late, in the middle of the
story, sometimes at the end.'' Settle's book opens in 1927, when
her mother returned to Cedar Grove after her husband's latest
failure, her tail, as she put it, between her legs. But the real
beginning is prehistoric, with the millennial processes that led to
seams of coal, and mines of salt, and natural gas beneath the
earth. Settle sets the family history in its social and political
context. She gives the early history of the valley, which lingers
like arrowheads in the soil; in a defining experience in the
basement of the British Museum, she discovers a tea chest filled
with the scalps of the farming settlers. Slavery and the Civil War
darken the book's pages, and so do the later boom-and-bust cycles
of the economy. Mother Jones arrives to cause trouble by doing the
right thing. The Tompkins's estate and fortune arose from and
depended on natural resources, but the family's enduring strength
came from its women.
</P>
<P>
   Addie lived a difficult life. Married soon after childhood to a
drunken and abusive miner with whom she had three children, she won
an early West Virginia divorce after she met Henry Preston Tomkins,
from the valley's most prominent family _ which never accepted her.
After they had been married 15 years, Tomkins was run down by a
train, most likely a suicide, leaving Addie with five more children
and ``a poverty of land'' to run. A determined woman, Addie took
charge, surviving the crises and tragedies of her children,
lecturing them in prayer over the dinner table, and finding
consolation in unceasing toil, her garden, and an uninhibited
Church of God Holy Roller religion that was radically opposed to
the chilly Presbyterianism of the rest of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Settle herself was an inquisitive and unruly little girl who
heard and remembered everything, even things it took her decades to
understand. ``(The grown-ups) tended to treat all the cousins as if
we couldn't hear, which has made this book easier to write.''
Settle was never interested in the lies of the grown-ups, their
sentiment and sentimentality, in their protective colorations,
stiff and ironclad as armor, of gentility. She sought the wonder
and mystery of the truth. ``(Aunt) Minnie was a morphine addict,
and my mother knew it from the time she was a child. She would, my
mother said, when she finally realized that I knew, drive the
hypodermic through her dress into her hip as she sat beating egg
whites in a china platter with a wire whisk and not even stopping.
Then she added, `She was a marvelous pastry cook.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are places in Settle's capacious book for passion and
politics, for social comedy, for the tragic rape and plunder of the
land and of lives, for the follies and pain of old hatreds, for
lasting resentments and enduring gratitudes. Every portrait is
three-dimensional. Kindly Aunt Myrtle loved animals and children _
and used them to manipulate the other grown-ups. Above all, Settle
is profoundly grateful to those who taught her empathy and the
``right, true pitch.'' ``I can still hear their voices and watch
them move at their own paces.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the parti-colored patches of family and national history,
Settle has stitched together her own Joseph coat of memory, with
its repeating patterns and its anomalies; the patterns of her
language ring like the refrains of old ballads, funny, violent,
terrifying, primal. The book has not been well-served by its
publisher, however. The old family photographs are so badly
reproduced that you can't make out the detail Settle so lovingly
describes in them; surely someone at a university press should
know, or care, how Katharine Cornell spelled her name or that it
was the ``Liebesnacht'' that Flagstad and Melchior recorded
together. Nevertheless, ``Addie'' will stand as a classic American
memoir. This reader finished, wept, turned back, and read it plumb
through all over again, for ``Addie'' is a book to love as well as
to read, a book to pass from hand to hand, generation to
generation, like a talisman.

CD OFFERS `HOPE' FOR OMAGH VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Around here, just about everyone's
getting the same thing for Christmas: a CD called ``Across the
Bridge of Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ireland's most popular recording artists have donated
their talent and songs to the CD to benefit the Omagh Fund, created
to help the victims of the bombing last August that killed 29
people, injured 250 others, and tore the heart out of this friendly
little market town in County Tyrone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contributors are some of the biggest names in
contemporary music, all of them Irish: Sinead O'Connor, Boyzone,
the Corrs, Enya, and U2.
</P>
<P>
   But even more poignant is the appearance of artists who hail
from Northern Ireland, who know firsthand of what they sing: Van
Morrison, who grew up in East Belfast; Ash, the rock band from
Downpatrick; singer-songwriter Paul Brady, a Tyrone man; and Juliet
Turner, a little-known but talented singer from Omagh. Liam Neeson,
the actor who hails from Ballymena in nearby County Antrim, opens
the recording by reading a poem by the County Derry-born Nobel
laureate Seamus Heaney.
</P>
<P>
   It was Turner whose aching rendition of the ballad ``Broken
Things'' captured the heartbreak and sense of loss when she sang at
a memorial service a week after the bomb exploded, when Omagh
paused to remember its dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
   On that sunny day in August, accompanied by just her guitar,
Turner's voice was, like Ireland itself, simultaneously haunting
and beautiful. Her lament, based on a psalm, appealed to a God who
seemed absent when the bomb exploded, killing mostly women and
children doing back-to-school shopping.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can have my heart, if you don't mind broken things.
</P>
<P>
   You can have my heart, if you don't mind these tears.
</P>
<P>
   But I heard that you make all things new,
</P>
<P>
   So I give these pieces all to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you want it, you can have my heart.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find a dry eye in Omagh after Juliet Turner sang
that song. Although the version on the CD was recorded in a studio,
it has the same effect on anyone who was in Omagh that day.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who is not enamored with the bottom-line thinking in the
mainstream music industry, said she was moved by the generosity of
the more famous artists who collaborated on the recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corrs were a good example,'' she said in an interview.
``They got up and organized a lot of publicity, put their money
where their mouths are. It is amazing to see the spirit of these
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording takes its title from a poem, ``The Bridge,''
written by 12-year-old Shaun McLaughlin, one of the six children
aged 12 or younger who were killed by the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orange and green it does not matter,'' Shaun McLaughlin wrote
after the political settlement reached in the Good Friday Agreement
offered people in Northern Ireland something other than an endless
cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United now, don't shatter our dream,
</P>
<P>
   Scatter the seeds of peace over our land,
</P>
<P>
   So we can travel, hand in hand
</P>
<P>
   Across the bridge of hope.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people who planted the bomb left 500 pounds of explosives in
a car parked in the middle of the shopping district here. The
public outrage that followed the Omagh bombing led the dissident
republican group that planted the bomb to call a cease-fire and
disband.
</P>
<P>
   Those killed and injured by the bomb, many of them maimed and
disfigured, are the human toll of the worst atrocity in 30 years of
the Troubles, as the Irish call their interminable, intermittent
civil war with characteristic understatement.
</P>
<P>
   But those who recorded ``Across the Bridge of Hope'' are hoping
it becomes the biggest-selling charity recording in Ireland of all
time. The organizers of the Omagh Fund had initially hoped to raise
almost $20 million for the victims and their families. They have
since scaled back their aim to about $8 million. So far, they have
collected about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Graham, who produced the CD, said it is available in the
United States by mail order and will soon be available as an
import. In the meantime, Graham, who runs freerange Records in
Killinchey, Northern Ireland, is trying to line up American artists
to contribute songs for an American version of the CD that
organizers hope to have ready for sale by St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Taylor's people have already been on to us. His song
`From Belfast to Boston' has a certain resonance,'' said Graham,
who has also spoken to Bonnie Raitt and Nanci Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   On the CD, Morrison's soulful, acoustic version of ``The Healing
Game'' underscores what's needed in Northern Ireland these days. He
is joined on the track by Belfast singer Brian Kennedy on backing
vocals. The musicians include Paddy Maloney, leader of The
Chieftains, and Phil Coulter, the Derry troubador who wrote ``The
Town I Love So Well,'' the bittersweet lament for his hometown,
which suffered so much during the Troubles but which has been
rebuilt and offers an example of post-conflict development.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's lyrics from ``The Island,'' written in 1986, are
prescient, and so chilling, when the horrific scenes of Omagh are
recalled.

<P>
   And teach them dying will lead us into glory . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a palpable, profound sadness here, more pronounced
during the holiday season, which is celebrated throughout Ireland
with gusto. Many people are ambivalent about celebrating Christmas
so soon after what happened Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a brave town, and most put a brave face on last week
to light the Christmas tree in the town center, not far from where
the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bomb's victims was released from the hospital
Wednesday. Pauline Green, 19, lost part of her left leg. She
hobbled out of the hospital on crutches and urged the politicians
to get beyond the current impasse and not let the peace process
collapse because of a dispute over what to do with paramilitary
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is within our grasp,'' the teenager said. ``Everyone
wants it. Keep talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Green prays that Heaney was right when he wrote the words that
begin ``A Bridge Called Hope.''

   Human beings suffer, they torture one another.

   No poem or play or song can fully right a wrong inflicted and

</P>
<P>
   History says don't hope on this side of the grave.
</P>
<P>
   But then, once in a lifetime, the longed for tidal wave of
justice can rise up and hope and history rhyme.
</P>
<P>
   So hope for a great sea change on the far side of revenge.

   Believe in miracles and cures and healing wells.

   Call miracles self-healing the utter self-revealing doubletake

<P>
   If there's fire on the mountain and lightning in the storm and a
God speaks from the sky that means someone is hearing the outcry
and the birthcry of new life at its term.

FUND MANAGER PUTS IT ALL ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about putting your money where your mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   Money manager Michael Malouf just moved from San Francisco to
Boston to start a new mutual fund focusing on small-capitalization
stocks for Neuberger &AMP; Berman Management Inc. His first order of
business: buying a townhouse in Boston's South End. Then he put the
rest of his entire net wealth, about $500,000, into his new fund.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of hedge funds, private investment vehicles for the
wealthy, will sometimes put most of their money in their own fund.
And mutual fund managers are expected to invest something in their
own funds. But rarely do you see a fund manager making this big a
bet on himself. Is this 31-year-old money manager sure of himself
or what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I know what kind of risk I am taking,'' says
Malouf. ``I think that small-caps are that attractive. I know the
manager _ it is me. I thought it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of small-cap stocks that Malouf follows have been
getting clobbered for so long it is sometimes hard to remember
which way is up. Measured from May 1996 to the low this October,
the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller stocks, was down 12
percent while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, which tracks large stocks,
was up 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since hitting bottom on Oct. 8, however, the Russell 2000 is up
29.62 percent compared with a gain of 23.41 percent for the S&AMP;P.
For the year, the Russell 2000 is still down 7.11 percent while the
S&AMP;P is up 23.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The small-cap market has given signs of awakening from its long
slumber only to doze off again. But even before the most recent
run, the historic spreads in valuations between the big and small
stocks have been encouraging fund companies to reopen small-cap
funds that had been closed to new investors and to start new ones
to take advantage of the discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the funds that have reopened in recent months: State
Street Research Aurora, Oakmark Small Cap, two funds run by Wasatch
Advisors Inc., and Heartland Value. Fidelity Investments' Small Cap
Stock, shut shortly after it opened when it was swamped with money,
has reopened to existing investors.
</P>
<P>
   The new funds include the Small Cap Value, run by John Bogle's
N/I Numeric Investors in Cambridge and just started this month.
Like all Numeric's funds, Small Cap Value will leave the
stockpicking to its computer models, which will select the 120 or
so best stocks from a universe of 1,500. The fund has only $400,000
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle says his ``gut'' tells him small-caps are undervalued, but
he doesn't pretend to know where the market is going. ``It is
probably not a whole lot different than me putting my chips on red
or black,'' Bogle says. The point of starting the no-load fund now
is to fill out his product line.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Malouf, the Neuberger &AMP; Berman manager, is an
active stockpicker and believes the values in the small-caps have
never been more appealing. He better be right _ with all his money
riding on his new growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the standard measures of valuing stocks are on his side.
The price-earnings ratios of small stocks, for instance, are just
80 percent of the large stocks, the biggest difference since at
least the '60s. In addition, when the Federal Reserve cuts rates,
as it just did, small stocks have tended to historically outperform
the big stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it turns, it is dramatic,'' says Malouf.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Malouf is running very short money, even by
small-cap standards. He has but $12 million in his new Millennium
fund, but he managed $1 billion in small-cap money for Dresdner
RCM's Small-Cap Growth and the firm's separate accounts. Malouf
spent seven years at Dresdner as an analyst and fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   So far, his timing couldn't have been better. Since launching
the fund on Oct. 20, the fund was up 28 percent through Monday
compared with 12 percent for the Russell 2000. But such short-term
numbers for a new fund are just about meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Malouf has 30 percent of his fund in technology. His top five
holdings: Karrington Health Inc., RSL Communications, SFX
Entertainment, Comfort Systems USA, and Quanta Services Inc. Among
the Internet stocks his favorite is Infoseek Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Malouf was hired by former Putnam Investments' money manager
Jennifer Silver, who Neuberger &AMP; Berman brought in 18 months ago to
add growth funds to its longtime emphasize on value stocks. Silver
now oversees about $1.75 billion in its mid-cap fund, the Manhattan
fund, and private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said the issue was whether to add a large-cap fund or a
small-cap fund. The huge gulf in valuations made that an easy call,
she says.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ It is foolish to regret the cancellation of a bomb
attack on Iraq, as some seem to do out of frustration and anger at
having to acknowledge the limits of America's power. The goal of
military destruction cannot only be a show of strength.
 &HT;    In Iraq's case, the goal must be an assurance that Saddam
Hussein is not accumulating weapons of mass destruction in the
absence of U.N. disarmament teams. In Washington's eyes, the
purpose has to be the all-but-avowed hope of provoking Hussein's
ouster in a coup. Neither one was very likely to be achieved by the
planned campaign.
 &HT;    President Clinton, against the feeling of senior aides but with
the strong support of National Security Adviser Sandy Berger,
decided to accept yet another Baghdad promise rather than unleash
bombs and missiles, likely to cause a large number of civilian
casualties as well as military damage.
 &HT;    ``We have to be able to take `yes' for an answer when we say
that if he (Hussein) capitulates, it is a better outcome here to
test that and see whether UNSCOM can get back in and do the job,''
Berger told reporters, who were arguing that ``Saddam won again.''
 &HT;    It took courage on Clinton's part to expose himself to charges
of weakness and wavering. Had he bombed, the United States
certainly would have been denounced for cruelty and arrogance,
despite official statements that appeared to revive the broad
coalition which opposed Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The
attack almost certainly would have settled nothing.
 &HT;    Still, Washington is either misleading the public or fooling
itself with claims of strong international backing, even from Arab
states, for action against Hussein. Whatever their leaders say at
the moment, the public in Arab countries no doubt would react
angrily to the infliction of intense further suffering on the Iraqi
population.
 &HT;    Even Le Monde of Paris chose to avoid comment on French
endorsement of the U.N. Security Council resolution and argued
instead that the reaction should be ``disarmament _ yes, sanctions
_ no.'' It's a clear reflection of the underlying French wish to
get rid of the punishments and just hope Saddam will behave better.
 &HT;    Further, it is impossible to delink the gulf situation from
Israeli-Palestinian developments, which do not look promising
despite Washington's hurrahs. The Wye accords actually may be
implemented, but it's proving much more difficult than promised. If
they fail, the United States will be held to account for Israeli
intransigence and Hussein will no longer seem to be the region's
prime villain.
 &HT;    By now there is a general expectation that the latest escape
from crisis in Iraq is only temporary. Clinton is right in saying
it will take a different kind of regime in Baghdad to reach a real
solution. But he isn't very clear on how that's to be achieved.
 &HT;    Ahmed Chalabi, a leader of the Iraqi National Congress, insists
that Hussein can be ousted from inside, if the United States will
provide the kind of aid proposed in the Iraq Liberation Act,
recently passed by Congress. It calls for $97 million in equipment
and training for Iraqi rebels and $2 million for a radio station.
Chalabi says opposition forces were actually on the verge of
victory in 1995, but for lack of U.S. help they were knocked out by
Baghdad.
 &HT;    It is true that the opposition, both clandestine within Iraq and
in exile, has a history of chronic quarreling and occasional
betrayal. The United States has been reluctant to give decisive
help, for fear of splitting up Iraq. Indeed, the greater danger is
to inadvertently launch a new, unending Afghanistan-type civil war
among Iraqi factions which clearly lack a solid political
organization.
 &HT;    There is no easy, assured solution and sooner or later, the
Iraqis will have to work their way out of this dreadful regime.
Certainly outside help, if reasonable and intelligent, is no worse
an interference in Iraq's domestic affairs than bombing the country
and starving its economy. It can be tried. It won't work quickly.
Meanwhile, it is better to be persistent and patient on disarmament
than to bomb.

WHO RUNS YOUR FUND? OFTEN, IT'S A RENT-A-MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some investment managers, setting up a mutual fund is akin to
planting the corn and slaughtering the pig just to make a pork
chop. After all, why spend time and money assembling a research
team, portfolio manager, performance record, and sales and
marketing forces when you can farm out the tasks?
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers do it. Payroll departments do it. And
increasingly, asset management firms do it. Outsourcing, already an
engine of growth for the mutual fund industry, will put even more
funds on the table in coming years by allowing investment companies
to increase quickly the breadth of their offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these guys are for rent _ why would I want to own
one?'' asks Bradford K. Gallagher, whose small Boston firm, Cypress
Tree Investments, uses companies from Salomon Brothers to
Wellington Management Co., one of the biggest managers of other
firms' funds, to run most of its mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   What might be dubbed the ``rent-a-fund-manager'' trend has
swelled in recent years, driven by investment firms racing to
create more funds faster and by institutional money managers who
have looked with envy at the lucrative fund industry and scurried
to offer their services. Known as subadvising, the practice has
also spawned the growth of ``virtual'' fund shops that lack the
frenetic trading desks, high-cost money managers, and costly
research teams of traditional investment houses.
</P>
<P>
   But amid growing pressure in the industry for ever more flavors
of funds, subadvising may generate too many funds and more consumer
confusion in an already crowded field. And an investment adviser
who hands over control of his assets to someone else could be
viewed as lacking experience.
</P>
<P>
   Even though fund prospectuses clearly state who oversees a
portfolio, ordinary investors might be surprised to learn how many
mutual funds are actually run by a money manager at another
company. Nearly one in seven mutual funds is subadvised, including
32 percent of all international stock funds, according to Financial
Research Corp., or FRC, a Boston consulting firm. For US
diversified stock funds, the figure is nearly one in three.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most well-known fund firms, including Fidelity
Investments, use subadvisers, particularly for exotic overseas
offerings or for obscure products, such as variable annuities, for
which they may not have in-house expertise. Vanguard, one of the
hottest brand names around, has Wellington, hardly a household
name, run many of its funds, including the troubled $18.3 billion
Windsor fund.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, a cradle of both the mutual fund industry and the
subadvisory business, the use of other companies' money managers
will play an increasing role, consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is appealing. An investment firm wanting to
expand into, say, an airline stock fund but not wanting to hire an
expensive sector analyst can pay someone else, often a well known
specialist, to take the reins. The practice is particularly common
for funds with international stocks, since a fund firm doesn't just
wake up one day and start picking winners in, say, Hungary. Mutual
fund and other asset management firms, even investment banks, are
all too glad to oversee more fee-generating assets without the onus
of marketing to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a growing trend, and it is likely to really take off as
soon as international investing takes off,'' says Louis S. Harvey,
president of Dalbar Inc., a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   By contracting things out, investment firms are not just gaining
efficiencies of scale and economy. They are also responding to
growing consumer demand for a fuller range of funds within
individual firms. Such pressure has created more than 11,000 mutual
funds (including mutiple share classes), more than triple the
number of listed companies on the New York Stock Exchange. With
trillions of dollars in retirement money expected to come searching
for mutual funds when Baby Boomers leave the work force in coming
years, analysts expect ever more funds to be created, many through
subadvising. ``With subadvising, you can have a full-blown product
line without the full-blown operations,'' says Thomas P. Sorbo, a
partner at Standish, Ayer &AMP; Wood Inc., a Boston subadvisory firm.
</P>
<P>
   Since testing a fund in-house before selling it to the public
can take years, it is faster to go straight to an outside money
manager with an established record. ``You can move quicker in not
hiring the expertise as staff,'' says Russell J. Kinnel, equity
fund editor at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago-based fund tracking
firm. ``But you can also lack internal growth and the proprietary
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the world need more mutual funds and virtual investment
shops?
</P>
<P>
   The rent-a-fund-manager trend is already adding elaborateness to
a complex fund industry. Increasingly, single funds are run by
managers spread out across several companies. For example, a firm
with a large capitalization fund with a heavy technology component
might hire a name-brand tech stock picker just for that part of the
fund. The Star Advisers Fund, a growth fund that is part of NVest's
New England Funds family, has three subadvisers, each overseeing a
different part of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   That practice will grow, says FRC analyst Ray Liberatore. In
all, Liberatore predicts subadvised funds will account for 20
percent of all funds, compared to 13.5 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   If past returns mean anything, that could be good for investors.
Subadvised US equity funds returned from a half to a full
percentage point more than their internally managed counterparts
over one, three, five, and 10 years through November, according to
Morningstar. And that is after slightly higher fees, which are
split between the subadviser and the company marketing and selling
the fund, are factored in. Liberatore attributes beefier returns to
the fact that marquee-name managers are often chosen as
subadvisers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, subadvised international funds have lagged
their internally managed peers, perhaps because they compete
against a few powerhouse firms already rich in overseas research
and stock-picking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Once confined to secretive shops like Wellington and Standish,
Ayer, subadvising is increasingly attractive to mainstream
investment banks and institutional money managers who want more of
the hot ``retail'' fund business that caters to ordinary Americans,
who have fueled the investment boom this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the field is fraught with peril. Subadvisors can be _ and
are _ sacked more readily than in-house portfolio managers, since
they are not full-time staffers with complex employment contracts.
``The subadviser doesn't control his own destiny,'' says
Philadelphia-based fund consultant Burton J. Greenwald, citing the
subadvisor's inability to influence how a fund is marketed. ``He
lives a precarious existence.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cypress, Gallagher is gearing up to cut ties to a sub-par
subadviser for one of his 16 North American funds. ``If these guys
don't perform, we fire them,'' Gallagher says. He grins, then adds:
``With subadvising, you have no human resources or personnel
issues.''

THE DAY-CARE DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margarita Morales and Kamalah Fletcher have a lot in common:
Both are preschool teachers who are struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, 24, a single mother of two, supplements the $10.19
hourly wage she earns as a head teacher at a center in Boston's
Jamaica Plain neighborhood by bagging groceries at a Costco
Wholesale store in suburban Dedham, Mass. She uses those weekend
earnings to help pay for day care and afterschool services for her
toddler daughter and 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, 22, sells sporting goods on weekends. But while
Morales plans to remain in day care, Fletcher has other plans for
her future. She has enrolled at Boston University and is studying
psychology in preparation for a future career as an elementary
school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't value the work we do with young children,'' says
Fletcher, who earns a scant $9.37 per hour. ``They see us as baby
sitters. There is a lot more to it than that, but you can't live on
the money. It just isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of welfare recipients now entering the job
market, one of the most critical questions facing parents, policy
makers, and employers is how to expand day-care programs and keep
top-notch teachers from leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is to pay them more.
</P>
<P>
   But poor and middle-class parents, already burdened with
skyrocketing day-care bills, say they are hardly prepared to pay
more to boost child-care wages. In Greater Boston, for example,
child-care costs now range from over $100 per week for older,
preschool children up to $250 per week for infants. A good
afterschool program can cost as much as $4,000 per year, and weekly
family day care costs an average of $125 to $150 _ too high for the
working poor, but barely enough to meet day-care providers'
operations and programming costs.
</P>
<P>
   A catch-22, but there is some movement afoot. In Boston, state
Senator David Magnani (D-Framingham) introduced a bill last week
that would provide grants to help family day-care and child-care
centers become certified, improve programming, and pay their staffs
more. Under such a grant program, centers would be rewarded for
instituting career ladders and encouraging workers to pursue
courses or degrees in early childhood education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is a push to create more slots to accommodate
children whose parents are on welfare, but the creation of slots
without looking at program quality could be a problem,'' says
Magnani. ``Secondly, there is a high turnover among day-care
teachers and family providers. We also know that only 14 percent of
all home-care providers and day-care centers in the state are
certified. The rest, 86 percent, are not certified by the National
Association for the Education of Young Children in Washington, D.C.
So, the goal is to raise standards and pay.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for workers like Morales and Fletcher, but what
about parents? Just trying to locate suitable care for infants or
toddlers can be frustrating. Although nine years have passed since
my own 13-year-old daughter was in day care, I still cringe when I
recall those roller-coaster years.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a divorce and the need for a higher income, one
home-care provider quit when my child was 2. I fired a second
provider, though she came highly recommended, after discovering a
pair of sewing shears on her livingroom floor, in the path of her
rambunctious 4-year-old and my curious toddler. The third time
around I got lucky. I found a preschool teacher who not only loved
my child, but later became a close friend and surrogate
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to any working parents, and they can tell you about
day-care trauma. Many point to day-care centers that do not accept
children under three, lengthy waiting lists, and such high turnover
that they worry about the emotional and psychological impact on
their children's ability to form close attachments.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Child Care Action Campaign, which is trying to
increase public interest in child-care issues, says the national
turnover rate for child-care providers is now 36 percent per year.
Compare that to the 5.6 percent turnover rate for public school
teachers. The fact that preschool teachers are bailing out is
hardly surprising, when you consider that they make, on average,
$12,057 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston, 47 percent of all providers now have some sort of
training,'' says Bernadette Davidson, director of The Childcare
Careers Institute. Still, she says, the child-care worker has
become a stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caring for other people's children is a learned skill,'' she
says. ``It's not innate. We have people who really love their jobs
and some have associate's or bachelor's degrees in early childhood
education, but because of the stress associated with the work and
the low pay, people are leaving the field.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents, high turnover can translate into longer waits for
space, poor quality, and the stress of having to find a new
provider. To secure good care in the face of one-, two-, and
three-year waiting lists, Mark Smith, 38, of Roslindale, went so
far as to put his unborn child on the waiting list for a center at
Shattuck Hospital to ensure her admission 15 months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were looking for day care, we had no idea how
difficult it was to find good care or what the costs would be,''
says Smith. ``Infant care in Boston averages $12,000 for a
full-year, full-day program, and some preschool programs are as
high as $10,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a staff member of Parents United for Child Care, says the
organization conducted a survey of 450 parents with children in day
care this year and discovered that 5 percent were forced to take on
a second job to pay for care. ``The biggest chunk of people are
middle class who can't save any money, which is the situation my
wife and I are in,'' he says. ``If you are spending $700 or $800 a
month on child care, you can't save for college or secondary
education. It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Smiths' two children are in day and afterschool
care only part time, the couple spend, on average, $700 per month,
more than their mortgage payment.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Parents United for Child Care filed a bill
called Childcare for Everyone. The measure would increase the
amount in day-care costs parents can deduct on their state tax
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Morales is still trying to make ends meet. She
started out as a substitute teacher and fell in love with the job.
So, she went back to school _ to UMass Boston's Urban College.
There, she took early childhood education classes in preparation
for what she thought would one day become a career.

NET CAN'T DECK THE MALLS -- YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On-line shopping is supposed to be going mainstream
this holiday season, so why is Jeff Levine still hunting for gifts
the old-fashioned way at CambridgeSide Galleria?
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old city planner for nearby Somerville, Levine is
young, educated, and computer-savvy, going on line almost every
day.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, he seems an ideal candidate for hunkering down in
front of his personal computer and buying gifts from some trendy
electronic-commerce retailer like Amazon.com, which bills its World
Wide Web site as the world's biggest book store.
</P>
<P>
   Yet early December finds Levine in a mall, undaunted by the
prospect of big crowds, long lines, and scarce parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to beat a mall when you just want to browse,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   If the hype of e-commerce advocates is to be believed, 17
million Americans will buy something on line this holiday season _
many of them dressed only in their pajamas. After a few years of
experimenting and buying items such as software and hot sauce, many
consumers are at last comfortable with electronic shopping.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, on-line holiday sales are expected to double,
growing from last year's $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion _ or so
claims Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no need to start writing obituaries for the mall
and the department store just yet. While nearly half of US
households now own a personal computer, on-line sales will account
for only about 2 percent of the more than $170 billion US consumers
are expected to spend this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet shopping is still so small it hardly shows up,'' says
Britt Beemer of America's Research Group, a firm that surveys
consumer shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say the Internet won't change the way people
shop and the way retailers do business.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boston Consulting Group, vice president David Pecaut is
eager to dispel some myths about on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   What's likely to emerge is not a battle between hip e-commerce
retailers on one side and old-fashioned brick-and-mortar retailers
on the other. As Pecaut sees it, shrewd retailers are likely to
operate both in stores and on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some brick-and-mortar retailers continue to shy
away from the Net, afraid a Web site may cannibalize store sales.
Such fears, Pecaut says, are unfounded _ and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who get on the Web late will struggle,'' falling
further and further behind those who got there first, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, the hallowed department-store chain, may offer one
blueprint for future success. In June, Macy's mailed out its first
catalog, and last month it ``relaunched'' its Web site. An early
Web site sold only 400 items. At the new version of Macys.Com ,
shoppers can choose from among 150,000 items.
</P>
<P>
   By offering three choices _ stores, catalogs, and Web site _
Macy's expects to see syngergies, savings, and more sales.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs and Web sites, of course, mean Macy's can sell
merchandise in places where it has no stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live in Kansas, you can now buy gifts from Macy's,''
says Carol Sanger, spokeswoman for Federated Department Stores
Inc., Macy's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can the Web help Macy's reach new geographic areas ,
but it will also help Macy's to reach out to new demographic
groups. Most department-store customers range in age from 30 to 50,
but on-line shoppers tend to be younger. Macy's hopes its Web site
will attract this much coveted younger crowd.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sanger, a traditional merchant such as Macy's has
an advantage over pure e-commerce retailers that sell their
merchandise only on the Web. Unlike new companies with strange
names, Macy's has a long history that may allay the fears of
consumers wary of using their credit cards for on-line purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated industry claims that encryption makes such
transactions safe, mall shopper Levine is one who remains wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still concerned about security,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dempsey is worried about something else; he thinks his
shopping strategy won't work on line. The Web may be great if you
know ahead of time what you want to buy, but if you're looking for
gift ideas, malls are better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to buy theme gifts,'' says Dempsey, a 25-year-old
teacher who prefers to buy several small items for individuals on
his shopping list rather than one big present.
</P>
<P>
   When coming up with themes, window-shopping in malls is a source
of inspiration, he says. And though he often goes on the Internet
for other reasons, he says: ``Right now it's easier to go to the
malls. Besides, I actually like to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Macys.Com president Kent Anderson doesn't think the Internet
will end browsing as we know it; it will simply modify old habits.
Some folks will browse Web sites and buy in stores, and others will
browse stores and then buy on line, he believes. Macy's job is to
be all things to all shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper of the future may look like Northeastern University
student Leo Wiriadjaja, who buys books on line and clothes at the
mall. Just as Macy's offers customers three ways to buy
merchandise, many consumers will reach a point when they buy some
items on line, some by catalog, and others in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't Wiriadjaja buy clothes on line? ``I'm not a normal
size,'' he says. ``I like to try things on first.''
</P>
<P>
   At its Web site, Lands' End Inc. looks to address such concerns
with a new ``virtual mannequin,'' one of many personalization
features e-commerce retailers are relying on more heavily this
year, as they seek to find ways to make on-line shopping a more
customer-friendly experience.
</P>
<P>
   At Landsend.com, some visitors can type in their measurements
and color preferences for a sweater, and the mannequin will not
only exhibit an image of how it will look on their body type, but
also suggest ideas for color-coordinated skirts and trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature helps men select shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many shirts are available that it can be a daunting
challenge to wade through all of them,'' says Willie Doyle, a
Lands' End Internet executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Express aims to make that task easier. Type in a
fabric preference. (Oxford pinpoint or 60-40 cotton blend?) Type in
a collar preference. (Button-down or tab?) After answering these
and similar questions, customers can quickly zero in on what they
want, Doyle says.
</P>
<P>
   Other Web sites tout similar search features.
</P>
<P>
   At Holtoutlet.com, the Web site of a Waltham company that sells
toys on line, shoppers can use a ``toy detective.'' No, this
playroom shamus won't be able to track down Furby _ but, then,
Furby is also hard to find at stores _ but type in the age of a
child on your gift list, a price range, and the kid's favorite TV
show, and the toy detective is supposed to round up some likely
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Holt debuted something else to help shoppers: a
rating system that lets customers grade the toys they've bought and
publish brief reviews that appear on Holt's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   MotherNature.com employs a similar strategy as it pursues its
goal to become the Amazon.com of on-line vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Type in a malady at MotherNature.com's Web site, and a range of
possible remedies pop up. Built into the site is a ``health
encyclopedia,'' explains marketing vice president Sharon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the best retail Web sites are ``selection and
information,'' she says. People may be reluctant to discuss medical
problems with a store clerk, but they may be more at ease going on
line in the privacy of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Certain commodity-type items such as books and music CDs have
sold well on the Internet. After all, a book is a book, whether
bought at Amazon.com or an old-fashioned book store.
</P>
<P>
   Rice believes vitamins, herbs, and supplements fall into a
similar category; by offering more choices and information, an
e-commerce retailer can gain an edge over brick-and-mortar rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Time _ or a lack of it _ may be the mall's worst enemy and the
Web's best friend. Faced with so many chores and errands,
two-income families want fast, hassle-free ways to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Such realities may explain why some malls are feeling the pinch
from the so-called power center, a much smaller strip mall anchored
by a superstore such as Home Depot, says Simmons College retail
professor Susan Sampson. The appeal? Consumers can zip in and out
of power centers far easier than big malls.
</P>
<P>
   But if consumers are looking to save time, they also want
service. And on that score, many Web sites don't measure up.
According to a recent study by Jupiter Communications, many Web
sites are ``failing miserably'' at service. Seeing an opening,
retail chains such as Filene's are redesigning parts of their store
floor plans to make shopping more convenient and less
time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Web sites will get things right sooner or later _
even a confirmed mall shopper like Levine acknowledges that.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he can see himself shopping on line some day,
he replies, ``It's probably just a matter of time.''

FINDING GIFTS _ AND SOME SECURITY _ ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This Christmas, you could probably do all your shopping from
home. The Internet gold rush has driven thousands of merchants onto
the Web, selling everything from jewelry to automobiles. Now the
big problem is finding what you want, and a trustworthy merchant to
buy it from.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most secure place for electronic shopping is the
America Online computer network. AOL runs its own shopping mall,
open only to subscribers to the service. Many of the merchants
doing business on AOL are well-known outfits like Walt Disney Co.,
L.L. Bean and Macy's. Many also run major shopping sites on the
public Internet, so you needn't be an AOL subscriber to deal with
them. But as the saying goes, membership has its privileges.
</P>
<P>
   AOL pledges total safety and satisfaction to customers who
purchase merchandise at its on-line mall. All merchants must use
the latest digital security systems to make sure customer data
can't be swiped by hackers. The threat of having one's credit card
number intercepted by data thieves has been wildly exaggerated. But
to reassure customers, AOL promises to reimburse shoppers if their
credit card data falls into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all stores at the AOL site must respect their
customers' privacy and guarantee their satisfaction. AOL itself
promises to reimburse customers if the guarantee isn't met by the
merchant .
</P>
<P>
   About 14 million people are AOL members. What about the rest of
us? We can find similar on-line shopping centers at the popular
portal sites. These sites began life as search engines, listing
millions of interesting Internet pages. Now, in order to attract a
constant stream of traffic, they offer many other services,
including listings of retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these are companies that have paid for a spot on, say,
the Yahoo shopping site. Unlike AOL, Yahoo offers virtually no
assurance that one of its stores is a good place to shop. ``There's
not a universal set of protections that apply to every single
store,'' said Yahoo director of brand management Karen Edwards. The
company will offer refunds to disgruntled shoppers on a
case-by-case basis, and spokesman Tim Brady said that Yahoo will
rid itself of bad apples. So far, he added, it hasn't been
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Excite Web site offers somewhat more consumer protection
through its Certified Merchants program. These are on-line stores
that have to meet fairly rigorous customer service standards. But
not every store listed at the Excite shopping mall is certified,
and it took a little hunting to find a list of the certified
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Most uncertified stores are run by honest merchants, so don't
write them off. Preston Gralla , author of ``The Complete Idiot's
Guide to Online Shopping,'' says you can take steps to protect
yourself. ``Check for warranty and return policies,'' he urges.
Responsible merchants will generally display them prominently at
the site. ``If there's no warranty and return policy posted, I
wouldn't shop at the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Also beware of sites that don't display the address and phone
number of the company. ``If a site isn't willing to post that kind
of information, I wouldn't want to do business with them,'' said
Gralla.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Internet credit card theft is highly unlikely,
reputable firms will use a secure transaction system for extra
protection. Your browser will display a message when you connect to
a secured shopping area on the `Net, and the ``http'' at the
beginning of the Web address will turn into ``https.`` If this
doesn't happen, shop elsewhere. These days, the Internet has plenty
of alternatives to choose from.

A GENTLE GENERAL TAKES COMMAND OF CELEBRATED NEW YORK EATERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's just before noon on a recent Tuesday and the
kitchen at Tavern on the Green appears ready for battle.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two chefs have been preparing sauces, salads and side
dishes for the past three hours. They have now turned their
attention to entrees for the 500 or so patrons expected for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The air is intoxicating as the nose attempts to identify the
different aromas vying for attention. Roasted lobster with rosemary
risotto dominates one cooking station; barbecued baby back ribs
leave a heavenly smell in a nearby area. Activity is in all
directions, but chaos seems to be at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because it's only Tuesday and this is only lunch
at one of the Big Apple's top destination-dining spots. Another
reason may be the kitchen's commander-in-chief, Sam Hazen, who is
decidedly down to earth despite his high-profile position.
</P>
<P>
   Marching watchfully through the various kitchen stations,
sampling dishes and nodding or commenting as he passes, Hazen is
the only cook not wearing a toque, the classic tall white chef's
hat. The general with blue-collar roots is attired in a hunter
green baseball-style cap with the restaurant's logo.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a sterling culinary resume, Hazen was named executive
chef at Tavern on the Green in late September. He says he is
committed to making Tavern as well known for its cuisine as it is
for the amazing topiary gardens encircling the Central Park
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is simple. People come here from all over the world
to eat, and we want them telling their friends and neighbors
they've never had a better meal anywhere,'' explains Hazen, a trim
salt-and-pepper goatee wreathing his mouth. ``We want Tavern to be
the talk of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is not in yet. New York's restaurant critics usually
give a chef a few months to get settled before they review him.
</P>
<P>
   For that Hazen, 41, must be grateful, because few gigs are as
demanding as top chef at Tavern on the Green. It is a massive maze
of a place that seats 850 at a time. In 1997, the restaurant had
revenues in excess of $34.5 million, making it the highest-grossing
independently owned restaurant in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It took Hazen more than two weeks to learn the names of all 70
chefs in the kitchen, not to mention the wait staff and
dishwashers. The restaurant was the host site for the New York City
Marathon in early November. After six weeks on the job, Hazen found
himself serving 21,000 pounds of pasta to a finish-line party for
17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't lie, it can be insane,'' he admits. ``It's like
driving a car 180 miles an hour in the left lane of the expressway
and then getting off in the right lane. It's a blur and it's
definitely a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a job that pays more than six figures and has the
potential to catapult Hazen into the galaxy of celebrity chefs, the
men and women viewed daily on the TV Food Network and public
television's numerous cooking shows.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty impressive stuff for a guy from upstate New York. Yet
hardly surprising, considering Hazen was practically born with a
cleaver in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Sam Hazen, and uncle, Russell, owned the Fifth
Avenue Diner in Troy. So the kid who was named for his dad spent
every day after school in the diner's kitchen. Summers, he was
there all day, every day.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was old enough to drive, young Sam was adept at
roasting veal shanks and baking pizzas. The family would also own
Three Coins and the Carriage House in Latham, before taking over
Someplace Else in Schuylerville. Sam Jr. stayed at his father's
side with each move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my inspiration, without a doubt. I wouldn't be where I
am today without him,'' Hazen says of his father, who died of
cancer on Christmas Day 1976. ``I'm the only one left in the family
who's still cooking. Everyone else looks at it like it's too nutty
and too many hours, and they're probably right.''
</P>
<P>
   All four Hazen children worked alongside their parents in the
family's restaurants. Only the youngest, John, is still tied to the
food industry: He's a bartender at the San Remo Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all helped out, but Sam was with my father cooking more
than any of us,'' remembers Hazen's sister, Ruth Madigan, who now
lives in Schenectady. ``He always had an interest in it. When my
father passed away, I think Sam wanted to do something to carry on
what my father was proud of, preparing good food.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazen married his high school sweetheart, Lisa Leith, who
persuaded him to enter the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best thing that ever happened to me,'' Hazen
says. ``The CIA was the springboard to where I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   He finished second in his class in 1982, and has been on the
culinary fast track ever since. He was a sous chef at several
acclaimed New York restaurants, La Cote Basque and Quilted Giraffe,
before venturing to London for more training. He was only the
second American to work in the kitchen at Le Gavroche, regarded as
England's premier restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen returned to the CIA to teach for three years, where he was
a popular instructor, according to culinary dean Fritz
Sonnenschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   But he also felt the call to action, and decided to return to
Manhattan's intensely competitive fine dining world ``while I was
still young with some vinegar.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hazen and his wife, along with their 6-year-old son, Jake, live
in an Upper West Side apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He began his reappearance in the New York dining scene at
Cascabel, now closed but at the time a hot spot in the Union Square
area. Hazen was executive chef with a crew of 10, and the New York
Times' demanding critic Ruth Reichl graced his food with two stars
denoting ``very good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hazen's cooking seems to recognize no boundaries,'' Reichl
wrote. ``What is impressive is that he cooks with such confidence
that he never loses his footing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichl, who is determined to wait until after the first of the
year to see how Hazen is faring at Tavern, remembers he was
particularly impressive with vegetarian dishes at Cascabel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the chefs who are trained the way he was tend to make
vegetarian food that feels like the middle is missing. I was really
struck with what a good job he did with vegetarian dishes,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen called Reichl before taking the job at Tavern. He wanted
advice, he says. He wasn't sure if it was a sound career move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for any chef those are difficult, terrible jobs, but
it's an amazing experience running a kitchen that large,'' Reichl
said. ``It's not like doing a regular restaurant. This is like
administering a city as opposed to a room. I would think that any
serious chef at some point would want to run a kitchen like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazen agrees, and that's why he and owner LeRoy Warner agreed to
a two-year contract. ``I decided I couldn't pass up this job. It's
a big job and very few people would be offered a job like this. To
come to this point in my career I had to do a lot beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts me in a different category,'' he adds. ``I could
jump into a hotel job now, if that's what I want to do. I was
always known before this as a white-tablecloth chef, but now I've
expanded my reputation and resume.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the classically trained chef has been promoted
to a position where he does little cooking.In a teeming kitchen
where more than 50 chefs are working at once on a Friday or
Saturday evening, engaged in conversations in Spanish, Italian,
Portuguese and Chinese, Hazen is a coordinator and administrator.
</P>
<P>
   There are three head sous chefs who supervise the many cooks,
and each answers to the executive sous chef, who reports to Hazen.
There is even one chef whose sole responsibility is preparing
buffet-style ``family meals'' for the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I don't do a lot of hands-on cooking,'' Hazen
admits. ``I will cook for VIPs, but I do a lot more tasting than
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, many nights when I leave here to go home I
realize when I'm on the way home that I'm incredibly hungry. I am
around food all the time, but I don't eat much. I must taste a
thousand different things every day, but I rarely sit down to eat
anything. One of the first things I do when I get home is look
around the house and see what my wife prepared for our son that
day.''

A DAY WITHOUT LIGHTS OR CAFFEINE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This was the third wake-up call in a week, and
this one was without coffee.
</P>
<P>
   First there was a 4.1 quake that rattled the Bay area. Then
there was a tornado in Richmond. On Tuesday there was a blackout in
San Francisco, right at rush hour and caffeine rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   God is telling us something, something about stocking up on
batteries, food, bottled water and a camp stove to make our own
joe. Stock up at the ATM too, because the forces of darkness at the
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. control our cash.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered the funniest things worked, and some unfunny
things didn't, just as we did after the earthquake in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   We learned that all our computers and links to the Internet are
dependent on technology invented by Edison _ sparks through cables
that some dope can short out by forgetting to throw a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Powering a computerized economy with PG&AMP;E is like powering a UFO
with a rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   We also discovered that we were on our own. Some of us knew that
already from '89. Good luck finding a cop or a fire truck when the
Big One or the Millennium comes.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours into the blackout on Tuesday, the only person
I saw directing traffic was Pan Pacific Hotel doorman James
Spencer, a veteran of the 1965 New York blackout. Also spotted
directing traffic were cable car gripmen, a priest and some nuns.
Official city authority figures were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most ordinary San Franciscans performed
magnificently. Just as in '89, on Tuesday drivers stopped for
stoplights that weren't working, and took turns letting each other
through _ most of them.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you can't run a red light that never turns red.
</P>
<P>
   At intersections on Market Street, pedestrians ruled _ and never
gave drivers a break.
</P>
<P>
   Muni buses worked _ the diesels, anyway. Muni is used to
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The diesel buses were out in force within the first hour of the
citywide blackout, carrying people to work, and then back home when
they found out their workplaces were closed. It was like D-Day and
Dunkirk, all in one morning, but without the shooting. Most people
were polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see some smiling faces,'' said John Pitts, a
driver on the 14-Mission line on Tuesday afternoon. ``You should
have seen some of the tempers this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Marco DiTano, owner of the Mondo Cafe at Mission and Second, has
a theory about why San Franciscans are at their best during
earthquakes and blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When insane things happen, the people who are already nuts are
more sane than the sane people,'' he said. ``That's why Muni
worked. That's why San Franciscans came through.''
</P>
<P>
   When the going gets weird, the weird get going.
</P>
<P>
   DiTano counts himself among those who are already a little nuts,
so he came through for his regulars by making the most valuable
substance of all Tuesday morning: coffee. He boiled the water in
the pizza oven.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the word got out, it was like the plague _ word
spread everywhere,'' he said. ``They were coming back for coffee.
They were standing in line. I had to hand out numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Lee Dahlberg walked from the Hall of Justice to his post
in Hallidie Plaza. ``The two things I wanted when I got here were
coffee and a potty.''
</P>
<P>
   The blackout had shut down the automated JCDecaux toilet near
the cable car turnaround _ with no one inside, fortunately.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, according to Dahlberg, his lieutenant was thinking
up practice scenarios for emergency drills _ and just then, the
lights went out.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there it was: an emergency scenario for all those
other bad things that could happen in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Someone on television offered a theory that the blackout might
be a Year 2000 problem practice drill.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it was, all right, but by accident. It was human
error as usual at PG&AMP;E. Homer Simpson seems to have taken a job at
a substation in San Mateo. The power came back only in patches.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Tuesday, the power at the offices of one of the most
powerful men in the city hadn't come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Walter Shorenstein didn't pay his power bill,'' said
former Assemblyman Bill Bagley, who was parked in a car in front of
Shorenstein's dark building at 50 California.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, we all pay our power bills, and that can be a lot
of money. For that, PG&AMP;E pays us back with a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it meant losses of thousands of dollars in business,
and maybe even being stuck in an elevator at work.
</P>
<P>
   For others, it was just a bad hair day because the dryer didn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   For almost everyone it was a wake-up call. A wake-up call
without coffee to wake up with.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, when you're buying your French roast for your
emergency supplies, be sure to have the beans ground because your
coffee grinder won't work.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if it is a Braun, it's run by PG&AMP;E.

SENATORS SEEK COMMITMENT FROM NORTH CAROLINA BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The two U.S. senators from California have asked
the head of BankAmerica, which was acquired by NationsBank Corp. in
September, to demonstrate its commitment to serving the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat who serves on the Senate Banking
Committee, on Tuesday requested that the chairman and chief
executive of the company schedule meetings with California
officials to describe the bank's plans for making community
development money available in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent events have renewed our concerns about the direction of
the new BankAmerica,'' Boxer said Tuesday in a letter to Hugh
McColl, who headed NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C., before its
merger with BankAmerica of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   She referred to the resignation of BankAmerica's former chief
executive, David Coulter, who had been on a track to ultimately
succeed McColl, and called it ``highly troubling.'' She also
mentioned the resignation in the past two months of several senior
executives who are women.
</P>
<P>
   These events raise ``questions about the new BankAmerica's
commitments to continuing its widely praised outreach programs,''
Boxer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Howard Gutman, a spokesman for Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, also a Democrat, said the senator would be writing ``a
private letter to McColl expressing her concerns'' about reports of
the bank's direction.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McColl said he was offended by reports questioning
the bank's commitment to promoting women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure our position is crystal clear _ Bank of
America is an inclusive meritocracy,'' McColl said in a letter to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we are firmly committed to the advancement of the
most qualified people and we will reward these associates who
achieve results regardless of their gender, religion, sexual
orientation, or any other non-performance-related factors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, several San Francisco officials, as well
as state Assemblyman Lou Papan, the Democratic chairman of the
Assembly Banking Committee, have said they are considering severing
city and state financial ties with the bank, citing concerns about
cultural and political differences between the North Carolina
headquarters and the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the departure of women executives in particular
triggered a sharp response. San Francisco City Attorney Louise
Renne called it ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank counters that 1,100 bank officials had ``change and
control agreements'' in their contracts through which attractive
severance packages were made available if they did not wish to
continue with the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bank spokesman John Keane said Tuesday that 70 percent of those
covered by the agreements were men and 30 percent were women. He
said more than 30 percent of those employees electing to stay were
women, which, he said demonstrates the bank's attractiveness to
women as a place to work.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer asked McColl to discuss these and other issues with city
and state officials and advocates for community development. McColl
is scheduled to speak to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on
Jan. 12 and to Town Hall in Los Angeles on Jan. 13 about
BankAmerica's commitment to California, Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also asked McColl to meet with members of the California
congressional delegation and the state Legislature; establish a
California Reinvestment Coalition ``commitment for California,''
and personally ensure that community groups who criticized the
recent merger ``will suffer no retribution in terms of loan
approval or other services received.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane said Boxer may not be aware that meetings with some
community development groups have already taken place.

ARMY ARSENAL MAY REACH DEAL WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Illinois, Arkansas)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB GARDINIER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERVLIET, N.Y. _ The U.S. Army's oldest arsenal is in
discussions with defense contractors about taking over some of its
operations, and an announcement about a deal could come soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has resisted the privatization of its arsenals in
Watervliet, Rock Island, Ill., and Pine Bluff, Ark., citing a need
for the United States to preserve its defense industrial base for
security reasons. But the Department of Defense is now conducting
similar privatization studies at the other arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Watervliet is unique as it makes some of the world's most
expensive long-gun barrels for cannons, mortars and howitzers. The
Benet Laboratories, which employs about 200 and works on materials
testing and development, also is located at the arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been talks concerning private concerns and I think
there will be more on this coming out later this week,'' said
Charlie Diamond, spokesman for Rep. Michael McNulty, D-N.Y. The
arsenal is located near Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is talking with a number of corporations, including
General Dynamics Corp. of Falls Church, Va., and Harsco Corp.'s BMY
Combat Systems Divisions in York, Pa., could set up shop at the
arsenal, said Tony Gaetano, a consultant for arsenal privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are discussions the Army is having with a number of
companies that is a part of a two-year review of gathering
information about the cost of present arsenal operations,'' Gaetano
said. ``That information will be shared with all companies wishing
to make bids to operate in the arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army itself, which now runs the arsenal and employs civilian
laborers, will also be able to bid, but it will have to prove it
can operate it at a profit, Gaetano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Dynamics and other companies are interested in running
the production side of things there but right now much of that is
up in the air,'' Gaetano said. ``I don't think that there are any
hard proposals on the table yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Privatization could affect most of the approximately 970 jobs at
the arsenal, though it is unclear how. The review will began in
October, Gaetano said.
</P>
<P>
   The union representing the workers has opposed privatizing the
185-year-old arsenal, which has lost 2,000 jobs over the past nine
years. Richard Brown, president of the National Federation of
Federal Employees union local at the arsenal, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have serious concerns about the work force there,'' Diamond
said. ``We don't want someone to come in with their own workers and
force out arsenal workers.''

AIRLINER CLOSE CALLS RISE IN THE NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Contrary to a nationwide decrease in near midair
airplane collisions, the number of high-altitude close calls over
New York state has doubled since last year, according to the
Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   That increase _ from four during the first 10 months of 1997 to
eight during the same period this year _ is part of an overall rise
in near-collision incidents over the seven-state region that
stretches from Washington, D.C., to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Two harrowing incidents in the past week brought talk of near
midair collisions, or NMACs as they are called by airlines and
controllers, into sharp focus.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, two airliners flying 33,000 feet above Long Island
came within one mile of each other _ a distance the FAA considers
perilously close _ before their pilots quickly banked in opposite
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Five days earlier, two commercial jets cruising high above the
Albany area were flying on a collision course before an air-traffic
controller in New Hampshire noticed the potential for disaster and
alerted the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter case, in which an on-board computer system appears
to have put the planes on a collision course, one controller later
told officials the two planes ventured so close that their radar
images had merged into one.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the marked increase in near midair accidents in New
York, as well as in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, reports of such
incidents nationwide decreased almost 19 percent in the past year,
from 204 in the first 10 months of 1997 to 166 during the same
period this year, FAA records show.
</P>
<P>
   Most incidents involve commercial airliners, which are required
by federal regulations to keep several miles between one another
horizontally and thousands of feet of buffer space vertically.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials in New York were unable to explain Tuesday why the
number of near collisions has increased this year. But one airline
industry expert said the increase has less to do with increasing
departures at airports than with a rise in the number of
``overflights,'' long-distance flights through established
air-traffic corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cases I'm familiar with, the problem stems from
overflights mixing with departures of local traffic,'' said Ed
Faberman, executive director of the Air Carrier Association, an
airline trade group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, near midair collisions are more likely to occur over
Chicago, Los Angeles or New York City, all of which lie under
popular overflight paths, Faberman said, as well as some less
populous parts of the country. For many years, Maine, for example,
lay underneath a common flight route to Europe, he said.

SAVVY SAVERS WILL TAKE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>

   ALBANY, N.Y. _20One of the scariest things about working for a
living is thinking you might always be working for a living, or at
least far later into your old age than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers might have feared just that after getting a look at
the third-quarter statements from their retirement plans at work.
That was the period that reflected the 512-point stock market dive
at the end of August. The implications didn't really sink in for
many people until October, when they received their
July-to-September quarterly account statements that detailed what
the market did to their retirement-plan holdings in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a blessing in disguise, financial planners and
money managers said. Individuals can learn valuable, lasting
lessons about how to handle their retirement planning from this
year's market roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The September statement was a rude shock from the June
statement,'' when the market was riding high, said Lynn Barnes, a
certified financial planner at Wright &AMP; Barnes in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Barnes' business is to manage retirement accounts for
small companies, whose employees call her directly with questions.
And they did.
</P>
<P>
   She got such questions as: ``What happened? I put money in, and
I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that many individuals are only now coming to
grips with this year's stock market volatility and what it may mean
for their financial futures. Their retirement-plan statements, and
not the daily fluctuations of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are
the key.
</P>
<P>
   Many more households _ more than 30 percent in 1995 _ owned
stocks indirectly through vehicles such as retirement plans, than
directly (15 percent in the same year), according to the report,
``The State of Working America 1998-99,'' by Economic Policy
Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in recent years, some employees got the
unrealistic notion that their retirement accounts would forever
increase in value, because for a time it seemed like the stock
market behaved that way.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with some people who work at Hannay Reels
in Westerlo, N.Y., a company that makes giant reels for firetrucks
and industrial plants. Some of the 150 employees thought the market
was on a permanent hot streak, said President Roger Hannay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They assumed that life would always be like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. The market can and does go down, sometimes inexplicably,
and sometimes hops back up again.
</P>
<P>
   The predominant theory, espoused by New York Comptroller H. Carl
McCall, who oversees 30 outside money managers for the state
employee pensions, is that people need to look at the long haul of
10 to 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pull out when the stock market goes down
temporarily,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some strategies and developments, though, that people
need to keep an eye on in their retirement plans in the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know when you can make changes to your retirement plans, such
as when you can increase or decrease the amount of money going into
a 401(k) plan, or when you can switch some of the funds from one
kind of mutual fund to another.
</P>
<P>
   Employers usually establish specific periods of time when
employees can change course. This doesn't imply that you should
switch around all the time, or whenever you can.
</P>
<P>
   Hannay said that some employees at his company wanted to move
their holdings immediately after the market dived, and he told them
that their company plan's rules allow such movements only every
three months, at the start of the financial quarter. That's a good
policy, he said, because it makes it ``impossible to do market
chasing'' and focuses people more on long-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider putting more money, not less, into 401(k) retirement
accounts. Some nervous investors wanted to put a stop to new
contributions from their paychecks when the market tanked, said
Twila Slesnick, co-author of a new book, ``IRAs, 401(k)s and Other
Retirement Plans: Taking Your Money Out'' (Nolo Press, $21.95). But
that's the wrong approach, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Your money can buy more investments when the market is down, she
said. Other stock-pickers have been making the same point, and feel
the market dive was fortunate, because it made some stocks in
well-managed companies much more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do more research on the different investment strategies
offered inside your retirement plan to make sure it is properly
balanced. In bull-market years, some people got invested too
heavily in high-tech stocks, for instance, that they counted on for
big price appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Some people even underestimated how much they would have to put
away, said Barnes, because they were counting on spectacular
investment growth. But that strategy led to losses for some when
the market tanked.
</P>
<P>
   You may need some stocks that are likely to lead to slower, but
more reliable, financial growth, as well as some bonds with a
predictable rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   Your age will make a big difference in what kind of mix is right
for you. People who are only two or three years from retiring need
at least some of their retirement money in bonds, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers close to retirement at Hannay Reels, for instance,
wished they had some more conservative holdings in their accounts
when the market dived, Hannay said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going forward, stay abreast of the options your employer
offers in 401(k) or similar plans and the professional
money-management firms the company hires to invest the money.
Employers choose money managers to invest according to certain
parameters _ such as a growth manager or a value manager _ and the
firms have to adhere to those standards.
</P>
<P>
   But within those categories of investment styles, firms can and
do periodically fire managers and switch to other firms they think
will do a better job. There weren't wholesale firings of managers
just because of this last stock market dive, however, because
``everybody was hit with equal pain,'' said Andrew Guillette,
consultant at Boston firm Cerulli Associates.

<P>
   MELILLA, Spain _ Squinting in the hot sun, with dust swirling
round his bare feet, Hamid Uld-Mohamed is the sort of young man who
strikes fear into the hearts of many Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Mauritania, a poverty-ravaged country in
western Africa, the slender 18-year-old now lives in a camp for
migrants in Melilla, a Spanish port on the coast of North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Founded as a fort in the 1500s and expanded in recent decades,
this small city borders Morocco, making it a front line between the
European Union and the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of migrants before him, like thousands more sure
to come, Uld-Mohamed is here on a mission: to use Melilla as a
springboard across the Mediterranean Sea to a shiny new life in the
EU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're intelligent and hard-working, you have no
chance to get anywhere in Africa, so going to Europe is your only
hope,'' he says, swatting a fly on his neck. ``Even if they put up
electrified fences all along the borders of Europe, even if they
put up the barriers of hell, people will keep on coming. Europe can
never keep us out.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Europeans _ the homemaker in Munich, the banker in
Paris, the plumber in London _ his words are a harbinger of
Armageddon, proof positive that Western Europe is in danger of
being swamped by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Like the southwestern United States, the European Union _ a
political and economic alliance of 15 states _ is grappling with an
immigration crisis. Some experts think that as many as a million
people fleeing poverty, war and persecution in the developing world
could try to breach the EU's external borders this year.
</P>
<P>
   Migrants have been coming to Europe for decades. But now, with
nearly 17 million jobless citizens in the EU and social security
systems bursting at the seams, many Europeans have lost the desire
to play host to the world's huddled masses.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they struggle to make sense of the changes wrought by
immigration in their societies, Europeans are hunkering down behind
tighter entry rules, beefed-up border security and mounting
xenophobia. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Analysts use the term ``Fortress Europe'' to describe the
anti-immigration mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask people whether they want any more immigrants to
come here, they will shout, `No! No! No!''' says Patrick Weill, a
scholar who helped draft immigration laws in France. ``The trouble
is that that in itself does not stop anyone coming, so we must
learn to cope better.''
</P>
<P>
   While EU countries struggle to stanch the flow, the migrants
keep on coming. Again and again, they try to slip through borders
on foot and by plane, in small boats, stowed away in car trunks and
cargo ships, even clinging to the undersides of railway carriages.
Some pass through customs with real or fake tourist visas and then
never leave.
</P>
<P>
   Most migrants sell everything _ and risk life and limb _ to make
the journey to Western Europe. Many die in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies estimate that 1,000 people have drowned this year _
compared with 3,000 in all of the previous decade _ in the Straits
of Gibraltar, the treacherous waterway between Morocco and Spain
that is known as ``Europe's Rio Grande.''
</P>
<P>
   But still they come.
</P>
<P>
   Experts think that 200,000 to 400,000 people will sneak across
the external borders of Fortress Europe and vanish into the
underground economy this year. Another 250,000, some of whom will
also cross the frontier illegally, are expected to join the queue
for asylum. As many as 4 million foreigners are now thought to be
living illegally in the EU, compared with about 5 million in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Melilla, Hamid Uld-Mohamed and 300 other men from all
over Africa and the Middle East are crammed into La Granja, an
abandoned farm used as a camp for migrants. Their womenfolk and
children are lodged in public housing scattered around the city.
Almost every day, more people arrive, seeking asylum or work
permits.
</P>
<P>
   Uld-Mohamed's application for asylum was rejected by the Spanish
government last July. If his appeal fails, he plans to slip into
continental Europe illegally. If the authorities try to deport him
back to Mauritania, he says, he will kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   Such all-or-nothing desperation is common among migrants in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa and the Middle East, in Asia and Eastern Europe,
millions of people live in political and economic misery. In the
wired-up global village, everyone can see that the grass is much
greener in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the Third World dream of a new life in the United
States, but colonial ties and geography often make Western Europe
the first choice for a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Besides creating millions of potential migrants, the breakup of
the Soviet Union has spawned a patchwork of new travel routes
leading to the EU's eastern flank. With few exceptions, border
controls have slackened across the old communist bloc, largely
because post-Soviet governments are too busy nation-building to
worry about people fleeing westward.
</P>
<P>
   Internal changes have also made the European Union _ which
consists of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden and the United Kingdom _ a more appealing destination.
Thanks to the Schengen agreement, border controls have been
abolished within much of the EU, allowing travelers _ including
illegal immigrants _ to roam more or less freely across the
continent once they get past the external frontier.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, most of the world's hot spots are closer to
the European Union than to the United States. Kosovo, the war-torn
Serbian province that is home to thousands of displaced people, may
seem remote to Americans, but it lies just 80 miles across the
Adriatic Sea from Italy and 350 miles by land from Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Benkharroubi Benkhada is a refugee from the bloody civil war in
Algeria, which sits across the Mediterranean from Spain's Costa
Dorada and France's Cote d'Azur.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployed 25-year-old fled his hometown of Mascara when
Islamic terrorists burned down the family house and murdered his
brother, who was in the army. He has been expelled twice from
Melilla, but he is now back at La Granja camp.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I will keep on coming here, 10 times, 20 times, whatever it
takes,'' he says, picking at a scab on his right hand. ``I will
keep coming until Europe accepts me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the global financial crisis bites down, migrants are
increasingly lured by the glitter of wealth in the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Average wages in Western European nations are more than 10 times
higher than those in neighboring countries, and the gap is even
wider farther afield. Morocco is a relatively peaceful democracy,
but a recent poll there found that three of every four people have
considered moving to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Modern technology helps promote the European dream across the
globe. In most countries along the fringe of the EU, any old TV set
can pick up European channels with their ads for luxury goods and
programs featuring beautiful people leading glamorous lives. Every
day, thousands of settled immigrants phone home reports of their
success in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, Uld-Mohamed grew
up watching movies and soap operas from the West. Earlier this
year, when a teacher strike ended his schooling and a violent
neighbor accused him _ wrongly, he says _ of impregnating the man's
daughter, the teen-ager decided to cut his losses and head for the
wonderland depicted on the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all grow up seeing Europe on TV and knowing that life is
good for people there,'' he says. ``Our parents tell us that our
destiny is in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Media reports are sometimes a direct catalyst for migration
toward the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a television station in Slovakia ran a documentary
hinting that Britain's social security system was a soft touch.
Within days, hundreds of Slovak Gypsies turned up at the White
Cliffs of Dover claiming asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Most migrants bound for the EU travel much farther than do
Mexicans heading for the United States _ and usually with less
chance of returning home to business as usual. It took Uld-Mohamed
nearly five months to reach Melilla from Mauritania. Carrying only
a few essentials in a bag and the clothes on his back, he traveled
1,500 miles across four African countries, working odd jobs along
the way to pay for food and bus rides. Twice he was beaten and
robbed by local police. By the time he reached La Granja, his
camel-skin shoes were in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Going back is not really an option for the gentle youngster who
dreams of being a graphics designer in Paris or Barcelona, Spain.
Like most migrants, he sold all his belongings to finance his trip
to the promised land. His school career is ruined, he says, and he
has lost touch with his family, who moved to Burkina Faso or the
Ivory Coast in search of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have given up everything,'' he explains. ``All that is left
for me now is to find a way into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Uld-Mohamed knows that will not be easy. Fewer than one in four
applications for asylum in EU countries is accepted, and his case
is far from watertight. Nor is sneaking into Europe as easy as it
once was. Following the U.S. example, EU governments have been
shoring up their external borders with extra police and high-tech
gadgetry such as night-vision cameras and motion sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the ramparts of Fortress Europe more evident than
here in Melilla.
</P>
<P>
   Called in last year after migrants rioted, the Spanish army is
still helping local border police patrol the 6-mile-long land
frontier with Morocco. Sheltering from the North African sun
beneath straw parasols, armed soldiers and police officers stand
guard all along the border. Jeeps and squad cars rumble through the
midday heat. Tanks stand at key junctions.
</P>
<P>
   With help and encouragement from its EU partners, Spain is
lining the border with a 16-foot buffer zone consisting of two
barbed-wire fences separated by a paved road and topped with watch
towers, sensors and cameras. A similar barrier has been built in
Ceuta, another Spanish enclave 150 miles west along the Moroccan
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Melilla project nears completion, though, most
migrants here seem unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wasting their money building this little Berlin
Wall,'' says Uld-Mohamed. ``A desperate man will find a way through
any fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the U.S. experience proves anything, it is that
tighter security does not seal a border. Often, it just forces
migrants into the arms of professional traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   As in Mexico, the people-smuggling business is booming along the
external borders of the European Union. The trade in the region is
estimated to be worth $2 billion to $4 billion annually, with
prices per crossing ranging from $1,000 to $30,000. Nosing around
the back streets of Melilla, Uld-Mohamed has been offered passage
across the Mediterranean to Spain for $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even faster than their Mexican counterparts, experts say, EU
trafficking gangs are evolving into a sophisticated branch of
organized crime, schooled in cutting-edge technology and willing to
use violence.
</P>
<P>
   Often Europe-bound migrants get a poor deal. Most EU traffickers
demand cash up front, with no refund policy. Many cheat their
customers, dumping them outside Western Europe or handing them over
to police as decoys while they sneak through other clients. At the
first sign of danger, traffickers often flee, leaving their human
cargo to fend off arrest or worse.
</P>
<P>
   At the seamier end of the trafficking industry, thousands of
young women are sold into forced prostitution in red-light
districts across the EU, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These traffickers are mafiosi involved in a highly lucrative
business,'' says Philip Muus, a migration expert at the University
of Utrecht in the Netherlands. ``They don't give a damn if people
suffer or die.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most legal channels for immigration into the EU have
been closed off, some traffickers advise their clients to claim
asylum, even when they have no real case for refugee status.
Applications are down from their peak during the Balkan Wars of the
early 1990s, when 4 million people sought refuge in Western Europe,
but the numbers are rising again. The EU expects to register
250,000 asylum applicants this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many are genuine refugees fleeing persecution in places such as
Kosovo and Iraq; others are simply looking for a back door into
Fortress Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Uld-Mohamed knows his claim to refugee status is flimsy, but a
Moroccan trafficker and a Spanish lawyer both urged him to file for
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be honest, to say that I have come to work, to do
any job that they will give me, but I was told that claiming asylum
was my best hope,'' he says. ``My application was turned down in
July, and now I'm filing an appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent surge in bogus asylum-seekers has triggered a
backlash. Many Europeans no longer give ``refugees'' the benefit of
the doubt, suspecting them instead of being con artists intent on
stealing jobs and sponging off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``With economic migrants posing as refugees, all asylum-seekers
have been given a bad name,'' says Wolfgang Mueller, a German
social worker. ``They are the new bogeymen of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent streamlining, asylum procedures in many EU
countries can take months to complete. While waiting for a final
verdict, thousands of applicants are caught in an invidious limbo,
forbidden to work and forced to live off state benefits, which
reinforces their image as freeloaders.
</P>
<P>
   In many European towns and cities, asylum-seekers from the
Balkans and beyond earn spare change by washing car windows at
intersections and by panhandling on sidewalks. Some turn to petty
crime. Many live in public housing or open camps, but more and more
are held in detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   The men in La Granja are allowed to go freely into Melilla,
which is a welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the Spanish name of the camp means the farm, the land
here is too dry and dusty even for a vegetable garden. The original
farm buildings are decrepit and crumbling. Mangy dogs and cats
scavenge among the abandoned cars, picking at the garbage that
blows in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men live in tents made of gray tarpaulin stretched
over scaffolding pipes. Their bunk beds are covered with threadbare
sheets. Mosquitoes and flies hum in the air. At night, rats scamper
along the pipes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The heat can be stifling, and sometimes the men sleep outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this place. I mean, this is not the Four Seasons
Hotel. It is more like a prison,'' says Uld-Mohamed. ``No one is
here for a holiday. We're here because we have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the lead character in Franz Kafka's novel ``The Trial,''
the men in La Granja are trapped in a legal maze. They run round in
circles, chasing documents and bureaucrats, never knowing when or
how the law will decide their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Documents are their only lifeline and thus take on a totemic
importance.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour before lunch, while Uld-Mohamed is sitting on his
bunk, leafing through a stack of letters from state agencies, a
commotion breaks out at the other end of the tent.
</P>
<P>
   A burly Ghanaian is shouting at the top of his lungs at a small
Iraqi, accusing him of meddling with his documents. ``These are my
papers, man. Why did you touch my papers? Why did you touch my
bloody papers?''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi curls his shoulders in contrition and says nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Uld-Mohamed sighs, as the barrage roars on. ``Sometimes people
cannot take the tension, and they explode,'' he says, turning his
gaze back to his own documents. ``You have to stay focused, or else
you lose your mind here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all aspiring immigrants, the men at La Granja cling to the
hope that one day a piece of paper will arrive, granting them the
right to live in the EU. Yet the lucky few usually find cold
comfort inside Fortress Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Demographers argue that the EU needs immigration, because its
population is aging and is in danger of shrinking. Some advocate a
U.S.-style quota system, which would allow Western Europe to choose
a set number of useful immigrants every year from different
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high unemployment, most European countries have programs
that admit temporary workers to do the jobs, from street sweeping
to farm labor, that native citizens no longer want. More than a
million foreigners are expected to secure legal residence in the EU
in 1998, mainly to rejoin families already settled there.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, polls suggest that a majority of Europeans,
believing their countries to be too crowded already, would prefer
to yank up the drawbridge and halt the inflow altogether.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments and social groups are trying to foster good will
toward immigrants and refugees. Some intellectuals are reminding
Europeans that their own ancestors once migrated en masse to the
United States, Canada and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But they may as well be speaking Swahili. Xenophobia is thriving
across Western Europe, pumping up anti-immigrant political parties
and fueling verbal and physical attacks in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   From Sweden to Germany to Italy, neo-Nazi skinheads and other
extremists beat and stab immigrants, sometimes even setting them
afire. Favorite targets are asylum-seekers, many of whom come to
Western Europe to escape persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Even many law-abiding Europeans have xenophobic fire in their
bellies.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, locals in Dover were interviewed on British
television following the arrival of another boatload of Eastern
Europeans. One woman, the owner of a bed and breakfast, the kind of
goodly matron who serves tea and scones to U.S. tourists with a
smile, was apoplectic with rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want these filthy scum here,'' she hissed, her face
flushed, a vein bulging on her right temple. ``If they don't go
home right away, there will be blood in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ireland, once an avid exporter of its own people, is
turning hostile. Instead of the ``hundred thousand welcomes''
promised by the Irish tourist board, asylum-seekers and other
migrants are vilified for milking the country's new prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's first anti-immigrant group, Reclaim Dublin, was
founded earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   When a pregnant woman from Angola was beaten in downtown Dublin
last March, passers-by looked the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Native Europeans are not just worried about their pocketbooks,
though. They are also fearful that, as dark-skinned people carve
out more space here, age-old identities will be eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Despite compelling evidence to the contrary, the traditional
European view is that immigration is something that happens
elsewhere, in countries like the United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the influx of foreigners quickened in the 1960s and
1970s, many Europeans clung to the myth that their national
cultures would somehow remain untouched, that the newcomers were
only here temporarily or that they could be completely assimilated.
</P>
<P>
   That has proved to be a false hope. With millions of
dark-skinned non-Christians settled in the EU, and with many more
knocking on the door, native Europeans are having to rethink their
national identities. In books and in televised debates, in offices
and factories, in bars and cafes, they are asking what it means to
be French or English or German.
</P>
<P>
   The tide of unwanted migrants has also caused political friction
within the EU and may even pose a threat to the dream of European
integration.
</P>
<P>
   Northern countries, which tend to draw more foreigners, have
accused their southern partners of not doing enough to control
illegal immigration. Under the Schengen open-border regime, Italy,
with its notoriously porous coastline, is now effectively the
gatekeeper for its northern neighbors _ an arrangement that
unnerves Germans, Belgians and others, who wonder if a borderless
Europe is such a good idea after all.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which already attracts about half of all migrants into
the EU, is particularly anxious about Schengen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If European integration means that an illegal immigrant can
land on the coast of Italy and then come unimpeded to Berlin or
Frankfurt, that makes me uncomfortable,'' says Monika Jupp, a
German schoolteacher. ``Maybe we need to take another look at how
we are constructing this Europe of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people caught up in civil wars or battered by poverty
in the Third World are little concerned about the angst of
well-heeled Europeans. The only thing that matters to them is
getting into the EU, whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Back at La Granja, in Melilla, the young men wait and wait.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening draws to a close and an orange glow creeps over
the horizon, another supper is served. Fenced in by metal barriers,
the men form a ragged line outside the makeshift kitchen. The mood
is sullen and a little edgy.
</P>
<P>
   Another day has slipped by without reprieve, and disappointment
is etched on their faces. Tomorrow is full of grim promise. The
same wild-goose chase with documents and bureaucrats. The same
food. The same bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   Fights sometimes break out at supper time, so a handful of
Spanish police arrive to stand guard.
</P>
<P>
   As he waits in line for his beans and rice, Uld-Mohamed, dressed
in a clean yellow shirt and beige pants, chats with a couple of
Nigerians about soccer and Spanish law, the job market in Europe
and women.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, when the banter fizzles out, the young
Mauritanian turns away to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning against the metal barrier, he stares off into the
distance through the wire fence that surrounds the camp, past the
soccer pitch and over the water to where the southern coast of
Europe lies out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made too many sacrifices, and suffered too much, to
turn back now,'' he says, his young face suddenly looking old.
``Whether they want me or not, one day I will make a home over
there in Europe.''

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Late last year, after his brother was
jailed and tortured by Saddam Hussein's police, Abdul Saleb began
plotting ways to flee his native Iraq for a new life in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing for his own safety, the 26-year-old Kurdish physician
did what many would-be migrants lacking EU entry papers do
nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to the underworld for help.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of a friend put him in touch with a local
``businessman.'' Saleb paid $3,000 for the first leg of his
journey, which was to take him from Chwarta, his hometown in
northern Iraq, to Istanbul, Turkey. From there he hoped to make his
way to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous but also very excited when the deal was done,''
he says of his first brush with the traffickers who smuggle people
into the EU for cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Saleb's escape to freedom turned sour early on.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 10 other Iraqi Kurds and one trafficker, he set off
on foot through the rugged mountains that divide Iraq and Iran. For
six days, they hiked in single file, dodging villages and border
checks, eating dried fruit on the hoof, stopping only to sleep.
Saleb, a slight man with fine features, says his pleas for rest
were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, an Iranian border patrol suddenly appeared on
a nearby ridge and opened fire, wounding a Kurd named Ali. The rest
of the group scrambled to safety. The trafficker _ a rough,
taciturn man _ refused to go back for their fallen companion.
</P>
<P>
   Saleb is still not sure what happened to Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``That trafficker had no human feelings,'' he says, his voice
dropping. ``We were only cargo for him, and one death was no big
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the group made its way across the border into Turkey,
where a dusty truck was waiting. It drove to the city of
Diyarbakir, where a Turkish man made up false documents for the
group. The Kurds then boarded a series of buses for Istanbul.
There, with traffickers peddling trips to everywhere in the EU,
Saleb paid $5,000 _ the rest of his savings _ to a Turk offering
safe passage by land to Bavaria, in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so happy when we thought we had arrived in Germany
that one of the men, an Iranian, bent down and kissed the ground,''
Saleb says, rubbing his bloodshot eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Saleb still remembers with bitterness the moment it dawned on
him that he had been duped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized that the road signs were not written in
German, my heart was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish trafficker had dumped his passengers in Kyjov, a
small town here in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Saleb still has not reached the promised land of
Western Europe. The unmarried Saleb is now in Prague, the
picturesque Czech capital that has become a key transit point on
the smuggling routes to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   With no legal right to be here, Saleb is doing odd jobs in the
black economy to scrabble together enough cash for a final run at
the walls of Fortress Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he squirrels away his meager earnings, thousands of
other migrants are queuing up for the chance to buy their way into
the EU.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, the tightening of border security is
forcing people such as Saleb into the arms of professional
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna-based International Center for Migration Policy
Development estimates that migrants pay gangs promising to smuggle
them into Western Europe $2 billion to $4 billion every year.
</P>
<P>
   Many traffickers along the EU border are small-time operators
trying to make some extra cash on the weekend. But authorities say
the trade is fast becoming a sophisticated branch of organized
crime, with some smugglers also dabbling in guns and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   According to police investigators, EU traffickers _ even more
than their peers in Mexico _ are plugging into networks with
offices and agents across the Third World. They have access to
expert document forgers. Many use high-tech gear often associated
with James Bond movies: satellite phones, high-speed boats and
cars, night-vision binoculars, sensors for eavesdropping on police
radios.
</P>
<P>
   Traffickers of many nationalities operate along every flank of
the European Union. They can be contacted through bars and cafes
dotted along the coast of North Africa. In Ceuta, a Spanish enclave
on the edge of Morocco, top smugglers are folk heroes, with
nicknames like El Nene (The Kid) and El Rey de las Lanchas (The
King of the Motorboats).
</P>
<P>
   Saleb chose Istanbul as his launch pad into the EU. With both
Iraq and Turkey locked in bloody conflict with Kurdish rebels,
European intelligence sources estimate that as many as 3 million
Kurds, many of them dreaming of a fresh start in the West, are
holed up in and around the ancient Turkish port city.
</P>
<P>
   Saleb, whose brother was accused of terrorist activity by Saddam
Hussein's police, stayed in a run-down boarding house in Kucuk
Pazar, an Istanbul neighborhood that draws a steady stream of
EU-bound migrants and the traffickers who seek their business.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the smugglers offered boat rides to Italy and Greece,
Saleb says. But because he has a deep fear of drowning, Saleb opted
instead for an overland trip to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul ``is like a giant bazaar, with so many people offering
to take you anywhere you want to go in (Western) Europe,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the former Soviet bloc is also crawling with
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Saleb wanders through the old train station in
downtown Prague, a stranger sidles up to him, whispering,
``Germany? Germany?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They make eye contact, they circle around, and then they
approach you,'' he says. ``Usually they ask for lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any smart business, the trafficking industry offers
products to suit many budgets.
</P>
<P>
   A well-heeled migrant from China can spend up to $30,000 on a
deluxe package deal that includes airplane tickets, good hotels and
a skillfully forged passport. At the bottom of the market, a Sri
Lankan peasant might pay $3,000 to be taken to the EU partly on
foot and partly in the back of a truck packed with people.
Traffickers along the EU border itself charge as little as $1,000
per head per crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say, however, that bargain-hunters often get a raw
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some are put to work in sweatshops to pay off their trips.
Others are sold telephone numbers of non-existent ``contacts'' in
the EU. Most have little say over their final destination, since
traffickers vary the routes according to current policing, weather
and laws.
</P>
<P>
   Like Saleb, many migrants are dumped somewhere along the
smuggling route and told they have arrived in Germany or the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cruel and unfair business where the rights of the
consumer, the migrant, count for nothing,'' says Lucie Sladkova,
head of the Migrations Information Center within the Czech
Republic's border police.
</P>
<P>
   At the first sign of danger, traffickers often scamper, leaving
their clients to face capture or worse. In winter, in the freezing
mountains between Germany and the Czech Republic, border police
have come across migrants shivering in thin garments and sandals.
Many have suffered severe frostbite, and some have died.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the main migrant graveyard lies in the treacherous waters of
the Strait of Gibraltar, where the flimsy motorboats used by
traffickers often capsize. Aid agencies put the death toll this
year at around 1,000, compared with 3,000 in the previous 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward smuggling ever-larger groups is most visible on
the open waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Every so often, European
coast guards intercept a large ship packed with migrants. Though
the traffickers charge luxury-cruise prices, the conditions are
usually appalling, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Salah Taha, an Iraqi Kurd, paid $4,000 to travel
in a ship from Istanbul to ``somewhere in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   The vessel was an aging freighter, and the 800 migrants were
locked in the cargo hold. Scraps of stale bread and water were
dispensed once a day, Taha says. The single toilet backed up, so
people relieved themselves on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   After a week, the crew, without warning, cut the engines and
fled in motorboats. After drifting for hours, the freighter ran
aground on the coast of Calabria, in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took all that money from us and put us into hell,'' says
Taha, who, unlike most illegal migrants, was lucky enough to earn
asylum in Italy. ``I still have nightmares about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they do reach the European Union, many migrants remain
beholden to the criminals who guided them there, police say. Some
traffickers, notably Chinese smugglers called ``snakeheads,'' have
kidnapped their clients to extort money from their families back
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, police in London have freed 15 Chinese
migrants held hostage by their fellow countrymen. Many were badly
beaten; one had been tied to a radiator for 12 days and his eardrum
had been punctured by the aerial of the mobile phone used to
blackmail his terrified wife in China.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect that hundreds, maybe thousands, more migrants are
trapped in similar bondage across Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments are trying to end the traffic in people with
tougher law enforcement and by pushing neighboring states to clamp
down. But the traffickers still seem to have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   Though hundreds of smugglers have been sentenced to jail terms
in Western Europe, many more have slipped through the legal
dragnet. Physical evidence of their crimes is often scarce, and
most migrants are afraid to point the finger.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the EU, say experts, many police forces remain corrupt
and inefficient. Another problem is that many non-EU officials
still regard people-smuggling as a relatively benign crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the days of the old Soviet bloc, ``anyone who trafficked
people into the West was a hero for us,'' says Sladkova, the
director of the Czech Migrations Information Center. ``It's one
thing to change the laws. It's another to change people's
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   If the war on drugs is a marker, then authorities are also
waging an uphill battle against the laws of supply and demand. As
long as migrants are willing to tolerate the risk and cost of being
smuggled into the EU, then traffickers will be there for them.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear, breezy evening in Prague, Saleb leans against the
stone railing on the famous Charles Bridge, staring blankly at a
German family posing for photographs.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about traffickers like a junkie talks about his drug
dealer. He cannot bring himself to just say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they are evil people, that they cheat us and leave us
to die, but what else can I do?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need them, because I cannot get into Western Europe by
myself.''

SLAVERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ On clear evenings, hundreds of tourists
amble through Europe's most famous red-light district, gawking at
prostitutes who stand in the windows wearing only lingerie and
come-hither smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Along the tree-lined canals and narrow back streets that are the
Dutch capital's biggest tourist draw, the atmosphere seems oddly
relaxed. U.S. retirees point and giggle. German teen-agers munch on
french fries. Japanese tour groups pose for photographs. Sometimes
the ``window girls'' join in the fun, putting on a little dance or
blowing a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest profession could almost pass for light entertainment
here. But behind the air-brushed facade, Amsterdam's sex bazaar
holds a sinister secret: Local police believe that many of the
women selling their bodies in the windows are immigrants trapped in
sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible thing to see,'' says Ruud Bierhausen, an
Amsterdam vice-squad detective. ``Sometimes, we approach the girls,
and they are so scared that they are white in the face and
shaking.'' Like many investigators, Bierhausen is reluctant to put
a figure on the number of women caught in sexual slavery, saying
only that there are ``lots and lots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luceia Brusa, a researcher at the De Graaf Foundation, an
Amsterdam-based group that studies prostitution, guesses that more
than half the sex workers in the Dutch capital could be working
under some form of duress.
</P>
<P>
   And Amsterdam is not alone. No one knows how many foreign women
are being trafficked into sexual bondage in the European Union
every year, but estimates range well into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is getting worse,'' Brusa says. ``The trade in
women is not only becoming highly internationalized and organized,
it is also becoming more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the rise in forced prostitution seem clear.
Authorities say young women in poor countries are aching for a
chance to start a new life in the West. Sex traders can make a
fortune exploiting their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Asians and Africans used to be the main victims, but the demise
of the Soviet Union has created a vast reservoir of desperate white
women. Young blondes from the former Eastern bloc are now the
hottest commodities on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The road to sexual bondage is not always the same. With the help
of traffickers, who are often linked to East European mafias, the
women enter the European Union on tourist visas or with false
documents, or by slipping across a remote stretch of border,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many come intending to work as prostitutes, only to end up as
someone's indentured servant. But others start off more innocently.
Some are simply kidnapped from their home countries, police say.
Many are lured to the EU by bogus marriage proposals or by the
promise of well-paid jobs as maids, nannies or waitresses. By the
time the dream offers are exposed as lies, it is too late. The
women are already the property of pimps in London or Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Most victims of forced prostitution are reluctant to talk to
reporters. Instead, they tell their stories to social workers, who
pass them on to the press, with last names deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Monika's story is one example.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 21-year-old Pole answered a newspaper ad seeking
staff for a new ``fashion restaurant'' in Germany. A man picked her
up from her parents' home outside Warsaw, drove her to a hotel near
the German border and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, she was sold to a brothel in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Her new ``owner,'' Klaus, had a volcanic temper, she later told
counselors. Monika once saw him break the arm of a young Russian
woman. After six months in the brothel, serving several customers
per day, Monika was set free by a police raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minute was hell,'' she said afterward. ``My dream was to
come to Western Europe, and I ended up being used like an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Trafficking in prostitutes is a license to print money.
According to police investigators, Western European pimps will pay
$500 to $20,000 for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, police in Milan, Italy, cracked a gang that put
half-naked women from Slavic countries on blocks and auctioned them
off to the highest bidders. Some of the gang members are now
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a shipment of illegal drugs, which is only consumed once,
a prostitute can go on earning thousands of dollars every month for
her ``owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex slaving is also less risky than drug dealing. Prostitution
is not yet fully legalized anywhere in the EU, but most local
authorities, notably in Amsterdam, tolerate it. Even when arrests
are made, sex slavers often evade prosecution, because most victims
are too scared to testify against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing in women is a fast and safe way to get very rich,''
says Brusa, of the De Graaf Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   No longer content with just selling women on the open market,
Eastern European mafias are investing in their own brothels, clubs
and massage parlors inside the EU, police say. This boosts profits
and allows them to keep closer tabs on their ``staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims across Western Europe describe the same regime of
terror. Their passports are taken or burned, authorities say. They
are allowed to keep only a fraction, if any, of their earnings.
Some are sold to a pimp in another EU country when police or social
workers get too close. Many are beaten or raped into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Bierhausen, the Amsterdam detective, thinks that pimps from the
former Yugoslavia are the most vicious in the business, perhaps
because their homeland was recently brutalized by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard rumors of hot irons being used on girls' faces,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, a dozen victims of forced prostitution are believed to
be murdered every year.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmail is another trick of the trade, authorities say. Most
women are warned that if they misbehave, their families back home
will be attacked or sent photos of them having sex with clients.
Many victims are afraid to go to the police, believing them to be
on the traffickers' payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are completely terrorized,'' says Tryntje
Kootstra, director of the Foundation Against Trafficking In Women,
based in Utrecht, Netherlands. ``They don't know where to turn or
how to get out of this nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are trying to stem the traffic in women. To address
the problem, the EU funds public-awareness campaigns in former
Soviet bloc countries and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout last summer, Polish television and cinemas screened a
short film about Kasia, a fictional young woman who emigrates to
Germany to work in a restaurant and ends up enslaved by a sadistic
pimp. Narrated in an actress's tremulous voice, the film shows a
series of harrowing images: young women in G-strings dancing in the
dark, mice scurrying in a cage, a half-peeled orange exploding in a
hand, beds bursting into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Along with publicity campaigns, governments have tightened laws
and assigned more police to investigate forced prostitution.
Authorities are trying to make it easier for victims to testify.
Sex traffickers are on trial or under arrest in several countries,
and some convictions have been secured.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, predicts an end to the flesh trade any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Witness-protection programs, legal systems and police efforts
still leave much to be desired, critics say. And Western Europe
shows no sign of losing its hypnotic pull on young women from
around the world, who convince themselves that forced prostitution
only happens to other people.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with social workers, Tatyana, a Russian survivor
of forced prostitution, summed up the future thus:
</P>
<P>
   ``My life was ruined by these monsters. And I know that I will
not be the last.''

   EISSENHUTTENSTADT, Germany _ The green van scrunches to a halt
on a bend in the gravel road. Two German border guards, eyes
shielded by sunglasses, pistols bobbing at their sides, leap out
into the morning air.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Steenfatt, lean and blond, scampers up the grassy bank
first. Through binoculars, he patiently scans the woods and fields
that fan out into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the eastern border of the European Union, a political
and economic alliance of 15 states. The narrow Neisse River down
below, which divides Germany and Poland, is a favorite crossing
point for illegal immigrants seeking a better life in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Like the southwestern United States, the EU is wrestling with an
immigration crisis. Even as border security tightens, some experts
estimate that a million people from across the Third World could
attempt to sneak into the EU this year, with many trying to enter
via Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to border guards like Steenfatt to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   On this balmy morning, two suspects have been spotted along the
Neisse River near Eissenhuttenstadt, but there is no sign of them
now. The only sounds are the wind rustling through the trees and
the distant chirping of birds. Even the river is silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must have been a false alarm,'' shrugs Steenfatt. ``Or else
they're already through and long gone by now.''
</P>
<P>
   A glance at the map explains his nonchalance and why EU border
police are battling against tough odds.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to build another Iron Curtain with militarized fences
and fortified walls, Europeans have settled for an external
frontier patrolled mainly by guards and gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   On its eastern flank, the EU's invisible border snakes for
nearly 2,500 miles through meadows and mountain ranges, along
rivers and past towns and villages. To the south, the whole
underbelly of Europe is exposed to the Mediterranean Sea. Italy
alone has 4,600 miles of coastline.
</P>
<P>
   With so many points of entry and with the help of sophisticated
traffickers who smuggle human cargo for cash, waves of migrants
breach the walls of Fortress Europe every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``With extra policing, we will catch more of them,'' says
Steffen Angenendt, a migration expert at the German Society for
Foreign Affairs, a think-tank partly funded by the German state.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will never stop illegal immigration altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Western European governments are striving to hold back
the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Every frontier state in the EU, from Finland in the north to
Spain in the south, is shoring up its border defenses. Neighboring
non-EU countries are under heavy pressure, and receiving EU funds,
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   No state, though, has done as much as Germany to fortify its
borders. The number of guards along its eastern frontier has
tripled since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   New helicopters and high-speed boats with night-vision equipment
have been introduced, as have a dozen vans with thermographic
cameras that can pick out a person five miles away, even in the
fog.
</P>
<P>
   Germany also runs a nationwide telephone hotline that
automatically connects the dialer with the nearest border-police
station. Tip-offs from citizens account for almost half of all
arrests of illegal immigrants in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But even the combined efforts of EU states and their people
cannot halt the flow. This year, some experts estimate that as many
as half a million migrants could slip past EU border defenses, with
more than two-thirds vanishing into the underground economy and the
rest later claiming asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Having hit a dead end at the edge of the Neisse River, Steenfatt
and his partner clamber back into the van to continue their morning
patrol. They drive down country roads and through small villages,
looking for anyone or anything that seems out of place.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, Steenfatt begins to pine for the night shift,
when crossings are more common.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he is interrupted by the shortwave radio, which
crackles rudely into life. An urgent voice barks something in
German. Another border patrol has caught an Asian man swimming
across the river near Guben, about 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Back at base camp, a cluster of low concrete buildings tucked
away in a clump of forest near Eissenhuttenstadt, Steenfatt joins
fellow border guards to await the arrival of their latest catch.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the compound, a row of cars confiscated from
traffickers is lined up like trophies on a mantelpiece.
Spanking-new BMWs with German license plates nestle beside beat-up
Ford hatchbacks registered in Poland. The latest addition is a
white Volkswagen Passat with Lithuanian plates. The vehicle was
intercepted by border police while carrying a trafficker and three
young women probably headed for prostitution somewhere in the EU.
</P>
<P>
   A thin rain begins to fall just as the van with the captured
Asian pulls into the compound. Still shivering in his wet track
suit, the man, who appears to be in his mid-20s, slides from the
back seat onto the tarmac. His hands are cuffed. He looks tired and
dazed. Two guards escort him up the steps of the processing center,
through the front door and down a long, dim corridor lined with
holding cells.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside each steel door hangs a sheet of paper bearing the
scratched-out names of recent prisoners: Ho Fong, Vladimir Petrov,
Muhammed al-Qatar. Names from every corner of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the corridor, in a bleak, unfurnished room, the
still-unidentified Asian, who police guess to be Korean or
Vietnamese, is ordered to pose against a wall for mug shots. He
blinks at each flash.
</P>
<P>
   On a nearby table, two guards wearing plastic gloves empty his
sodden black knapsack. They start sifting through the contents. A
faded pair of Levi's jeans. A bar of soap and a toothbrush. A diary
and some air-mail envelopes in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   The migrant looks on with empty eyes. He refuses to speak. No
doubt he has been briefed on German law.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, EU countries have made it easier to deport
undocumented foreigners. But an illegal migrant who cannot be
identified and whose travel route to the EU is unclear still stands
a chance of avoiding deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the tight-lipped Asian from the doorway, Steenfatt _
his hands resting on his holster belt _ rocks back and forth on his
boot heels. He is itching to get back out into the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there is a feeling of release when you catch someone,
but you always suspect that others are getting through while you're
back here doing the paperwork,'' he says. ``You always wonder if
the traffickers are throwing you a diversion. We get this one guy
here, while they sneak through 15 more.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Border policing in Western Europe has changed profoundly in
recent years. In the early 1990s, migrants openly stormed the
frontiers of the EU, and many were happy to be caught. Once in the
hands of German border police, for example, they could claim asylum
and live off state benefits while their claims were processed.
Sometimes whole villages from the former Yugoslavia turned up at
the border in buses or on foot.
</P>
<P>
   But the tightening of immigration and asylum laws, together with
the beefed-up security, has forced migrants to be more cunning and
to hire professional smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Along this stretch of German border, guards like Steenfatt play
cat and mouse with the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides dress up as fishermen or as courting couples to scout
the banks of the Neisse and the Oder, the other, wider river that
separates Germany and Poland. Both sides use informers, authorities
say. The traffickers often toss the border police a migrant or two
as a red herring.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steenfatt, each technological or tactical advance
is countered by the other side. Many traffickers now carry
night-vision binoculars. When some smugglers invested in scanners
to eavesdrop on police radio, German police bought scanners to
detect the eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   Steenfatt and his colleagues sometimes spend hours watching a
strip of border through night-vision cameras, waiting for a
trafficker to spirit his customers across. To conceal their
surveillance tactics, the border patrol agents often let their prey
advance a couple of miles into German territory before pouncing.
</P>
<P>
   An avid fan of U.S. sports, Steenfatt sums up his job with a
football analogy. ``We are like linebackers,'' he says, smiling.
``We wait to see if they're going to run or throw. We try to guess
what they're thinking, then we try to beat them on the play.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not always clear who is winning the ball game. Last year,
the German border police caught more than 500 traffickers, many of
whom have been sentenced to jail terms of two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the officers who patrol the 160 miles of border where
Steenfatt is posted are catching fewer illegal migrants than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Is that because better policing is forcing traffickers to try
their luck farther south, where the mountainous terrain is harder
to patrol? Or are traffickers just getting smarter at slipping the
tackles?
</P>
<P>
   No one here is complacent. Despite the recent strides in
technology and manpower, border police on the beat still moan about
their handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   The traffickers have digital mobile phones, they say, while
border guards rely on heavy walkie-talkies that have poor
reception. Lumbering police vans are no match for a stolen
Mercedes. It takes 30 minutes for a helicopter to arrive at the
border from the base in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   At official crossings from Poland and the Czech Republic, German
border guards complain that they lack the staff to search every
vehicle for stowaways.
</P>
<P>
   Better border security in neighboring non-EU states,
particularly Poland, is relieving some of the pressure. But experts
say traffickers can still outfox the underpaid and underequipped
border patrols in countries that surround Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Czech border guards were issued
carbon-dioxide detectors for sniffing out migrants concealed in
trucks. According to a police spokesperson, the only hidden cargo
detected so far has been a few horses and a shipment of sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much money in play that the traffickers can afford
to stay one step ahead of the border police, especially in the
non-EU countries,'' says Angenendt, of the German Society for
Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women who man the EU borders talk with pride about
their mission to uphold the law. Still, many feel compassion for
the migrants whom they are paid to hunt down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the situation in their home countries, you
can understand why they risk everything to come all this way for a
new life,'' says Steenfatt. ``If I were in their shoes, I would
probably do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Language barriers make it hard for EU border police to strike up
much rapport with the migrants. A smattering of Spanish can go a
long way on the U.S.-Mexico frontier. But the huddled masses
heading for the EU speak everything from Urdu to Estonian to
Mandarin Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, European border police claim to feel the human tragedy
that is part of their daily grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not robots, you know,'' says Steenfatt, his angular face
softening slightly. ``When you find a small child in the woods with
big brown eyes, hungry and cold because the trafficker has run away
and left them there, you can hardly hold back the tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Most border police regard traffickers as parasites. They also
fear the smugglers' growing penchant for carrying weapons.
Steenfatt and others have used their own money to buy lightweight
bullet-proof vests to replace those issued by the German state,
which are too cumbersome to wear all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his colleagues, Steenfatt never crosses into nearby
Poland when off-duty, just in case one of the many traffickers
based there decides to settle a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never say anything when you stop them for questioning,
but you can feel that they are remembering your face for next
time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the silent Asian to his fate back at base camp,
Steenfatt and his partner join a boat patrol on the Oder River.
With the wind flapping through his beige uniform and pop music
wafting up from the on-board radio, Steenfatt stands on the rear
deck of the boat, scanning the shoreline through his binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   The German side is more densely wooded than the Polish side.
Along both shores, children swim and play, and fishermen sit with
rods in the water and baskets of supplies by their sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all looks very quiet and innocent, but you can never be 100
percent sure,'' says Steenfatt, pointing to a fisherman speaking
into a mobile phone on the Polish side. ``Is he chatting to his
wife, or is he tipping off a trafficker about our movements?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a brief flicker of excitement when an old barge is
spotted farther up the Oder. But another patrol boat gets there
first, and its crew is soon combing the vessel and its cargo of
coal for illegal migrants. The police come up empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of scouring the riverbanks in vain, Steenfatt
finally spots something: a clump of discarded clothes on the German
side.
</P>
<P>
   He jots down the position without urgency, though. A land patrol
will return later to examine the evidence, to see if the clothes
belonged to illegal migrants and, if so, whether the traffickers
have opened up a new route. If migrants did dump the garments, they
are probably half way to Berlin or Frankfurt by now.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the afternoon, with his shift winding down and
the sun sagging below the horizon, Steenfatt begins to realize that
he will not catch anyone today.
</P>
<P>
   As the police boat slices a path through the water and the
wilderness, he allows himself a little gripe about the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want us to catch every illegal who tries to cross here,
but look at this,'' he says, waving at the trees and bushes that
line both sides of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much land and so many places to hide.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EISSENHUTTENSTADT, Germany _ On trips around Europe, German
border guard Jan Steenfatt likes nothing better than to drop in on
local police stations to swap a little shop talk.
</P>
<P>
   His dream is to spend a day along the Texas-Mexico frontier with
the U.S. Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to go over there and visit,'' he says. ``I think
I could learn a lot from their way of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   As the European Union fights to secure its own borders against
illegal immigration, the experience along the U.S.-Mexico frontier
stands out as a bench mark. Most Europeans concede that Americans
are more experienced in defending a long land border.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal migration via land routes only became a problem in
Western Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before
then, the Iron Curtain kept the EU's eastern flank secure, and most
undocumented migrants came up from the south, from across the
Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, 10 EU countries have
dismantled entry controls along their shared internal borders,
making their territory even more alluring for illegal migration.
</P>
<P>
   As pressure has built in the 1990s to keep illegal migrants out
of the EU, politicians, police and academics from Europe and the
United States have shuttled back and forth across the Atlantic,
attending seminars and observing border patrols in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, we've had more and more visitors from
Europe,'' says Doug Mosier, spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Dallas. ``I think that, in terms of
technologies and strategies, the U.S. is still seen as the
pioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a million immigrants settle legally in the
European Union every year _ about the same number as in the United
States and Canada put together. Of the many people claiming asylum
in the EU this year, about 250,000 _ roughly double the figure for
the United States _ are expected to pass the first legal hurdles to
have their cases heard.
</P>
<P>
   But further comparisons are hard to make. European migration
statistics are patchy, because EU states keep separate records, use
different accounting methods and often keep their findings secret.
</P>
<P>
   According to the INS, U.S. border patrol agents arrested 1.4
million undocumented migrants in the 1996-97 fiscal year. The INS
estimates that 275,000 people slip into the United States illegally
each year.
</P>
<P>
   No such official figures are available for the EU as a whole,
but some experts suspect that up to half a million migrants make it
past border guards into the European Union every year.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by the American track record in nabbing illegal
immigrants at the border, Europeans have taken up much of the
high-tech gadgetry, such as infrared binoculars and cameras, used
by U.S. Border Patrol agents. EU states are also moving to build a
U.S.-style database that would pool information on asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   In communications, the United States is showing the way with
encrypted two-way digital radios and the growing use of satellite
technology to pinpoint border agents on patrol. ``Our radios are
antiques in comparison,'' grumbles Steenfatt. ``Sometimes they
don't even work (30 feet) away.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2,000 miles, the U.S.-Mexico border is shorter than the
eastern frontier of the European Union, which runs for more than
2,500 miles from Finland to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans seem more willing to install occasional fixed
barriers along their border, such as the 1.2-mile chain-link fence
in El Paso, in an effort to keep illegal immigrants out.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by memories of the Iron Curtain, many Europeans _
particularly Germans _ prefer to leave their frontiers physically
open, apart from border checkpoints on key roads. Germany even
shuns automated cameras and sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our different history gives us some different attitudes than
the Americans,'' says Eckehart Wache, who commands guards along a
160-mile stretch of German-Polish border. ``We do not want fences
and walls or an automated border system. We always want an officer
to be on the spot to make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and EU border police are caught in the same vicious circle:
The better they get at their job, the more migrants turn to
criminals who smuggle human cargo.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the Atlantic, the people-smuggling industry is
thriving, though experts think traffickers in Europe may have
stronger links with organized crime and more sophisticated
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   EU border police face a more diverse mix of migrants than their
counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   People from all over the developing world are caught sneaking
across the southwestern U.S. border, but the vast majority are
Mexican. Once criminal background checks are run, illegal migrants
from Mexico often are taken to an international bridge, where
Border Patrol agents watch them cross back to their native country.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not so simple in Europe, where most undocumented
migrants hail from countries not directly bordering the EU. Often
they have sold everything and traveled thousands of miles to start
a new life in Europe. Many will try anything _ from refusing to
give their identities to filing weak claims for asylum _ to avoid
being sent back.
</P>
<P>
   Although instant deportation is becoming more common, EU states
still face legal and diplomatic obstacles to expelling illegal
migrants.
</P>
<P>
   In one regard, though, EU border police have a clear edge over
their American peers. Nations on the eastern border of the EU are
helping to clamp down on illegal immigration in ways that U.S.
border guards can only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic are desperate to
join the EU and know that securing their borders is a precondition
for membership. One result is that former Soviet bloc states are
now catching thousands of illegal migrants before they even reach
the EU border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is important,'' says Steenfatt. ``But even with the
best equipment in the world, you need cooperation from the guys on
the other side'' of the border.

<P>
   LONDON _ In much the same way as Americans cross state lines,
people can now move around much of continental Western Europe
without passing through customs or passport controls.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Schengen agreement, traditional entry controls have
been scrapped along the shared borders of 10 European Union
countries _ Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Greece, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to make life easier for EU citizens, the resulting
freedom of movement is a boon to criminals and illegal migrants.
Any undocumented person who manages to sneak across the Neisse
River from Poland to Germany, for example, can expect to make his
way unimpeded to Paris or Amsterdam or Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Border controls remain in effect in EU countries that have not
joined the Schengen group _ Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Ireland and
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the lack of internal border controls, Schengen
countries invest heavily in joint security. Police carry out random
spot checks of people, particularly in border areas, which means
that Europeans and others must carry ID cards at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Stored in a nuclear bomb-proof vault in Strasbourg, France, a
database keeps records on millions of travelers, many of whom are
non-EU citizens permanently banned from entering the Schengen zone.
Some European police carry mobile computer terminals that can
access the database. Even so, many illegal immigrants travel freely
across the Schengen zone, fueling xenophobia and causing political
sparks to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's porous external borders have earned it a reputation as
the ``leaky sieve'' and the ``soft underbelly'' of Europe. Thanks
to Schengen, Italy is now effectively the gatekeeper for other EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from their Schengen partners, the Italians are
clamping down on illegal immigration. But Germany and other
countries remain nervous.
</P>
<P>
   During a surge in the flow of Kurdish refugees from Iraq and
Turkey earlier this year, France and Austria temporarily beefed up
police checks along their borders with Italy.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent months, some German politicians have called for
Schengen to be shelved altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Says Jonas Widgren, director of the International Center for
Migration Policy Development based in Vienna, Austria: ``If Europe
does not win the battle against illegal immigration, then the whole
edifice (of Schengen) is in danger.'' &QL;

EU IMMIGRATION LAWS SEEK TO KEEP THE LID ON 

</HEADLINE>

By CARL HONORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Border police are one way to keep people out of
Fortress Europe. Laws are another.
</P>
<P>
   ``European countries are not looking for new immigrants, and our
laws reflect that,'' says Patrick Weill, a Paris-based expert on
immigration legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the European Union is not hermetically sealed.
</P>
<P>
   EU countries grant residency to just over 1 million people each
year, about the same number as the joint total for the United
States and Canada, which have 20 percent less population.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the newcomers rejoin families already settled in Europe.
Others earn asylum or avoid arrest long enough to qualify for
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   To keep pace with globalization, the EU's 15 member states have
made it relatively easy for highly skilled foreign workers, ranging
from bankers to computer analysts, to take jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries also run programs that allow non-EU citizens to
come in temporarily to perform the low-skill work, such as seasonal
farm labor, that most Europeans no longer want.
</P>
<P>
   But these immigrants are the lucky ones. Millions of other
people are thwarted by mounting legal barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the days when people from the Third World could
earn the right to settle in the European Union simply by filling
out a few forms.
</P>
<P>
   After the oil crisis of the 1970s, which triggered an economic
crunch and widespread job losses, northern EU countries abolished
their programs for recruiting foreign workers. Southern EU
countries, where immigration traditionally has been weaker,
followed suit a little later.
</P>
<P>
   After refugees from Eastern Europe and elsewhere began flocking
to the region in the early 1990s, all EU countries moved to tighten
their asylum laws, harmonize their immigration rules and bolster
border security.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, most Western European states have tinkered with
their family reunification rules _ raising the minimum income
requirements or lowering the maximum age of eligibility _ to
restrict the flow of people joining relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious tightening, however, has been in asylum
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, potential refugees picked an EU country and turned
up at its border to claim asylum. The state supported them while
their cases were considered. If rejected, they applied in another
EU country.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to new EU-wide agreements, asylum-seekers must now apply
for refugee status in their first EU port of call, whether they
wish to stay in that country or not. An applicant turned down by
one member state can no longer apply to another. Benefits paid to
asylum seekers have also been trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Many EU countries now have laws allowing for the instant
deportation of an asylum-seeker if authorities can prove his or her
identity and that he or she touched ground in a ``safe'' country en
route to Western Europe. Most states bordering the EU, including
Poland and the Czech Republic, are now judged to be ``safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Muster, a Berlin-based immigration specialist, says,
``The joke is that the only way that anyone can claim asylum in
Germany nowadays is by parachuting in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even traveling to the European Union is harder than it used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   All member states now demand visas of citizens from a long list
of non-Western countries that never used to need them.
</P>
<P>
   Many EU countries post officials in foreign airports to check
Europe-bound travelers for fake documents. Airlines and other
carriers face fines for bringing undocumented passengers to EU
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Around five years from now, most member nations will hand over
the task of generating laws on immigration and asylum to the
European Commission, the EU's executive branch in Brussels. Some
hope the shift will further reinforce the legal ramparts of
Fortress Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be a sign of things to come, Austria, which now
holds the rotating EU presidency, is proposing that the European
Union as a whole scrap the right to permanent refugee status
enshrined in the 1951 Geneva Convention and replace it with a
watered-down offer of temporary protection.

AN ELECTRIFIED CITY GOES WITHOUT POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ and ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was a simple human error, but it threw San
Francisco and much of San Mateo County into chaos for hours,
highlighting the vulnerability of the city's power grid and
high-tech life.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic mail, voice mail, answering machines, faxes and
coffee makers all went dead Tuesday because of a Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric Co. worker who forgot to do something elementary: remove a
grounding wire before restarting the power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grounding is a pretty basic procedure,'' said Carl Bellone,
PG&AMP;E's director of distribution operations. ``It's as basic as it
gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the error, more than a million people lost power for
anywhere from two to seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   One death was blamed on the outage. An elderly San Francisco
woman was killed by a hit-and-run driver who didn't stop at an
intersection with no working traffic signal.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the California Public Utilities Commission
and the state's newly formed grid-operating Independent System
Operator said they would be looking into the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The PG&AMP;E crew responsible for the power failure was doing
routine maintenance at a San Mateo substation. Grounding wires,
which are about as thick as a human thumb, are normally put in
after the power is turned off to protect workers. They are removed
when the work is completed.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the workers failed to remove the wires before power
was restarted, triggering a massive short circuit and causing two
San Francisco power plants and 25 substations to automatically shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified workers will ``go through the normal discipline
process,'' said Gordon Smith, the president and chief executive of
PG&AMP;E. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the error was simple, the location was crucial.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo ``is a very critical substation; it's the biggest
one'' on the Peninsula, Bellone said. ``They don't all feed
downtown San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   That one substation could wipe out an entire major city
highlights San Francisco's geographic isolation at the upper tip of
a peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Most other cities are fed power from many sources and from
several directions. But because San Francisco is bordered by water
on three sides, its power comes only from what it generates at its
own plants _ at Potrero Hill and Hunters Point _ and from plants on
the Peninsula and in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of lessons learned ... it's worth revisiting the
question: Is San Francisco inherently necessarily that isolated, or
is there something we can do about that,'' said Ron Knecht,
president of the Economic and Technical Analysis Group, an energy
consulting firm in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the company would be looking closely at transmission
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of building an underwater transmission line to the east
or to the north, which is incredibly expensive, we can probably do
a better job of making sure (we have better) transmission
capability coming up the Peninsula,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano, the incoming president of the city's Board of
Supervisors, said he would ask for an investigation into PG&AMP;E's
possible legal liability for damages, particularly to small
business operators.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ziering, manager of California Public Utilities
Commission's Energy Reliability Team, said state regulators might
look into why the problem had been able to spread so far without
any backup plan to stop it and why it had taken hours to restore
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, if you lose one system, the rest of the power
chain should be able to survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown criticized PG&AMP;E, which had told him Tuesday
morning that power would be restored in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They missed their target,'' he said. ``I would assume that you
would have some kind of backup plan when this kind of human error
could cause this kind of inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E said power restoration lagged in some locations because of
the time-consuming nature of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You physically have to move switches,'' said spokesman Leonard
Anderson. ``It takes time. Dozens of switches have to be thrown,
knobs have to be turned, switches have to be moved. It's
mechanical.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One consumer group condemned the utility's handling of the
outage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the larger lesson here is: What's going on with this
company?'' said Netti Hoge, director of the nonprofit consumer
group Toward Utility Rate Normalization. She cited several recent
PG&AMP;E problems, including a blackout sparked by someone who tampered
with the controls in a power substation last year and a 1997 jury
decision that the company bore responsibility for a 500-acre forest
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to be strike three,'' Hoge said. ``You can't blame
an act of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have been human error, but who was supervising the
human?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the California Independent
System Operator, the newly formed organization that manages the
power transmission grid interconnecting the entire state, pointed
out that the blackout had not threatened to knock out power to the
whole state, like the August 1996 failure that started in Idaho and
wiped out power to 11 western states.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1996 power failure created a cascading effect _ power
stations going out one after another _ Tuesday's had a natural
terminating point: it had nowhere to go after hitting San
Francisco. However, he said, his organization would also be
reviewing Tuesday's outage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to be concerned though, because everything is
interconnected,'' Dorinson said.

VITROLLES, France: name changes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, we've sat back and let these foreigners dance
all over us,'' he says, walking his dog near the center of town.
``It may seem like nothing to change a street sign, but it sends a
signal that enough is enough, that we are ready to take back our
city and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Front has gone beyond symbolism in Vitrolles.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of immigrant workers have been axed from the City Hall
payroll, and some ``native'' replacements have been hired in from
other towns. Funding for social programs, especially those catering
to immigrants, has been cut.
</P>
<P>
   Early last summer, the youth center in Les Pins, a neighborhood
with a large immigrant population, was closed for repairs. But no
work was done for weeks. In September, the building burned to the
ground. Many locals suspect arson by National Front militants.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Submarine, a cafe-bar that once drew a
multicultural crowd to its rap and reggae concerts, was shut down
by City Hall, which owns the building.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Fayard, the deputy mayor, brushes aside charges that his
party is conducting a witch hunt against all things foreign.
</P>
<P>
   He says the firings at City Hall were colorblind cost-cutting
and that the owners of the Submarine were dealing drugs and
fiddling their accounts. He argues passionately that street names
should reflect ``native'' culture and that state spending should be
aimed at French citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Fayard describes the birth-bonus program as ``a simple gesture
of solidarity to Vitrollais families.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a challenge by France's Movement Against Racism,
a lower court in Marseille ruled that the program violated a
constitutional principle guaranteeing equal treatment in the
apportioning of state aid. Before the ban was announced, 20
payments had been made to French families in Vitrolles. But Fayard
believes that the court in Marseille was wrong and that the
birth-bonus program is a good thing for France. Sitting in his
sunlit office in City Hall beside a French tricolor flag, the
deputy mayor neatly sums up National Front thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a clear choice. Do we want a French France inside a
European Europe, or do we want to continue down the current path to
a multicultural, multiracial world where countries and borders and
cultures have all dissolved into a gray nothingness?'' he asks,
pausing for breath before confirming his own preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``As patriotic defenders of the republic, we in the National
Front are proud to make Vitrolles more French.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most right-wing movements, the National Front puts a heavy
emphasis on security, which often means a crackdown on immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall has more than doubled the number of municipal police
officers in Vitrolles, and it is planning to add more. It has
installed surveillance cameras in immigrant neighborhoods and has
set up a rapid-reaction police unit with a round-the-clock
telephone hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Many locals are delighted by the beefed-up security and by the
falling crime figures trumpeted by City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Take Louise Marchand. She lives in a tidy bungalow near the
center of town. Not long ago, she was awakened by a ruckus outside
her bedroom window. Several North African teen-agers were horsing
around outside on their scooters. She called the hot line, and
police arrived at the scene within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Arab kids are up all night in the streets, making noise
and getting up to mischief, and we used to have to live with it,''
she says, pruning the rosebush in her front garden. ``Now the
police sort them out right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young immigrants, on the other hand, accuse the expanded
police force of harassment and worse. Others complain that the
National Front ethos percolates through every public institution in
Vitrolles.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent strike by trash collectors, the backlog of
garbage lay festering in Les Pins long after it had been cleared
from other neighborhoods. Locals claim that City Hall sent a
cleanup crew only after youths set fire to the piles of stinking
rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that even the education system has not been immune.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Touzalines, an Algerian family, moved here from
rural Provence. Their eldest daughter, Sofia, who was born in
France, went to register at the local high school. Under French
law, the school was legally bound to take her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in and told the principal's secretary that I wanted to
sign up. She was silent for a while and then looked up, stared at
me for a moment, and said: `You think you can go to school here
with a face like that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't move. It was the first time anyone had ever said
something like that to me. Then she just went on with her work. A
few moments later, she looked up and said, `You're still here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sofia's parents complained to the principal, who backed her
secretary. According to the family, which is now fighting for
redress in the courts, local authorities refused to investigate.
School officials decline to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sofia, now 19, and her younger brother commute
three hours every day to high schools in other towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of thing that happens when you have the
National Front running a city,'' says Sofia. ``I just hope it
doesn't get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say it won't, arguing that winning Vitrolles was the
party's high watermark. But others fear that what is happening here
might be a sign of things to come, both in France and the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere in the EU, anti-immigrant parties register on
the political radar.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party in Austria is the largest far-right political
movement in the EU. Led by the charismatic Jorg Haider, who calls
for an end to immigration and urges foreigners to go home, the
party won 28 percent of the vote in the last general election and
now rivals the country's two mainstream parties in the polls. At
rallies, Haider has told supporters, ``I am your patron saint
against further immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls in France routinely give as much as 15 percent support to
the National Front, which runs three other towns besides Vitrolles.
In October, the party scored a publicity coup when Charles De
Gaulle, the namesake and grandson of the famous French leader,
agreed to run as a National Front candidate for the European
Parliament in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Germany's DVU party, which demonizes
immigrants, snatched 13 percent of the vote in a state election,
the highest score by the far right anywhere in the country since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Small anti-immigrant parties hold toeholds in other EU nations,
such as Britain and the Netherlands. Last February, Ireland, where
immigration is a recent phenomenon, gave birth to its first
pressure group against refugees. But even though the anti-foreigner
sentiment seems to be hardening everywhere, xenophobic parties are
not riding an unbroken crescendo. Some are stable in the polls;
others have suffered recent setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In September, France's National Front lost the by-election for a
parliamentary seat it had earlier won in Toulon. In the German
national elections held the same week, extremists fell short of the
5 percent of the vote needed to earn seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson from Vitrolles is that holding office can be a
poisoned chalice for the extreme right. Some National Front voters
here already criticize the party for failing to deliver economic
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Even from outside the citadels of power, though, Europe's
extreme right can shape public opinion by whipping up panic about
immigration and thus forcing mainstream rivals to toughen their
rhetoric and policies.
</P>
<P>
   Edouard Balladur, the former French prime minister, has caused a
furor by calling for a debate on ``national preference.'' This
year, mainstream conservatives in four French regions formed
regional governments in coalition with the National Front.
</P>
<P>
   To make their politics even more palatable, extreme
right-wingers are buffing up their image. Polished manners, college
degrees and sober suits are the order of the day. Any admiration
for Nazi Germany is kept under tight wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Among Europe's reconstructed xenophobes, Bruno Megret is a
rising star. Urbane and eloquent, with a degree from a U.S.
university under his belt, he is seeking to wrest control of the
National Front from its founder and current leader, the rough-hewn
Jean-Marie Le Pen. Last month, Megret announced his intention to
run in the mayoral elections in Marseille in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Megret already controls Vitrolles through his wife, who ran for
and won the mayor's job when an earlier campaign violation
disqualified him from the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone like Megret, who seems refined and reasonable, could
lead the National Front to greater political influence,'' says
Denis Babin, a Paris-based political analyst. ``People like him can
make extremist ideas seem more normal, more acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the hope of hard-core National Front
supporters in Vitrolles. Many here are already dreaming of bigger
things: winning a major city like Marseille, then a regional
government or two, then the presidency of France.
</P>
<P>
   Roche, the taxi driver, is sure that one day history will
remember this little town for sending a wake-up call to the rest of
France and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really wants all these immigrants in Europe, but here
in Vitrolles we are at least doing something about the problem,''
he says. ``If we keep on fighting for our country, one day our
grandchildren will thank us.'' &QL;

<P>
   MAGDEBURG, Germany _ When immigrants in Europe talk about their
worst nightmare, someone like Dirk is usually the villain of the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Magdeburg, a small city in eastern Germany,
Dirk is at the sharp edge of anti-foreigner sentiment. He is a
young neo-Nazi skinhead who says he cannot stand the sight of
non-Aryans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we come across one or two foreigners on their own, we beat
them up,'' Dirk, who refuses to give his surname, says casually.
``It's what they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the European Union, violence against immigrants is on
the rise. The thriving skinhead movement, whose membership is
measured in the thousands, is often to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Nazi groups preach a virulent strain of racist nationalism.
Skinheads _ who often shave their scalps and wear black boots,
suspenders and bomber jackets _ are the movement's stormtroopers.
For a laugh, for the homeland, they turn the xenophobia of Fortress
Europe into violence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern Germany, where neo-Nazism is strongest, skinheads
fire-bombed shelters for foreign asylum-seekers in the early 1990s
and more recently attacked dark-skinned pregnant women and
immigrant schoolchildren on field trips. Here in Magdeburg, a
hotbed of neo-Nazism, xenophobic crimes are up 19 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Similar violence is spreading elsewhere in Europe, particularly
in northern countries. Germany recorded nearly 400 attacks on
foreigners last year, up more than 10 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Danish skinheads prowl along their country's borders, beating up
nonwhites with fists and baseball bats. In the rough neighborhoods
of Britain, skinheads and other white thugs get their kicks from
beating up Asians in a practice known as ``Paki-bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   From Sweden to Britain to Spain, young people flock to concerts
where skinhead bands celebrate the Third Reich and vilify
immigrants, Jews and Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany may be the most visible example, but this is a
European phenomenon, and it's getting worse,'' says Rheiner Erb, a
researcher at the Center for Anti-Semitism Research in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that the skinhead movement is partly fueled by
old-fashioned teen-age rebellion. Youngsters see it as a way to
shock their elders, and they like the camaraderie that comes from
sharing music, clubs and a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal may run much deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers say that most skinheads are angry young men from
the burgeoning underclass. The movement's nationalism gives them an
identity, while its racism allows them to blame immigrants for
their blighted lives.
</P>
<P>
   Here in eastern Germany, where disillusionment with capitalism
is rife and where foreign faces are a novelty, the crude
certainties of neo-Nazism strike a loud chord. In Magdeburg, being
an immigrant-hating skinhead is almost fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Although he claims to be drifting from the movement and no
longer shaves all the hair from his head, Dirk, 24, remains an
archetypal ``skin.''
</P>
<P>
   He left school at 14 and has never had a job. He lives in a
grubby apartment in a housing project near the center of Magdeburg.
Paint is peeling off the walls and window frames. Half-eaten bowls
of spaghetti lie on the sofa.
</P>
<P>
   One corner of the living room is given over to a little shrine.
Finely painted war planes _ some German, some foreign _ hang from
the ceiling. Submarines topped with swastika flags sit on a shelf
by the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unification (of Germany) has been very bad for us,'' says
Dirk, blowing dust off a little U-boat. ``Nowadays, the dirty
foreigners get everything, and we get nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Magdeburg, the capital of Saxony-Anhalt, the poorest state in
Germany, is ringed by housing projects left over from the communist
era. Row upon row of concrete apartment blocks rise like barracks
from the scrub land. Anti-immigrant graffiti is painted on walls
and bus shelters. Skinheads and other youths loiter in the bars and
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in other neo-Nazi enclaves across Western Europe,
foreigners can feel the hot breath of racial hatred on their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants, who make up only 2 percent of Magdeburg's
population, say they live under a reign of terror. Most avoid
public transport and seldom venture out at night. Banana skins and
dog feces are pushed into their mailboxes. Skinheads spit on them,
shout abuse or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't want to behave like Germans,'' Wolfgang, one
of Dirk's skinhead friends, says of the immigrants. ``We have to
show them who is boss here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrants refuse to be hounded out. They dismiss the
skinheads as confused youngsters who rail against ``foreign
garbage,'' even as they wolf down Turkish kebabs and chicken chow
mein.
</P>
<P>
   Erdal Sahbhaz sells ethnic fast food on the main shopping square
in Neu-Olvenstedt, a housing project in northern Magdeburg. A
Turkish immigrant, he seems unfazed by the swastika scratched into
the side of his stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``These skinheads look scary, and they're nasty when they're
drunk,'' he says, sunning himself on a plastic deck chair. ``But at
the end of the day, they're just kids who don't know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Other immigrants, though, are throwing in the towel. Danny
Mbowa, a young Nigerian who came to Magdeburg a year ago, is
planning to move, perhaps to Paris or London.
</P>
<P>
   ``This skinhead thing is getting really bad,'' he says. ``Last
week, three of them chased me through a park in broad daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   Police warn that the European skinhead movement is growing more
organized.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the Internet hums with sites and chat boards where the
continent's neo-Nazis swap ideas and invitations to events. Web
page after Web page calls for ``liberated zones'' that are free of
foreigners. There are links with the Ku Klux Klan and white
supremacist movements in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-European cooperation is not confined to cyberspace, however.
German neo-Nazis print their literature in Belgium and other EU
countries. Skinhead bands tour the continent and distribute their
albums and videos through established music labels in Sweden,
Britain and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Concerts seem to be a central bonding ritual for skinheads. On
stages festooned with swastikas, heavy-metal punk bands with names
like Fortress and Stormtrooper rail against ``foreign scum.''
</P>
<P>
   After the concerts, many fans, giving straight-arm salutes and
shouting ``White Power'' and ``Sieg Heil'' (``Hail Victory'') spill
out into the streets in a froth of xenophobic rage.
</P>
<P>
   Heiko Schmengler used to play bass guitar in one of Germany's
top skinhead bands. He still holds dear much of the neo-Nazi creed.
The sports bar he runs in Neu Olvenstedt is decked out with German
flags.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmengler, who now has a 5-year-old son named Matthew,
thinks the violence is in danger of getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young skinheads of today don't discuss or think about what
they stand for like we used to. They just put on the outfit and
start attacking people,'' he says, cradling Matthew on his knee.
``And it's shocking how many weapons you see nowadays.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, police found a cache of dynamite in what was
believed to be a small neo-Nazi bomb-making factory near Jena, an
east German town. Raids elsewhere in eastern Germany have turned up
submachine guns, pistols and silencers. Police warn that baseball
bats are giving way to knives as the preferred weapon of the
street. Some fear the neo-Nazis may soon turn to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is leading efforts to clamp down. Brandenburg, the state
that surrounds Berlin, has set up an anti-neo-Nazi commando unit
equipped with helicopters, special weaponry and high-speed cars. In
its first weeks, its agents made two dozen arrests.
</P>
<P>
   To monitor racism and xenophobic incidents throughout Western
Europe, the EU is creating a special ``observatory'' in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Yet social workers everywhere sound a note of caution: Better
monitoring and tougher policing will achieve nothing, they warn, if
the underlying social and economic malaise is left to fester.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Stern, a former chairman of the Berlin Philharmonic
Orchestra, is not very sanguine. A Jewish refugee who fled the
original Nazis during World War II, he recently visited a skinhead
club as part of a social outreach program.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I be optimistic?'' asks the genial 70-year-old. ``Some
of these kids are beyond redemption, and there is not much hope for
the rest unless unemployment falls dramatically, which seems
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, extreme right-wing politicians are helping to
swell the skinhead ranks by fanning the flames of xenophobia with
pamphlets and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   In the housing projects of Magdeburg, the mood is tense. Hanging
around in the afternoon drinking beer, Dirk and his skinhead
friends look like a brawl waiting to happen. There is an ominous
rumble beneath their banter.
</P>
<P>
   Says Dirk, ``If our politicians don't do something about the
foreigners, we might have to do it for them.''

   VITROLLES, France _ Like many natives of this small, quiet town
in the deep south of France, Lucien Roche thinks the time has come
to put immigrants in their place.
</P>
<P>
   The burly, blue-eyed taxi driver fears that the French way of
life _ and even the national gene pool _ is under threat from
people with dark skins and foreign backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't want France to be transformed into an African or a
Muslim republic, we have to fight back,'' says Roche, chewing on a
baguette during his lunch break in the center of Vitrolles. ``The
moment has come to stand up for our own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Roche cheered when Vitrolles City Hall began
paying selected couples $800 for each baby they produced.
</P>
<P>
   Although any resident with a European Union passport was
technically eligible for the controversial program, which now is on
hold because of a lawsuit, most people here assumed that the real
aim was to spur French whites to go forth and multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Vitrolles is run by the National Front, an extreme right-wing
party that wants to rid France of foreigners. The poster
advertising the birth bonuses showed a smiling baby with blond hair
and blue eyes beneath the words: ``For French families.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Vitrolles and across Europe decry the birth
bonuses as a throwback to the Nazi obsession with Aryan breeding
and as a crude bid to freeze immigrants out of French society. But
many others welcome any move to tip the scales in favor of native
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``These immigrants have so many children that we are being
swamped,'' insists Roche, a middle-aged father of two.
</P>
<P>
   Though the birth bonuses were unique to Vitrolles, the
anti-foreigner sentiment behind them echoes with mounting force
across France and the European Union, a political and economic
alliance of 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``These immigrants have so many children that we are being
swamped,'' insists Roche, a middle-aged father of two.
</P>
<P>
   Though the birth bonuses were unique to Vitrolles, the
anti-foreigner sentiment behind them echoes with mounting force
across France and the rest of the European Union, a political and
economic alliance of 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   EU countries are trying to seal their borders against the river
of economic and political refugees flowing here from Africa, Asia,
the former Soviet bloc and even Latin America. Inside what
observers call Fortress Europe, the welcome mat has been rolled up
and the hosts are turning nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere from Sweden to France to Spain, people of foreign
descent are accused of polluting local cultures, committing crimes,
stealing jobs and freeloading on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the mood elsewhere in Europe and eager to restart
its birth-bonus payments, Vitrolles City Hall is now appealing a
lower-court ruling that deemed them unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over Europe, public opinion has turned against us,'' says
Said Charchira, president of the European Union Migrants Forum, an
advocacy group. ``We are no longer seen as human beings but as an
infection that must be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Europe vilifies immigrants. But last year, a
poll conducted by the EU found that one-third of the union's
citizens considered themselves ``very racist'' or ``quite racist.''
The same study found that nearly half believe there are too many
foreigners in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans distrust plans to expand the EU alliance to
include countries in Eastern Europe, fearing a westward flood of
migrants from new members such as Poland and the Czech Republic.
Earlier this year, groups opposed to EU enlargement covered town
centers in Denmark with posters bearing the slogan: ``Say Welcome
To 40 Million Poles.''
</P>
<P>
   In much of the EU, media coverage of immigration has taken on a
disapproving, sometimes hysterical tone.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for instance, the Wexford People, a provincial
newspaper in Ireland, ran a breathless front-page editorial
accusing refugees from Eastern Europe of running through the
streets waving welfare checks, terrorizing old women and trying to
seduce and impregnate Irish girls.
</P>
<P>
   The xenophobia is not confined to the written or spoken word.
Authorities say violence against nonwhites is on the rise
throughout the continent, even in areas, such as Scandinavia, that
are famed for gentle liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   Based on polls, interviews and police statistics, Erb Rheiner, a
researcher at the Center for Anti-Semitism Studies in Berlin,
figures that 10 percent to 15 percent of young men in northern
European countries, and almost as many again in the south, condone
the use of violence against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Skinheads and other right-wing thugs, who warn that Europe is
heading for an all-out ``race war,'' carry out many attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the EU, extremist parties like the National Front are
tapping into the xenophobia and fueling it. Vitrolles, which lies
10 miles north of Marseille, is on the cutting edge of the
anti-immigrant backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch the ordinary small-town veneer here, and racist anger
oozes to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled at the foot of a rocky ridge, Vitrolles is a small
industrial town built largely after the 1960s. Factories on the
outskirts of town stand idle, and 18 percent of the population is
jobless. As many as one-tenth of the 40,000 inhabitants are of
non-European descent, with most tracing their roots to Morocco,
Algeria and Tunisia but also to sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Drifting among the concrete shopping arcades in the center of
town, his hands deep in his pockets, Marcel Gagnon, an unemployed
young white man, accuses the dark-skinned people of spoiling
Vitrolles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't belong in Europe. They're different from us,'' he
says, scowling. ``Look at their faces, at the way they dress and
behave. They don't want to adapt. They just want to suck us dry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and early 1970s, immigrants were welcomed with open
arms into Europe's booming economies. But years of low economic
growth turned the smiles to bile. With the global economic crisis
threatening to bite deeper, nearly 17 million EU citizens, or 10
percent of the labor force, are jobless. In France, the
unemployment rate stands at 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It matters little that immigrants often do the work _ from
domestic cleaning to fruit-picking _ that most Europeans no longer
want. With fewer jobs to go around, with welfare systems bursting
at the seams and with globalization and EU integration chipping
away at traditional identities, many Europeans are edgy and worried
and looking for scapegoats. Anyone who seems like an ``outsider,''
who does not fit the old image of what it means to be French or
German or Dutch, is fair game.
</P>
<P>
   Parties like the National Front in France, the Freedom Party in
Austria and Vlaams Blok in Belgium offer simple solutions. They
want to stop all immigration, to send millions of immigrants home
and to give ``native'' citizens priority in everything from jobs to
housing to social spending.
</P>
<P>
   In France, where the National Front has been in politics since
1972, the policy of putting ``our people first'' even has a name _
``national preference.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with their strident nationalism, most extreme right
parties are also opposed to European integration.
</P>
<P>
   The slogans of the far right resonate especially with young
blue-collar men, who are more likely to compete with immigrants for
jobs. But analysts say other parts of the electorate are also
warming to the message.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, the National Front won the municipal elections
in Vitrolles with more than half the vote. With some success, the
party is using the town as a testing ground for its philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters of different races still hang out together in the
playgrounds and in the town center, but the us-vs.-them feeling has
sharpened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more tension and distrust around,'' says a black
Ivory Coast immigrant who gave his name only as Laurent. ``If you
are on the bus or waiting to pay at the supermarket checkout, you
never know if the person beside you voted National Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Corine Ferrer, a youth worker of French descent, discerns a new
ethnic discord. ``You never used to hear kids saying, `You're
white,' or `You're black,' but now it comes out all the time,'' she
says. ``The Front is driving a wedge between ethnic groups, which
is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the measures taken by the party in Vitrolles are
symbolic. The historic flag of Provence, the local region, has
replaced the European Union flag that once hung from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen street names have been Gallicized. In front of
City Hall, the square once called Place Nelson Mandela is now Place
de Provence.
</P>
<P>
   Some Vitrollais snicker or shrug at the changes, but critics
warn that symbols put ideas into people's heads and give them the
courage to say what was once unsayable.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Legrand, an unemployed painter, certainly takes heart
from the name changes.

DEFYING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, ITALIAN TOWN OPENS ITS ARMS TO
IMMIGRANTS

<P>
   BADOLATO, Italy _ Perched on a rugged hilltop at the edge of the
Ionian Sea, Badolato seems to be dozing in a southern Italian time
warp.
</P>
<P>
   Its medieval houses and churches are knotted together in a
tangle of winding, narrow alleyways. Old men in cloth caps sit all
day long on the edge of the main square, moving only to follow the
shade. The dry hills are terraced with ancient farms.
</P>
<P>
   But Badolato is not all sleepy inertia. This small town is a
rare oasis of hospitality and hope for immigrants seeking a new
life inside Fortress Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when a boat carrying 836 refugees, most of
them Kurds from Turkey and Iraq, washed up on the beach down below,
the town made headlines across the continent. Instead of slamming
their doors and calling in the police, as most other Europeans
might do nowadays, the locals rolled out the welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned houses were thrown open to the refugees. Local
restaurants and grocers delivered boxes of food to their doorsteps.
Neighbors donated clothing, washing machines and television sets as
well as staples found in the cupboards of every Italian kitchen:
crusty bread, bottles of wine and olive oil, tomatoes, garlic and
pasta. The newcomers were given Italian lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response came from inside the heart,'' says Gerardo
Mannello, the mayor of Badolato. ``That we are such a big media
story shows how far the rest of Europe has forgotten basic human
values.''
</P>
<P>
   But the soft-spoken mayor is the first to admit that altruism is
only part of the equation. Rolling out the red carpet to the
refugees was also a bold stroke of civic self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than the rest of Europe, where low birthrates and
aging populations are causing alarm, Badolato is crying out for
demographic renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, poverty has fueled an exodus of young people,
causing the town's population to tumble from nearly 7,000 in the
1950s to just over 600 today.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 houses stand abandoned. Only two of the dozen
medieval churches are open. Most Badolatans are over 50, and, last
year, the junior high school closed for lack of pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Mannello saw the refugees as a catalyst to rouse the town from
its deathbed slumber. It has proved to be a clever gamble.
</P>
<P>
   By embracing the newcomers, Badolato has won federal funds that
are helping refurbish dilapidated houses and the town square. And
the refugees have injected a new elan into local life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a model for mayors all over Europe,'' says Mannello.
``The humanitarian machine and the economic machine linked
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Badolato could never be big enough for all 836 of the refugees,
so most have moved on since gaining their residency papers, mainly
to EU countries farther north.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 45 Kurds still living here, this town is now home, a
small corner of Fortress Europe where dark skin and a foreign
accent are not a one-way ticket to pariah status.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds came here after fleeing their strife-torn homeland in
eastern Turkey and northern Iraq. Today, throughout Badolato,
everyday scenes of Italo-Kurdish harmony look like clips from a
promotional video.
</P>
<P>
   Il Castello, the town's only pizzeria, nestles in a corner of
the main square. Young Kurds and Italians hang out together in the
shade of the restaurant terrace, sipping cold drinks, talking about
soccer and girls, laughing over dirty words in their respective
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Serri, a Turkish Kurd, has been working at Il Castello since
July. His command of the language is still shaky, but he answers
the phone in Italian with a cheerful ``hello'' and takes orders
from customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have really opened their arms to us,'' he says,
hoisting a large mushroom pizza in the air. ``They did not turn us
away when we needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimmo Audino, the gregarious owner of Il Castello, credits the
Kurds with putting Badolato on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of fun together socially, but they've also been
good for business,'' he says. ``We get customers from 200 km away,
which never used to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Audino moved his pizzeria onto the square in July, he
allowed his family-owned former locale, tucked away down a curling
staircase off the main thoroughfare, to be turned into the first
Kurdish restaurant in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Set up with money from the town coffers, the Ararat, named after
the boat that brought the Kurds to these shores, is a monument to
cultural fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Knee-high tables hug the terracotta floor. Colorful woven
carpets hang from the white walls. Diners wash down Kurdish food
with Ciro, the local wine. One page of the menu is devoted to
pizzas with Kurdish toppings, such as yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Cayundar helps run the busy Ararat. In August, he became the
second Kurd in Badolato to net an Italian girlfriend. He has never
felt more welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear of racism and skinheads in Europe, but I've never
felt any rejection in Badolato,'' he says. ``They have given us a
great chance to make a home here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten Kurdish children are now studying alongside their Italian
peers in the local school. Fifteen Kurds already have full-time
jobs _ in the town hall, on nearby farms, with local butchers and
as live-in maids. There are plans to set up an arts and crafts shop
and a small textile plant, both of which would employ a mix of
Italians and Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newcomers are laying down even deeper roots. One
Kurd has started a five-year course in medicine at the University
of Catanzaro, 35 miles up the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Two Kurdish babies have been born in Badolato, the first births
registered here in years. Both children were christened with
suitably Italian names: Angela and Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Badolato is also hoping to parlay its philanthropy into tourist
lira.
</P>
<P>
   The town opened its first-ever tourism office in July and is now
promoting itself as a multicultural getaway. Bookings are streaming
in, mostly from northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Caterina Carnuccio, whose family has for decades run the local
newspaper-tobacco shop, is delighted by the Kurds' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town was dead, and now things are picking up again,''
says the spry 61-year-old. ``I feel very affectionate toward the
Kurds, and they call me mamma.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in Badolato is not to everyone's liking, though.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Italy's refusal to turn away the Kurdish boat
people was harshly denounced in Germany and the Netherlands, both
magnets for illegal immigrants. Mannello, the mayor, has received
threats through the mail and by phone.
</P>
<P>
   A few locals resent the changes here, and some people in nearby
towns accuse Badolato of exploiting the Kurds to extract money from
Rome. Though several Italian mayors have expressed interest in the
way Badolato is handling its refugees, none has yet followed
Mannello's example.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the first euphoria has died down, even Badolatans are
having to come to terms with the fact that a warm welcome is only
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating the newcomers into the labor force is turning out to
be trickier than expected. Cheated by employers in neighboring
towns or unwilling to take low-paid work, a few Kurds have turned
down job offers, to the annoyance of locals. And even if Badolato
booms, it will always be a small town with limited career
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Sekfan Gunel, a Kurdish immigrant, lives with his wife and
daughter in one of the formerly abandoned houses just off the main
square. After a lunch of tomato and onion salad, he slips out onto
the narrow balcony to drink a cup of strong coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The view would make a tourist's heart sing: red clay rooftops,
stone churches, terraced farms, deep blue sea. Donated clothes flap
on the washing line just above Gunel's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are warm here, and I would like to stay, but if I can't
find good work, then I don't know. Maybe I will have to leave,'' he
says, staring down into his coffee. ``That would be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their eventual fate, though, the Kurdish newcomers will
always have a soft spot for Badolato. By swimming against the tide
of European opinion, this tiny, picturesque town has shown that, at
least in southern Italy, the art of the warm welcome is alive and
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never forget this reception,'' says a Kurdish woman who
identifies herself only as Dina. ``We'll always remember these kind
Italians who opened their hearts to us.''
</P>

<P>
   ANTWERP, Belgium _ In this small country famous for chocolates
and diamonds, life is bittersweet for Dennis Amoah.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old is a professional soccer player on a continent
that worships the sport. He lives in a modern apartment with his
sweet, loving wife. He has many friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Amoah also bears a heavy cross on his athletic shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Being a black immigrant from Ghana, he says, makes him a target
for racial hatred in many walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   When Amoah hits the road with his lower-division soccer team,
opposing fans wave bananas at him, call him a ``black monkey'' and
tell him to go back to the jungle where he belongs, he says. Rival
players sometimes taunt him with racist slurs, too. He once tried
to scramble into the stands to silence a foul-mouthed fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to lose my temper, but now it just hurts. It makes you
feel ashamed of what you are,'' says &QL; 
Amoah, the muscles tightening on his smooth face. ``It is not a
good thing for your heart and mind.''
</P>
<P>
   His plight is part of a larger picture. In a Western Europe
proud of its liberal traditions, many immigrants _ particularly
those with dark skins _ say they find it hard to be accepted as
equals and to get ahead in daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Though only a minority suffers racist violence, most grapple
with a culture of discrimination that sends a similar message: You
are not one of us. You are not wanted here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the Berlin Wall has fallen, another wall has been
built within people's minds,'' says Said Charchira, president of
the European Union Migrants Forum, an advocacy group. ``That wall
is made of racism and xenophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic minorities in Europe generally enjoy fewer legal
protections than their counterparts in the United States. But even
where strong anti-discrimination laws do exist, such as here in
Belgium, victims often fail to make them work in practice or to win
much sympathy from the native population.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., people discriminate quietly. But in Europe, it's
out in the open. It's in your face,'' says Tony Lamptey, an
African-American now living in Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   Lamptey sometimes feels he has stepped through the looking
glass. Born in Illinois, he worked as a salesman in Louisiana and
Georgia before earning an MBA. In 1992, eager for a change of
scenery, he moved to Antwerp, where he now runs a small African
grocery shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Americans think racism doesn't exist in Europe,'' he
says, ``but people get away with things here they wouldn't even
dream of trying in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   No country in the 15-nation European Union is colorblind.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where large-scale immigration started earlier than
in the rest of Europe and where minority rights are widely viewed
as more evolved, racial discrimination may be weaker or more
discreet, but it still thrives.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Antwerp, a Dutch-speaking port city where unemployment
is rife and politics lean toward the extreme right, every type of
discrimination is in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   Amoah says he has seen it all. Six years after moving from Ghana
to take up an offer to play professional soccer, he has a full
residency permit and a white Belgian wife. Yet he still feels like
an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Across the EU, non-whites complain of insults in the streets and
withering looks in shops. Many are turned away from restaurants,
bars and nightclubs, either with a racist slight or with a hollow,
``Sorry, we're full.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Amoah and three black friends _ all well-dressed
and sober _ went to a popular discotheque on the outskirts of
Antwerp. The doorman demanded to see their passports, then told
them to scram, Amoah recalls. Minutes later, several white Belgians
were let in with no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember the music they were playing in the club that
night,'' says Amoah, smiling wryly. ``It was a song called `Don't
Hate Me' by Haddaway, a black singer from Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet getting through the proverbial front door is sometimes a
pale victory. Just ask Paul Berko, a young Nigerian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent car trip from Antwerp to Paris, he and a black
friend stopped in a small Belgian town to eat lunch at a
restaurant. After they paid the bill, the waitress cleared their
table and then made a great show of dumping all the plates and
cutlery into the garbage can, Berko says.
</P>
<P>
   When Berko asked her why, the waitress answered that if she did
not throw everything away, nobody would eat in the restaurant
again, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Antwerp, which lies just 30 miles north of the European Union
headquarters in Brussels, immigrants can never entirely forget
their outsider status.
</P>
<P>
   De Coninc Square in the city's center is a multicultural haven.
A boarded-up building is covered with bright murals, and the
cobbled streets are lined with ethnic bars, eateries and
nightclubs, many with cheerful names like Tropical Dance. Immigrant
men and women linger on the streetcorners, laughing and chatting in
a babble of languages. Reggae music drifts through the air.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, on one side street, a bar called Non-Stop runs an
informal ``whites-only'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Lamptey, the African-American grocer whose shop lies around the
corner, is not surprised that such flagrant racism is allowed to
exist inside an immigrant neighborhood. Even though the law is on
their side, non-whites in Belgium lack the confidence to fight
back, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., black people don't fear white people, and they'll
sue if they think their rights are being trampled,'' he says,
smoothing the sleeves of his purple African robe. ``But black
people have not been here long enough to feel Belgian, and they're
scared of being sent home if they kick up a fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamptey stops speaking for a moment to serve a couple of
customers. A tall Nigerian woman buys a handful of cassava and a
bag of okra. A young man from Ghana picks up some yams and a bottle
of shampoo. Lamptey then turns back to finish his discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think they'll get anywhere trying to sue a
Belgian for discrimination,'' he says. ``You just keep your head
down and carry on with your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the European Union, authorities concede that public
institutions are often tainted by racism.
</P>
<P>
   Ask immigrants around the continent to name their bugbears, and
the police will figure on almost every list.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse law enforcement officials at all levels,
including judges and prosecutors, of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   Even supposedly multicultural Britain is not above reproach. In
October, the police chief in Manchester admitted that his force was
infected with an ``institutionalized racism'' that reflected
mainstream British society.
</P>
<P>
   At border checkpoints around the EU, dark-skinned Europeans
complain of being singled out for tough grilling by customs
officials, while their white compatriots sail by with a nod and a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   On streets inside the EU, police hunting for illegal immigrants
or criminals are far more likely to stop and search non-whites,
studies show. Amoah says he is regularly asked by the police to
show his ID.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you ever feel at home somewhere when they are always
forcing you to prove that you have the right to walk down the
street?'' he asks, fiddling with the strap on his mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the harassment blurs into brutality or worse, critics
say. Four years ago, a Ghanaian immigrant was hauled into an
Antwerp police station when neighbors complained that his stereo
was playing too loudly. While in custody, the 34-year-old slipped
into a coma and died.
</P>
<P>
   Police claim he was on crack cocaine and that their efforts to
control his epileptic seizures resulted in the coma. Though no one
has ever been charged with his death, fellow Africans say that his
body bore the marks of severe beatings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``You cannot trust the police here,'' says Amoah. ``They are often
the worst racists of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his troubles with native Europeans, though, Amoah was
lucky to land in Europe with a job. He was brought here by a
professional soccer team and now plays for a club in Nijlen, a
small town 15 miles east of Antwerp. Like many successful non-white
players, Amoah _ a high-scoring forward _ is popular with fans of
his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the glamorous world of soccer, however, most immigrants
in Europe struggle to get a foot on the economic ladder and often
languish in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   European labor practices do not help. Many EU countries have
rigid laws that make it hard for anyone _ especially immigrants _
to break into the mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
   An enterprising Chinese or Pakistani family can eke out a living
running an all-night grocery in Britain, but not in Germany, where
laws prevent any shop opening after 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some laws conspire directly against immigrants. In the
Netherlands, regulations make it virtually impossible for a
foreign-born resident to drive a taxi, that favorite first job of
many ambitious newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   In many EU countries, people who have applied for refugee status
are not allowed to work at all while their applications are under
review.
</P>
<P>
   In Antwerp, as in the rest of Europe, job hunting with the wrong
skin color or an exotic surname can be tricky. Recent research by
the Geneva-based International Labor Organization suggests that, in
many European countries, one in three immigrant job applicants
suffers discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ILO study, employers claim positions are filled
when they aren't or they admit openly that ``foreign-looking''
staff might put off customers. Many simply gravitate unwittingly to
candidates with white faces and traditional European names.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they do get hired, immigrants often say they are
treated poorly in the workplace. The racist chants aimed at Amoah
and millionaire soccer stars in the stadiums of Europe echo the
drudgery thrust on immigrants further down the economic scale.
</P>
<P>
   Boldichat Abdeldajid came to Antwerp in 1988 from Morocco. At
the metallurgical factory where he now works on the outskirts of
town, only foreigners are asked to handle the scalding liquid
metal, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a white guy joins, he goes straight to another part of the
factory,`` says Abdeldajid, a big, burly man with a timid smile.
``It's the blacks and the Moroccans who get stuck with the dirty,
dangerous work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same spirit, say researchers, European landlords and real
estate agents steer immigrants away from ``white'' neighborhoods,
and ``white'' schools turn away immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Abdeldajid and his wife tried to enroll their
children in a school down the road from their small apartment in
Antwerp. The principal told them he had already accepted ``too many
immigrants.'' When they protested, he told them to go back to
Morocco, Abdeldajid says. Their children now walk to classes two
miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you really feel like an immigrant, an outsider,''
says Abdeldajid, cracking the knuckles on his meaty fingers. ``We
hear this word `integration,' but how are we supposed to integrate
if Europeans won't let us?''
</P>
<P>
   Education researchers warn that immigrant children are
underperforming in European schools. Some blame economic-class
divisions and the tendency to shunt such children into poor
schools; others blame the lower expectations of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Take Nancy Palaba, a black woman who came to Antwerp from Ghana
to work as a maid 11 years ago. After a long shift recently, she
returned to her tiny apartment to find her 12-year-old son weeping
on the sofa. Ken, a math whiz, had just scored 93 percent on an
exam. A substitute teacher, who knew nothing of his school record,
had accused him of cheating in front of the whole class.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Africa we only knew the word `racism,''' says Palaba.
``Europe has taught us what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Young immigrants also are hard-pressed to find role models.
Non-whites may thrive in sports and the music industry but, in most
European countries, they are sparsely represented at the top of
politics, business and such professions as law and banking. Only
one of France's 36,560 towns and villages has a dark-skinned mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, there are few
dark faces in the mainstream media. When immigrants do crop up in
the European press, it is often in crime reports, and their
ethnicity is usually flagged: Moroccan drug dealer, Nigerian
rapist, Vietnamese burglar.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of role models, coupled with the racism, is
especially galling for second-, third- and fourth-generation
immigrants, who were born in Europe and speak the local languages
yet still feel like second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the rundown suburbs that ring the major cities of France, the
children of Arab immigrants seem to be locked into a permanent
underclass. Crime and violence are sometimes the only outlets for
their frustration. Some neighborhoods are virtual no-go zones for
the French police.
</P>
<P>
   Dany Fraitas Santos knows how those Arab youths feel, even
though he stays on the right side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Cape Verde Islands, which lie off the west coast of
Africa, the 27-year-old was brought up in Antwerp. He now works for
an insurance company in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak perfect Dutch, and I even speak it with an Antwerp
accent, so I have no problems on the phone,'' he says. ``But as
soon as people see my face, I am instantly something foreign to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos dreams of one day leaving behind the discrimination of
Europe for a fresh start back in Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not every native European is an unreconstructed racist.
</P>
<P>
   Many try hard to be colorblind and to welcome immigrants as
equals. And though it seems like a paradox, interethnic socializing
is fairly common in some EU countries.
</P>
<P>
   American visitors to Britain, where the rate of interracial
marriage is 10 times higher than in the United States, often remark
that relations between blacks and whites seem less tense there than
in the States.
</P>
<P>
   Interethnic relationships rankle many Europeans, but others take
them in stride. Amoah, for instance, is on good terms with his
wife's white friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Taking heart from the social mixing, European politicians are
moving to tackle discrimination. After declaring 1997 its official
Year Against Racism, the EU is setting up a special ``observatory''
in Vienna to monitor and make suggestions on how to combat racism.
</P>
<P>
   Other levels of government are taking steps of their own. Last
summer, Antwerp's City Council hired its first two ``integration
officers,'' who will handle discrimination complaints and work to
promote racial harmony. The police force has launched a drive to
recruit ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Following the British example, Belgian soccer authorities
recently announced a campaign to stamp out racist slurs in the
professional leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But new rules and commissions and inquiries seldom win rapturous
applause from immigrants, who are tired of windy rhetoric that
fails to deliver hard results.
</P>
<P>
   Like other black soccer players in Belgium, Amoah would love to
see his sport purged of racism. But nothing has changed so far, and
he is not holding his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a black man, you have to fight harder for everything in
Europe, and you have to put up with a lot of garbage,'' he says.
``That is not going to change overnight.'' &QL;

ELECTRONIC GIFTS ARE HOT ITEMS AT THE NORTH POLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Imagine Santa with a cell phone for the sleigh, a
Palm Pilot to store his naughty-and-nice list, and, then, for some
relaxing television viewing after his big trip, a new satellite
dish at the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   It's the perfect high-tech Christmas _ no ho, ho, ho.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and electronic items are now a staple of the Christmas
retailing season and are widely available from sources ranging from
traditional retail stores to television channels and Internet
vendors. In fact, the majority of American households will buy at
least one electronic item for the season, according to the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association, a trade group based in
Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The most highly desired item is a desktop computer, identified
by 11 percent of 1,000 people surveyed in September, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Joe Pasquini wants. Of course, as president of the
Capital District Computer Enthusiasts Club in Albany, he already
has a computer. But he'd like a faster model for around $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time. As far as PCs are concerned, it's ancient: 3 years
old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasquini family has plenty of company, early sales reports
indicate. Sellers say they are seeing both novice buyers selecting
their first computer, and experienced users upgrading their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The iMAC, Apple Computer Inc.'s hip product, is selling well at
$1,300 and is attracting buyers to other Apple products, said Jason
Pierce, sales manager at Castle Computers in Latham, N.Y. The other
models include a desktop entry, PowerMac, and the portable
PowerBook.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and the spread of e-mail are stimulating computer
purchases, Pierce said. Older buyers, including grandparents, are
now evaluating computers because they want to send e-mail to
children and grandchildren, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer-distribution channels are also reporting brisk
sales. QVC, the shopping channel, sold more than 18,000 specially
designed IBM-compatible systems on Sunday alone, said Dennis
D'Angelo, director of merchandising for electronics. Many QVC
buyers enjoy the chit-chat between television hosts and callers,
and like the extended demonstrations of product features, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They find buying in that environment less intimidating than
computer superstores or office-supply chains, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cyberian Outpost Inc., a young Internet retailer
based in Kent, Conn., surpassed $1 million in orders on Nov. 30,
said a company spokesman. Even people who are buying their first
computer for the home are making purchases over the Internet, he
said: They just buy from work.
</P>
<P>
   This year's novice buyers may just be starting down the path of
a lifetime of computer-related purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something to buy,'' Pasquini said.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not a whole new and better system you want, then it
could be an accessory he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer owners now want to spend a few hundred dollars on
a digital camera so they can put photos into their computer systems
and e-mail them to friends and family. Cameras range from around
$200 to $1,000 in computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   The market is also supplying scanners for less than $100 to take
images into the computer; portable drives for extra storage are in
the same price range.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilots, the hand-held devices that allow people to store
schedules and contact names and phone numbers, are selling for
around $300.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phone providers are now often providing the handsets
for free as long as people commit to a calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   New stereo receivers with Dolby sound are selling for around
$400, and digital versatile disk players for movies and music range
between $400 and $800.
</P>
<P>
   If the high-tech world seems too confusing, don't seem rushed.
You have plenty of time. You might be able to wait until the new
year to get a computer, Pasquini said, and get an even better
price.

AS MULTICULTURALISM MOVES INEXORABLY FORWARD, EUROPEANS ARE
GRAPPLING WITH IDENTITY CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Europeans have always had fun with national
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The uptight English sipping tea. The snobbish French dunking
croissants in their ``cafe au lait.'' The mechanical Germans
searching for a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, though, such portraits are largely the stuff of comedy
sketches and cartoons. Defining national identity in Western Europe
has become a subtle and slippery matter.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, a debate rages over a question that never
needed asking before: What does it mean to be French or Dutch or
English?
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the identity crisis is European integration,
which is blurring old borders and binding the people of this
continent more closely together than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Another is immigration. Two generations after migrants started
arriving en masse, native Europeans are struggling to come to terms
with life in multi-ethnic societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every people in Europe is grappling, in its own way, with the
question of who we are,'' says Roger Morgan, a senior fellow with
the Center for European Integration Research at the University of
Bonn in Germany. ``It's a tricky debate and one in which people can
take quite strong positions for and against.''
</P>
<P>
   Never easy to measure, identity can be roughly gauged by the way
a nation chooses to paint its own self-portrait. Does it banish
immigrants to the fringes or airbrush them out altogether? Or does
it allow immigrants to sit near the center, like full members of
the family?
</P>
<P>
   The final option unnerves many Europeans. Some nations in
Western Europe can trace their history and culture back more than a
thousand years. Embedded in the back of many minds is the belief
that ``European'' still equals ``white Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   When a black woman won the Miss Italy contest in 1996, some
commentators complained that she was ``unrepresentative of Italian
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at the other end of the spectrum, the Dutch have, for two
years running, sent black pop groups to represent their country at
the Eurovision Song Contest.
</P>
<P>
   European attitudes vary widely on how to embrace immigrants and
their cultures. In a recent poll, citizens in industrialized
countries were asked for their views on multiculturalism. Americans
and Canadians were the most accepting, followed by the British and
the Dutch and then by the Swedes. People in the rest of the
European Union lagged far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Multiculturalism is still a dirty word in France, where,
traditionally, immigrants have been expected to dump their own ways
in favor of ``French'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the idea of an ethnically homogenous nation remains
strong. Laws traditionally have made it hard for anyone without
German blood to earn citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Although continental integration has spawned a new ``European''
elite who speak two or three languages and glide across borders
with ease, it is also driving many people deeper into old national
and regional identities.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, immigrants are an undeniable fact of life in Europe,
and they are giving a multi-ethnic flavor to everything from sports
to music to cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   More and more European schools, even in France, permit immigrant
students to wear the traditional dress of their homelands, and many
cater to their dietary preferences. In the Netherlands, white
teen-agers sprinkle their speech with Surinamese, Arabic and
Turkish words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, Europe is changing on the ground,'' says Mark
Mitchell, an immigration expert at the University of Portsmouth in
England. ``Every country is different, and though you can argue
about the speed, the overall evolution toward de facto
multiculturalism is now unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   Social divisions among ethnic groups are also starting to
soften.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that more than 60 percent of the French have
friends in minority groups, not far behind British levels.
Interracial marriages are more common in both countries than in the
United States. In Britain, half of black men and a third of black
women have married or have lived with a white partner.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Germany, where mainstream politicians still insist that
``we are not a country of immigration,'' inter-ethnic marriages are
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe that the bonds of friendship and family
will help draw immigrants into the national self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``When personal relationships are forming across ethnic lines,
people find it easier to imagine a national identity with a
multicultural basis,'' says Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has probably moved farthest down the road to a shared
multicultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic cooking is a big hit all over Europe, but the British
have gone one step further, virtually adopting Indian food as their
national cuisine. In last summer's World Cup, that great cauldron
of national emotions, one official song of the English soccer team
was a homage to a fiery Indian dish called vindaloo. And the new
``curry pubs,'' where customers wash down Indian grub with pints of
lager, are the ultimate in cultural fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the British marked the 50th anniversary of the
arrival of the first boatload of immigrants from the Caribbean with
a vivid celebration of multiculturalism, which culminated in a gala
evening of comedy, music and poetry that was broadcast nationally
and attended by top politicians and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the World Cup may have marked a turning point for the
host country, France. Built around a core of dark-skinned
immigrants, the French team won the championship and, with it, the
hearts of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the victory, hundreds of thousands of revelers
piled into the Champs Elysees. In a rare display of ``fraternite,''
blacks, Arabs and whites danced and sang together, waving the
French tricolor flag.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that racism in France will end overnight. But
the World Cup victory could prove to be the moment when the French
began to embrace their multiracial society.
</P>
<P>
   ``A World Cup victory does not change social reality,'' wrote
Serge July, editor of the Liberation newspaper in Paris. ``But it
can change the image the French have of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The French victory did not go unnoticed in Germany, whose soccer
team, made up entirely of white men with names such as Jurgen,
performed dismally in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cheering on dark-skinned players who score big goals is the
easy part. Many Europeans still find it hard to accept all
immigrants as full members of the national family or to celebrate
the emergence of a new cultural hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Netherlands and Britain, those two multicultural
trailblazers, racism and discrimination run deep.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, millions of dark-skinned people living in Europe,
including those born on the continent, wonder if they will ever be
accepted as ``real'' Europeans. And their defeatism could become a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrants and their children make little effort to
integrate, preferring instead to huddle in ethnic enclaves,
speaking their own languages, eating their own food, hanging out
with their own people. That isolation is made easier by modern
technology, which gives immigrants the chance to phone and fly home
often and to watch TV from the mother country on satellite
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Such ethnic cocooning is anathema to thinkers such as Anil
Ramdas, a Surinamese immigrant and a leading commentator in the
Netherlands, who believe that non-whites should work overtime to
earn a place at the center of the national self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the white majority be open to us simply because we
are here?`` Ramdas asks. ``It's our business to portray ourselves
as the most modern, the most hip, the most desirable people in the
world. This is not the flower-power era of good will. We live in
the advertising age where you have to sell yourself, and only the
glamorous survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ethnic cocooning could slow the pace, many European
intellectuals think it is unlikely to halt the general drift toward
multiculturalism. Peering into their crystal balls, some see
Europeans of the distant future living at ease in multi-ethnic
melting pots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people who say that European cultures
cannot or should not be diluted,'' Morgan says. ``But the clear
trend is to redefine national identities along multicultural
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, European comedians will continue to
milk those old jokes about the tea-sipping English, the snobby
French and the rigid Germans.

BEATING THE ODDS: TAILOR RISES TO THE TOP OF SAVILE ROW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend use)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON, England _ To most Europeans, buying a suit on Savile Row
means the same thing as it did 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Immaculate craftsmanship. Sky-high prices. Traditional English
service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best tailors in the world still ply their trade
along this august street in the heart of London.
</P>
<P>
   But the old image of rich white men buying sober suits from
stuffy white tailors is starting to fray like an aging lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Andrew Ramroop, a black immigrant from the Caribbean
island of Trinidad, owns and runs Maurice Sedwell, a leading shop
on ``The Row.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is an element of surprise when customers come in
off the street and are welcomed by a West Indian,'' he says, a
Caribbean lilt rippling through his voice. ``But they are soon put
at ease when they realize what you know and what you can do for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might dismiss Ramroop's rise to the top of Savile Row, that
great totem of the White Establishment, as a fluke. But others
prefer to see it in a wider context _ as a beacon, a sign that the
immigrant story in Europe is not all exclusion and failure, that,
despite the institutional barriers and the petty discrimination,
newcomers can thrive here.
</P>
<P>
   Now 55, Ramroop came to London in 1970 with a dream and a couple
of homemade suits. His handiwork quickly earned him a back-room job
in a tailoring shop on Savile Row. Long years of discrimination
followed, he says. Less-gifted white colleagues were regularly
promoted ahead of Ramroop. But his talent eventually prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a decade after he took it over, the Maurice Sedwell store
is thriving in his elegant hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ramroop has clothed British Cabinet ministers and made outfits
for Diana, Princess of Wales. Last month, he was in Houston,
measuring board members of a leading company. Earlier this year, he
was chosen by his peers to chair the Master Craftsmen's
Association, the ultimate accolade for a tailor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always aspired to be the best tailor on Savile Row, and to
some extent, I think I've achieved that,'' he says, caressing one
of his gold cuff links. ``You could say this is a dream come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, immigrants seem to have more luck making good in
Britain than in the rest of the European Union, but countries
across the English Channel also have many success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the EU, people of foreign descent have made great
strides in sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   European soccer leagues are filled with dark-skinned players.
The superstars among them are household names who earn millions of
dollars in wages and endorsements. Nearly half of the members of
the World Cup-winning French team were immigrants, and all were
feted like national heroes.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the EU, non-white pop groups churn out hit songs and
slick videos in European languages.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Jannah and other black singers dominate the charts in the
Netherlands. Young Swedes fall at the feet of the black singer
Doctor Alban. Black rapper MC Solaar is a hero in France, where
rappers of North African descent are also on the rise. One of
Britain's chart-topping Spice Girls is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to other industries, the music industry is relatively
open, and black people, in particular, have seized the opportunity
with a vengeance,`` says John Rogers, a London-based pop music
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants have made more modest gains in higher-brow pursuits
such as literature, classical music and art.
</P>
<P>
   Britain seems to have the strongest non-white literati.
Indian-born author Salman Rushdie, whose writings incurred the
wrath of the Iranian mullahs, is a star here and abroad. In 1991,
Nigerian-born Ben Okri won the Booker Prize, Britain's most
prestigious award for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Dark faces are fairly common on British TV. The country's soap
operas feature many non-white actors, and several news anchors are
black or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's nearest rival on the Continent is the Netherlands,
where TV personalities come in different shades and colors.
</P>
<P>
   But non-whites are also creeping onto small screens elsewhere.
On weekday mornings, many Germans tune in to a chat show hosted by
an Asian immigrant. France has a news anchorman of North African
descent.
</P>
<P>
   The score card in politics is less impressive. Parliaments
across Europe remain much whiter than their electorates, and no
country has produced a dark-skinned leader with the standing of a
Rev. Jesse Jackson or a Gen. Colin Powell. But a few pioneers are
climbing the political ladder, particularly in local government.
One example is Trevor Phillips, a black who is a strong candidate
for the new post of mayor of London.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the corridors of political power, ambitious young
immigrants, particularly in Britain and the Netherlands, are
carving out careers in such professions as law, medicine and
banking.
</P>
<P>
   Sanjay Patel is an example of a slowly emerging breed: the
non-white yuppie. He grew up in Birmingham, England, where his
Indian parents still run a grocery store. He went to university and
now earns a six-figure salary as a trader in the City, London's
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one generation, we've gone from selling tinned vegetables
to selling stocks and bonds,'' says Patel, a brash 27-year-old with
a penchant for flashy clothes. ``That's pretty good, don't you
think?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Patel's parents, many of Europe's immigrants yank
themselves up through the world of small business. Restaurants are
a favorite route. Throughout the European Union, immigrant
entrepreneurs from almost every ethnic group are busy parlaying
their home cooking into profits.
</P>
<P>
   A few immigrants have broken into the top of the European
business club. Minoo Akhtarzand, an Iranian-born woman, has risen
to become a managing director of Vattenfall, the largest
electricity company in Sweden. Indian-born Lakshmi Mittal founded
and still runs the LMN Group, one of the five largest steel
producers in the world. With a personal worth of $3.5 billion,
Mittal ranks among the richest people in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Successful immigrants often bring with them a fresh energy.
European cuisine, soccer and pop music have all been galvanized by
foreign influences.
</P>
<P>
   On the famously conservative Savile Row, Ramroop is always
experimenting with new stitches, materials and designs and with new
ways to keep customers happy. He is even injecting a little
Caribbean ``joie de vivre'' into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the 60th anniversary of Maurice Sedwell in July, he did
the unthinkable. He threw a party inside his mahogany-paneled
showroom. A steel band played Caribbean tunes, while guests dug
into West Indian food. Ramroop mixed the rum punch himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the done thing on Savile Row to have a party. No one
has parties. No one wants to change. No one thanks their
customers,'' he says. ``But our party was great, and people danced
for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many successful immigrants, Ramroop never forgets the
discrimination that he faced en route to the top.
</P>
<P>
   But he prefers to look forward. He stresses his own industry and
ingenuity. He argues that being non-white can be an advantage, a
badge of honor signaling that he has beaten the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he seeks to encourage others to follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Ramroop took on a promising young immigrant from Iran
as an apprentice tailor. Earlier this year, he sent a message of
support to London's hottest young black designer, Ozwald Boateng,
whose business was hit hard by the economic downturn in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the burgundy leather sofa in his own showroom with
sewing machines clicking gently in the background, Ramroop allows
himself to indulge in a little optimism on the future of immigrants
on Savile Row and in the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever people think about it, we live in an increasingly
multicultural world now,'' he says. ``It will take time, but I
think more and more (non-white) people will go on to achieve
success.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ People have begun to ask whether Hillary Rodham Clinton
is likely to be elected president of the United States. At this
point, the answer is evidently no, but the question does reflect a
remarkable development in her role and the way she is perceived.
 &HT;    Throughout President Bill Clinton's ordeal by sex-lie scandal,
Mrs. Clinton has carried on as though she had no personal concerns.
Her stamina and her strength have made a huge difference in her
husband's ability to weather the attacks so far.
 &HT;    The troubles aren't quite over yet, but the issue now is more
how congressional Republicans are going to get rid of the
impeachment question than it is the fate of the president. Censure
strikes me as a rather pointless, artificial way of avoiding their
responsibility to conclude what has been started.
 &HT;    The argument that some formal punishment must be imposed to show
that Mr. Clinton earned the disapproval of the legislature and many
compatriots is fatuous. That criticism has already been very widely
recorded.
 &HT;    Some do seem to resent, however, that he has borne it all
without any signs of the emotional distress and self-abasement that
would seem inescapable for most people. He is probably sustained by
the same force of confidence that led him to feel he could ignore
the proprieties and get away with it. That trait got him into
trouble, and it is seeing him through, with Hillary's indispensable
help.
 &HT;    She has gone through several transformations in their years at
the peak of American politics. She wanted to share in the rewards
as well as the effort. There was a lively, joyful modern air of
equality and partnership in their early campaign theme of ``two for
the price of one,'' but it boomeranged. Feminism hasn't won that
much support from Americans.
 &HT;    So she shifted to less assertive, less political subjects,
gentled her style, and made more of the wife-and-mother role which
American political usage seems to demand. But that turned out to be
a lot tougher than the traditional routine, and she responded again
with intense, carefully programmed activity. Now she is on the
cover of Vogue, a first for a presidential wife, and will be Time's
Woman of the Year, and American-watchers around the world are
wondering about her future.
 &HT;    Mrs. Clinton is a fine public speaker, poised, generating
conviction, able to think quickly on her feet. In January this
year, not long after the Monica story broke, she appeared at the
World Economic Forum in Davos to talk about education and
development. She showed no diffidence or embarrassment, and the
several thousand business and political leaders present gave her a
standing ovation.
 &HT;    A question was passed up to her. ``Don't you think it's time for
the U.S. to choose an intelligent, capable woman president?''
Without stopping for breath, she laughed and found the perfect
diplomatic answer. ``Yes, and I look forward to voting for her.''
 &HT;    Clearly, the intention was to lure her into declaring a
candidacy for herself, but she is no political dummy. In current
circumstances, it is hard to imagine her name on a ballot. It would
be fun to see her as vice-presidential candidate on an Al Gore
ticket for 2000, but entertaining the voters isn't what campaign
consultants recommend.
 &HT;    Still, Mrs. Clinton has now established herself as an effective
public figure in her own right, both in the United States and in
the many foreign countries where she has made successful trips. She
is too young, too energetic, too full of ideas, too competent to
disappear politely when she is no longer first lady. There have
been rumors that the couple will split up after they leave the
White House, the aftermath of the scandal, but their pact has
proven extraordinarily solid so far.
 &HT;    The issues that were shoved aside and drowned out by Monicagate
are all still there, and she has developed considerable expertise
in addressing them. No doubt she will find a platform to enable her
to continue, whatever her husband chooses as his next career, for
he will have one.
 &HT;    The nearest thing to a precedent for Mrs. Clinton's
self-launched activism was Eleanor Roosevelt, also a stubborn,
persistent, innovative woman who had to put up with a lot. She was
demeaned, even detested, but she kept on with the humane causes she
thought important and now she is remembered with love and
gratitude.
 &HT;    Just where it will take her isn't clear, but certainly Mrs.
Clinton is not coming to the end of her road in 2000.

New York Times.)

BATTERIES KEEP POWERLESS CITY CLINGING TO TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's information revolution went to
battery power Tuesday, showing just how dependent
communication-rich lifestyles are on electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The outage that struck the city and adjoining areas also led
some to believe they had witnessed a preview of the much-ballyhooed
millennium bug computer meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I hope they get things up and running really, really
soon,'' said John Bandermere, a San Francisco programmer who was
trying to get the last drops of power out of his IBM laptop
computer before the batteries were exhausted. ``I only have about
30 minutes left, then I'm hosed. There's nowhere around here to
charge up again.''
</P>
<P>
   A mistake made by a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. work crew shut
down a power substation in the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday
morning, leaving 1 million people without electricity for up to
seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phone users were quickly sucking up battery power, as
many office phone systems shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race against time,'' said Susan Werler, an executive
assistant who was holding a cell phone up to her face. ``They keep
putting me on hold, and I think I only have about 10 more minutes
of talk time left.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Garrett of Alexander Ogilvy, a high-tech public relations
firm, said the outage had created a ``primal'' atmosphere at the
San Francisco-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very technology intensive here,'' he said. ``Panic sets
in when e-mail goes down for 10 minutes. Throw in the phones going
down, and you get a crazy workday.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell felt the switch to portable phones. ``Our wireless
phone traffic was up 65 percent,'' said John Britton, a spokesman
for the telephone company. ``We had congestion, and not all the
calls that were made got through.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular phone lines, which use low voltage power from a number
of Pacific Bell generators, continued to operate during the outage,
and handled an extra million-plus phone calls during the power
outage, Britton said. The wired phone power comes from diesel
engines that kicked in at 13 Pacific Bell stations in the San
Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   During the outage, many Internet companies sent their workers
home, as monitors blinked off and network connections were dropped.
``A lot of people got the day off,'' said Sarah Wright, marketing
director for Surfree.com, a 5,000-employee Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuters also got the day off: With power off at many San
Francisco offices, there was no where to send data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stayed home and sketched,'' said Terry Colon, a
home-based computer illustrator for a Lycos Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Most large Silicon Valley Internet companies were unaffected
because they are bases south of the affected area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were missed,'' said Erin Schlough of Mountain View-based
Netscape Corp. Schlough said that if a power outage had hit the
Silicon Valley, the redundant nature of the Internet would kick in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies replicate their sites on other computers
located pretty much around the world,'' she said. ``Any traffic
that would come to us would be rerouted to those other machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Some saw Tuesday's outage as a sneak peek at the predicted
millennium computer snafu, or the ``YK2 problem,'' when some
computers supposedly will get lost in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must of been mentioned around here 20 times,'' Garrett
said. ``People were saying it's a dress rehearsal for Y2K. Very
scary.''

WOLFE NOVEL IS IN, THEN OUT, IN THE BONFIRE OF THE HIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does the speed of America's pop-culture machine leave you
feeling a bit behind the times? A step slow? Unhep to the latest
jive?
</P>
<P>
   If so, there's a good reason. For Those In The Know are
constantly deciding that the latest Hot Thing is now The Thing That
Was Formerly Hot. In fact, the thing that was once Hot is often
reclassified as Overhyped or _ heavens! _ Laughably Overrated
before you even dragged your out-of-touch rear end to the mall and
purchased whatever it is we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   What we're talking about is the latest tome by Tom Wolfe, ``A
Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $28.95). If you're just
getting around to purchasing one of the 1.2 million copies in its
mammoth first printing, then you are sooooo November '98. I mean,
that book is yesterday's ``Entertainment Tonight'' report.
Following is proof:
</P>
<P>
   July '98: ``Business Week'' notes that the publisher of the
yet-to-be-released novel changed the cover art _ from two men
clashing to a picture of the Atlanta skyline _ after Barnes &AMP; Noble
focus groups proclaimed that the original concept had ``too much
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   August '98: David Kamp, in a profile of Wolfe in ``Vanity
Fair,'' gets an advance read of the novel and proclaims it better
than Wolfe's 1987 novel, ``Bonfire of the Vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 15: ``A Man in Full'' is nominated for a prestigious
National Book Award, nearly a month before the book is released and
before review copies have been sent to most critics.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 2: Time magazine offers the first of many long, slow wet
kisses that the media will plant upon ``A Man in Full.'' In a cover
story, the magazine calls his novel ``bodacious'' and says it
proves he ``still has the right stuff.'' More praise follows in The
Washington Post, Newsweek and The New York Times, which saw fit to
print Michael Lewis' contention that ``The novel contains passages
as powerful and as beautiful as anything written not merely by
contemporary American novelists but by any American novelist.''
America pants.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7: The disquieting storm of the critical backlash begins to
rumble. Jacob Weisberg, writing in the online journal Slate, says
Wolfe infuses his tale ``with characteristic wit, verve, and
narrative propulsion.'' But Weisberg is disturbed by its lack of
heart, of decency, and he concludes that the book ``remains
sophisticated entertainment rather than literature.'' Those In The
Know take note.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 8: Star-Telegram books editor Larry Swindell has already
read the tea leaves, and in his largely favorable but appropriately
measured review of the book, he declares that it is ``already
overhyped and, I believe, already overrated.'' That same day,
taking its cue from the heartland, the Los Angeles Times says that
despite some ``brilliant riffs,'' the new novel has ``a great deal
of make-work writing and narrative padding.'' The reviewer says its
characters, ``(like) the bumper cars in a fun house ... collide
zanily, but they take us nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 10, 8:57 a.m.: Slate posts the first excerpt of an e-mail
exchange between ``Vanity Fair's'' Marjorie Williams and ``The
Washington Monthly's'' Timothy Noah debating the merits of ``A Man
in Full's'' ending, among other specific discussions about the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 10, 9 a.m.: The bookstores open. ``A Man in Full'' is
available for purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 18: Alice McDermott's ``Charming Billy,'' not Wolfe's book,
wins the National Book Award for fiction. From the dais, esteemed
novelist John Updike, who wrote a bruising review of ``A Man in
Full'' in ``The New Yorker,'' makes fun of Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Last week: ``The New Republic'' runs a rip-snorting, brutally
mocking review of the book, the first sentence of which is, ``Tom
Wolfe's novels are placards of simplicity.'' The reviewer, James
Wood, calls Wolfe's mind ``curiously unliterary'' and decries his
writing as ``... this bumptious simplicity, this toy-set of
literary codes essentially indistinguishable from the narrative
techniques of boys' comics. ... '' USA Today later says that ``A
Man in Full'' is both entertainment and literature, and all these
second-guessers should realize that, preparing us for the third
wave of Wolfe-ian discussion: the opinion that Those In The Know
were duped into believing that second round of negative criticism.
</P>
<P>
   This week: A reporter, preparing to describe how Tom Wolfe's
latest novel has been praised and dismissed to such an extent as to
make reading it superfluous, zips through 248 of its 742 pages
before deadline. He thinks it's ``pretty good,'' but he is
admittedly behind the times.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   NY-FINANCIAL-DISTRICT (New York) _ At 8:30 on a Saturday night,
the holiday shooting stars suspended above Nassau Street are aglow,
illuminating blocks of rolled-down aluminum security shutters.
There are no coffee shops still open, no magazine shops, no bars _
and even more strikingly _ there are no people. ``When I moved in
last February, there was supposed to be a grocery store coming,''
said Tracey White, looking back pointedly at the still-black
windows on the ground floor of her building, one of the new rental
conversions in the financial district. ``It's really dead.'' By
Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   BLECKNER-BENEFIT (New York) _ ``I never invite people over _
it's so anxiety-producing,'' Ross Bleckner said, contemplating the
imminent arrival of 120 guests, many of them uptown swells who had
paid $1,000 for the privilege of climbing six flights of stairs for
cocktails and dinner with the celebrated artist. An avowed recluse
who resists forays north of Union Square, Bleckner was the host of
a benefit last week for Community Research Initiative on AIDS in
the minimalist Xanadu that is his home, a former loft building that
he owns in TriBeCa. By Christopher Mason.

<P>
   TENEMENT-MUSEUM (New York) _ For the descendants of Abraham and
Fannie Rogarshevsky, history came between the dill pickles and the
corned beef sandwiches. Family memories, some of them coaxed over
lunch, have been vital in recreating the Rogarshevskys' vibrant,
three-room Orchard Street apartment, circa 1918, a permanent
exhibit at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. It is the fifth
apartment the museum has restored in its 1863 red-brick landmark
tenement. By Patricia Lee Brown.

</P>
<P>
   PALM-PILOT (Undated) _ What the Furby electronic pet is to the
single-digit set, the leather Palm Pilot case is to the adult
digital one: the hottest gift item of the season. Encasing the Palm
Pilot in lizard or saddle leather is part of the fervid culture
that has grown up around this digital record keeper, calendar,
address book and organizer. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   NY-WINTER-GARDEN (New York) _ After a visitor the clatter of
miniature electric trains and the Christmas tree with twinkle
lights that tickles the glass roof of the Enid Haupt Conservatory
came the moment of truth. ``It smells like winter out here,'' said
Ashali Bhandari, 7, of Manhattan. It should have: she was looking
at the winter solstice garden at the New York Botanical Garden in
the Bronx. By Mac Griswold.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   HIRING-A-DECORATOR (New York) _ ``Working with a decorator was
kind of like, `Whoa,''' said Amanda Sacks, who lives in a newly
decorated Victorian town house in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ``Because
I'd never actually worked with a decorator before.'' Ms. Sacks, age
9, said she thought the experience was a good one. ``I might choose
Chris again,'' she said, referring to future homes. ``If he's still
decorating.'' When Karen Sacks; her husband, Bradley; their
16-year-old daughter, Jilian, and their 9-year-old twins, Amanda
and Blaire, hired Christopher Coleman, a New York decorator, they
made it clear that they were all clients _ and available for
consultation. By William L. Hamilton.

   Jennifer Coolidge cut out the recipe for Texas Christmas pickles
from last year's pages. Her family loved them, but she lost the
recipe. Here it is again. The recipe came to us via Lori J.
Bennett, who entered it in a cooking contest we ran last year.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS CHRISTMAS PICKLES
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1 gallon
</P>
<P>
   1-gallon jar of dill pickles
</P>
<P>
   5-pound bag sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 small bottle Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Drain all juice from pickles and discard. Slice pickles
lengthwise and place in jar. Add Tabasco and garlic. Add about
one-third of the sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Screw lid back on jar tightly, so no juice will leak out. Gently
tip jar back and forth several times to allow sugar and spices to
mix with pickles. Leave on counter at room temperature for about a
week.
</P>
<P>
   As sugar dissolves, add more until all sugar is used. Gently tip
jar back and forth daily to allow sugar and spices to mix.
</P>
<P>
   When all sugar is absorbed, pickles with be dark-green and
crispy. Serve on deli platter with sliced vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per half-pickle: 35 calories, trace fat, 9
grams carbohydrates, trace protein, 0 cholesterol, 287 milligrams

TO FIELD A FIGHTING ROBOT, LEARN TO PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Building robots has always been a highly mechanical enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Articulating the joints. Adjusting the center of gravity.
Tinkering with different forms of locomotion. Getting all the cogs
and sensors to work in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about physical parts. That's why the archetypal sci-fi
robot seems paradoxical and silly. Androids have always been
symbols of the future, but they're just walking collections of
physical and electrical problems, relics of an era when the big
pressing questions were all about machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the big pressing questions are no longer about machines.
They're about information. So building robots seems anachronistic.
Unless you're building robots that live inside computers.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the Robot Club, which is ostensibly about building
machines but is really about software design. As the new kid in
town at Columbus High School, you meet a group of gearhead kids. To
join their clique, you have to build robots that accomplish an
increasingly complex series of tasks, from recycling bottles and
cans to spying on violations of hazardous-waste rules at the local
biotech corporation.
</P>
<P>
   A strong environmental thread runs through the whole story,
which is politically correct to a fault and horribly acted by
hammy, over-rouged teen-agers. But if you skip the egregious video
clips, the game play is brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   In the workshop, each robot begins as a stripped-down chassis
with empty slots for parts. From a collection of treads, wheels,
sensors, scoopers and weapons, you assemble the hardware. Then you
switch to the software and the fun begins because the whole thing
has to be programmed.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the real meat of the Robot Club game: giving the
robot the instructions it needs to accomplish its job.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a very simple, early mission, the robot has to
touch a flag and return to home base. The task breaks down into two
states: ``find flag'' and ``go home.''
</P>
<P>
   So after attaching a yellow sensor, a purple sensor and treads,
which move the robot, you drag the hardware icons onto a
point-and-click instruction box and program the robot: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ State No. 1: Find Flag.
</P>
<P>
   (a) Point to something yellow (the flag).
</P>
<P>
   (b) Turn on the treads.
</P>
<P>
   (c) If the robot is touching something yellow, then switch to
the task called ``go home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ State No. 2: Go Home.
</P>
<P>
   (a) Point to something purple (home base).
</P>
<P>
   (b) Turn on the treads. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You run the program. If it works, you go to the next mission. If
not, you debug it and try again. The first puzzle has just one part
and one command you can give that part (the learning curve is very
gentle).
</P>
<P>
   But as you progress, there are nearly 100 different parts, each
with its own set of commands. As the missions become more
elaborate, the programming becomes more complex as well. And there
isn't one right answer. Some solutions are more elegant than
others, but there is always a range of strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In Duel Mode, for instance, the goal is to disable another robot
before it disables you. The hardware options available include
grenade- and tennis-ball launchers, lasers, a force-field
generator, a crossbow, a cloaking device, pogo springs, hover pods
and a banana gun, all of which consume varying amounts of energy
and do varying amounts of short, medium and long-range damage. The
options are virtually limitless. It boils down to personal style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be very different strategies for successful
robots,'' said Luyen Chou, executive producer of the Robot Club.
``And they really tend to reflect people's personalities. Like some
people tend to always build really big dumb robots that just go
around and shoot a lot of stuff. And other people tend to build
robots that are very light and smart and fast and do a lot of
monitoring of their energy and hit points and a lot of tricky
stuff. And it's not clear which strategy is better. Sometimes the
big lumbering one tends to beat the smaller, smarter ones, and
sometimes it's the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to building robots out of code rather than wires
and rivets is that you can try it both ways. If your robot is
demolished, it can be reconfigured and reprogrammed in a matter of
minutes and sent back into the gladiator ring. You can experiment
more, learn through trial and error and perfect the kamikaze
force-field-and-banana-launcher strategy because mistakes are less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The other big advantage is that you can test your robot against
everyone else's robots on the Internet. If you go to the Robot Club
Web site (www.southpeak.com/games/kids/ robotclub), you can upload
the robots you've built, download the robots other people have
built and watch them duke it out on screen. Code to code. Flare gun
to liquid squirter. May the best robot win. If it happens to be
yours, there are bragging rights. Your robot becomes the machine to
beat. If you lose, build a better 'bot.
</P>
<P>
   This looks and feels like a video game. But essentially, it is a
programming competition. ``But we never tell anyone that,'' Chou
said. ``Because if you tell them that, it's an immediate turn-off.
We get a lot of people who were never into programming, but they
love the idea of dueling someone.''
</P>
<P>
   These virtual machines aren't robots in the 1950s
science-fiction sense. But in a way, they are the ultimate robots
because they are pure programming. And programming is the only
thing that distinguishes a robot from a run-of-the-mill machine.
The reality of robots is factory work. But the robot of popular
imagination is a machine that shows signs of intelligent life, not
a machine that methodically sucks the air out of vacuum-packed
grocery items.

   Things like Web crawlers, intelligent agents and artificial life
forms _ automata that have shed their electromechanical coils _ are
much closer to our idea of ``robot'' than the real robots. Virtual
machines that do the tedious work of gathering data, updating
files, tidying up our hard drives, fetching and carrying
information, and catering to our whims _ these are the heirs of our
sci-fi imagination.

   For those who who have failed to be caught up in the ballroom
dancing boom sweeping people back off their feet, the World Wide
Web may offer salvation. A new Library of Congress Web site allows
users to lace up their dancing shoes and learn steps for the waltz,
the Charleston, and the fox trot _ with no need to endure the
self-conscious awkwardness that marked many of those old school-gym
dance classes.
</P>
<P>
   The site, An American Ballroom Companion: Dance Instruction
Manuals Circa 1490-1920, memory.loc.gov/ammem/dihtml/dihome.html is
a collection of over 200 social dance manuals covering etiquette,
technique, and dance history.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes some anti-dance treatises. The
chronological series begins with a rare fifteenth-century source
for the basse danse, a Burgundian court dance, continues through
clog dances, waltzes, and ballet, and ends in the ragtime era.
</P>
<P>
   ``This site provides an opportunity for people interested in
dance to look at rare material not available in most local
libraries.'' said Elizabeth Aldrich, a dance historian and
choreographer, who served as a consultant on the project.
</P>
<P>
   A special feature in the works is 80 video demonstrations of
assorted historic dances. The dance demonstrations are set to music
and provided as links at relevant places in the dance descriptions,
as well as through a video directory. The video clips, each lasting
about a minute, include close-up tutorials for particular steps.
There are also selections from a reconstructed 1890s ballroom
performance in the Library's Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And what about those with two left feet? Not to worry, said
Vicki Risner, a dance specialist at the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wants to learn how to dance can do so,'' she said.
``Recreational dancers are raving about this site, because it gives
them a whole new repertoire.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout the site are rich and entertaining nuggets
of dance culture like ``Tips to dancers,'' a 1918 dissertation on
ball-room gentility by V. Persis Dewey. Among his subjects, Dewey
describes the evils of the ``ballroom snob,'' who is ``grossly
conceited'' and does ``underhanded things in the dance hall.''
</P>
<P>
   T. A. Faulkner, in the anti-dance polemic ``From the Ballroom to
Hell,'' asks: ``Did you ever know a lady who danced to excess to
live to be over twenty-five years of age? If she does she is, in
most instances, broken in health physically and morally. Doctors
claim it to be a most harmful exercise physically for both sexes
... Is there any wonder that so many women of today are
unhealthy?''
</P>
<P>
   For those who feel the music, or at least wish they did, the web
offers other resources that cater to dancers of all kinds and every
experience level. The U.S. Swing Dance Server, 
simon.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/aswin/swingdancing/swingdancing.htm
l, offers swing music, essays on proper dance technique, and Arthur
Murray-style dance instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors may order swing videos, enter chat rooms designed for
swing-lovers, or simply peruse the latest swing news.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, ``Dancing for Busy People,'' www.henge.com/calvin,
has instructions for an array of dances, including contradancing,
square dancing and quadrilles. The site also has listings of
national dance events and articles about dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing has arrived on the world wide web. So log on, adjust the
volume, grab a partner and tango the night away.

FRENCH HONOR TEXANS FOR WORLD WAR I SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ To the French, they were ``Sammies,'' the young
men of the American Expeditionary Force who brought the promise of
ending the bloody stalemate that engulfed Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, more than 80 years after the Armistice ended World
War I, the French awarded two aging veterans from Texas that
nation's highest decoration _ the Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Brig. Gen. Albert Crowther and retired Pvt. William
Martin of San Antonio received the medal from Francois Bujon de
l'Estang, the French ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is in frail health, Alfred Rihn of Lytle, Texas, will
be presented the same medal at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the ceremony was held against a backdrop of two World
War I-era ambulances in the U.S. Army Medical Department Museum at
Fort Sam Houston.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac decided to mark the 80th
anniversary of the signing of the Armistice by conferring the
Legion of Honor on all surviving Allied veterans of the 1914-1918
war.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador said France lost 1.3 million men in ``a
devastating war.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States came to France's aid, Bujon said, by sending
more than 2 million soldiers, called Sammies by the French people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French have not forgotten the courage of these young
soldiers,'' the ambassador told about 100 military personnel,
family and friends of the two recipients. ``This underscores the
friendship that has existed between the U.S. and France for over
200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bujon stood before each man, affixed the medal and red ribbon on
their lapels and said, in French, ``In the name of the president of
the Republic and by virtue of the powers vested in me, we hereby
make you a knight of the Legion of Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bujon said it had taken an enormous effort by the
French Embassy and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to trace
and locate surviving American veterans of what had once been called
``the war to end all wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legion of Honor, with the rank of ``chevalier,'' or knight,
will be given to all surviving Allied veterans who served in France
prior to Nov. 11, 1918, the day the Armistice was signed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 veterans from the Allied forces _ including
soldiers from Britain, France and the United States _ have been
identified as eligible to receive the medal.
</P>
<P>
   Crowther, 100, enlisted in the Texas Militia in 1916. He served
with Battery A, Second Texas Field Artillery, in France. He
remained in the Army and served in Italy during World War II. He
said he was greatly honored to receive the medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given by a nation of people that I admire,'' the retired
banker said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 103, was born in Fayetteville, Texas. He enlisted in the
Army in July 1918 as a private with the 815th Pioneer Infantry.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge in August 1919, Martin went to work at the
Magnolia Ice Cream factory in Houston. He also worked on his own
farm before joining the United Gas Company in San Antonio.

ITS NOT YOUR FATHER'S ENCYCLOPEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of computer-based reference products is changing.
First came the shrink-wrapped boxes with a CD-ROM or two inside.
Now that is old hat.
</P>
<P>
   The big reference products on store shelves these days are
``suites,'' products that begin with an encyclopedia and add a
dictionary, to look up the words in the encyclopedia that you don't
understand; an atlas, to locate a place you're reading about; an
almanac, for the kind of statistics an encyclopedia does not
generally have, and a variety of other tools, like a thesaurus or a
book of quotations. And all the suites have links to the Web for
updating or supplementing information. Five CD-ROM's are now par
for the course. Some suites also throw in speech recognition
software, which can be helpful if it doesn't drive you crazy first.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers in computer stores may find big displays of suites in
the next few weeks, and these will probably continue in January,
aimed at all the people who got new hardware over the holidays.
(And when you install a suite, it will immediately make your
enormous new hard drive seem considerably smaller.)
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the suites are unpredictable and are likely to be
discounted sharply. These products tend to be what the computer
stores use as ``loss leaders'' to lure traffic, so shoppers may
find one brand or another available for nearly nothing. (Owners of
previous encyclopedia-only versions of the Grolier and IBM products
have to buy an entire suite, including the encyclopedia, to get the
add-ons; only Microsoft sells its package of encyclopedia add-ons,
called Microsoft Bookshelf, separately for around $50.)
</P>
<P>
   The magic to the suites _ if they work well _ is the
integration, the way a computer links the components together to
make access easy. But putting all these books on the computer has
some drawbacks. I have always found magic in the books themselves,
like the copy of ``Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'' that my Aunt
Leona gave me when I graduated from high school. It occupies a fat
space on my bookshelf, and it's nice to leaf through. On the other
hand, my printed copy is the 14th edition, copyrighted in 1968, and
unless I graduate from high school again, I don't think anybody is
going to give me a newer one. And the electronic version is easier
to search.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating something as big as an encyclopedia suite is
necessarily a job of sampling, not fully digesting. For spot-checks
of three of the biggest, I borrowed some homework assignments from
Cabin John Middle School, in Potomac, Md.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1999 WORLD BOOK FAMILY REFERENCE SUITE, WITH VIA VOICE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (IBM; $69.99 before $30 rebate; Windows 95 and 98.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The software for the 1999 World Book Family Reference Suite
asserts ownership over your computer, unpacking itself into your
startup group so its cluster of four icons sits smack in the middle
of your desktop. It also takes over your hard drive: the suite,
three CD's in all, requires 16 megabytes of RAM, 39 megabytes of
hard drive space plus 8 megabytes for online access. The Via Voice
speech-recognition feature, for which a headset microphone is
included, requires 32 megabytes of RAM and another 64 megabytes of
hard drive space.
</P>
<P>
   World Book's layout is clear and intuitive, which is
particularly useful for children and their bewildered parents. To
test the suite's linked features, I looked up E.coli, a usually
innocuous bacterium used for genetic research; one type of E.coli
can sicken or kill people who eat undercooked beef.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary, the Merriam-Webster Reference Library, gave me a
56-word definition and added a paragraph on Theodor Escherich, the
eponym of the bug, which is more formally referred to as
Escherichia coli. (If you had a reference suite, you could also
look up eponym.) The encyclopedia pulled up an article on genetic
engineering and helpfully put ``E.coli'' in red. The Information
Please almanac returned a one-page list of headlines from August
1997, including one about Hudson Foods' announcement that it would
sell a processing plant in Nebraska after beef from there was found
to be tainted by E.coli and a four-page entry for October that said
a federal jury in Omaha was investigating Hudson. (It meant grand
jury, not federal jury.)
</P>
<P>
   Search for a single word, and the software will highlight it in
each article where it appears (although E.coli was not highlighted
in the almanac.) There are functions that allow you to use a
highlighter and paste notes into the text and a ``homework wizard''
that helps organize reports. I think that might make homework a
little too easy and would certainly encourage a greater reliance on
the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Installation was a headache. My home computer, a Dell Dimension
350-megahertz machine, crashed every time I tried to install Via
Voice. It accepted the Information Please almanac at one point but
wouldn't give me access to it later. Clicking on the encyclopedia
icon on the desktop sometimes got me into the encyclopedia and
sometimes did not; on those occasions, it was necessary to close
the icon box and call it up again from the Start menu.
</P>
<P>
   So I tried again at work, on a 300-megahertz Compaq Deskpro. At
the Via Voice step, I got an error message: ``Please select or
conform the correct folder where WB99 is installed or exit setup
and install WB99 first.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm no conformist, but leaving aside the diction error in the
error message, I called customer support. After a 65-minute toll
call, I was told to scan the disk for errors but found none. But
somehow Via Voice installed properly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't worth the effort, though. I went through the 10-minute
training exercise, reading words on the screen aloud so the
computer could get used to my pronunciation, and then I grabbed a
copy of the newspaper and read in a paragraph to see how Via Voice
would do. I read: ``MINNEAPOLIS _ The marksmen gulped a hasty
dinner of pasta and salad before preparing to spend a chilly night
stalking their quarry.'' Via Voice heard: ``Minneapolis of marks
and helped a hasty diner of pasta and salad before preparing to
spend a chilly night stocking their quarry.''
</P>
<P>
   I also tried ad-libbing: ``Good morning. Today is Wednesday, and
I have a lot of work to do today.'' It wrote, ``Bad morning today a
news Wednesday and I have a lot of work to do to them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1999 GROLIER MULTIMEDIA REFERENCE SUITE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Grolier Interactive; $89.99 before $30 rebate; Windows 3.1 and
later, and NT. &LR; )
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Grolier Interactive Suite is the king of the
name-droppers, with Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, the Hammond
Atlas of the World, the Wall Street Journal 1998 Almanac all
included. And as an awkward inducement to register the suite,
Grolier has also thrown in access to The New York Times Book of
Science Questions and Answers, already on the disk.
</P>
<P>
   The suite also includes access to the online Encyclopedia
Americana, aimed at college students, and The New Book of
Knowledge, and it comes packaged with a small hardcover book, ``How
to Improve Your Grammar and Usage,'' by Mark Rowh. A paperback book
of quizzes and other activities is also included.
</P>
<P>
   The encyclopedia itself produced a definition of E.coli, a
diagram of recombinant DNA, for which E. coli's DNA is often used,
and entries on bacteria, Escherichia, food poisoning and infection,
and meat and meatpacking.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the marquee names, Grolier is the most basic of the
encyclopedias mentioned here, geared toward younger children. The
Grolier package is not integrated; it is more like buying a shelf
of books, not all of which are geared to the same age group as the
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's on line has advantages over the printed version. It
offers chronological browsing of all quotations, or searches by
keyword, author, topic, date or source. There was nothing under
``coli,'' but under ``bacterial'' I found a 1948 snatch of poetry
by Theodore Roethke, who wrote that he studied ``the lives on a
leaf,'' including ``bacterial creepers.''
</P>
<P>
   The printed Bartlett's was always great for browsing, and I
enjoyed this new edition (the 16th, with multimedia add-ons),
including gems that may not turn out to be enduring, like one from
Gene (Eugene Wesley) Roddenberry, 1921-1991: Space _ the final
frontier ... These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other recent classics, like ``I am not a crook''
(Richard Nixon, Nov. 11, 1973). Newer ones, like ``I did not have
sexual relations with that woman,'' await a future edition.
</P>
<P>
   The disk also has a timeline that includes Alfred E. Newman and
Uncle Sam, of the World War I recruiting poster. And this being
multimedia, Bartlett's on a disk also offers sound clips of ``La
Marseillaise'' (1792, the timeline informs me), video clips of
Nixon's 1952 Checkers speech, Willie Mays' famous over-the-shoulder
catch during the World Series in 1954 and the O.J. Simpson car
chase of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal Almanac divides itself into 10
categories, including Year in Review, Politics and Policy, the
United States Economy and Money and Investing. None found E.coli. A
search under ``bacteria'' found some articles on cloning in the
Year in Review section. The Living in America section came up with
an article on slowing the progress of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammond Atlas of the World is actually an atlas plus a small
almanac, with statistics on population, migration and other
subjects. I didn't bother asking for E.coli but went straight to
the unrelated Ekoli. It found the name and jumped to a map of the
country, but not one big enough to show that town.
</P>
<P>
   The Grolier suite is a good choice for families with young
children or for an adult who really wants a digital copy of the
Bartlett's or Hammond and doesn't mind an encyclopedia thrown in.
But as a reference tool for adults, Grolier is not in the same
league as World Book or Encarta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENCARTA REFERENCE SUITE 99 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Microsoft; $79.99; Windows 95 and 98, and NT.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's entry into the encyclopedia suite market is another
space hog: 28 megabytes for the encyclopedia, 40 MB for the search
function (based on queries written in ordinary language), 17 MB for
the text-to-speech engine, 15 MB for the speech-recognition engine,
72 MB for Virtual Globe 99, 5 megabytes for Bookshelf 99, 4
megabytes for the Research Organizer and 15 megabytes for ``shared
system components,'' for a total of 196 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The program boots itself when you put the first of five CD's
into the drive. The encyclopedia gave a brief mention of E.coli and
linked to a detailed discussion of bacteria in general; Virtual
Globe located Ekoli, which is in Congo, and was ready to give me
extensive facts and figures on Congo and its latitude, longitude
and distances to other locations, but it, of course, had no
geographical references on E.coli. Microsoft Bookshelf _ nine
reference books, including a dictionary, a book of quotations and a
timeline _ is on a separate disk and required a separate search. It
defined E.coli, pronounced it for me and found a definition of
travelers' diarrhea that included E. coli and a chart on the
taxonomy of life.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are in the encyclopedia and open the CD-ROM drive to
put in the Bookshelf disk, the program warns you to put the
encyclopedia disk back. Click on Bookshelf and it warns, ``Unable
to find Bookshelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookshelf opens with a new word and quotations each time: a
brief inspiration before you begin to search. The timeline lists
the Hudson Foods incident and lists five discoveries made using
E.coli.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta's linking of information is helpful, but the results can
be weird. Use the dictionary to look up ``Jeremiad,'' for example,
and then turn to the timeline for information on the prophet
Jeremiah, and the adjacent entries on the timeline choices will
include Jeremiah Dixon (Mason's partner in drawing the line that
divides North from South); ``Jeremiah Johnson,'' a 1972 movie, and
Jeremiah M. Johnson, Secretary of Agriculture in President Benjamin
Harrison's Cabinet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The speech software in Microsoft's package did not strike me, a
competent typist, as worth the trouble. I asked it to look for
Cleveland, by spelling out the word letter-by-letter, and it simply
refused to get the last letter, trying, in turn, b, g, e and t. My
12-year-old son (who won't use the Mavis Beacon typing tutor
program I bought him, but that's a different story) would benefit
from speech software, but it couldn't understand him at all. He
tried to ask for information on the Crusades, and the response was
``crusiogaa can't be found.'' It's easier to learn to type.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three reference suites reviewed here, Encarta is easily
the slickest. From an unpromising foundation (Funk &AMP; Wagnalls
Encyclopedia, to be precise), Microsoft has built a huge research
tool, one loaded with graphics and animation. Encarta often comes
bundled with new computers, but it's a sensible investment on its
own.

<P>
   The punch bowl is the genteel dowager of the cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet enough she is, but hardly a room-stopper. A little
neglected, a little tired, she is the obligatory guest who must be
invited every year.
</P>
<P>
   But with just a soupcon of imagination, that dowager can be
turned into Carmen Miranda. Think of punch as the centerpiece,
instead of the afterthought, and let the little lady make a
statement at your soiree.
</P>
<P>
   Start with unusual containers instead of the mundane, low-slung
models with the prissy little glasses. Think of big jars, oversize
mixing bowls, huge vases. Clear containers are best for displaying
jewellike colors.
</P>
<P>
   Then go wild with the fruit. Vibrant and aromatic, peaches and
pineapples, mangoes and melons add life and movement to the whole
scene. And, you can eat the decorations the next day.

   NY-FINANCIAL-DISTRICT (New York) _ At 8:30 on a Saturday night,
the holiday shooting stars suspended above Nassau Street are aglow,
illuminating blocks of rolled-down aluminum security shutters.
There are no coffee shops still open, no magazine shops, no bars _
and even more strikingly _ there are no people. ``When I moved in
last February, there was supposed to be a grocery store coming,''

   BLECKNER-BENEFIT (New York) _ ``I never invite people over _

cocktails and dinner with the celebrated artist. An avowed recluse
who resists forays north of Union Square, Bleckner was the host of

lunch, have been vital in recreating the Rogarshevskys' vibrant,
three-room Orchard Street apartment, circa 1918, a permanent
exhibit at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. It is the fifth

 &HT;    Industry concedes its price structures hard to understand
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey and Kay Powell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think car prices are confusing, consider funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a single sheet of charges that can be pasted on a
window, most funeral homes have pages of prices for everything from
refrigerating the body to scattering the ashes in the North Georgia
mountains. When you buy a car, you buy a car. When you buy a
funeral, you're buying a matrix of goods, services and intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not retailers; we're professionals. As an industry, we
haven't done a very good job of explaining our pricing,'' says
Kelly Smith, public relations director for the National Funeral
Directors Association, a trade group based near Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Take caskets. Funeral directors have traditionally sold caskets
at a high markup to recoup other costs associated with maintaining
expensive vehicles and real estate. The industry started
re-evaluating its price structures in the 1980s when the Federal
Trade Commission enacted a rule requiring mortuaries to disclose
charges for goods such as caskets and services such as embalming.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC rule also meant that for the first time consumers could
meaningfully compare prices. This year, Woody Bates, a retired
Coca-Cola marketing executive and member of the Memorial Society of
Georgia, spent weeks driving around metro Atlanta collecting price
lists from more than 100 funeral homes. He found that chain-owned
establishments, in general, have higher prices than independents,
charging a basic service fee that averaged $300 more. The findings
concur with surveys in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   Service Corp. International, the largest chain, counters that
its average funeral in the United States costs $4,821, less than
$50 above the national average as computed by the funeral directors
association. Besides, says SCI executive Glenn McMillen, price
surveys oversimplify the picture. They don't take into account
package deals, and they make no allowance for the higher level of
service one expects at a carriage-trade funeral home such as H.M.
Patterson &AMP; Son, SCI's best-known Atlanta property, where
``Preferred Tradition'' packages run from $9,985 to $24,425.
</P>
<P>
   ``In life,'' McMillen says, ``you still get pretty much what you
pay for.''

 &HT;    THe vocabulary of the death

<TEXT>
<P>
   Funeral speak
</P>
<P>
   Undertakers are famous for their euphemisms. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Cover charge. Somewhat irreverent industry slang for the basic
service fee funeral directors list under the government-required
itemization of charges.
</P>
<P>
   Cremains. The pulverized bones _ not really ashes _ left after
cremation.
</P>
<P>
   Floral tribute. Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Interment space. Grave.
</P>
<P>
   Inurnment. Putting the cremains into an urn.
</P>
<P>
   Earth. What the grave is filled with. Never dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Loved ones. Survivors _ also known as the people who pick up the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the interment space. Digging a grave.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing the body. Embalming.
</P>
<P>
   Removal. Taking away a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Succession planning. Selling out to a chain, referring to a
major reason independent funeral homes change hands: Junior doesn't
want to be a mortician.

<P>
   A muckraker among morticians
</P>
<P>
   About the time Waltrip and SCI began reshaping the funeral
business, a writer was finishing a book that would reshape the
public's perception of it. Jessica Mitford, a feisty Briton with
leftist political leanings, did for undertakers what Upton Sinclair
had done for meatpackers with her 1963 muckraking best-seller,
``The American Way of Death.'' She was working on an update when
she died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every family that a funeral director has met with in the past
35 years has brought a conventional wisdom informed by that text,''
laments Lynch, the undertaker author.
</P>
<P>
   Mitford portrayed funeral directors as self-appointed shamen who
took advantage of grieving survivors when they were most vulnerable
and least likely to compare prices. She found embalming ghoulish
and argued that direct cremation was preferable to pumping a corpse
full of arterial fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was partially right,'' Lynch concedes. ``When you have a
dead body on the floor that happens to be someone you were married
to for 50 years, it's hard to let your fingers do the walking.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's main response to Mitford's critique has been to
sell prepaid funerals that allow customers to make choices and lock
in prices before they need an undertaker. Billions of dollars worth
of funerals have been arranged in this manner. Consumer's Digest
and other watchdog groups discourage prepaying because many plans
are nonrefundable and nontransferable, not to mention mediocre
investments. Still, consumers seem to take comfort in pre-need
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Another response to Mitford's criticisms has come from outside
the industry. Memorial societies _ co-ops in which people band
together to buy low-cost funeral services from selected mortuaries
_ have spread nationwide and now count more than 500,000 members.
The Memorial Society of Georgia has 7,000, twice as many as five
years ago. One group in California has gone so far as to assist
families in caring for and burying their own dead _ the ultimate
do-it-yourself project.
</P>
<P>
   While the vast majority of society members plan to be cremated,
there are exceptions. One is Sandy Whittington, the woman with the
coffin in her attic.
</P>
<P>
   The divorced mother of three didn't want to be a bother to her
children, two of whom live far away, so she decided to make her own
arrangements. A local funeral home quoted a price of $7,000.
Sticker-shocked, she joined the Memorial Society instead. But when
she went to one of the mortuaries the society did business with and
asked to see the casket used in the low-cost burial, the funeral
director showed her a cloth-covered coffin and said, ``Perhaps your
family wouldn't be embarrassed to see you in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The society was outraged and did not renew its contract with
that funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Whittington _ an enthusiastic history buff _
heard about some carpenters who made 19th-century reproduction
coffins. She ordered a pinch-toed pine box with raised panels and a
cross on top for $800 from Bert and Bud's Vintage Coffins of
Murray, Ky. Then she went back to the first funeral home and told
it exactly what kind of modest rites she wanted. It kept a copy of
her wishes on file _ no money down _ and she gave copies to her
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told everyone that if they want to send flowers, do it
now so I can smell them,'' Whittington says.
</P>
<P>
   Cremains of the day
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of cremation, funeral directors have noticed that
fewer families are having bodies embalmed and displayed at a
service. It's as if disposal of the remains and memorialization of
the life are beginning to diverge in the public mind. No example
demonstrates the trend better than the death of Jessica Mitford.
</P>
<P>
   After the writer died of brain cancer, her body was cremated and
her ashes cast upon the Pacific Ocean, near her Berkeley, Calif.,
home. It was the simplest of committals.
</P>
<P>
   The memorials were another matter. Mitford's friends and
admirers gathered to honor her in San Francisco, Martha's Vineyard
and London, where the theater rental alone cost thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the splashiest memorial is still to come. Her followers in
Northern California are planning to build a co-op funeral center,
with a crematory and a cemetery that doesn't allow caskets, vaults
or tombstones, like some modern-day Indian burial ground. The
centerpiece will be the Jessica Mitford Memorial Theater, a public
hall where people can hold anything from commemorative services to
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   They may even make it a chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at developing other sites,'' says Karen Leonard,
who heads the Redwood Memorial Society and was Mitford's research
assistant on the new edition of her book (which was published in
August). ``The Grateful Dead wants to help us with fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mitford's request, Leonard sent her crematory bill of about
$500 to SCI headquarters, suggesting that the company pay it in
light of all the publicity she had given it over the years. The
request was predictably ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But the folks in Houston haven't completely disregarded
Mitford's passing. She visited the funeral museum shortly before
her death, Leonard says, and was soured by the way the industry
portrayed itself as ``God's headwaiters.'' Now it's the industry's
turn. In the museum, there's a display of memorial bulletins from
recent celebrity funerals: Frank Sinatra, Roy Rogers, Barry
Goldwater _ and, yes, Jessica Mitford, 1917-1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't discriminate,'' says Boetticher, a smile buried
somewhere beneath his solemn expression.

 &HT;    The American way of death, once a bastion of tradition, is
changing as people reconsider their final rites
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night last year, Sandy Whittington stretched out on her
living room floor in Douglasville(Ga.) and instructed her
disbelieving son to take her measurements. Two months later, it
arrived: a casket in a packing crate labeled ``Coffin _ Empty.''
She had it hauled to the attic, where it holds out-of-season
clothes and waits for the inevitable day that awaits us all.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't terminally ill; at 60, the Veterans Administration
retiree seems livelier than some people half her age. She was
simply appalled at the cost of a traditional funeral and decided to
do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want to be embalmed,'' she allows. ``I have a fear of
being buried alive, and I figure if you aren't dead when you get to
the funeral home, you'll sure be dead by the time you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   While few people keep mail-order caskets in the attic,
Whittington's desire to take charge of her funeral is indicative of
something larger. The American way of death is changing as a
growing number of people, for a variety of reasons, rethink their
final rites.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative funerals are on the rise. Retail casket dealers
(such as metro Atlanta's first, Peachtree Caskets Direct in
Alpharetta(Ga.)) are opening shop. Cremation, once a rarity, now
figures in almost a quarter of the nation's 2.3 million deaths a
year. Personal touches and quirky tributes are turning up in
services everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost revolutionary, what's happening,'' says Kelly
Smith of the National Funeral Directors Association. His favorite
new-era funeral story? He met a mechanic in a bar who told him
about a buddy of his who was buried with cigarettes, Zippo lighters
and the latest issue of Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same forces that have altered America have altered
funerals: mobility, consumerism, the splintering of families and
organized religion. Add to those the growing informality of
American society, which seems to be bringing the spirit of an Irish
wake to many funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of what we respond to in funerals is more or less
fashion,'' says Thomas Lynch, a Michigan funeral director who wrote
a poetic memoir of his profession called ``The Undertaking: Life
Studies From the Dismal Trade.'' As he sees it, funerals used to be
about security: dark-suited men who sold protective-seal caskets
and sturdy vaults. Now the watchword is choice: colorful caskets,
eulogies from friends, ashes scattered at sunset, memorial services
where the loved one might not be present but his barbecue grill or
her favorite stuffed animal might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rolling our own rituals,'' Lynch says.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral museum
</P>
<P>
   The funeral as we know it _ with an embalmed corpse propped in a
shiny casket under the soft glow of a mortuary torchier _ did not
become the standard until early this century. Before then, bodies
stayed home and went swiftly into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Laderman, an Emory University(Ga.) religion professor,
illustrates the transition in his book ``The Sacred Remains'' by
comparing the funerals of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
The first president was buried quickly and memorialized nationwide
at processions in which symbolic empty coffins were carried. The
mourning for Abe was more literal; the 16th president's body was
embalmed and touched up repeatedly as hundreds of thousands of
citizens viewed it during an 11-day train journey back to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War was the turning point, as undertakers followed
soldiers into the field to preserve their bodies for shipment home.
By the late 1800s, Laderman writes, ``Funeral directors became the
new priests who presided over the corpse.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation from undertaker to mortician to funeral
director is lovingly documented at the National Museum of Funeral
History, an obscure assemblage of Americana packed away in an
office park building in the northern suburbs of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Open since 1993, the museum has a dazzling collection of vintage
hearses and bizarre caskets, such as the custom-made triple-wide
that a Colorado couple ordered after their son died. (In their
grief, they planned to join him in repose by committing suicide but
changed their minds.) There are displays of embalming equipment,
exhibits on mourning customs and, just arrived, the eternal flame
that burned over John F. Kennedy's grave until it was replaced last
year. It would all seem dreadfully gloomy if it weren't for the
jaunty big band music coming from the speakers _ toe-tappers like
Louis Armstrong's ``I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal
You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to feel upbeat when they leave here,'' laughs
museum president Bob Boetticher, a funeral director for 33 years.
(Who said undertakers don't have a sense of humor?)
</P>
<P>
   Boetticher has a special affection for the Victorian era, when
funeral rituals reached full blossom. He knows that pallbearers a
century ago donned gray gloves and that girls were given dolls
dressed in black because even toys should look sad in a time of
mourning. On weekends, the director haunts antiques shops looking
for cast-off funeraria. Sometimes he dresses up like an old-time
undertaker and trots out one of the museum's horse-drawn hearses
for parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew that death was part of life back then,''
Boetticher says. ``They didn't deny it. They took it seriously. Now
when someone dies, it's, `I gotta get back to work.'
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs. ``I was born in the wrong era.''
</P>
<P>
   The big business of death
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's lobby, there's a bust depicting a jowly man who
may be the most important figure in the funeral industry today.
He's Robert L. Waltrip, founder and chairman of Houston-based
Service Corp. International, the world's largest funeral company.
The bust? He founded the museum, too.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip started his company in 1962 with two local funeral homes
that had been in his family for decades. Now SCI owns 3,370
mortuaries, 430 cemeteries and 180 crematories in 18 countries.
It's one of three public corporations _ the Loewen Group of British
Columbia and Stewart Enterprises of New Orleans are the others _
that have become the talk of the industry for bringing merger and
acquisition to what had been a mom and pop enterprise. Together,
they own almost 15 percent of the nation's 21,900 funeral homes,
accounting for almost a quarter of all funerals.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know a chain mortuary to look at it. When SCI
purchases a property such as H.M. Patterson &AMP; Son, the blue-blood
Atlanta funeral home it bought in 1993, the name and much of the
staff remain the same. The changes occur out of view. SCI assembles
clusters of properties so it can centralize accounting,
transportation and in some cases embalming.
</P>
<P>
   Some have called SCI the McDonald's of death. Glenn McMillen,
senior vice president of operations, dislikes the analogy. ``The
funeral business just doesn't lend itself to a chain operation,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   The McDeath tag doesn't fit for another reason. Unlike the
burger biz, where competition and economies of scale keep prices
down, the opposite often seems to happen with funerals. Price
surveys in city after city have shown that charges at
chain-operated mortuaries usually are among the highest. In
Houston, a survey by KPRC-TV and the Interfaith Funeral Information
Committee, a consumer group out of Arizona, found that 16 of the 20
most expensive funeral homes were owned by the Big Three
consolidators. (SCI disputes the impression left by such surveys;
see accompanying story.)
</P>
<P>
   Rabun Smith, a longtime funeral director in Warner Robins, has
seen the issue from both sides _ as an independent and as an SCI
employee. In 1988, nearing retirement, he sold the
Christopher-Smith Funeral Home to a chain that was later absorbed
by SCI. He stayed with the business for five years, but didn't like
what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in here and almost doubled prices,'' he says. ``If
they keep buying up funeral homes, which seems to be their
intention, heaven help us.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as his contract with SCI was up, Smith opened a new
business, the Heritage Memorial Funeral Home, to compete with the
one that still bears his name. A funny thing happened, he says.
``The other people's prices came back down.''

TOASTING A DOG'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't know what to buy that hard-to-please dog or cat on your
Christmas list this year?
</P>
<P>
   Consider Champ-Pagne, a Canadian spring water developed by
Milwaukee entrepreneur Chuck Christ. Packaged like real champagne,
Champ-Pagne costs from $5.99 to $9.99 a bottle and is meant,
according to the Associated Press story, ``to let the victorious
dog or cat toast achievements in style.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question here is: Exactly what achievements are we
talking about?
</P>
<P>
   One could argue, of course, that anybody who would blow $10 on a
bottle of water for a dog or cat might have trouble tying his or
her shoes, let alone evaluating the achievements of a pet.
</P>
<P>
   But let us assume that there are legitimate reasons for buying
this product, other than making Chuck Christ a rich man or
hastening the day that America collapses into a black hole of
self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   As I am writing this, I am being serenaded by the snores of my
pug dog, Buster, whose idea of achievement is to polish off two
bowls of food before curling up for a much-needed 21-hour nap.
Buster would probably enjoy Champ-Pagne, assuming a way could be
found for him to drink it and sleep at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another problem: Most dogs and cats are much too
busy to waste time on victory celebrations. If given a choice
between sniffing another dog's butt or toasting success with a
raised flute of Champ-Pagne, a dog will take the butt every time.
</P>
<P>
   Not being a cat person, I can't really say how a cat would react
to Champ-Pagne. My guess is that your typical cat would be fairly
unimpressed unless the drink were served with a dead-bird
appetizer. Or it might wait until you're out of the house buying
the Champ-Pagne and then steal your stereo. But I could be wrong
because, like I said, I'm not a cat person.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that an achievement that warrants Champ-Pagne
for one pet might only warrant three-day-old puddle water for
another. (Assuming there is a difference. Besides not being a
cat-person, I am also not a designer-water person.)
</P>
<P>
   For dogs like Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin, finding people buried in
mine-shaft cave-ins or rescuing children on the brink of a
waterfall is all in a day work. For other dogs (Buster, for
example), raising an eyelid is a major accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is generally conceded that pets are much better able to
manipulate their owners than the other way around, it is easy to
see how an occasional reward of Champ-Pagne for a job well done
could turn into a $1,000-a-week bottled-spring-water habit.
</P>
<P>
   A dog that once expected nothing for fetching your slippers is
now pawing at the liquor cabinet simply because it stole only one
of two pork chops off your plate.
</P>
<P>
   Which goes back to my earlier contention that a pet's idea of a
victory might be far different than yours. A dog that goes a day
without digging a hole in your back yard deep enough to bury
Santa's toy bag may feel quite proud of its accomplishment whereas
you might see it as nothing more than a temporary reprieve from the
animal shelter.
</P>
<P>
   A pet that derives wicked satisfaction from watching you blow
your kid's college tuition money on Champ-Pagne may become sullen
and resentful once the novelty wears off and it realizes that the
whole rigmarole is over nothing more than ... water.
</P>
<P>
   A fancy bottle is nice, but you've got to think that most pets
would prefer a nice, meaty steak bone or, in the case of cats, a
nice pile of squirrel entrails that have been left out in the sun
for few days.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that some pets wouldn't appreciate a few
fingers of Champ-Pagne with their canned horse snouts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm thinking of knocking back a bottle with Buster if
and when he wakes up.
</P>

THE SEARCH FOR THE DISCOUNT CHRISTMAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; While those paid-full-price shoppers are still in
their jammies making coffee, bargain hunters are already stalking
their prey.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite as bad as predawn shopping by flashlight at the
Rose Bowl Flea Market, but searching for haute looks on the cheap
isn't for sissies, we learned on an early-morning expedition with
discount diva Jane Mannfolk.
</P>
<P>
   A television stylist and makeover specialist seen on ``Leeza,''
``Better Homes and Gardens,'' ``Power Living by Jake,'' ``The
Discovery Channel'' and several A&AMP;E documentaries, Mannfolk has
spent most of her career dressing other people (and herself) with
designer looks for less. She's got it down to such a science that
she says she can scour the racks of an off-price store and bag a
trophy-worthy ensemble (with hat and shoes) in less than an hour _
and under $100.
</P>
<P>
   And she proved it, taking time to share some cheap-chic shopping
tips along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first lesson in shopping off-price stores is bringing the
proper ammunition,'' said Mannfolk, pointing to a dozen or so
fashion magazines she'd brought with her.
</P>
<P>
   While we sat in the car waiting for the store to open, she
flipped through the pages pointing to pictures of the latest
trends, ripping some out and dismissing others. ``I look for
outfits that can be easily duplicated, especially those in neutral
tones like black, tan and navy. Pink is really hot now, through
spring '99, but you can't always find it, especially when it's
trimmed with yellow lace like this hot Christian Dior outfit,'' she
says, pointing to a recent ad.
</P>
<P>
   She pulls out some pictures of Ellen Tracy sportswear, a couple
of Ralph Lauren ads and others selling trendy styles, including
quilted parkas, bulky sweaters, faux-fur-trimmed sweaters and
evening gowns with sheer fabric over lace. She also adds an ad for
Gucci pumps. You know, those cool new ones with the tall, thick
Cuban heel and rounded toe.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with our ammunition, we wait outside the door, ready to be
among the first Monday morning customers. According to Mannfolk,
``Monday morning, not Saturday afternoon, is when you'll find the
best selection at stores like Marshall's, Ross Dress for Less and
T.J. Maxx. Another trick is to ask a salesperson what day and time
most new shipments arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   The doors open, and Mannfolk hits the racks, fixing her sight on
the season's trendiest trends, with her magazine pages on her
clipboard as a guide. ``When I'm shopping, I look for the quality
of fabrication, the cut of the garment and the feel of the fabric.
Better designers like to use subtle tones such as wheat, navy and
charcoal gray, and with experience you can quickly spot the fabric
quality and workmanship,'' she explains as she runs her hand over a
garment and tosses it over her arm.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, she's got several designer looks completed,
including a Ralph Lauren look-alike ensemble for $84.98, a Marc
Jacobs-inspired suit for $138.99, and a pair of black leather pumps
that look similar to Gucci's $600 version for $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   We go to another off-price store, where she finds it's a little
tougher to spot her quarry. But, then, it's also noon, and the
store is packed with bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Mannfolk heads to the women's coat area and mercilessly goes
through the racks. She finds a cute red parka with faux fox trim
that she likes but says the Tommy Hilfiger quilted parka with a
plaid muffler is what she's after. Suddenly she finds it.
Hilfiger's is blue, and this one is brown, but she says that's OK.
``It's got the look, and that's what we're after,'' says Mannfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the plaid scarf like the one in the same picture was
hard hunting in a sea of floral and leopard-print numbers, but she
finally found it in a bright color combo. It was soft and comfy and
even had fringe like the one in the picture. Total price? $69.98.
Total time spent? Thirty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-hour to spare, Mannfolk pulled out the Ellen Tracy
ensemble featured in Vogue with a model in khaki pants, a
fisherman's style sweater, knit cap and tan sneakers. ``This outfit
will cost several hundred dollars and hasn't even hit the stores
yet, but we'll find the look,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And does. The sweater isn't wool like the Ellen Tracy design but
has the feel of the hefty knit and the popular shrunken look,
priced at $19.99. The flat-front khaki pants (she says pleated
pants are passe) are a name brand (we're not allowed to tell
readers) for only $17.99; the cap is $10.99, and the shoes are also
a name brand, marked down to $18.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find any sneakers in the women's shoe section, so I
went to the men's area. If you've never worn men's sneakers, you
need to know that the sizes run bigger. If you normally wear a size
8, go down two sizes and look for a size 6 in the men's
department,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   While we wait for the clothing to be rung up, Mannfolk shares
more advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get the best bargains, be willing to spend a lot of time
thumbing through the racks, because the good stuff is lurking in
between the junk. Check for designer labels and name brands and try
on several sizes. You may find something wonderful that just needs
to be taken in a bit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Not sure if you love it? Mannfolk says most off-price stores
won't hold merchandise like department stores, but you can put it
on layaway for $5. She also suggests buying and returning it if it
doesn't work, because the designer goods go first.
</P>
<P>
   For inexperienced bargain hunters, Mannfolk says to stick to
basic items such as a charcoal gray or black skirt that hits below
the knee (pleated or pencil-slim), trousers that are lean with a
boot-leg silhouette (with or without a cuff) and a white cotton
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   And be on the lookout for pink or red, especially in a sweater
with three-quarter sleeves, she says, as carnation pink is expected
to be a hot seller in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for evening gowns, Mannfolk prefers black or ivory
gowns with the currently popular slip-dress appeal, especially if
they've got spaghetti straps or dips in the back. If the style has
too many gimmicky details, it won't pass chic _ even if it's cheap.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like a difficult assignment, but not if you do your
homework, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Homework?
</P>
<P>
   Says Mannfolk, ``Bargain hunters have to know a bargain when
they see it, and the only way they can is by shopping full-price
stores regularly to know what's in style, how much it costs and
what fits you best.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking this sounds like too much work _ and there
are plenty who do _ that's fine with Mannfolk. It leaves more cheap
chic for her.

for Thursday, Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAFRICA-FOSSIL (Undated) _ Scientists in South Africa
announce they have found what they describe as the most complete
skull and skeleton yet of a very early member of the human family
tree. It is of the afarensis period, like Lucy, but its skull is
much more complete. Also, this fossil, like foot bones found
earlier, suggests that at this stage of its history, humanity was
walking on two feet but also spending a lot of time in the trees.
And other fascinating facts and speculations. By John Noble
Wilford. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEAT-EXTREMES (Undated) _ Extreme summer heat and humidity
of the kind most threatening to health have become more frequent in
the United States over the last half century, two federal
researchers are reporting today. The trend was stronger at night
than in the daytime, making it especially dangerous, particularly
for the elderly. While the increasing frequency of extreme heat and
humidity cannot be directly linked to global warming, if it even
exists, it is consistent with what is predicted in the global
warming scenario.'' By William K. Stevens. (1100 words)

second space walk in continued effort to assemble the International
Space Station. By Warren E. Leary. (500 words)

AL GORE SR. WAS MUCH MORE THAN A POLITICIAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about political philosophy. Forget about the never-ending
confrontation between conservative and liberal ideas. Forget about
the partisan conflict that seems to dominate American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr. was a politician who transcended such concerns.
When Gore died over the weekend at the age of 90, Vice President Al
Gore lost his father, and our nation lost a statesman.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``statesman'' seems almost archaic in today's political
environment, for it connotes a grandness of vision and nobility of
purpose that are sadly lacking in our current crop of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A statesman is someone who will do what he believes is right
without regard for the political price. A statesman is more
concerned about his country's future than about his own.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gore, a Democrat, represented Tennessee in the U.S.
Senate from 1953 until 1970. He was an early supporter of civil
rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War _ positions that
were instrumental in derailing his bid for a fourth term. He lost
the 1970 election to Republican Bill Brock, who vigorously attacked
Gore's liberal views.
</P>
<P>
   He was a liberal, no doubt about it, but he was no knee-jerk
leftist. Here's what ``The New York Times'' said in its obituary:
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1952, Gore was elected to the Senate, where he did not fit
into the mold of either the Northern liberals or the Southern
conservatives. He was known as one of the Senate's best debaters
and was considered a possible Vice Presidential nominee in 1956 and
1960, but he frequently found himself on the unpopular side of an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is probably best remembered for his role in promoting the
interstate highway system, which could hardly be considered a
liberal issue _ especially by the standards of today's liberal
environmentalists, who look upon concrete as a lethal threat to
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose that this energetic proponent of coast-to-coast
paving saw any irony in his politician son's eventual devotion to
ultraliberal environmental causes? He probably did; Al Gore Sr. had
a terrific sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered that when the former senator visited Fort Worth in
February 1988 to campaign for Al Gore Jr., who was seeking the
Democratic presidential nomination that year. Candidate Gore was
elsewhere that day, but nobody missed him; the candidate's father
was a show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in 35 states so far _ only 15 to go,'' Gore Sr. said
during a campaign breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having more fun than Al Junior,'' said a family friend
who had seen both men in action on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gore laughed off a question about Brock, the man who
ended his Senate career and who was serving as campaign manager for
Republican Bob Dole's 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that's a `verboten' subject,'' Gore said with a
twinkle in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Gore even saw the humor in a politically oriented comic strip's
send-up of his son as ``Prince Albert,'' a too-good-to-be-true
aristocrat who was bred to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have paid for that kind of exposure,'' Gore said.
``I'm just glad they spelled Al's name right.''
</P>
<P>
   I recall a Gore backer saying in '88 that she thought Al Jr.
looked like the actor who played Superman in the movies. Could be.
But Al Gore Sr. looked exactly like a Southern senator _ or maybe
Hollywood's idea of a Southern senator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was a young-looking 80 back then, with a ready smile and a
firm, enthusiastic handshake. Strands of silver hair curled over
the crisply starched collar of his white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   He could have passed for a character from one of those epic
political novels that were so popular before the public became
disillusioned with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   I would venture the guess that if today's politicians were more
like Albert Gore Sr., there might not be so much disillusionment
about politics.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Al Gore Sr. was more than a politician. He was a
statesman.

MACHINE VISION: NARROWING THE GAP BETWEEN HUMAN AND ROBOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By JAMES RYAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we ever arrive at that point in history where machines become
our masters, it will have all begun with machine vision.
</P>
<P>
   Machine vision allows assembly-line robots to locate and
identify parts to inspect, count, measure and verify objects in a
variety of industrial processes. In other words, for at least some
things we can do, they can do them better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of giving computers eyes,'' explained Art Molella,
director of the Lemelson Center at the National Museum of American
History at the Smithsonian. ``It's obviously something that has
revolutionized assembly lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The essential hardware components are relatively common: a video
camera, a personal computer, a sensor and a frame grabber, which
captures a still picture from a moving video image.
</P>
<P>
   There is something slightly menacing about hunks of wire and
metal that can see more clearly for some tasks, thus performing
them with more accuracy than their human creators _ even if those
hunks of metal are still a far, far cry from the Terminator.
</P>
<P>
   Machine vision was conceived in the mid-1950s by Jerome H.
Lemelson, an independent inventor with more than 500 patents. The
Big Three automakers initially rejected Lemelson's suggestions for
automating assembly lines. But Japanese automakers did not, and
they leaped ahead in quality and productivity for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit eventually caught on. But Lemelson's contribution to
automotive excellence went largely unrewarded until his patents
came through decades later.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of machine vision goes beyond its commercial
value, Molella said. ``What's more important is the path it has
opened toward artificial intelligence and robotics in general,'' he
said. ``It has fed the imagination as well as the assembly lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Some machine vision systems, like those used to inspect fruit,
can ``see'' in color, but most find black and white adequate. A
computer can distinguish between 256 shades of gray. The human eye?
About 64 shades.
</P>
<P>
   While humans need two eyes for good depth perception, most
machine vision systems find one camera sufficient. Since the system
knows the actual size of an object it is scanning for, it can use
the size of the object's image and the angle at which light from
the object strikes the system's lens to calculate its position.
</P>
<P>
   Machine vision has humans beat hands down when it comes to
consistency. There's no more worrying that the night shift will see
things differently from the day shift. Robots are more precise than
assembly line workers, said Joe Campbell, vice president for
marketing at Adept Technology, a maker of industrial robots in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A robot with a machine vision system can be built and programmed
to perform a wide range tasks: picking up a single bolt from a
jumble on a conveyor belt and screwing it into an engine block,
automatically discarding a defective soda bottle in a production
line or placing a needle on the hub of a speedometer moving down a
conveyor belt and pointing it exactly to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Machine vision systems use video cameras and perceive objects by
using mathematical approaches that look for patterns in pixelated
video images. Many of the mathematical formulas were developed
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest advances in recent years have come from improved
cable couplings and faster computers, which allow the systems to
work more quickly. The speed at which machine vision systems can
perform a function is doubling every couple of years, said Tom
Reynolds, general manager of Advanced Control Technologies, based
in Laguna Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we could do 3 inspections a second,''
Reynolds said. ``Now we can do 10; a year from now it will be 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, that means we humans should be safe from machines'
taking over the world until, oh, at least 2033.

TEXAS LAWMAKER KEEPS HIS IMPEACHMENT CARD TO HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As one of the few Democrats undecided on impeaching
President Clinton, Rep. Nicholas Lampson of Texas insists, ``I'm
not trying to play hard to get.''
</P>
<P>
   With the likelihood of a House impeachment vote growing, the
stakes for Lampson and a dozen or more other fence-sitters are
rising immeasurably. After the Judiciary Committee wraps up
hearings this week, jockeying among pro- and anti-Clinton forces
can only intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson, while making some anti-impeachment comments Wednesday
in a telephone interview from his home town, Beaumont, maintained
his firm straddle. He is among a dwindling number of undecided
Democrats. Virtually all the other wavering lawmakers are moderate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Lampson says, he is content to wait until the committee
wraps up its proceedings and votes on articles of impeachment
before making up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Democrats _ Ralph Hall of Texas, Rep. Gene Taylor of
Mississippi and Rep. Virgil Goode of Virginia _ either openly
support impeachment or are leaning in that direction. A House floor
vote is expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lampson, 53, a former public school science
teacher and tax assessor, said he has paid scant attention to this
week's Judiciary proceedings, in which legal scholars and veteran
prosecutors have defended Clinton. One thing he knows for certain:
The impeachment terrain is shifting as surely as a tectonic plate
during an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get myself out there and start making
statements about something that very likely will change by this
afternoon,'' he explained. ``I honestly believe it would be
premature.''
</P>
<P>
   House approval of impeachment frequently is compared with an
indictment. Approval by the House of impeachment articles would
send the matter to the Senate for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Lampson sees himself as something of a grand
juror. ``This is a very serious, far-reaching matter,'' he said.
``For me to go on speculating and tipping my hand without all the
information would cheapen the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``I'd sort of like to keep my cards to myself
for just a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampson's press secretary, Monette Goodrich, said the lawmaker
has not been pressured by White House officials or any other
Democrat. And Lampson said that while he did discuss impeachment
timing in a recent phone conversation with his Texas colleague,
Rep. Tom DeLay, the strongly anti-Clinton GOP House whip did not
try to sway his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very clear about his position,'' Lampson said, reciting
DeLay's oft-stated view that Clinton should resign or be removed
from office. ``I can tell you I do not share that feeling, and I
will not make that kind of statement at this point one way or the
other,'' Lampson said.
</P>
<P>
   A few elements of the Clinton defense line put forward by
Democrats raise questions, Lampson said. One is the Democratic
contention that the context of Clinton's misstatements about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky _ the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit _ may have amounted to a
setup.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson described it as a possible ``sting operation.''
Democrats have charged that the Jones lawyers, Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr and Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee who secretly
tape recorded Lewinsky talking about her affair with Clinton, were
in collusion with one another to bring Clinton down.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, Lampson said, is whether Clinton's alleged
perjury and obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky matter are
impeachable offenses. Democrats have insisted they are not. Lampson
said he also worries about the impact of impeachment on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that being a loyal Democrat has nothing to do with
his own decision-making. ``I feel like I'm a good Democrat but I
also feel like I need to be a good congressman,'' he said. ``I
don't have to follow my party line.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampson won his seat in 1996, dumping one-term Republican Steve
Stockman, who in 1994 had beaten Rep. Jack Brooks, a House
Democratic veteran who was at the time chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson won re-election in 1998, beating GOP challenger Tom
Cottar by 64 percent to 36 percent. Lampson said the
impeachment-related calls and letters he receives have been mixed,
and that he was ``placing the pressure on myself'' to come through
with the right vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lampson said he is focusing on a few unrelated
issues _ establishing a legal system to deal with cases of
international child abduction, and ending international trafficking
of child pornography on the Internet. ``These are things I can have
an impact on,'' he said.

FASHIONABLE WAYS TO SAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Off-price stores carry a wide variety of
merchandise, including really old stuff, current merchandise from
over-sells, damaged goods and designer labels from recent seasons.
They get weekly shipments, and the best bargains go quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't rule out consignment shops. Bargain hunters can find
couture fashions that have been worn once or twice and sold for
less than half the original price at these stores, where big
spenders sell their castoffs. Besides great finds, loyal customers
are often called the moment something in their size arrives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't find a sweater on the cheap with marabou feathers or
faux-fur trim? Buy the trim at a fabric or craft store for about
$10 a yard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pearls, sequins and beading are in, and you can save a bundle
by doing it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Couldn't find a long narrow skirt? Sew a strip of chiffon on
the hemline, or make an over-skirt to hit mid-calf. This will get
you through the season but will probably be passe by next fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Want those Christian Dior mules with the fuzz balls on the
toes? Use eyelash glue or a hot glue gun to tack on marabou
feathers or fur. The eyelash glue also is good for applying
rhinestones on your cheek or shoulder for holiday parties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Need an evening wrap? Buy three yards of tulle or velvet and
hem the ends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't let a great coat or blouse get away just because you
hate the buttons. When you're buying cheap chic, you can afford to
sew on new buttons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Like retro looks? Mannfolk says you can find sequined or
beaded cardigans for $20 to $50 at thrift stores such as Jet Rag
and Wasteland in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't afford one of those tiny vintage evening bags all the
movie stars are carrying? Stores such as Marshall's as well as
junior boutiques like Rampage and lower-priced department stores
such as Mervyn's have several look-alike styles for $20.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: Those with the most status are satin drawstring types with
beaded fringe. &QL;

 &HT;    The woman who wouldn't die
 &HT;    EDITORS: REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING. THIS STORY IS RUNNING IN TWO
PARTS. THIS IS PART ONE.
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I keep all my little horrors in this suitcase,'' Sandra
Manning says in the dim light of her living room.
</P>
<P>
   The American Tourister _ bright red and solid _ keeps everything
locked up tight. She flips it open, reaches in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' she says, matter-of-factly, fingering a faded
Polaroid, ``is the monster.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a handsome man, with mahogany skin and a big white smile,
and at the moment Sandy snapped the photo, he was perched on the
edge of a park fountain, hugging his three small children. The very
image, Sandy says, of ``a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Except now, in the American Tourister, is another picture _ the
regular guy's booking mug. No big white smile, just two glassy eyes
confronting the police camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's more. Tucked beneath the mug shot are the police
reports, which detail exactly what he did to her, on the winter
afternoon she almost died.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the police reports are the court papers, which assign
Sandy Manning's monster to a brief prison term _ over, it seemed to
her, before the ink dried on the tabloid stories.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a picture of Sandy, in her hospital bed, oxygen
tubes curling up to her nose, a blue pillow resting lightly across
her chest, covering the bandages that bind the holes her husband
made when he stabbed her over and over in the marsh beyond the
railroad tracks way out on the Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The stab wounds healed.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``My children, my babies, they're everything to me. They have
been through so many traumas in their short lives. One day life was
one way, and then it was just total upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsey, 9, the oldest, she saw the most violence, so she
carries the most pain. She still dreams her father's going to stab
me, shoot me. I was in the tub one night and she came in, sat down
on the toilet seat, said, `Mommy, what will we do if Daddy Mike
kills you?' And I told her, `Only thing we can do is pray, baby,'
so that's what we did, right there on the bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mikey's 7, looks just like his daddy. When he started
kindergarten, he was real moody. Lately, he's been worse. One night
we were lying on the couch and he kept holding his breath, putting
the covers over his head, saying he didn't want to live in this
world, that it was too painful. Mikey's counselor thinks the night
terrors are tied in with the fear he's going to grow up like his
father. Mikey has told him, why does he have to have the same name
as the murderer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney's the youngest, 6. She's very withdrawn. Courtney
will not talk to you. I mean, she will not talk to you. She was not
even a year old when all this happened, but I feel like the
after-effects have gotten to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids, they're angry because they don't have normalcy like
other kids do, not by a long shot. And they worry just as much as I
do that he's going to come back. One time Lindsey thought she saw
him at the Texaco and she ran home screaming, `Mommy! Mommy! I
think I saw Daddy Mike!' She just freaked out. I know just how she
feels because sometimes I think I see him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple way to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the shorthand people use when they have talked
about something too many times, Sandy will say, in a single breath,
to dispense with it: ``My husband kidnapped me and stabbed me and
tortured me and I almost died and God knows why I didn't.'' And
unless you already know the story _ perhaps you opened the morning
paper six years ago and saw the headline, or watched the TV news
accounts _ you think surely she must be exaggerating. Because who
on Earth could survive all that?
</P>
<P>
   Other times, if she's in an upbeat mood and doesn't want to
bring herself down, Sandy will refer to ``The Incident,'' pause a
bit for emphasis, and let it go at that. Only the very curious will
inquire further.
</P>
<P>
   To really understand what happened to Sandy Manning you would
have to know 100 little things:
</P>
<P>
   That one morning after a weekend of domestic abuse, she finally
got up her nerve to flee _ straight down Interstate 95 in her pink
nightgown with nothing but her three groggy children and the
promise of shelter in a safe house.
</P>
<P>
   That a few weeks later, while living an underground life, she
went to court in the morning to renew a restraining order against
her husband, and that very afternoon he forced her into his car at
knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   That the restraining order was on the front seat of the old
green Chrysler when he held the butcher knife to her throat and
ordered her to drive, north and west through Palm Beach County,
toward nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   That when they crossed the long, high bridge on the Beeline
where she could see the tree tops blowing in the wind like unruly
mops of hair, she thought about jumping out, but he said drive
faster, Bitch _ and she fought back tears as her chance disappeared
in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   That eventually he parked on a lonely stretch of road and
dragged her across the railroad tracks, and it was here that he
stabbed her and held her face down in the brackish water and she
said the Lord is my shepherd until her mind went numb.
</P>
<P>
   That after he stabbed her, she pulled the knife from the spot
near her heart and nearly sliced her fingers off, and still today
she can't use her right hand to pick up a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   That afterward he dragged her back to the car, where he drank
Pepsi, and smoked Marlboro reds.
</P>
<P>
   That he wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   That he beat her with a tire iron, picked her up and kissed her
on the forehead. ``I love you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That when the cops came, he blamed the crime on two masked men.
</P>
<P>
   That throughout all of this _ for 17 ungodly hours _ Sandy
Manning felt herself slipping away. But then her three children
would visit some small, still-alive place in the back of her mind,
and she would tell herself, again and again, taking up a mantra,
``Sandy, don't you dare die. Sandy don't you dare die.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you knew 100 little things, you still would not know
the whole story, or even the most important part. Because after The
Incident there was an investigation, and after the investigation
there was a plea bargain, and after the plea bargain there was a
brief prison sentence, and after the prison sentence Mike Jones
went free, but the woman who had been his wife did not.
</P>
<P>
   After The Incident, Sandy Manning wasn't Sandy Manning anymore,
she was somebody else. Somebody who heard the monster's voice in
her head. Somebody who hid in the bathtub every time a floorboard
creaked. Somebody who three years later still could not chop fresh
vegetables for her children's dinner, because chopping fresh
vegetables means picking up a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen Sandy Manning. She is the woman staring
blankly at the cereal boxes in the grocery store; the incapacitated
soul in the welfare office trying to string together enough
benefits to keep the lights on in her small, dim apartment; the
weekly regular at group therapy, looking for magic answers when of
course there are none.
</P>
<P>
   She is the woman who drops out of the work force so he can't
find her, then fights her way back. The woman who swallows too many
pills and has her stomach pumped, and who in despair practices
holding a revolver to her temple. The woman who wants to clear out
of town because she's terrified _ and who wants to stay put because
she has a right to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be looking over my shoulder forever,'' Sandy Manning
says. ``Because that day he hurt me, he killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10, 1992. Sandy stops at her mom's house to pick up some
clothes, and there he is. He's hiding it, but he's angry. Angry she
left him, angry she took the kids and went to the safe house. Red
hot angry. They talk for a moment, and then she gets into the car,
ready to go, and suddenly he is in the seat behind her, the knife a
cold, sharp warning against her throat. Drive, he says. Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hours pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's mom, Sharon, and sister Diane know something is wrong,
so they get in the car and go _ west past the farm fields, past
Mike's old haunts, back and forth on the roads he traveled most,
where he knew the street signs, because although Sandy had tried to
teach him, he still couldn't read too well. Maybe he's holding
Sandy captive till she says she'll come back, they think, maybe
they're just holing up to talk, maybe they're making up. Maybe,
maybe, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It is 6 a.m. and everybody knows what nobody's saying when
Sandy's mom turns on the news. On the screen, at St. Mary's, a
Trauma Hawk lands, depositing a stretcher, and on the stretcher is
a woman, and before Sandy's mom can process the image, the awful
truth of it, the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, We have your daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She needs surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She says she loves you, and please, please take
care of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is 28, pretty, with the strong, broad features of her
Scandinavian ancestors, luminous green eyes and light brown hair
that picks up highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she colors it, and once you get to know her, you
realize the color says something about how she is feeling: Her hair
is a flat, dull brown when she has been depressed; it is a lighter,
brighter shade on the weeks she is successful in keeping
appointments with doctors and social workers; and on really fine
days, after the children bring home good report cards or counseling
has been particularly enlightening, it is a beautiful, soft shade
of strawberry blond.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy has had so many setbacks in life, so many secrets, you
half expect her to pull the curtains and retreat, but withdrawal is
not in her nature. She is at heart an extrovert who relishes her
connections with the world; and despite all that has happened, or
perhaps because of it, she can be uncommonly empathetic and
generous, as if she would like to give to others all the security
and comfort she has been deprived. If, for example, while driving
to the store or the doctor's she happens to intersect with somebody
carrying a white bucket to collect change for a good cause,
especially one for children, she will give the solicitor not a few
quarters but a fistful of dollars _ then thank them.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's dream, before Mike took it, was to win a music
scholarship to college. She still keeps a tattered Polaroid of
herself singing a Gloria Estefan hit at her high school talent
show. The auditorium was so dark that the picture is almost
entirely black, except for Sandy, the star soloist, up on stage,
arms spread wide, incandescent in a white dress in the last sweet
time in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, if you walk past her apartment window, you might hear
her deep, gutsy voice doing justice to a gospel tune, or coaching
Lindsey through a Mariah Carey hit. Her oldest daughter doesn't
always reach the high notes, and sometimes she forgets the words,
but like Sandy, she has a voice full of promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time, baby,'' Sandy will say. ``Be patient and
you'll get it right one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's sister Betty loves to tell the story of how Sandy won a
big dance contest sponsored by Easter Seals when she was 7. When
Betty mentions this to a reporter, to make sure she understands her
sister had genuine talent _ that she could sing and dance _ Sandy
buries her face in her hands, mortified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Mish,'' Betty says, calling her little sister by her
childhood nickname. ``You have to tell the good things about
yourself, too. You can't just tell the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the good things?'' Sandy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Betty. ``You are a good singer, and a good
person. And you are a very good mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so much bad has happened to you, I think you forget to
take any credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Olson was 15, a lovely high school sophomore who liked to
study, when she met a 19-year-old Job Corps trainee named Mike
Jones. It was Dec. 5, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a date, exactly. Sandy had a friend who was seeing
Mike's cousin, and one night they all went out. Sandy remembers two
things about this meeting. The first is that she was glad her mom
wasn't home, because Michael is black and her mother would never
approve of an interracial relationship. The second is how sorry she
felt for Mike once she got to know him, even just a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat in the back seat and talked and talked. First it was
the easy stuff _ school, my hobbies, my favorite colors. But
Michael came from a family that had experienced extreme poverty and
violence. He told me in such detail about how his dad beat his mom
_ until she literally had to pile the kids on a bus and get out of
town _ that he just had me crying tears. I felt so sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would call me the next day, and that night I went
home and I was lying in bed
</P>
<P>
   thinking, `I don't want to date this guy.' He had so many
problems, I was praying he wouldn't like me. But the next day the
phone rang, and it was Michael, and I just had this overwhelming
feeling of _ I don't know _ pity.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing on Mike's part, but soon after, he and Sandy
were an item. Mike was so attentive. He brought her flowers, movie
tickets, a plastic red rose that lighted up _ even a lobster tail
from Red Lobster, where he had taken a job as a dish washer and
moved up to prep cook. They went to concerts, and, because they
loved coffee and conversation, to the doughnut shop down the street
for the $6.99 steak-and-egg special. The romance was short on
money, but Sandy thought it had a fairy tale quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the sweetest thing,'' she says. ``Back then.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she got pregnant and things unraveled. Michael and his
mother were thrilled at the news, Sandy recalls, and went out right
away to look for cribs; but her own mother and sister saw things
differently. Mike was too domineering, they said. Sandy, sweet 16,
was too young. So her sister drove her to a clinic, and, sobbing,
Sandy had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at her family's urging, she hopped a plane to her old
hometown in upstate New York, to stay with another sister.
Everybody she knew said better to end things now, make a clean
break, vanish until he forgets you, but Sandy had a terrible
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Once before she had tried to break up with Mike, to concentrate
on her schoolwork, and he had protested by dropping to his knees in
the middle of the street, vowing to kill himself. So what would he
do now that she had had an abortion and cleared out of town?
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, she had her answer.
</P>
<P>
   He shot himself in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messed up all his intestines,'' Sandy says. ``And instantly
this became my fault, in Michael's mind, and in mine. I felt so
guilty I took an extreme measure _ I got back together with him,
and I threw away my birth control. I know how crazy this sounds
now, but back then, I didn't care what my family thought; to make
everything right, I was going to have his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's exactly what I did _ quit school, find a job, get
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he hit her? My God, Sandy says, you don't forget
something like that. You keep it on instant replay in your head.
</P>
<P>
   She had just returned from the grocery and was running through
their Lake Park townhouse calling Mike's name, so he could help
unload bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him in the upstairs bathroom with a Cool Whip bowl
full of these little white things. He had a can and had scrunched
it down and made it into a pipe. Well, Mike used to smoke reefer,
but this stuff was new to me. So I said, `Is that drugs?' And he
said, `Crack.' He told me to go downstairs and start cooking.
Later, when he still didn't come out, I ran back upstairs and
opened the bathroom door, and I took the bowl and said, `I'm
throwing this in the toilet.' He got mad. Slapped me. Pushed me. I
rolled down the stairs, and then he went back and did his drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was how it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how it always starts, with a first slap or punch, then
another, and another. And so it goes for Sandy, in her 18th year.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, to try to put him in a good mood, or at least a
better one, she tucks a napkin under his neck and serves up bacon,
eggs, grits, pancakes, biscuits, sausage _ then gets the juice
thrown in her face because it isn't chilled. Nights he smashes
dirty plates on the kitchen floor. There are many accusations _
where have you been? Are you cheating on me? No. No, no, no, no. It
doesn't matter. He's hitting her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant with her first child, she runs. Her mom says, ``Baby,
come home,'' and she does. But the monster knows where she is all
the time. He follows her to the store, the bus stop, the doctor's
office. She's so scared she sleeps at the foot of her mother's bed,
with a machete. Her stepdad has an ax.
</P>
<P>
   She asks for help, and the police say get a restraining order,
so they can arrest him when he comes close _ but Mike's a magician,
good at disappearing. Sandy swears to the ominous, off-the-record
remarks of one officer, a woman: ``Honey, if he comes for you, the
only sure thing you can do is shoot him, then drag him in the house
and make it look like a break-in. Because this kind of man, he
doesn't give up until he gets what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he disappears for seven months, only to turn up at her
baby-sitting job. Come back to me, he says, or I'll kill your
family, one by one. Don't hide from me, he says, because I'll find
you. And she believes him, so, yes, she goes back. He lays off, for
a while. Then one day she makes the wrong kind of Kool Aid, and the
next thing she knows she's flying across the dining room with a
bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on like this. Except when she's pregnant with her
younger children. He wants a boy and she's afraid of what he will
do if she says no, so they have Mikey. He forces her to have sex,
and her birth control fails, so they have Courtney. When she's
pregnant, he's Superdad _ and this is deceiving. For a while, she
has hope.
</P>
<P>
   And he finds God. They go to church. Four times a week they're
bowing their heads in the pew, and she's praying, Lord, please make
things different, but afterward, back home, he hits her. Once he
calls her a devil in front of the whole congregation, and she runs
out of church to weep on the front steps. A deacon counsels him,
but it doesn't sink in.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   He hurls a coffee table at her, and the glass shatters in
glittery pools around the children's feet. He speeds down Federal
Highway, calling her names, slams the brakes so hard Lindsey flies
from her safety seat into the dashboard. In the driveway one day,
when she is sick with a kidney infection and confined to a
wheelchair, he tries to run over her with his car.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest baby is on her lap. She thinks, ``This is it.'' She
thinks, ``No more.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she drops him at his tree-trimming job and
kisses him on the cheek, so he won't suspect. And then she is
flying down I-95, her pink nightgown fluttering in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 11, 1992. Sandy is covered in blood and mud, and a tangle
of vines from the bog plugs the hole in her chest, and it is just
like this, a creature half alive, that she rises from the muck at
the Tri-Gas plant, on the Beeline Highway near Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The place is so quiet, so damn deserted, a rescue seems
impossible _ but suddenly out of nowhere in the mist of the dawn,
two early shift workers appear at the gate. Mike says, ``Hey,
fellas, call a tow truck, I'm stuck in the mud.'' But they're not
stupid, so they call the sheriff, too.
</P>
<P>
   And Sandy hangs on. Hangs on until the cops come, and the
ambulance, and the Trauma Hawk. Hangs on until the hospital, where
a detective leans low over her stretcher, and _ safe at last, if
you can call it that _ she says in a voice surprisingly strong:
Forget about two masked men. My husband did this. His name is
Michael Anthony Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 stab wounds in all, scattered like some sick
connect-the-dots game across her stomach, her chest, her upper
arms, her ears. Her hands are like mincemeat where she grabbed the
butcher knife, and the fingers on her right hand flop around like a
marionette's. The knife pierced her lung and her breath comes in
jagged little spurts.
</P>
<P>
   When Sandy asks the doctor if she will live, he looks a long
time at her, bandaged like a mummy and lost in a jungle of plastic
tubing, and very softly, he says, ``Honey, you should have been
dead 16 hours ago.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, 1993, in Courtroom 315 of the Palm Beach County
Courthouse, Mike Jones pleaded guilty to attempted first degree
murder and false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did the crime and then confessed to it made a
speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been searching myself, wondering why things happened
the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a person of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got plenty of love in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He got eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sandy wondered aloud if that was how long she had to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``After The Incident, I held up real good. I was in this support
group for battered women, and I told them my whole story. People
thought, `Oh, this girl is wonderful!' I was like a role model for
people who were going to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, Michael plea bargained, and I just lost it. What
happened was, I met with the prosecutor and she handed me the
doctor's reports on Michael, which explained how upset he was about
the abortion and me leaving for the women's shelter and taking the
kids. The gist was that he was insane at the time he did this to
me. So the idea was, we go to trial, he might get off by reason of
insanity, and if we go for the plea, then at least we keep him in
the system for his prison term, and then 15 years' probation. So I
had 24 hours to decide, and I took the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, after Mike went to prison, I just broke down. I
started hearing his voice in my head, and one day I flipped out on
Lindsey. She was yelling at me about something, and I got it in my
head she was her father. I put my hand over her mouth and nose and
I didn't let go. Her eyes started fluttering, and then I came to
and realized this was my daughter I was trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up at St. Mary's. Three weeks of intense therapy. One
hundred different medications. They couldn't tell me if I'd ever be
well, but I took the medicine and I saw a therapist, and I just
kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then one day, at group, this old lady started talking
about how her husband had thrown her against the wall and something
in me just clicked. Because this woman reminded me of my
grandmother, and here somebody was beating the hell out of her, and
I just thought, `God, does it ever end?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, I left the meeting, screaming, and I went to the
water fountain. I had two bottles of pills with me, and I opened
them up and I took them all. I just wanted it to be over, all the
violence. I wanted out. Waking up in the hospital and realizing I
hadn't been successful _ that I hadn't killed myself _ that was
just the worst feeling in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole time, I'm doing the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because right around this time, the Nicole Simpson case broke,
and O.J. was the suspect, and suddenly domestic violence was this
really hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on Geraldo and Montel, and they said I had a real good
story.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a name for Sandy's condition. Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder. She was propped up in a psychiatric ward when she got the
diagnosis. Nightmares. Hallucinations. Anxiety attacks. Depression.
Flashbacks. Panic. Numbness. It all fit.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of the post-trauma illness as a wartime
affliction, but it can be triggered by any traumatic event: rape,
torture, child abuse, a hurricane, a flood. Or, as too many women
can testify, near-death at the hands of the men they married.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sandy got the diagnosis, she thought the wartime
explanation might be the best, after all. Hadn't she just been
through a war? Wasn't the Beeline her battlefield?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Anderson, who has 20 years' experience as a case manager at
the 45th Street Mental Health Center in West Palm Beach, tried to
help Sandy put the fragments of her life together in 1994, when she
was living in a part of town where drug shootings are not just
something you read about. He remembers how smart she seemed _ and
how scared.
</P>
<P>
   Of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of what might.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mike Jones had an eight-year sentence _ but that was just
on paper. In real life, he would be out before her youngest baby
finished kindergarten. Then what would she do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy was having visual terrors of being stabbed,'' Anderson
says. ``In layman's terms, she was having flashbacks. She was
absolutely terrified. When something like this happens, if you
don't get help, you wind up like the Vietnam vet who disappears
into the mountains and fights the war for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an irreconcilable misery to be married to the man who
almost killed you, and so, while Mike Jones was in jail awaiting
trial, Sandy did the only logical thing. Divorced him.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, she had found somebody else. You might even say
Mike Jones introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few months before The Incident, and Mike had just
dropped off Sandy at her job with an answering service in Riviera
Beach, where she worked triple shifts to pay their rent. In the
parking lot, they fought. She was still sniffling when she sat down
at her desk _ with a black eye _ and the first call came in.
Something about a leaky sink. Please beep Jerry Manning.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry called back, Sandy tried to deliver the leaky-sink
message, but she was sobbing too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry had a soft, deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   So she told him. The whole unbearable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohmigod, honey,'' he said, ``you sound like a real nice lady.
You got to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   They met for the first time three months later, after the
</P>
<P>
   Trauma Hawk deposited Sandy's ravaged body at St. Mary's. When
she opened her eyes after surgery, she saw Jerry, standing over her
bed with a teddy bear, no longer just a soft-deep voice on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy thought getting married and buying a sweet little house
together and setting up shop as a blended family, his kids, hers,
might help her start over in life, but she was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1996 when they said their vows _ and not too much later
when they broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Manning tried, but he stepped into a crowded marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry. Sandy. And her monster.

<P>
   It is important for the international community to sort out the
developments in Russia, for our present financial crisis is the
best proof that the Russian economy is integrated into the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Our potential partners in the West cannot grasp the logic of
Russia's leaders' economic and political decision making. And yes,
the main problem that faces the West in trying to figure out
Russian events is not so much their complexity as the country's
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to explain to your politicians, CEOs and other
decision makers that it is probably premature to look for a logical
pattern now.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains: our new Russian government under Prime
Minister Primakov still has not drawn up an economic policy. But
why? _ It has been too busy trying to ensure political stability.
And in fact it has managed to cope with this major task and keep
things from spiraling out of control. So we put up with a tradeoff:
uncertainty in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Russia may well take a step backward in terms
of market reforms. What is important is WHY it will make this step.
I hope the outcome will be to make two steps forward afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As to checks and balances, the degree to which our economic
program is realistic depends on whether it can get support from
international financial organizations such as the IMF and World
Bank _ and on whether it succeeds in restructuring our foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Three options are still possible to really overcome the Russian
crisis, but they are all related to the degree to which the budget
is balanced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option One: To return to a rigid budget with revenues
exceeding expenditures. On this basis, an arrangement can be made
with international financial organizations on foreign-debt
restructuring. This would, however, require a total reform of our
tax system, reduction of ineffective expenditures and a way to
provide social protection to those who actually need it. In these
endeavors, the government might find itself taking steps at the
expense of its political prestige.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Two: To draw up a relatively balanced budget that
presupposes an emission, or printing, of 80 billion to 100 billion
new rubles before the end of 1998. This means that 35 to 40 billion
rubles would go to the budget, 40 to 50 billion would be toward
payment of the foreign debt and 10 to 15 billion rubles would go
into Russia's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Such a relatively balanced budget would result in a monthly
inflation rate of 5 percent to 8 percent through March. But it
would not lead to hyperinflation, and it would still enable us to
reach agreement on foreign-debt restructuring. In my view, this is
the most realistic option.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Three: To meet the opposition's populist demands, the
government could try to solve all its problems, including those
that cannot possibly be solved, such as paying off all its debts by
December. This would call for a printing of 150 billion rubles or
so. In this case, inflation would be no less than 10 percent a
month through March.
</P>
<P>
   I think this option would be unworkable. First, it would not
promote economic development; second, it would be fraught with
serious social tensions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, importantly, I believe that Russia has no economic
problems that cannot be solved. Everything hinges on the political
problem _ the government's weakness in the absence of any accord in
our society over the goals, means and price of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that the democratic movement in Russia has suffered a
big defeat. There surely has been a political recoil. But even if
the idea of building a democracy is defeated, this does not mean
that a normal market economy cannot be built.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as spring, when I was prime minister, I thought the
main thing was to set ourselves an economic task that we could
tackle. I did not realize that in the final analysis, everything
would hinge on politics _ on the stability, wisdom and
trustworthiness of our politicians.
</P>
<P>
   We have made many mistakes, especially in grossly
underestimating the difficulty of remolding social consciousness.
One can speed up the implementation of an economic plan, but one
cannot speed up the remolding of social consciousness in the
various levels of society. All our economic theories, though
correct, tripped over this.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Russia has never seen a mere seven consecutive
years of economic reform. We simply mark time, taking two steps
backward for every forward step. What is important, however, is
that over this time of trial and error, everyone has realized that
no road exists other than the one leading to a free-market economy.

<P>
   It is high noon on a beautiful autumn day in 1997, and Sandy has
just washed her hair and put on a pretty gray shorts set for an
emergency meeting with the principal and teachers at her children's
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency is, her ex-husband is about to go free.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones' travels through the prison system were entirely
typical _ up to a point. He served 321 days in the county jail,
followed by three years in prison, and then, because Florida's
prisons were crowded and one way to empty them was to let inmates
out early, he was all set to walk out of his prison digs up near
the Georgia line _ a bus ticket south tucked in his pocket _ when
there was a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   He had no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   No job.
</P>
<P>
   No plan.
</P>
<P>
   The people in charge of monitoring his 15-year probationary term
didn't want him landing on Sandy's doorstep _ in a letter to a
judge, a Department of Corrections administrator noted that Sandy
was ``in extreme fear for her life and the safety of her children''
_ so they took the unusual step of having him assigned to a
Probation and Restitution Center in Central Florida for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the year is up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy plops down in the principal's office. Fiddles with her
purse straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he tries to take the kids?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   The principal raises her eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he disguises himself?''
</P>
<P>
   The principal jots a note.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he has a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just her children's physical safety Sandy worries
about. Lately her kids have been doing well in school, but Sandy
remembers what happened this time last year, when Mike's prison
term expired, before the judge sent him to the probation center:
Mikey stopped focusing on his schoolwork and started obsessing
about the safety of his family. A worried old man at the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for my mom,'' he told his teacher then, and looking
into his small, round face, she knew right away his mom wasn't the
only one he was scared for.
</P>
<P>
   The principal pulls up her chair, touches Sandy's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The school, she says, will do everything it can to make sure her
kids are safe. And she and the teachers will get them extra
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy smiles. But under the table, her knees are shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says it, but everybody's thinking it:
</P>
<P>
   What about Sandy? Who's helping Sandy?
</P>
<P>
   November 1997. What is fear, undiluted, uncontrollable fear?
</P>
<P>
   It is the phone ringing and a voice you can't place hissing,
``Gonna getcha, gonna getcha.'' It is a stranger outside your
house, inexplicably snapping a picture. It is your ex-husband's
relatives finding your apartment, dropping by for the first time in
years, saying, casually, ``Just want to see how you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you're doing: A stranger cuts through your yard, you
hide in the tub. A palm frond tickles the window, you punch 911.
You pack your kids off to grandma's house, then shake like a leaf
alone in your bed. You come across his mug shot, and suddenly he's
in the room. You think you're safe working at a little
hole-in-the-wall restaurant _ who possibly could find you there? _
and then your boss gets a call from a stranger, asking too many
questions about you.
</P>
<P>
   You say his name, your scars itch.
</P>
<P>
   You go to the benefits office, the lady says, ``Why not file for
child support?'' You say no because you can just see his face the
day he opens his paycheck and it's short. You can hear him mutter,
Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   You move again. Change your phone again. Call the county clerk's
office, ask to seal your address. Use an alias. Hand out his
picture. You check with the cops, the probation officer, the
courthouse. You know what everybody says? ``Get a restraining
order.'' This seems so preposterous you laugh. You tell your kids,
``Don't walk alone, not even down the block.'' Tell your mom, ``If
anything happens to me, I want you to sue the whole damn state.''
</P>
<P>
   And then.
</P>
<P>
   He gets out.
</P>
<P>
   And you draw the blinds and lock yourself in.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's worksheet:
</P>
<P>
   During a fight, what can you do to protect yourself?
</P>
<P>
   lockdoor hide
</P>
<P>
   Who can you call to help?
</P>
<P>
   cops
</P>
<P>
   Make a plan: When I see:
</P>
<P>
   Micke call 911
</P>
<P>
   ``Read it, Mom,'' the kids say. ``Read us the story. Read it so
we know what happened. What really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper clipping is titled ``The Woman Who Wouldn't Die,''
and Sandy keeps it pinned to the back of her bedroom door, so that,
in her lowest moments, when she undresses and sees her scars _
shining like fresh white wounds _ she can remind herself that she's
tough, that she survived. That headline is her Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Read it, Mom. They already know the rough outline, of course,
but an outline is a lusterless substitute for a story in its flesh,
and they know this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did he really hurt you? Why can't we be a family anymore? Her
babies are standing shoulder to shoulder like little soldiers by
the bedroom door, and they are so insistent, so certain, so
tormented, that she gives in. But she is a careful censor, careful
about what she leaves out, about how she delivers the truth of what
their daddy did.
</P>
<P>
   When she finishes, Courtney is crying, and the corners of
Mikey's mouth turn down, the way they do when a math problem is too
hard, or a vocabulary word stumps him.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey, the oldest, stands perfectly still, then draws an
arm around her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is an accelerated reader.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been in mother's bedroom many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is sitting on her bed, wearing purple, because purple will
hide the blood.
</P>
<P>
   She has a gun.
</P>
<P>
   She puts it to her temple, then under her chin, practicing
different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey needs help in math.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's so moody.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney climbs onto my lap when she's sad.
</P>
<P>
   Under her chin. To her temple.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps five minutes, but feels much longer than that,
when Sandy tiptoes across the hall in the middle of the night to
check on the children.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, she pours a cup of coffee and three bowls of
Fruit Loops, and everybody comes running for breakfast, just like
always.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what about your night terrors, Little Man?'' the pretty
lady counselor says.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey looks at her with big wet eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty scary, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How 'bout we make a picture of them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to punch the balloon next time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   It feels good to punch a balloon when you're angry.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Saturday morning, and the pretty lady named Zoe is
trying to find the key to unlock Mikey. She and her partner, Matt,
are from the Children's Home Society, a new program called the
Child Witness to Violence Project, which helps youngsters who have
seen far too much of what they should not see at all.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Anderson and Zoe Costello first knocked on Sandy's door the
week Mike Jones went free, and they have been back many times since
to assist Sandy in practical ways _ doctors' appointments,
shopping, parenting techniques _ but mostly, they listen. To all
the stuff she and the kids don't usually talk about. ``All the dark
spots,'' Sandy says. Sandy's dark spots go back to childhood, when
she was raped by a relative. ``I learned early,'' she tells Matt,
``how to be a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking helps.
</P>
<P>
   Matt asks Sandy to sign a contract: If she is thinking about
hurting herself, she is supposed to call right away.
</P>
<P>
   He asks her to keep a diary, and after a while she stops looking
over her shoulder to see if anybody is snooping when she writes, on
a bad day, ``God, if you can hear me, please help!''
</P>
<P>
   He asks her to keep a daily agenda. Her whole day is mapped out,
from 6 a.m., when she gets up to make coffee, until 8:30 p.m., when
Lindsey goes to bed. In between, she reads the paper, exercises
(after The Incident, her weight ballooned), cleans the house, helps
with homework, cooks the dinner, bathes the kids, slides in a tape
and out-Mariahs Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Her last assignment, right before bed, is to look in the mirror
and repeat a sentence:
</P>
<P>
   ``I, Sandy Manning, am a good person, and I'm going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   On good days, she almost believes it.
</P>
<P>
   It is afternoon, a clean, blue, spring day, and Sandy is
scrubbing kitchen counters with the window open, a breeze
fluttering in. She has freshly painted nails, a pretty blue dress
and beautiful strawberry blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Life is looking up. Just recently, she moved her family into a
cheerful new apartment, decorated it with throw rugs and family
photos and banners from her favorite team, the Cowboys (cowboys,
you know, are tough). And on the kitchen table there is a boom box,
which means that Sandy never does dishes without LeAnn Rimes
singing How Do I Live as back-up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy likes to think of the apartment as the place she and the
kids will start fresh, put all the junk behind them and live _ dare
she say it? _ a more or less normal life. As if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, free now for nearly half a year, is living in
Lakeland, where, Sandy hears, he is working at a restaurant and
reporting regularly to his probation officer. When she feels
jittery, she pulls out the court papers and checks the terms of his
15-year probation, forbidding him from having contact with her or
her children.
</P>
<P>
   In the court file, she knows, there is also a note from Judge
Roger B. Colton of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit that states that
Mike ``should serve his probationary period outside of Palm Beach
County and/or in an area other than where the victim in this case
resides.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a comfort _ but not a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy looks out the window, ticks off recent developments:
Mikey's night terrors are worse. Lindsey still cries a lot. Sandy
still hides in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   But some good things have happened, too, and in Sandy's mind
these are worth remarking upon, because it has been a very long
time since she has been able to list so many.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy took all the kids to Kmart, and right there in the middle
of the aisle, Lindsey crossed her arms and said, ``We're not
leaving, Mom, until you buy yourself something nice,'' and that is
how Sandy got her new pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney got student of the month, and Sandy posted the
certificate on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Matt took Sandy to sit for a practice exam to earn her GED, and
she couldn't believe it but she did really well.
</P>
<P>
   And here's some news. Sandy heard it through the grapevine,
confirmed it with a probation officer. Mike Jones met somebody, got
serious fast _ and just got married.
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy Ham, 10th Circuit administrator for the Department of
Corrections, asks Mike if he will talk to a reporter for a story
about Sandy, he declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned that he doesn't want to cause any more pain and
confusion for his children,'' Ham says.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy pauses a long time when she hears this.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great,'' she finally says. ``If it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday. Dead summer. She sees him.
</P>
<P>
   He is backing a white van into his cousin's driveway, a few
blocks from her apartment, and when she passes by on her way to a
manicure, God as her witness, he leans out and waves.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike all right, she tells herself.
</P>
<P>
   She recognizes his smile.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike.
</P>
<P>
   She's 100 percent certain.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Manning floors it, and after she adjusts the rearview
mirror, she takes a good long look back.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7, 1998. On the Saturday morning Sandy Manning left
Florida, she packed six worn suitcases and three pillows for the
kids, and she said her goodbyes on the phone and in her sister's
living room, and if she cried once she cried a dozen times. And
then she loaded everybody up in a little gray station wagon for the
ride to the Amtrak station, where in the few minutes she had while
waiting for the Silver Service she opened up the newspaper and
checked her horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``Let go.''
</P>
<P>
   She had whispered about the plan for days, weeks, months. For a
long time, nobody thought she was serious; after all, she had left
town once before, a few years ago, only to come back a short time
later. So saying a thing and doing it are two different
enterprises, as Sandy Manning will tell you. But she will tell you,
too, that sometimes you have to do a thing, even if you're not
absolutely positive it is the right thing, because when you examine
your options you realize you have no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   So she had thought it all out. She had her priorities. And her
first priority was not to run into Mike Jones on her way to a nail
appointment. Or at the Texaco. Or anywhere else, for that matter.
Her first priority was not to run into him at all.
</P>
<P>
   And so on Halloween night, Sandy's family threw her a going-away
party at a karaoke joint, and since Sandy is a woman who
appreciates symbolism, she sang the old Gladys Knight hit about
leaving on a midnight train to Georgia. And right then, everyone
knew her departure was a sure thing, sure and true.
</P>
<P>
   Where she went, that's a secret. Just say it's a place far, far
away. A place where she has people who care about her and the
prospect of a good job. A place where she will live in a nice house
in a safe neighborhood, and the kids will have their own bedrooms,
freshly painted in their favorite colors, and out back there will
be a trampoline to jump on before they do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon Sandy left town _ one year and a day after Mike
Jones went free _ her train stopped in a Central Florida town where
the sun cut dappled patterns on the cobblestone as she and her
children walked toward Pizza Hut for one last celebration. If you
are going to do a thing, Sandy figured, it is best to do it right.
So she put a dollar in the jukebox, and Tracy Chapman belted out
Give me one reason to stay here. And everybody thought the pizza
tasted so, so good.
</P>
<P>
   After that they were on the train again. The kids pressed their
faces against the glass and smiled at the glittery night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way, babies,'' Sandy said.
</P>
<P>
   And when in the mist of the dawn the train whisked across the
state line, carrying them up and away, she sank to her knees on the
cold, rattling floor, unfolded a note she had written to God, and
prayed.

 &HT;    Weird, wacky and so South Park Off-color and on target
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gratuitous locker-room offensiveness spun around as
sophisticated chaos, Comedy Central's ``South Park'' is the kiddie
cartoon from hell: a shock-the-bourgeoisie spoof of pop-culture
that's outrageous but also sweet at its core. Likewise, the
inevitable soundtrack spin-off seems like a goof but boasts more
than a weird, eclectic all-star cast (can't think of the last time
I heard Elton John and former Clash frontman Joe Strummer on the
same album). It's actually pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Hayes, the '70s soul great who lends his rumbling bass
voice to the show's omnipresent Chef, gets the meatiest material _
not much of which can be alluded to in a family newspaper _ and
there's some easy laughs as some of ``South Park's'' kiddie
characters obliterate Styx's ``Come Sail Away'' and Bad Company's
``Feel Like Makin' Love.'' The surprises, though, are hilariously
bizarre groupings _ Ozzy Osbourne and Ol' Dirty Bastard? _ and
blast-from-the-past R&AMP;B nostalgia moments, as when Rick James and
Ike Turner hook up to sing ``Love Gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   And who more appropriate than Master P to revisit ``Freddie's
Dead,'' only now called ``Kenny's Dead,'' in homage to the
unfortunate South Parker whose sudden and often violent death is a
staple of each show?

 &HT;    `Old Dogs' wag some wicked tongues
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was Nashville's Outlaws, then came the Highwaymen
and now come the Old Dogs: Waylon Jennings, Mel Tillis, Bobby Bare
and Jerry Reed. Their satirical concern is not growing gracefully
old, but of glibly defying age (``We can still bury a bone. . .''),
love (``She'd rather be homeless than here at home with me. . .'')
and changing musical mores (``Elvis has left the building and
you're stuck with me. . .'').
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, they take a few shots at Music City USA (``Nashville
is rough on the living, but she sure speaks well of the dead . .
.'') and reach the inevitable conclusion: They never expected to
live this long, but are ``Still Gonna Die.'' They're at their best
baying individually rather than attempting harmony, with Jennings
and Bare's sly styles meshing perfectly with lyricist Shel
Silverstein's wicked words. Radio may pass on these non-hunks'
humor, but country fans are sure to howl with them.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the fall, homeowners often awaken to find their windows
fogged over. In the winter, the windows may be covered with a thin
layer of frost. Both the fog and the frost are examples of
condensation. It occurs when moisture, in the form of invisible
vapor in the warm interior air, meets with the cold surface of the
window pane.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate condensation is not a cause for concern as long as it
evaporates when the windows warm up, but in extreme cases it may
not dry up. Then it will collect and run down to soak the window
sash and sill. Heavy persistent condensation will flow past the
sill to saturate the wall. Damp walls will encourage mold and
mildew. Eventually the moisture will penetrate through the walls
and rot the framing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, condensation is not always as obvious as foggy or
frosted windows. Sometimes the warm moist air penetrates through
the wallboard into the wall cavities. Here it meets with cold air
and condenses as water droplets on the wall insulation. This
moisture may eventually dry out during the spring and summer months
or it may remain and eventually cause the quality of the insulation
to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Condensation is rarely a problem in the spring or the summer
because the outside air never gets cold enough to cool and condense
the vapor in the warm indoor air. In the fall, all homes will have
some condensation because there is a certain amount of residual
moisture left in the air from the hot humid days of summer. In
time, with adequate ventilation, this will dissipate and the
condensation should cease. In winter months condensation may become
an annoying problem because there is not enough ventilation to
remove the moist air. The problem may be exacerbated when a variety
of indoor sources add to the humidity in the air.
</P>
<P>
   One way to prevent condensation is by lowering the humidity.
This is not as easy as it sounds because ordinary activities like
cooking and showering add significant amounts of moisture to the
air. Opening a window for five minutes after cooking or showering
may be enough to flush out the moist air. A better solution,
however, would be to install exhaust fans over the stove and in the
bathroom. These would pull the moisture out without introducing
cold air into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Exhaust fans are effective in pulling out the damp air, but they
could cause backdrafting in some homes. The air that pulled out by
exhaust fans must be replaced. Backdrafting occurs when the
replacement air is sucked in through the chimney or furnace flue.
It is not a significant problem in older homes because replacement
air usually comes through gaps and cracks around the windows and
doors. Newer homes are tightly constructed so they have far less
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   You can test for backdrafting by holding a smoking incense stick
below the chimney flue. If the smoke from the stick is drawn into
the house, there is a backdrafting problem. Opening a window will
alleviate the problem, but this is only a short-term solution. The
best way to solve the backdrafting problem is to consult with a
heating professional about installing ductwork to provide fresh air
directly to the furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential source of indoor moisture is the clothes
dryer. Make sure it is properly vented to the outside; otherwise
all the moisture from the freshly washed clothes will be discharged
into the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Houseplants can also throw off a lot of moisture. If possible
limit the number of plants in your home or place most of the plants
in a separate room and run a dehumidifier periodically. Operating a
dehumidifier may seem like the best way to remove moisture from the
air, but beware, it can drive electric bills up.
</P>
<P>
   Ground moisture seeping up from the soil in a crawl space or
through a concrete floor can also add considerable amounts of
moisture to the air. In the crawl space lay down sheets of 6 mil
polyethylene over the ground. Seal concrete floors and walls with a
moisture sealer. In addition, check the ground slope around your
home. It should slope away from the house so that all rainwater
drains away.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources of indoor moisture may surprise you. Storing large
amounts of green firewood in the basement may increase the relative
humidity by as much as 15 percent. The obvious solution is to store
most of the wood outdoors or in the garage. A large aquarium can
add to the humidity as the water in the tank evaporates. Placing a
cover across the top of the tank will contain most of that
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that reducing indoor humidity is important if
condensation is a problem. If not, then making the air too dry _
less than 40 percent humidity _ can create respiratory and allergy
problems.

   This musical souvenir from a televised special that first aired
on TNT in April finds a bevy of past and present stars paying
tribute to Burt Bacharach's mighty canon of elegant pop hits. Not
many of them can pull off the sexy, swingin' '60s tone of the
songs. Sheryl Crow tentatively trips through ``One Less Bell to
Answer,'' while bimbo-pop vocal group All Saints completely
flattens ``Always Something There to Remind Me.'' But full-throated
crooners Chrissie Hynde and Wynonna nail the sumptuous ache of
``Baby It's You'' and ``Anyone Who Had a Heart,'' respectively.

   Freshman efforts are rarely this confident and inventive. These
ingenious Athenians(Ga.) take Indonesian instruments (talempong
nipple gongs, anyone?), throw in the Germanic trance rock of '70s
pioneers Can and rock it up with the hard-hitting drums of Mischo
McKay. There are also hints of Chicago post-rock experimentalists
Tortoise and the anarchic pop of Brian Eno-era Roxy Music. From
these influences, McKay and multi-instrumentalists Joshua McKay
(Mischo's brother) and Kai Riedl have created a singular sound that
has sprung fully formed on their first release. Get a good seat on
this band's wagon now, because it's likely to get crowded.

 &HT;    `Bug's Life' leads soundtrack parade
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the advent of movies as big-screen jukeboxes in the early
1980s (``Flashdance,'' ``The Big Chill'') cinematic scores have
given way to hit parades (really, a new kind of product placement).
The latest batch of ``original soundtrack'' albums has arrived, and
one _ composer Randy Newman's charming score for ``A Bug's Life''
(Walt Disney, 20 tracks) _ is, actually, original. More typical is
the sugary oldies revue of ``You've Got Mail'' (Warner
Sunset/Atlantic, 15 tracks), with puppy-cute fluff from Harry
Nilsson, Bobby Darin and Jimmy Durante to match puppy-cute stars
Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. . . . Adam Sandler's puppy-cute, too, but
he's not housebroken, so the soundtrack for ``The Waterboy''
(Hollywood, 13 tracks) rocks out like a frat row beer blast with
tunes from Joe Walsh, Rush, Creedence Clearwater Revival and the
Doors . . . The murderous new theme for the remake of ``Psycho''
(Geffen, 14 tracks) is twisted tunesmith Danny Elfman's winking
homage to Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrmann. The ironic tone is
constant (remakes of ``Psycho Killer'' and the spooky country
ballad ``Psycho''). Best track is Steve Earle's haunting ``All of
My Life.'' . . . Tunes from the British art film ``Little Voice''
(Capitol, 11 tracks) revel in show-biz camp and brassy melodrama, a
reminder of the days when divas (Judy Garland, Billie Holiday)
really were.

HOW CHESTNUTS FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS _ AND RETURNED

   The chestnut is back.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the mighty chestnut was, if not the backbone, at
least one of the vertebrae of American food, both native and
Europeanized.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans used the whole nuts as vegetables and also
ground them to make flour for bread. The Europeans who arrived
later cooked with the nuts in the same manner and also introduced a
sweetened paste version in desserts. In eastern America, the nuts
were harvested and used as a cash crop, shipped off to cities such
as New York, Boston and Philadelphia, where they were roasted, sold
by vendors and eaten right out of the shell.
</P>
<P>
   The trees, called ghost redwoods, were mammoth, averaging 5 feet
in diameter and up to 100 feet tall. But mighty as they were, the
trees _ along with the nuts that fed man and forest wildlife _
began to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   In 1904, the chestnut blight first appeared at the Bronx Zoo.
Imported Chinese chestnut trees carried a virulent bark fungus that
killed virtually all the native American chestnut trees. By 1950,
few remained.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in your very own supermarket, there the nuts are, in
among the pecans, the almonds and the cashews. Retailing for about
$4 a pound, chestnuts are starting to crack their way back into
American traditions. Most of the chestnuts we see in the
supermarkets are imported, but American growers are doing their
part to bring back the ``king of trees.'' The American Chestnut
Foundation is one operation promoting the planting of new
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   If chestnuts are new to you, here's what to look for. Shells
should have a little ``give.'' If the shell is firm, the chestnuts
may need to ripen longer.
</P>
<P>
   Store the nuts in the refrigerator or freezer. When they are
ready to cook, wipe off any dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnuts must be scored before cooking. To do this, make an
``X'' with a sharp knife on the flat side of the nut. (If you don't
do this, the nuts will explode when heated.)
</P>
<P>
   In the oven: Lay nuts in one layer in ovenproof dish. Bake at
325 degrees for about 20 minutes. Peel when cool to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   In the fireplace: Use a long-handled pan for roasting chestnuts,
or use a fireplace popcorn basket. Don't overcrowd pan. Shake the
pan as you would popcorn, and hold pan just above flame, not in it.
Nuts should be done in about 15 minutes, or when the outside shell
is black. Remove nuts from pan and peel as soon as they are cool to
the touch.
</P>
<P>
   On the stove top: Place nuts in one loose layer in a heavy pan _
cast-iron is best. Cook over medium heat while shaking the pan.
Cook until you can smell the nuts.

</P>
<P>
   You don't need special equipment to roast chestnuts, but it
certainly brings a little extra glamour to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Sur La Table, a mail-order operation based in Seattle, has just
opened a store in Dallas. The store stocks chestnut roasting pans
(a metal skillet with holes in the bottom called a ``rotisseur
marron'' by the French) that sell for $9.95. Pick one up at 4527
Travis St., Suite A, in the Knox-Henderson retail district, (214)
219-4404, or order by calling (800) 243-0852.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma also carries a chestnut cooker in its catalog.
The lidded stoneware roaster is meant for the oven and is packaged
with 2 pounds of chestnuts for $44. The roaster, sans nuts, is
$24.50. The company also sells a hooked knife for scoring the tough
nuts; it's $5. Call (800) 541-2233.

A COWBOY'S HAUTE CUISINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE AUTHORS: Grady Spears is the hometown boy who happens to be
executive chef at Fort Worth's celebrated Reata, the cowboy-cuisine
restaurant that has earned some mighty nice press this year from
Texas Monthly, Gourmet and other magazines. Spears was punching
cows at an area ranch before he stumbled into the restaurant
business about a decade ago, and he is poised to take his upscale
home-cooking concept to a Beverly Hills Reata next spring. Robb
Walsh is an Austin-based food writer who recently won a James Beard
Journalism Award and whose work is frequently seen in American Way
magazine and heard on NPR's ``Weekend Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FORMAT: This beautiful 212-page hardback features stunning
photography by Marathon-based shooter James Evans, who offers
landscapes and personality portraits from West Texas, where Spears
discovered his passion for cooking. Lovely food pictures done by
Dallas photographer Dick Patrick make you want to cook up some of
Spears' spicy tomato soup and catfish cakes as quickly as possible.
Ten chapters of recipes range from ``Scorching a Steak'' and
``Chuck-Wagon Game Birds and Seafood'' to ``Ranch-House Soups and
Salads'' and ``Pies, Sweets, and Cowboy Coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Each chapter has an intro _ written in a folksy way, so reading
it is much like listening to Spears' friendly drawl _ that
describes how the chef observed and learned various cooking methods
taken from years of Texas traditions. But don't skip the main
introduction, Spears' genuine, aw-shucks reflection on his amazing
food career. Loath to take much credit for his own success, Spears
likewise credits Walsh for making the book work: ``Robb was the one
to put the puzzle together. I had no idea what I was doing _ and
still don't. I'm just lucky,'' Spears says.
</P>
<P>
   THE RECIPES: What's best about the recipes is that the
self-taught Spears made them user-friendly for the home cook; not
even the bock-battered quail with cider adobo looks threatening. As
often as possible, he has kept the ingredient list fairly short and
accessible, and there are never 15 or 20 steps in the directions.
The only hitch is in those occasional recipes that refer you to
other recipes for an ingredient, such as red chile sauce or roasted
shallots.
</P>
<P>
   THE AUDIENCE: Anyone who likes flavorful, hearty and fattening
foods _ Spears never met a stick of butter or jug of cream he
didn't add to a dish _ will have a ball with this book. And talk
about impressing dinner guests: Unless your friends have eaten at
Reata, they won't have experienced cornmeal-crusted oysters or
oven-roasted pork tenderloin with apple-poblano chutney.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO FIND THE BOOK: Spears says the book should be in
bookstores before Christmas.

   JALAPENO BEEF STEW
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   6 shallots, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 pound beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   4 jalapeno chiles, stemmed and seeded
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch rounds
</P>
<P>
   1 large potato, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red onion, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup port
</P>
<P>
   2 cups beef stock and 2 cups canned beef broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dried oregano leaves
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste; freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Toss shallots with olive oil, place
them in a small pan, and toast them in the oven for 35 minutes or
until they are soft and brown. Heat butter in a large, deep
saucepan (one that has a cover) over medium heat. While the butter
is melting, toss beef cubes with flour to coat. Place beef in hot
butter, increase the heat, and saute the cubes on all sides for 5
minutes for rare and longer for more well-done. Do not crowd the
meat, or it will steam rather than brown. Remove the pan from the
heat, transfer meat to a bowl, cover it loosely with foil to keep
it warm, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the jalapenos. Place pan over medium heat, and in the
remaining butter, saute chiles, carrots, potato and onion, tossing
to prevent burning, until onions turn translucent. Add the wine,
stock or broth, sage and oregano, stirring gently on the bottom of
the pan to release any solidified pan juices. Cook stew over low
heat, with the lid slightly ajar, for 40 minutes. Add the reserved
shallots and the beef, stir to combine, and continue cooking for an
additional 20 minutes. Test to see if meat and vegetables are done.
Season with salt and pepper.

   In many houses, there (italics)is(end italics) a mouse stirring
this holiday season: the one attached to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is being used for one-click gift ordering, with the promise
of avoiding crowded malls and traffic jams and the hope of finding
last-minute purchases on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   On-line holiday purchases are expected to double compared with
last year, said Nick Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a market
research company in San Francisco. And while online shopping will
still account for only a small part of holiday purchases, wired
merchants and investors have been salivating over the potential
increases.
</P>
<P>
   But can shopping on line really make the last-minute rush
easier? A sampling of shopping sites and interviews with Internet
retailing experts suggests the answer is yes _ at least for
products that can be found on the Web and especially for
near-last-minute purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that many items are not easily available on line,
that Web traffic itself can suffer from jams and that most of the
things you click your mouse on still have to be delivered by
trains, planes or trucks.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the season's shopping experience, Internet retailers
have developed gift registries, gift suggestions for stumped
shoppers and even live customer service _ just like stores. And the
number of Web retailers grows every year, increasing selection and
competition.
</P>
<P>
   There are big and efficient online sellers for books, CDs and
computer equipment, and many sites offer electronic cards and gift
certificates. There are even games that can be downloaded,
theoretically, the night before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for grown-ups who would rather visit a root canal
specialist than a toy store in the next two weeks, there is
www.etoys.com, which promises that ``Santa can go to bed early this
year.'' Toys are categorized by age, and pages describe what awards
each toy has won.
</P>
<P>
   At www.toysrus.com, the Toys `R' Us site, you can check the baby
registry created (off line) by the moms of the munchkins you're
shopping for. At www.justpretend.com, (``toys and playthings that
inspire imagination and creativity'') there are five sets of
specialized dress-up sets, with reversible wizard-or-princess hats.
</P>
<P>
   For those with quirkier tastes, sites can be found offering
four-pound fruitcakes, fancy sports equipment, foreign musical
instruments and rare videos.
</P>
<P>
   Books are among the biggest-selling items on line, with
Amazon.com and the Barnes &AMP; Noble site as two major places geared
toward last-minute book buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to take a two- or three-week period of hell and
turn it into 15 minutes of a pretty good time,'' said David Risher,
senior vice president of Amazon.com, as he tripped through Web
screens in his Seattle office, demonstrating how to give a present
in the fewest possible seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you're in a big hurry,'' he went on. ``We have a
feature on the Web site, Gift Click. You can do it Christmas
morning.'' The function tells your recipients via e-mail that you
are sending presents and lets them do the pesky work of filling in
the mailing addresses. For purchasers who put their credit card
numbers on file, it's one-click shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, in addition to offering ``buy now and get a free
book'' deals for new customers, (www.barnesandnoble.com) posts a
chart of the last day you can order a book in stock for Christmas
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation for online shoppers is the gift registry. One
example is the Wish List offered by iQVC, the Web version of
television's QVC home shopping channel. About 10,000 people have
signed up to use it, said Stuart Spiegel, vice president and
general manager for iQVC.
</P>
<P>
   At iQVC's jewelry site (www.gemsandjewels.com), those who think
it's blessed enough to receive can leave very specific instructions
on what they want, right down to ring size, favorite stone and
preferred designer. Those who are going for the greater blessings
of giving use the password of the person who registered to find out
which precious stone to concentrate on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different from that magazine left on the coffee table
a little too long opened to the right thing,'' Spiegel said. ``It
is a fun way to point people in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar service is offered at Eddie Bauer
(www.eddiebauer.com), where you can send out e-mail announcements
to friends about what you want from the store. They're not subtle:
``Hi from (my email address) (my name)! I have an Eddie Bauer Wish
List at http://www.eddiebauer.com. Just go to `Wish Lists.' ...''
The message includes the wisher's password to get access to the
list, but not so much as a ``please'' or ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another helpful feature for buying off the Web are shopping
agents, programs that search commercial sites and come back with a
list of items and prices, which can certainly reduce fingertip
fatigue. One, www.mysimon.com, will even search for the best
bargains for the objects you desire, then let you sent the results
via e-mail straight to people who have you on their gift lists.
</P>
<P>
   Some online sites have gone so retro that they are providing
actual human beings, through chat or e-mail, to help shoppers.
During limited hours you can try live customer service at
Azazz.com, an Internet-based department store that offers
housewares, apparel and home office supplies, with free shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Adatom.com, which offers brand-name furniture, linens
and toys direct from the factory. The humans function much like the
programs that are always available at sites like Amazon, which
provide suggestions for other books or movies a ``Beloved'' or
``Titanic'' fan might like.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would rather decorate the house with all that time
freed up by not shopping, you can buy live Christmas trees and
wreaths or artificial trees that arrive at your door already strung
with lights. Then try poring over the numbing prospect of 26
different kinds of angel ornaments available at Christmasdepot.com:
(mauve satin, peach satin, pink satin, red lame starburst, red
sparkle, red velvet, silver lame, silver lame starburst, etc.) At
the Menorah.net site, candle holders are available in three-, six-
and nine-foot models.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the less delightful aspects of holiday shopping exist on
the Web as well, like piped-in tinny Christmas carols and traffic
that can be heavy at peak hours, slowing things to a crawl. And
every once in a while you might see the screen message, ``Please
contact the server administrator and inform them of the time the
error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have
caused the error.'' So much for the customer is always right.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is never as smooth as it could be, and shopping is no
different. It can be just as hard to find some things on line as
off.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for the father who wants a video of the 1939 (not
the 1978) version of the English drama ``The Four Feathers,'' a
search through Reel.com, Amazon.com, and MySimon yielded two sites
advertising VHS versions of the flick, (both were out of stock),
and one offering a laser disk, (too high-tech for Papa). Then
again, he hasn't been able to find it in a real store, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Web can be very useful for finding obscure items. Frith
Maier of Seattle had her heart set on a heated toilet seat, like
one she had enjoyed while visiting Japan, for her sister's outhouse
in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   After calling plumbing supply companies with no luck, she found
one on the site of ToTo Toilets. The catch was that the seat,
equipped with an extra device that delivers a puff of warm air,
cost $900.
</P>

   If you want a used cello (knock-knock.com/mie/cellos.htm) or a
bodhran, (www.bodhran.com) an ancient Celtic drum, your selection
will likely be greater than can be found by skimming your local
classifieds. Bodhrans, which are made of goat skin stretched over a
wooden frame, abound on the web, from Ireland to Massachusetts to
Prince George, B.C., with air mail delivery times as short as three
days.
</P>
<P>
   For kids who need a specific brand of soccer ball, beyond what
the mall stores sell, Soccer.com, for example, offers more than 25
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Since online orders can be entered and registered so quickly,
consumers can be forgiven for believing they can put off their
shopping to the very last minute. Land's End's site,
www.landsend.com, announces how many ``shipping days left!'' until
Christmas, and Christmasdepot.com counts down the very seconds.
</P>
<P>
   For Father's Day, Amazon.com processed lots of same-day sales,
with gift certificate orders coming in via e-mail that morning, and
being sent out the same hour, Risher said. The same is expected on
Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   With the under-$1,000 computer hoping to attain Most Favored
Donation status, computer sites on the Web are revving up for a
high-volume December.
</P>
<P>
   Computershopper.com, on its holiday gift ideas pages, gives
hints on how to buy someone a PC and have it last longer than a
year. But earlier this week CompUSA, in its holiday Web section,
listed a few items that were already out of stock and on backorder.
</P>
<P>
   One big site selling computers, Cyberian Outpost,
(www.outpost.com), has warehouses and shippers located together and
offers next day delivery for items ordered up until midnight
Eastern time. And with the wide variety of software available there
and from other sites to download onto kids' computers, a popular
game could arrive this Christmas morning via the phone line,
instead of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   There are other aspects of the holidays that the Web can help
with, of course, like planning dinner. Where else but on line could
you find a recipe for Channukah Candle Salad
(www.pastrywiz.com/archive/channuka.htm) that features half a
banana stuck in a pineapple ring, topped with a gumdrop, with mayo
dripping down to represent melted wax, and a green pepper handle
for the candle holder?
</P>
<P>
   And what brick-and-mortar store could boast as many kinds of
fruitcake as the Web sells, with Miss Melba's Olde Timey,
Monastery, Gloria's Classic, Babs' Jamaican, Sunshine Hollow's Real
Handmade Pecan four-pounder, and Carolyn's Cajun (from Cut Off,
La.)?
</P>
<P>
   And for when the holiday hangover clears, there's always the
return policy to think about. At www.azazz.com and Cyberian
Outpost, returns are accepted for any reason. Amazon.com asks no
questions about returned books, though CDs and videos need to be
unopened.
</P>
<P>
   A pre-printed packing slip for returns comes with every order.
Beats driving downtown, parking, and having to look someone in the
eye and explain why that gift from your beloved isn't a keeper.

   &UR; Paperwhite Splendor &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year, I planted 25 Ziva white-flowered paperwhites in
three bulb pans. I watered them thoroughly and kept them in a dark,
55-degree room for five to six weeks before bringing them out into
a sunny room. The 25 bulbs had 24 flower clusters, about eight per
tray, yet bulb catalogs have photos of pots covered with masses of
blooms. Are there tricks the pros use to get more flowers?
</P>
<P>
   A. When you think about how many bulbs, rhizomes and whatnots
are stuffed in the average gardener's refrigerator or out on the
porch this time of year, paperwhite narcissus are just about the
friendliest; very agreeable to work with. Dr. August De Hertogh, a
professor of horticulture at North Carolina State University in
Raleigh, and author of ``Holland Bulb Forcer's Guide,'' the
floricultural industry's bulb bible, said that paperwhites, unlike
most bulbs, don't need any dark or cooling period when you buy
them. Just pot them up in pebbles or a well-drained potting medium,
water them and put them on the windowsill.
</P>
<P>
   My suspicion is that your bulbs were on the small end of the
size range. With smaller bulbs, one stalk a bulb is about it. Look
for what the industry calls top-size bulbs, about six and a half to
seven inches around. At that size, the norm is two stalks a bulb,
with the occasional third. Or look for Galil, sometimes sold as
Galilee, a paperwhite that produces more florets, is shorter than
Ziva and has a lighter fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   But for a real eye-popping display, do what some catalog
photographers have been known to do _ cut a few extra stalks and
prop them up in the pot alongside the other bulbs. Looks
spectacular, at least for the time it takes to snap the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers for Galilee paperwhites include the Charles H. Mueller
Co., 7091 North River Rd., New Hope, Pa. 18938, (888) 594-2852; and
French's Bulb Importer, P.O. Box 565, Pittsfield, Vt. 05762; (800)

 &HT;    `Bug's Life' leads soundtrack parade
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the advent of movies as big-screen jukeboxes in the early
1980s (``Flashdance,'' ``The Big Chill'') cinematic scores have
given way to hit parades (really, a new kind of product placement).
The latest batch of ``original soundtrack'' albums has arrived, and
one _ composer Randy Newman's charming score for ``A Bug's Life''
(Walt Disney, 20 tracks) _ is, actually, original. More typical is
the sugary oldies revue of ``You've Got Mail'' (Warner
Sunset/Atlantic, 15 tracks), with puppy-cute fluff from Harry
Nilsson, Bobby Darin and Jimmy Durante to match puppy-cute stars
Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. . . . Adam Sandler's puppy-cute, too, but
he's not housebroken, so the soundtrack for ``The Waterboy''
(Hollywood, 13 tracks) rocks out like a frat row beer blast with
tunes from Joe Walsh, Rush, Creedence Clearwater Revival and the
Doors . . . The murderous new theme for the remake of ``Psycho''
(Geffen, 14 tracks) is twisted tunesmith Danny Elfman's winking
homage to Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrmann. The ironic tone is
constant (remakes of ``Psycho Killer'' and the spooky country
ballad ``Psycho''). Best track is Steve Earle's haunting ``All of
My Life.'' . . . Tunes from the British art film ``Little Voice''
(Capitol, 11 tracks) revel in show-biz camp and brassy melodrama, a
reminder of the days when divas (Judy Garland, Billie Holiday)
really were.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ History arises at unexpected moments. For the
descendants of Abraham and Fannie Rogarshevsky, it came between the
dill pickles and the corned beef sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Family memories, some of them coaxed over lunch, have been
indispensable in recreating the Rogarshevskys' tiny three-room
Orchard Street apartment, circa 1918, a permanent exhibit (and the
fifth apartment the museum has restored in its 1863 red-brick
landmark) opening Thursday at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.
</P>
<P>
   At a family reunion at the museum last spring, where the
conversation also drifted to the Rogarshevsky women's gorgeous
complexions, 77-year-old Florence Rosenthal recalled how, as a
young girl, she used to sit on the tenement's steps coloring
lingerie brochures with crayons because the family couldn't afford
coloring books. Roby Langert, 53, remembered the precious pennies
her great-grandma Fannie kept in a jar.
</P>
<P>
   For Arnold Rosenthal, 75, the essence of the place was ``the
people coming and going, the gossip.'' As he poked around the
apartment, he wasn't thinking about how a family of eight made do
in 325 square feet but about what his uncle used to say in praise
of baldness: ``Grass doesn't grow on a busy street!''
</P>
<P>
   Piece by piece, Pamela Keech, the consulting curator, has been
untangling the family memories, some more reliable than others due
to the passage of time. Abraham and Fannie Rogarshevsky's
descendants (the name was changed to Rosenthal in the 1920s ) were
tracked down through advertising in the Forward newspaper and
Modern Maturity magazine. At times, the process has resembled the
traditional prenuptial ball of knots, like the one Fannie presented
to her prospective daughter-in-law. ``If my mother could sit there
and unknot them,'' said Nathalie Dickstein, ``it would prove to
Grandma that she was patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stories have been one element in an elaborate tapestry of
sources _ including crime-scene photographs of similar apartments _
that Ms. Keech used to recreate the apartment as it looked on July
12, 1918, when Abraham, a garment presser, died of tuberculosis at
age 45. In this fragment of frozen time, the Rogarshevskys are
sitting shiva _ observing the Jewish rituals of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing the apartment, Ms. Keech's task was to unearth
the material culture of the poor and working class, what she calls
``the decorative arts history that nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Though conditions at 97 Orchard St. were harsh (indoor toilets
did not arrive until 1905, and then only in hallways), the visual
richness of the decor has surprised curators and counters images of
a spare tenement life popularized by photodocumentarians like Jacob
Riis. During excavations of the apartment where Fannie resided
until 1941, some 22 layers of wallpaper were discovered: they were
changed as often as every two years. Elsewhere in the building,
gold leaf touches and bronzing powder on picture rails have been
found. Decoration was the bane of housing reformers, who loathed
clutter and advocated pristine rooms with white walls. ``All our
research has consistently challenged notions of what tenement life
was like,'' said Renee Epps, the museum's vice president. ``Squalor
was an atypical situation. Families like the Rogarshevskys were
house proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Telz, Lithuania, the
Rogarshevskys moved into the building with their four boys and two
girls in 1910. They were one of the largest families in the
building, which was home to a total of about 10,000 people between
1863 and 1935 (Fannie stayed on as caretaker for six years after it
officially closed). Fannie and Abraham slept in the back room
facing the air shaft, an amenity for ventilation introduced after
the passage of the 1901 Tenement Housing Law, which also brought
cold running water into each apartment. Ida and Bessie slept on a
folding cot in the kitchen. The four boys slept in the living room
across a single couch, which they extended by placing four chairs
alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keech's primary source was Evelyn Wallach, the
daughter-in-law who successfully untied the ball of knots. She was
the only eyewitness to how the apartment looked in 1918, and she
shared her memories with the museum before she died, at age 96{.
She spoke of the folding cot against the interior window and of
Fannie's coal stove, which was always immaculate _ ``shiny black.''
</P>
<P>
   To supplement recollections, Ms. Keech consulted 1918 tenement
crime scene photographs from the municipal archives. In contrast to
family photos, for which interiors were often spruced up, to
portray their lives in the best light, black-and-white crime
photographs ``show the way apartments really looked,'' she
explained. ``The people were killed, so they didn't fix up things
up first.'' The photos _ she tries to ignore the blood _ inspired
several decorating choices in the restored Rogarshevsky living
room, including calendars as wall decor, shelves with lace edging
and the placement of pictures high on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   One of the family's concerns was that the apartment accurately
reflect Fannie and Abraham's poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there carpeting?'' Steve Long, director of the museum's
resource and study center, asked 67 year-old Mrs. Dickstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linoleum,'' she answered. ``We couldn't afford carpeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the curtains have tie-backs? ``No tie-backs _ no way,'' she
replied.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Rogarshevskys' decor would have come from secondhand
furniture peddlers, so Ms. Keech looked for objects ``with dings.''
To find appropriate period furniture on a budget of $3,000, she
scoured flea markets all over the region, carrying photocopies from
catalogs of merchandise (some of it redeemable with soap coupons).
She was also on the trail of folk remedies and obscure antique
medical items such as a 1918 creosote decongestant. The family
donated some items, such as a white enamelware pail used for
salting kosher meat. (Still being sought: a Lithuanian pushka, or
charity box, which the family might have had for money they raised
to send to the famous yeshiva back in Telz.)
</P>
<P>
   The apartment walls themselves had to reflect imperfect tenement
craftsmanship. Basing his work on existing fragments in the
building, Kevin Groves, the preservation consultant, re-created the
uneven plasterwork and wallpaper edging. Some existing
imperfections, such as a crack in a kitchen cabinet window were
preserved as ``areas of record.''
</P>
<P>
   While excavating plaster, Groves discovered horsehair was used
as binder. To rebuild several walls, he imported horsehair from his
daughter's riding stable in Orange County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Within these walls, Jewish mourning rituals will be interpreted
for visitors. Reflections about sitting shiva were gleaned from
family members at the reunion lunch, which resembled seder dinners,
complete with ancient hurts and dominant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma always liked Henry's side of the family better,'' Mrs.
Dickstein said over lunch, to no one in particular, referring to
her great-uncle, Abraham's brother. ``When they came over, that's
when the matzo meal for the pancakes came out.''
</P>
<P>
   She also affectionately described her cousin Albert, now 73, who
owned a lingerie store right on Orchard Street. ``He could look at
a woman and tell you her bra size,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Rogarshevsky was a member of a landsmanshaft, an
association of immigrants from the same hometown, or shetl. When
someone died on the Lower East Side, ``the whole neighborhood came
to a halt,'' noted David Jacobson, the executive director of the
United Hebrew Community of New York, a major Jewish burial
organization. Jacobson advised the museum on Jewish burial customs,
probing the collective family memory. ``Did they wear slippers and
not shoes?'' he wanted to know (Yes). ``Did they tear the lapels on
their suit jackets?'' (a reference to another mourning custom of
tearing a garment toward the heart upon learning about a death).
</P>
<P>
   This week, its restoration concluded, the apartment was prepared
for mourning, the table set with hard-boiled eggs and bagels
shellacked for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing it for the first time, on Monday, Mrs. Dickstein said
with pride, ``Grandma is a folk hero.'' But she had some doubts
about the wallpaper _ the 14th layer uncovered, a dramatic red that
was once inexpensive but has been handscreened and put into
production by Scalamadre for $113 a roll as ``Rogarshevsky
Scroll.''
</P>
<P>
   She deemed it unquestionably ``gorgeous.'' ``But,'' she added
upon reflection, ``it's perhaps too rich-looking for Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Tours of the Rogarshevsky and other apartments at the Lower East
Side Tenement Museum, are given Tuesdays through Sundays. Tours
start at 90 Orchard St. Reservations are recommended: (212)

   The Diaries of John Rabe.

 &UR; By SHERYL WUDUNN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one years ago, Japanese soldiers captured the ancient
Chinese capital of Nan-king, torturing, raping and killing vast
numbers of people in one of the bloodiest massacres in modern
history. Yet there is a stunning difference of opinion on exactly
what took place. Some Japanese have tried to say -- perhaps
wishfully -- that the massacre never happened, while many Chinese
regard it as a symbol of Japanese brutality and one of the ugliest
landmarks of an ugly century.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there is a deep and divided body of literature on the Rape
of Nanking, as the incident has become known, but most of that
literature is, by necessity, dependent on secondary sources. That
is why ``The Good Man of Nanking'' soars above most of the rest.
Essentially the diaries of one man, John Rabe, a German businessman
for the Siemens China Company, the work is at once riveting,
inspiring, terrifying and tragically sad. It is also, in an odd
way, refreshing. For Rabe is modest, unpolemical. He is, by turns,
naive and cynical, generous and materialistic, outraged and calm.
His account is compassionate and, at times, humorous, with an
understated horror that seethes through the straightforward
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe not only witnessed the slaughter as the Japanese captured
Nanking (now known as Nanjing) in December 1937, he also saved the
lives of many people. By invoking the name of Hitler, he gained
tacit approval from the Japanese to set up a special safety zone
that ended up sheltering a couple of hundred thousand Chinese from
the rampaging Japanese soldiers. The zone lasted about four months.
</P>
<P>
   A Nazi who originally supported Hitler, Rabe chose not to flee
Nanjing with most of the other foreigners as the Japanese
approached. He remarked in his diary: ``I don't love being shelled
. . . but I simply cannot bring myself to save my skin just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rabe stayed behind in Nanjing to set up a small shelter,
which quickly expanded into a vast safety zone. He had his tussles
with the Chinese, particularly the Chinese troops, who kept
sneaking into his shelter, even digging trenches to secure safety
behind its walls. The Chinese military's presence, of course, made
the shelter a prime target for the Japanese, so Rabe wanted them
out.
</P>
<P>
   They did not leave, even as the Japanese began bombing their way
into the city. Mean-while, everyone else was pleading to be let
into the shelter. ``I can't listen to their wailing any longer, so
I open both gates and let everyone in who wants in,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   This was just the beginning of the chaos, though. Rabe's initial
hopes that the Japanese would capture the city peacefully -- their
planes dropped pamphlets saying that all civilians would be
``treated humanely in all respects'' -- soon gave way to
frustration, then horror and despair. ``We come across corpses
every 100 to 200 yards,'' he writes on Dec. 13, 1937, the day after
the Japanese took control. ``The bodies of civilians that I
examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had
presumably been fleeing and were shot from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese soldiers looted, smashed, burned people and buildings
-- whatever was in their way, whatever was their fancy, Rabe says.
They entered his safety zone to pillage, rape and murder. Just
behind Rabe's garden wall, a woman was raped and then wounded in
the neck with a bayonet. Nurses at the nearby hospital were also
violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been
raped, about 100 girls at Ginling Girls College alone,'' Rabe
reports on Dec. 17. ``You hear of nothing but rape. If husbands or
brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all
sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Japanese began burning down the city and the people in
it. When army officers demanded Chinese workers, a trusting Rabe
suggested where they could be found. Days later, he discovered that
43 of the 54 workers the Japanese had rounded up were led to the
riverbank and machine-gunned, ``ostensibly because they were the
employees of an enterprise managed by the Chinese Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe mentions one day when he was cleaning the safety zone: ``We
find many bodies in the ponds, civilians who have been shot (30 in
just one pond), most of them with their hands bound, some with
stones tied to their necks.'' At another time, he complains that 50
corpses lay unburied. At still another, he reports that a German
colleague saw 300 corpses in a dry ditch near one of the city
gates.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe records all sorts of atrocities: a woman is found dead with
a golf ball inside her vagina, another bayoneted there. ``You can't
breathe for sheer revulsion when you keep finding the bodies of
women with bamboo poles thrust up their vaginas,'' he writes.
``Even old women over 70 are constantly being raped.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rabe hears from a Japanese Foreign Ministry official
that Tokyo has asked for order to be restored. But he cannot get
approval even to bury the dead, and he points to ``the danger to
which we are all exposed as long as perhaps a thousand corpses are
lying about the city unburied.'' He continues: ``These corpses have
been partially eaten by dogs. At the same time, however, dog meat
is being sold by the Chinese in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nanjing starved, the crops outside the city walls lay rotting
because no one was allowed to go out to harvest them. Rabe surmises
that the Japanese wanted the Chinese to starve to death. He
compares the soldiers to the ``hordes of Genghis Khan'' and
laments: ``One might well believe the Japanese Army is made up of
ex-convicts. Normal people do not behave this way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing aspects of these diaries is that
while Rabe recounts tortures, rapes and mass murders by the
Japanese, he appears not to have seen many of the atrocities that
are commonly described by the Chinese themselves. There are no
accounts of live burials, mass disembowelments, deaths by freezing
or death by being eaten alive by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-NANKING-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: by dogs.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japanese soldiers would naturally have tried to avoid torturing
Chinese in front of foreign witnesses, but Rabe was also getting
reports of atrocities from his Chinese assistants. It is unlikely
that the book's editor, Erwin Wickert, who had known Rabe and
obtained the diaries from his granddaughter, would have left such
stories out. So it is probable that Rabe, who did not speak
Chinese, simply did not see these particular atrocities, or did not
dare to record them for some reason. It is also possible that these
crimes were committed in extreme secrecy. Or perhaps they did not
occur at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, an emotional debate rages over how many people
actually lost their lives at the hands of the Japanese. Some
Chinese estimates go as high as 200,000 to 300,000, a number that
was recently popularized by Iris Chang in her book, ``The Rape of
Nanking.'' In his diary, Rabe says that out of an initial
population of 1.2 million people, about 800,000 fled before Nanjing
was captured. He writes that about 250,000 ended up in his safety
zone, and though many were killed there, most survived. That would
leave about 150,000 people unaccounted for by Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   Basing his numbers on reports from one of the humanitarian
groups involved in burying the dead, Rabe estimates that a total of
50,000 to 60,000 people were actually killed, and those are the
numbers that he used when he returned to Germany and lectured on
his experiences in China. (When he tried to send a report of the
atrocities to Hitler, he was arrested and interrogated by the
Gestapo; upon his release, he stopped speaking publicly about
Nanjing.)
</P>

   Tales From Hospice.

<P>
   By A. G. Mojtabai.

 &UR; LIFE SUPPORT &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY HOFFMAN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Readers who turn glum at the prospect of a book entitled ``Soon:
Tales From Hospice'' should know that these stories aren't only
about dying; they're also about urgent living. In ``Last Things,''
a woman writes farewell letters filled with ``paper courage'' to
all of her friends; in ``Tour,'' a dying priest, drifting in a kind
of dream state, tries to make amends with the soul of a troubled
family member; in ``Greyhound,'' a man eaten up with cancer
remembers a bus trip when he fell in love with a girl, then let her
slip away. ``If he concentrates now,'' he tells himself, ``maybe he
can make things turn out different.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``hospice,'' A. G. Mojtabai explains in her preface,
``derived from the Latin hospitium, was traditionally used to refer
to a place of shelter, a place of rest, for pilgrims and travelers,
well or infirm.'' The hospice she writes about, in Amarillo, Tex.,
brings other Latin phrases to mind: tempus fugit; carpe diem.
</P>
<P>
   Mojtabai (the author of seven other books, including the novels
``Called Out'' and ``Ordinary Time'') has taken us behind
Amarillo's doorways before. In ``Blessed Assurance,'' published in
1986, she introduced readers to some of the workers at Pantex, the
final assembly plant for all United States nuclear weapons, where
they calmly awaited global annihilation, sustained by a strong
fundamentalist faith in their salvation after the coming
Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the patients in ``Soon,'' when faced with their own
personal annihilation, seem much less sanguine. Billy, the
tattooed, snakeskin-booted central character in ``Spring Me,'' is
``one of the meanest patients in the history of the unit.'' Acting
as if he's stepped out of a Larry L. King romp, Billy ``hollered
for booze, he hollered for the Playboy Channel.'' Chain-smoking in
the waiting room, he chooses filterless cigarettes since ``it
doesn't make a particle of difference by now.'' In his wheelchair,
waiting for a buddy to take him honky-tonking on Saturday night,
Billy yells to the nurses: ``Yessir . . . gonna hit the Crystal
Pistol tonight. Live it up tonight! Gonna have me a big time --
quality time!''
</P>
<P>
   In a story called ``Zone,'' the proudly agnostic Mr. Straughn
``wanted to record how it feels to die, what it meant to enter what
he called the end zone, so that his wife and daughter, and we --
all of us -- would be better prepared for it.'' The staff member
who narrates the story watches Mr. Straughn's final moments as his
breath stops and starts. ``Maybe,'' she says, ``he was summoning
himself back by main force to speak that final word. If so, he
needn't have bothered. The word was never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon'' is at its most engaging when Mojtabai explores such
small, tumultuous dramas -- stories, even at life's edge, that
continue to unfold. There's a risk, though, in setting an entire
collection inside an institution that is meant to be serenely
confining; sometimes the stories feel confining too. Thus in ``At
the Door'' and ``Air,'' as grown children mentally loop back
through tangled relationships with dying parents, the stories
become one-sided conversations about the past, family dramas that
want to spill out beyond the hospice walls.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Mojtabai has a knack for summoning up
telling details -- like the ``recommended'' hugs that staff members
are encouraged to give patients and their families: ``not too
tightly; never sexy.'' She is also good at using story titles
(``Sightings,'' say, or ``Long Distance'') as central images and
working them to a crescendo. The effect, ironically, sometimes
makes death seem a little too neat on the page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolation,'' for example, is about a young AIDS patient named
Michael and a priest who exhorts him to pray. In reverie, Michael
returns to earlier times: ``He was so restless, he couldn't wait to
be gone from West Texas, he was ready to go. There were open fields
on either side, a telephone cable stitching the air high overhead.
The wire went on, humming with secrets it wasn't yet telling, bound
for elsewhere, where he, too, was going.'' Michael's story ends in
a lonesome but artful fashion: a nurse finds him clutching the
phone to his chest ``like a bouquet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Mojtabai is successful at involving us with
characters we meet only in the last chapters of their lives, people
whose fates have already been determined. We are drawn to their
stories as we might be to those of passengers on a sinking ship.
The most effective of these is ``The Juniper Tree,'' in which Cora,
a hospice volunteer who narrates several of the stories, sits with
Marian, ``the frailest of 8-year olds,'' who has ``been living on
crushed ice.'' Cora starts to read her a fairy tale, then hesitates
when she discovers it's about a boy who is chopped up and cooked in
a stew. Marian insists that she continue. At the fairy tale's end,
the boy is reborn in a juniper tree that is transformed into a
bird, then a child again. Later, Cora comes down the hallway and
finds Marian in crisis, ``surrounded by her parents and one of the
nurses.'' When Cora asks if she can fetch some more ice, Marian
lifts her hand and whispers, ``Hurry!''
</P>
<P>
   Hurry or not, it will make little difference. But Mojtabai has
us praying for a miraculous, fairy-tale ending.

THE SILENT DUCHESS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Dacia Maraini. Translated by Dick Kitto and Elspeth
Spottiswood.
</P>
<P>
   261 pp. New York: The Feminist Press. $19.95. &QL; 
 &UR; -------- &QL; 
 &UR; THE SILENCE &QL; 
 &UR; BY KATHRYN HARRISON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A little girl, 7 years old, deaf and incapable of speech,
accompanies her father, a Sicilian duke, to witness the execution
of a young criminal, a boy of 13. Because of their social position,
these two aristocrats are permitted to eavesdrop on the child's
confession in his sordid underground prison, then given a ringside
seat at his hanging.
</P>
<P>
   The violence of this spectacle is such that Duke Signoretto
Ucria hopes it will both unstop his daughter's ears and ``unstick
her lips.'' But Marianna Ucria is possessed of an imperturbable
calm. ``For living visitors like Dante,'' she thinks as she watches
the prisoners, ``hell can even be beautiful to look at'' -- a
surpassingly literate and philosophical assessment from such a
young girl.
</P>
<P>
   Thus are we introduced to the early-18th-century heroine of
Dacia Maraini's novel, joining Marianna's father in ``knocking at
the door of her silence.''
</P>
<P>
   What lies behind that door, and who has pushed it shut? We can
ask these questions of stories other than the one Maraini tells in
``The Silent Duchess,'' for we are well acquainted with heroines --
and the occasional hero -- who cannot or will not speak. From the
Greek tale of Philomela to Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid
to Maya Angelou in ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' from Ellen
James in John Irving's novel ``The World According to Garp'' to
Estha in ``The God of Small Things,'' by Arundhati Roy, the list
goes on. Can we guess what words, what accusations, their silence
holds? All too often, the clues point to sexual trauma -- in this
case, a childhood rape.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Marianna Ucria is given in marriage, against her will, to
her mother's older brother (and her father's cousin), Duke Pietro
Ucria. The reason is a simple one, at least as her mother explains
it. ``Uncle Pietro will take you for nothing because he loves
you,'' thus sparing her parents a dowry they can't afford. This
conversation is carried out by means of pen and paper, as are all
of Marianna's communications. Soon she is married to ``that sad,
grumpy man, always dressed in red and known in the family as 'the
prawn.' '' Marianna refers to her cold and peculiar spouse as
``uncle husband.'' During the course of their 27-year marriage, she
bears him five children and presides over his large household. The
duchess herself is considered eccentric, but this has less to do
with her silence than with her devotion to reading.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Marianna is widowed. After the funeral, she accompanies
uncle husband's corpse to its interment in the catacombs; having
remained innocent of the pleasures of the bedroom, she scrutinizes
the ``fleeting curve'' of his lips, his ``jutting cheekbones,'' as
she tries one last time ``to fathom the secret of his body.'' Soon
thereafter, Marianna takes a young lover, but the discovery of
physical passion cannot tempt her from the life of the mind, from
her addiction to silent, sated hours in her library. As old age
approaches, she spurns the proposal of a kind admirer, a man who
values her intelligence. Escorted by her maid, Marianna sets out to
see what she can of the world. Without giving away the identity of
the man who raped her -- or its bearing on the duchess's betrothal
-- one can set out these summary events of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange how well she's worn,'' her profligate brother,
Abbot Carlo, notes: ``Slim as when she was 20, a fresh, clear
complexion. . . . This dumb sister still has the face of a young
girl. . . . What if it were her dumbness that has preserved her
from the ruins of growing old?'' Dumbness? ``Holiness'' might be a
more fitting word, suggesting the quality of being set apart.
Perhaps it is poetic justice that Carlo has been disfigured by
appetite, lust, cruelty. In contrast, Marianna bears no superficial
trace of sin or suffering. In her innocence, she looks like an
angel -- and in fact she functions as a particular kind of
celestial being, the recording angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silent Duchess'' is a leisurely, discursive case history
of an early violation, a narrative that segues (painlessly, without
being polemical) into a treatise on the nature of the writer,
especially the female writer. Marianna's silence is both ``dense
and transparent.'' She sees it as ``both mother and sister'' and
prays to the ``Holy Mother of all silence.'' For Marianna, and by
extension all women, Maraini suggests that creativity implies a
certain defection, a refusal to participate in a forum dominated by
male voices -- voices that exploit, that discount the importance of
the domestic female world, that misrepresent what it is to be a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Silence does not diminish the duchess; rather, it dignifies her.
For Marianna, separation allows perspective; the abandonment (not
the impairment) of one faculty sharpens the others; deafness even
enhances her perceptions. Because she is spared the chaos and
distraction of noise, Marianna finds that she can read people's
thoughts. Her past violation guarantees her vigilance; she will
always be hyper-alert to her surroundings. Her sense of smell, for
example, is so keen that passages of ``The Silent Duchess'' will
remind readers of another novel set in the same pungent century,
Patrick Suskind's ``Perfume'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she has lowered her eyelids so as to rest her eyes for a
while, and her nostrils have begun to draw in the air, recognizing
the smells and meticulously noting them in her mind: the
overpowering scent of lettuce water that impregnates her father's
waistcoat, below that the scent of rice powder mingled with the
grease on the seats, the sourness of crushed lice, the smarting
from the dust on the road that blows through the joints of the
doors, as well as the faint aroma of mint that floats in from the
fields of the Villa Palagonia.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-DUCHESS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Villa Palagonia.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing'' and ``meticulously noting.'' This entire novel
could be described in such terms, filled as it is with observations
that are rich almost to the point of cloying. It's a trick for
historical fiction to avoid awkward pileups of costuming and props.
Maraini, a playwright and essayist who is one of Italy's most
prominent writers, is also a seasoned and elegant novelist. She's
not afraid of excess -- and why should she be? It's entirely under
her control. Her intelligent heroine, well read to the point of
heresy (she imports and eagerly consumes books by philosophers who
comment on the nature of reality, who challenge the vision of the
church and, by implication, the patriarchal rankings of society),
is an apparatus intricately calibrated for perception, for
understanding, for revealing.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is the sort of world that the duchess describes on
the tablet hung around her neck, in the letters she sends to her
daughters, in the thoughts she shares with the reader? It's
splendid and squalid and violent, a place where women are at once
petted and despised -- a place that seems alive for the reader,
both then and now. But historical fiction is not, of course,
history. Despite its links to Maraini's own family's Sicilian
roots, ``The Silent Duchess'' isn't biography exhumed; instead, it
is fantasy projected onto the usable screen of the past.
</P>
<P>
   IN her afterword, the literary scholar Anna Camaiti Hostert
suggests that Maraini chose to set her story in 18th-century Sicily
because it was dominated by a peculiarly ``arrogant and
hypocritical aristocracy, remarkable . . . in the cruelty of its
oppression of both the poor and women.'' The afterword provides a
useful, if academic, context for the work of a writer who remains
largely unknown to Americans. In her more than 50 books, Maraini's
attention, Hostert tells us, ``has always been concentrated on
women's enforced silence in society as well as in literature, and
on the alternative ways in which a female voice can manifest
itself.'' If this sounds ponderous, the novel itself is anything
but.
</P>
<P>
   As translated by Dick Kitto and Elspeth Spottiswood, ``The
Silent Duchess'' is a story of grace and endurance, not mere
survival. What's more, it acquires a slyly suspenseful quality as
the somewhat pedestrian puzzle of the rapist's identity is
superseded by the more complex tension and mystery of Marianna's
silence itself. What will cure this case of ``hysterical'' -- in
other words, female -- deafness and muteness? There are passages
the reader dreads, afraid to be returned with the duchess to the
spoken word, to the implicit capitulation that would be signaled if
she deigned to talk. Might this happen at the death of uncle
husband? At Marianna's discovery of physical passion, when she
redeems what the rapist stole? When she at last learns (that is to
say, remembers and acknowledges) who raped her?
</P>
<P>
   Any of these would be the manipulations of a lesser writer. The
final and greatest satisfaction of Maraini's novel is that the
duchess remains triumphantly silent.

 &UR; EIGHT MILLION STORIES
</P>
<P>
   BY GARRISON KEILLOR
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you go in New York, you are walking through somebody's
literary turf. If I hike over to Central Park, I pass through Isaac
Bashevis Singer's neighborhood and the site of Poe's cottage and go
by the hotel where Holden Caulfield sat on the bed with the
prostitute and the building on 78th Street near Amsterdam Avenue
where Sister Carrie lived with Hurstwood, her paramour, before she
rose in society and he fell. In the park I breathe in a rich
fragrance richly described by John Cheever and look down the
horsepaths of ``The Age of Innocence'' toward the buildings of
Fitzgerald's 59th Street (``my lost city, wrapped cool in its
mystery and promise'') and think of E. B. White's saying, that New
York bestows ``the gift of privacy, the jewel of loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   So many great writers have lived here, their homes cannot be set
aside as museums: they are needed for housing. Everyone came
through town, even Thoreau, who spent a few months on Staten Island
in 1843. He rode the ferry to Manhattan, hoping to interest editors
in his work; he thought New York ``a thousand times meaner than I
could have imagined. It will be something to hate -- that's the
advantage it will be to me.'' He failed to interest anyone, he got
homesick and left town grumping about the crowds: ``It must have a
very bad influence on children to see so many human beings at once
-- mere herds of men.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phillip Lopate's excellent anthology, ``Writing New York,''
you get writers who love crowds and writers who hang out alone and
brood, the diaries of businessmen and homages to ``the sweet slums
of Bohemia and beatnikdom, where sunflowers and morning glories
would bloom on fire escapes in the summer and old ladies weighed
down by breasts leaned on goosedown pillows in windows,
self-appointed guardians of the street'' (from Joyce Johnson, who
``sat up till dawn in Rappaport's, where they gave you a whole
basket of rolls free, drinking coffee with a jazz trombonist from
St. Louis and a poet just arrived from Chicago''). And Elizabeth
Hardwick on Billie Holiday: ``The sheer enormity of her vices. The
outrageousness of them. . . . Her ruthless talent and the opulent
devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry James looks dimly at the ``vast bristling promontory'' of
Manhattan, where ``the shores are low and for the most part
depressingly furnished and prosaically peopled,'' and fusses about
the impermanence and commercialness of it all, and A. J. Liebling,
a sociable fellow from 93rd Street and Lexington, sees impermanence
as a civic virtue: ``It is one of the oldest places in the United
States, but doesn't live in retrospect like the professionally
picturesque provinces,'' he says. ``Any city may have one period of
magnificence, like Boston or New Orleans or San Francisco, but it
takes a real one to keep renewing itself until the past is
perennially forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The gassiest of the city's admirers may have been Lewis Mumford,
hiking across the Brooklyn Bridge, observing the skyscrapers
against the sky and the river below, the ferryboats, the tramp
steamers -- ``And there was I, breasting the March wind, drinking
in the city and the sky, both vast, yet both contained in me,
transmitting through me the great mysterious will that had made
them and the promise of the new day that was still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   O.K. Whatever you say, pal. Contain as much of the sky as you
like. What really shines in this anthology isn't the literary set
pieces but the journalism, from Poe's column about a 10-mile foot
race in front of 11,000 spectators in May 1844, won by a man named
Stannard in 1 hour 4 minutes 3 seconds for a $300 purse, to Alfred
Kazin's memoir of Brownsville and Joseph Mitchell rambling around
the Fulton Fish Market at 5:30 in the morning and Joan Didion on
her way home: ``I remember sitting in a lot of apartments with a
slight headache about 5 o'clock in the morning. I had a friend who
could not sleep, and he knew a few other people who had the same
trouble, and we would watch the sky lighten and have a last drink
with no ice and then go home in the early morning light, when the
streets were clean and wet (had it rained in the night? we never
knew) and the few cruising taxis had their headlights on and the
only color was the red and green of traffic signals.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising journals are those from a city long
disappeared, from when cows were pastured on Bowling Green and pigs
ran loose and Wall Street was a ``narrow thoroughfare, baking and
blistering in the sun'' and the English actress Fanny Kemble ruled
the stage and merchants and lawyers streamed into the eating houses
for lunch, where a barker stood in the doorway and chanted:
</P>
<P>
   ``Biledlamancapersors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosebeefrosegoorosemuttonantaters --
</P>
<P>
   ``Biledamancabbage, vegetables --
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkinsirtakaseatsir.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is Grant Thorburn of 22 Nassau Street, a grocer who began
selling potted plants and found that they sold better if he painted
the pots green. Here is Miss Kemble, writing, ``The women here . .
. ripen very early and decay proportionally soon. They are,
generally speaking, pretty, with good complexions, and an air of
freshness, but this I am told is very evanescent.'' And here is the
Wall Street lawyer George Templeton Strong, writing in 1851: ``I'm
sadly vulgarized and degraded of late by the itching for money that
has come over me. Oh, for $100,000 -- well invested! A skillful
operation resulting in an enormous profit with no risk has all the
charm for me now of poetry or romance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-NEWYORK-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: romance.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The diaries of Strong and his contemporary Philip Hone provide
such clear accounts of early 19th-century New York as to make the
literary wits of their day unreadable by comparison. Try to read
the whinnying of the great Washington Irving and then check out
Hone's diary entry for Saturday, Dec. 8, 1838, when he and family
and guests are eating dinner and a week-old infant boy is left in a
basket on the doorstep, the name ``Alfred G. Douglas'' written on a
label pinned to his muslin frock. Hone reports on the autumn
foliage, a concert by Ole Bull, a charity ball, the Astor Place
riots, the rebuilding of Trinity Church, the death of his wife. He
observes John Jacob Astor, worth $15 million, sitting at dinner,
mumbling, drooling, fed by a servant -- ``a painful example of the
insufficiency of wealth to prolong the life of man.'' Hone is
chairman of the committee that plans the reception in 1842 to
welcome Mr. Charles Dickens (``a small, bright-eyed,
intelligent-looking young fellow, 30 years of age, somewhat of a
dandy in his dress'') and is pleased that all goes well, all except
the coat-check operation: Hone trudges home hatless and coatless on
a February night.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman gazed on it from the Brooklyn ferry, ``mast-hemm'd
Manhattan,'' and Poe rowed a skiff along Roosevelt Island to look
at the Manhattan shore, ``the magnificent cliffs, and stately
trees'' that he knew would be soon replaced by warehouses and
wharves. Maxim Gorky, looking across the harbor, saw a city
quivering like a mirage, ``a fantastic city all of fire. . . .
Thousands of ruddy sparks glimmer in the darkness.'' Helen Keller
took a boat around Manhattan and her companions spelled into her
hand the names of boats, Bella, Floradora, Rosalind, Pearl of the
Deep, Minnehaha, Sister Nell. Dawn Powell looked down from the
Empire State Building and saw ``a garden of golden lights winking
on and off, automobiles, trucks winding in and out, and not a
sound. All as silent as a dead city -- it looks adagio down
there.'' Fitzgerald saw it from a ship sailing up the Hudson at
early dusk, ``the white glacier of lower New York . . . a miracle
of foamy light suspended by the stars.'' And the Englishman Stephen
Graham saw it in 1927 as we all see it, on foot: ``It is 5 A.M.
Something of the burden of the city has been lifted. The air is
light. The heart seems freed. I feel happy to be walking. I love
the space and the quietness. I have got rid of the idea of going to
bed, got rid of the routine of daily life. New York and its
millions, its wealth, its mysteries, are mine. There is a sense of
conquest. The bustle has died down and I am still walking. The
majority of people are asleep -- but I am not the least sleepy. It
seems as if life has just begun.''

<P>
   Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816) is one of those attractive
but vague figures, remembered for vastly different events that add
up to -- well, what they add up to is fascinating, but not at all
clear. Two centuries after Sheridan's heyday in London, his fame
rests mostly on the comedies he wrote as a young man. ``The School
for Scandal'' and ``The Rivals'' are hilarious, perfect little
exposes of base aristocrats, lying journalists and moralists
without moral cores. Yet by the author's own admission the plays
were a mere stepping stone, a bid for money and social cachet to
help him pursue his real passion. Sheridan was elected to
Parliament in 1780 and rose to the very top ranks as a reformer
within the Whig party. These were the fabled glory days of English
political rhetoric, and for a while Sheridan No. 2, the politician,
outshined his illustrious colleagues Charles James Fox and Edmund
Burke as the best orator in the land.
</P>
<P>
   The journey from facile golden boy to persuasive liberal
statesman is hard enough to trace. The real challenge for
Sheridan's biographer is to fit those first two acts with a very
different third. Later in life Sheridan became a laughingstock,
famous not for his way with words but for his notorious debts, his
desperate sucking up to patrons and, most embarrassing of all, his
bright red drinker's nose. This Sheridan lost most of his money and
all of his pride. When he died, London gossip pronounced that he'd
ended up a pauper, with hardly a chair left for furniture.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think some consolidation of the three Sheridans would be
in order, but in ``A Traitor's Kiss,'' Fintan O'Toole takes the
bold and, in the end, pretty convincing step of introducing a
long-ignored fourth Sheridan into the mix. No. 4 was born in
Dublin, and O'Toole believes that through all his later ups and
downs Sheridan remained, first and foremost, an Irishman. When he
wrote plays, Irishness was the outsider's point of view that
supplied the double-entendres. When he entered politics, Ireland's
plight fed his sympathy with oppressed pawns of colonialism and
with humble people everywhere who lived under laws that failed to
serve them. His torn allegiances, as a Protestant high up in the
British Government who thought the Irish had been given a raw deal,
drove him to seek a humane compromise. But this position was
lonely, irksome to enemies across the political spectrum and hard
on his nerves.
</P>
<P>
   We're speaking somewhat rhetorically here, of a sentimental
rather than a concrete patriotism, since Sheridan left Ireland for
English boarding school at 11, never to return. But O'Toole makes a
good case for the Irish question's powerful resonance within the
Sheridan clan; one 17th-century ancestor got swept up in a quixotic
effort to refashion Protestantism for the Irish language. And
Sheridan appears to have suffered one of those awful childhoods
that lead to nostalgia in the adult. As a boy he was sickly,
neglected by his family and teased by his peers for his father's
low profession as an actor and theater manager. (Theater then was a
guilty pleasure, enjoyed but frowned upon, rather like the
contemporary talk show.)
</P>
<P>
   At first Sheridan channeled his hunger for love, status and
vindication into romantic mischief, eloping with a well-known
singer, casting himself (falsely, O'Toole implies) as her protector
from an unwanted suitor and provoking two duels. Our instant
celebrities shop around for book contracts; Sheridan moved to cash
in on his 15 minutes by writing plays. O'Toole is a theater critic
for The Daily News in New York, and he's insightful about the
social atmosphere of the 18th-century stage: the rowdy informality
that sometimes climaxed in a riot, the barely camouflaged gossip,
the minor but suggestive fact that the lights didn't go down before
a show, which made the audience feel like full-fledged participants
in the entertainment. O'Toole has less to say about the plays
themselves, but it could be that Sheridan's plays, while close to
flawless, don't bear much talking about except to acknowledge that
their author was a comic wizard. I was constantly reminded, reading
this book, that the 1700's predate the 1800's. That is to say,
before the Romantics arrived, literature tended to be an arena of
wit, intrigue and idealized lovers -- of rhetoric more than
conflict or ambiguity. O'Toole dutifully looks for unplumbed depths
in some of Sheridan's strongest characters, like the vicious prude
Joseph Surface or the confused Mrs. Malaprop. Trotting out a little
rhetoric of his own of the jargony academic type, O'Toole argues
that Sheridan's constant awareness of the untrustworthiness of
language led inevitably to his lonely, radical choices in politics.
</P>
<P>
   But is the road from satire to politics really so straight? A
contemporary of Sheridan's named Jane Austen possessed as fine an
ear for linguistic untrustworthiness as has ever existed, but in
political terms she was a conventional Tory. Besides, while most
satirists are out to expose some ugly truth, Sheridan was the rare
humorist who dreamed of a kinder, gentler world. He could be as
sentimental, and as ruthlessly persuasive, as a Disney song. His
most celebrated speech, charging the Governor General of India with
corruption and brutality, was a classic of the 18th-century cult of
sensibility and by all accounts a show-biz masterpiece -- a
five-hour torrent of facts, unanswerable accusations and tugs at
the heartstrings that were achingly sincere, and utterly shameless.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SHERIDAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: shameless.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Away from the podium, his politicking was rougher around the
edges. A maverick within his own party, he fatally allied himself
with the fickle, selfish Prince Regent. His position grew even
trickier in the repressive 1790's, when his defense of the Irish,
and of basic civil liberties like habeas corpus, opened him to
charges of treachery. Was his thinking on Ireland a lost model for
an enlightened Third Way, a course of nonsectarian compromise, as
O'Toole -- again indulging in a little rhetoric -- seems to imply?
Absolutely, but then again, not quite. Sheridan's heart was in the
right place, but even at the height of his power his political
method was too compromised by social climbing and pipe-dream
idealism to apply usefully to today. After his first wife died, he
compromised himself even more. His drinking stood out in an era in
which it was hard to stand out for drinking. When an aristocratic
lady broke off an affair with him, a combination of depression and
class rage sent him off on a pathetic campaign of harassment that
today would put him on trial as a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying it: Sheridan had his weak spots. (Or, as
Byron once put it, after recalling all Sheridan's gifts, ``But
alas, poor human nature!'') Still, the decline was not wholly his
fault. O'Toole's very moving point is that as an Irishman, Sheridan
was doomed to remain on the fringes; as a self-made man he found no
home in the rigid upper reaches of English power. The irony is that
when Sheridan died, his Irishness was put away in the closet. His
plays were safely absorbed into a harmless pageant of English comic
literature. His irresponsibility was greatly exaggerated, and his
glittering wordplay and rakish reputation made him seem like the
prototype of the feckless English fop.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the lesson of Sheridan's life, it helps to look
not at his politics but back at his plays. Elites close ranks to
resist outsiders, they told us. People in power aid people in
power, and society runs on lies. In the plays, the message was
comic, with the happiest of endings. In life, it proved
depressingly real.

 &UR; PIGSKIN WIDOW
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dixie Gibbs may be blond and pretty, she may have a smile for
everyone and give a successful after-game party, but as the wife of
the head coach of the Birmingham Black Bears, she is a flawed
individual. She doesn't care much for football. She doesn't even
know the rules. In Alabama that is plenty cause for suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of Dick Tomey, the head coach of the University of
Arizona Wildcats, Nanci Kincaid knows the rules, and for her
carefully constructed second novel she has recruited a shadow team
of wives, mothers, sisters and girlfriends to recount the lonely
and frustrating life on the sidelines. Kincaid also knows her
readers, which is why, despite its drolly macho title, ``Balls'' is
about women and marriage as much as it is an insider's view of a
college football recruiting scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie, the main character, grew up in ``HamU'' country, the
local handle for fictitious Birmingham University. In high school,
she vowed to marry a football player and picked the star
quarterback, Mac. Years later, she and their two children stand by
as he accepts the head coach's mantle from his mentor, Catfish
Bomar. It is the end of an era. The fans and money people all
expect Mac to carry on the winning tradition. By then, Dixie, still
a dispassionate spectator, has figured out the game: football comes
before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie's first teacher is the big-hearted Leeta Sparks, who works
two jobs so her husband, Hemp, can pursue his first love, coaching
high school football. When the newlywed Dixie asks Leeta if she
still loves Hemp, she says, ``I love him the same way I love my
kids,'' because, Leeta thinks to herself, ``any other answer would
half kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a more seasoned Dixie who meets the ambitious Romalee May,
the defensive coordinator's wife at HamU. During games, Romalee, a
former Miss Georgia, talks strategy and player histories while
Dixie is content to scan the crowd. But as Dixie observes,
``Romalee's experiential expertise lasts only until the rum and
Coke she's sipping sets her free from it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a luncheon, Catfish Bomar's wife, Celeste, a ghoulish
augur, boozily declares about her husband: ``He's killing me. I am
one step closer to dead every . . . football season.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dixie, her marriage has evolved into a chilly union. Mac
canceled their first vacation to play golf. He missed his son's
first steps and first words. During the season, Mac is gone before
Dixie wakes and comes home after she is asleep. Off-season, he
travels on recruiting trips, and summer weekends he spends on the
links. When she asks him to attend a reading of a short story she's
written, he answers, ``I'll just wait until the movie comes out.''
Dixie's forbearance, however, is maddening. One minute she is
pricked with rage, the next she is in awe, comparing Mac to Jesus
``casting his net into the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid cleverly mines the small moments to communicate Dixie's
deepening sadness. A car ride home becomes symbolic of the journey
of her marriage. The mood is celebratory: Mac has just been named
head coach. Dixie is exuberant because they have realized their
dreams. Then she sees it's a success she had no part in creating.
</P>
<P>
   It's an obvious conclusion that these women are mad -- and
cynical -- as hell. Ultimately they are outsiders. When the illegal
inducements Mac doled out to recruits are made public, Dixie learns
of his resignation in the newspaper. Though painstakingly
developed, the characters do not have enough to do except watch and
talk. Divided into short chapters, the book is narrated in the
first person from 18 different perspectives. Kincaid loses time by
reorienting the reader with each shift, which prevents her from
telling her story. And what of these rogue spouses? The husbands
are the supposed focus here, but they are relegated to the
background. Like the wives, readers are left sitting on the bench.

 SURPASSING WONDER

   The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds.

 &UR; EDITING THE WORD OF GOD
</P>
<P>
   BY ANTHONY J. SALDARINI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Bible and Talmud ``inventions'' may sound like
fighting words to a religiously sensitive audience, but here the
word ``invention'' is a belief-neutral description of the processes
that created the Jewish and Christian foundational classics (the
Hebrew Bible, the Jewish literature of the Second Temple period,
the New Testament, the Mishna and the Talmuds). In ``Surpassing
Wonder,'' Donald Harman Akenson, a professor of Irish history,
adopts a Great Books approach to Jewish and Christian history,
viewing it not as ``a chronicle of events, but a chronicle of
successive texts, their constant invention and reinvention.'' With
an imaginative use of metaphors, analogies, persuasive rhetoric and
praise, he pleads with all to read these religious classics
seriously, whether they grant them spiritual authority or not,
because, precisely as splendid intellectual and spiritual
``inventions,'' they have fascinated readers for generations and
profoundly shaped Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   To read these complex collections as literary unities Akenson
must simplify. He stresses narrative because ``the most important
portions of the Scriptures are presented as historical documents,
and the most revealing portions of both Hebrew and Christian
Scriptures are found in tightly constructed primary historical
narratives.'' He artificially unites discrete narratives into one
by postulating (solely for the purpose of analysis) a single author
for the dominant narrative of the Hebrew Bible from Genesis to
Kings, as well as for the New Testament Gospels and letters as a
whole, the 60-plus legal tractates of the Mishna and the sprawling,
shifting conversations of the Babylonian Talmud, which include
technical discussions of law, charming folk tales, intriguing
interpretations of Scripture and lucid depictions of human virtue
and vice.
</P>
<P>
   Akenson subordinates the sharp and inconvenient particularities
and contradictions of the texts in order to accomplish the ultimate
goal of history and human thought, interpretation of the whole. A
moral end motivates this quest for understanding because ``the
acquisition of significant bodies of knowledge in adult life''
requires an act of volition and of ``ethical discipline'' that
demands the rigors of a pilgrimage. Thus the religious classics of
the West belong to an intertextual world in which they have been
received and transformed by later generations and stand ready to
work their magic again on us.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible has attracted dedicated readers in every generation,
and even in our television culture thousands of Jews have committed
themselves to a seven-year program of reading the whole Babylonian
Talmud. Akenson seeks to attract a larger audience by demonstrating
the intellectual and human worth of the biblical and Talmudic
tradition. However, he fails to provide a sustained and searching
critique of the limitations of these traditional texts and of their
misuse throughout history. He does capture much of the variety and
inner strength of the biblical tradition. The Hebrew Bible was
created from pre-existing traditional materials, which still
proclaim their individuality in language and thought. Subsequent
interpretations of it in the Second Temple period (500 B.C.-A.D.
70), the New Testament and the Rabbinic periods used the language,
symbols, thought patterns and literary forms from the tradition in
new configurations and new systems of thought while remaining
within the same grammar of biblical invention. Akenson stresses the
creative imagination of later authors, but not their implicit
dissatisfaction with the tradition, which begs to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   He does not ignore dissenting voices, for he shows again and
again how later generations radically rewrote Scripture and the
rabbinical tradition even as they claimed to change nothing. He
acknowledges the persistent, irresolvable historical uncertainties
that plague interpretation of these ancient texts, but pushes them
aside in favor of listening to the primary texts ``without engaging
any prior theological or ideological commitments.'' His style and
use of striking metaphors and analogies propel this rich literature
into the minds of his readers. But other voices in the text and in
the 20th century demand a more thorough hearing. The biblical books
modify, nuance and limit one another. Communities of believers who
have lived these texts also provide a gritty commentary that
qualifies the great themes of intellectual history.
</P>
<P>
   To the historian I am making a plea for more history in his
reading of the great books. Akenson has consulted major scholars in
each field and uses their work intelligently and shrewdly. He
ferrets out shoddy historical methods and special pleading among
biblical theologians and historians, especially in a delightful
65-page appendix on the historical Jesus. But through his own
hypotheses he binds together diverse materials at a heavy cost.
</P>
<P>
   The master narrative of the Hebrew Bible, from Genesis to Kings,
provides him with a Magna Carta or Constitution of the tradition.
But the ancient tradition privileged the Torah, or Pentateuch
(Genesis through Deuteronomy), as do Jews today, and modern
literary analysis convincingly demonstrates that Joshua through
Kings should be read as a deuteronomic history, governed by the
measure-for-measure theology of Deuteronomy. Akenson's fiction of a
genius who invented his master narrative during the sixth-century
B.C. exile in Babylon is just that.
</P>
<P>
   His narrative trope works even less well for the New Testament
and the Talmuds. Despite his attempts to make sense of the
canonical order of the New Testament books and of the reasons why
the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds comment on some Mishna
tractates but not others, no clear narrative structure emerges.
Admittedly, the Mishna's formulaic linguistic world -- with concise
laws, lists and crisp disputes over cases and contradictions --
produces an intellectual architecture independent of narrative. But
Akenson concedes that the unity of the Babylonian Talmud is a
matter of sensibility, not proof.
</P>
<P>
   Akenson's interpretation of these classics is a promising start
for anyone. He encourages serious, holistic reading by word and
example. Religious believers may be enriched by the exposition of
the ``surpassing wonder'' of these human inventions, even if
dissatisfied by the bracketing of some tenets of their respective
faiths. Cultural critics may find an entree into a more mature
conversation with some texts that live on in our culture. Most
important, this book will guide and stimulate ordinary readers to
read on.

 &UR; IRON DRIZZLE
</P>
<P>
   BY JAMES SAYNOR
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Americans often have an image of Eastern Europe that's not
necessarily appreciated by Eastern Europeans. From across the
Atlantic, the region is seen as unstable and locked in the past,
consumed by ancient fears, sutured together by superstition.
Repression and understatement are the order of the day. Then
there's the weather -- frequently chilly and gray, epitomized by
that most deadly of meteorological states, ``drizzle.''
</P>
<P>
   There's so much grayness, cold and drizzle in ``Country of
Memory,'' a novel set in Eastern Europe by the American writer K.
C. Frederick, that the merest ribbon of blue in the sky causes
people to shuffle together and gaze upward in wonder. Such moments
of community are rare in this story, which mainly focuses on dread,
dislocation and runny noses. It's almost a pastiche of the
20th-century Eastern European novel -- a digest of quiet
desperation, mining a vein of literary styles from Kafka to
Kundera.
</P>
<P>
   But Frederick seems aware that he's writing from without rather
than within and that his tale is something of a conceit, even a
backhanded homage to a cheerless tradition. He carries it off with
surprising esprit.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told mostly from the viewpoint of Petir, a needy
fellow trapped in a ``circle of solitariness,'' who works as a
petty bureaucrat in the vast Pyramid Combine, a state-led bank in
an unspecified fictional country. While the malign Government
grapples with ``unsettlement in the east'' and ``rebellion in the
southern provinces,'' Petir's office thwarts legitimate insurance
claims against the Combine -- like that of a man called Pund, who
lost a leg in a work accident. Pund is convinced that Petir is the
desk drone who deep-sixed his payout. Armed with a hammer, he is
intent on revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Petir must also cope with the oblique demands of two women. His
ex-wife, Marit, is a kleptomaniac librarian with a girlfriend
caught up in student protests. And Lera, his (eventual) lover, is
an enigmatic femme fatale who claims to be dodging both gangsters
and the secret police. She's full of windy remarks: ``All of us are
searching, and we're searching for different things''; ``We can't
be responsible for other people's illusions. . . . Only for our
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Marit and Lera prove unlikely but effective therapists for
Petir, helping to soothe his biggest hang-up -- his memory of the
deaths of his mother, father and grandmother in a huge inferno, set
by his mother, when he was a child. Now all he has to deal with is
Pund. When his wild-eyed nemesis finally catches up with Petir,
it's almost an epiphany: ``Never in his life had he felt so
transcendently content.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick is a fitful storyteller; the narrative pressure of his
novel comes and goes in spurts, like water in an Eastern European
plumbing system. Characters endlessly roam the streets, their minds
looping between horrid childhood memories of impaled goats and
thoughts of their own desolation. They're ``stultified by
self-observation,'' to borrow a phrase once used by the English
novelist Angus Wilson to describe some of his own characters. As a
result, the novel's angst can feel stapled on.
</P>
<P>
   But often there's more life in Frederick's writing than there is
in his characters -- when, for example, Petir's face is described
as ``a blackboard from which some terribly urgent message had been
erased'' or a truck whistles by on the highway like ``an unmoored
planet hurtling through space.'' And the narrative is seasoned with
witty mock-European folklore -- the saga of a disabled botanist
whose heart ends up in the pillar of a cathedral; the myth of ``the
tinker of Beldagg,'' a goblin who can snatch your soul if you utter
a particular word.
</P>
<P>
   For all that the novel is about a man tiptoeing around the edge
of a nervous breakdown, it is also about relishing this condition
in a giddy kind of way. ``Country of Memory'' has an odd,
depressive exuberance. It amounts to Old World gloom described with
irrepressible New World bounce.

   Americans love a self-made man, but the British, as everyone who
reads Private Eye or Jane Austen knows, generally hate anyone who
succeeds and despise anyone who fails, which leaves very little
room for movement.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, if biographers are to be kept in work, a few
self-esteeming, ambitious people need to step off the ordinary path
from time to time, if only so their adventures may be recorded as
cautionary tales. In ``Prophet: The Life and Times of Kahlil
Gibran,'' the classical translator and sometime anthologist Robin
Waterfield proves how vexing it must be for a British scholar to
possess a passion for Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), the Middle
Eastern-born poet and artist who moved to Boston from Bsherri,
Lebanon, when he was 12, held his first critically lauded art
exhibition at 21, had become a respected painter and writer in
Greenwich Village by 30 and at 40 acquired cult status as the
author of a mystical illustrated psalter called, immodestly, ``The
Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gibran's book has been ecstatically embraced by
scarf-swathed disciples of Isadora Duncan and Madame Blavatsky,
hash-brownie-munching beatniks, herbal tea-drinking New Agers and,
evidently, by quite a lot of ordinary people as well.
</P>
<P>
   The book has sold more than 9 million copies in America alone --
each one bearing Gibran's portrait of his prophet, Almustafa, who
resembles the artist and who stares hypnotically off the page like
a gravestone rubbing of the young Pancho Villa. Here is not only a
self-made man, here is something infinitely more embarrassing: the
self-made seer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Prophet,'' Waterfield struggles to present the life and
career without permitting his readers to think that he may himself
have fallen under the swami's spell. His admiration for the man may
be accepted; he has, after all, taken the trouble to edit a Gibran
anthology for Penguin, and this year, in addition to the biography,
he has also written benign introductions to Penguin Arkana's new
translations of Gibran's ``Spirit Brides'' and ``Broken Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   But the unforgiving portrait he paints here reveals a
narcissistic pretender who did not care about his family and who
may have cruelly manipulated his chief patroness, literary
collaborator and one-time fiancee, Mary Haskell Minis, for
financial ends. ``It is hard to avoid the conclusion that he knew
he was on to a good thing, and made sure that it remained in
place,'' Waterfield writes, reducing a complex 20-year relationship
to the exploitation of a lovesick human trust fund by a cad.
</P>
<P>
   He also speculates hand-rubbingly on Gibran's romantic
attachments, divining ``a sexual charge'' between the artist and
his model, Emilie (Micheline) Michel, and detecting a similar
``charge'' in the atmosphere during Gibran's conversations with
Haskell. While he accepts that Gibran never slept with Haskell, he
decides that Gibran and Micheline ``consummated their relationship
sexually,'' though he admits ``there are no extant letters or
anything to provide concrete evidence of this.'' His basis for
Ken-Starring the pair is that Gibran ``was certainly not a virgin''
when he met Micheline, and, more damning, that Baudelaire's
``Fleurs du Mal'' was in print, ``containing some of the most
highly charged erotic poems ever written.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he sneers at Gibran for having been a ``tabula rasa''
when he met his first benefactor, the Boston photographer,
publisher and philanthropist Fred Holland Day, at 13. But one black
mark in Gibran's character overshadows the rest: ``the enormity of
his self-estimation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gibran's character flaws were more thoroughly
explored a quarter-century ago in ``Kahlil Gibran: His Life and
World,'' a lucid, comprehensive biography written by a cousin, also
named Kahlil Gibran, and his wife, Jean, who undertook the project
because they could find no objective study of their illustrious
relative. When they began their book, the chief accounts of
Gibran's life were ``This Man From Lebanon,'' an appreciation by an
acolyte who called herself Barbara Young, who described him as
``one of the rare gestures of the Mighty Unnameable Power,'' and a
sloppy memoir by his good friend Mikhail Naimy, written in Arabic,
that characterized him as a rake and a tippler.
</P>
<P>
   In this 75th anniversary year of the publication of ``The
Prophet,'' the 615 letters and 47 diaries the Gibrans unearthed in
the course of researching their book -- which was expanded and
reprinted in 1991 -- constitute the bulk of firsthand knowledge of
Gibran's American experience.
</P>
<P>
   If Waterfield's ``Prophet'' is pathography, ``Kahlil Gibran: Man
and Poet,'' by the Lebanese scholar Suheil Bushrui and his
colleague Joe Jenkins, both of the Kahlil Gibran Research and
Studies Project at the University of Maryland, breaks new ground,
falling into a category that lies somewhere in between hagiography
and history. Bushrui and Jenkins's adoration of their subject
emerges in their declarations that the poet could ``sing with the
eloquence of Isaiah and the sorrow of Jeremiah,'' that he ought to
be recognized as a national hero for the Arab world, much as
Cuchulain is for the Irish, and, more controversially, that,
although Gibran was a Maronite Christian, ``his writings through
the years reflect his desire to merge the Sufi Muslim tradition
with the Christian mystical heritage of his background.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GIBRAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: background.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet, through their consultation of Arabic and other sources,
the authors add substantial texture to previous descriptions of
Gibran's social and work habits in Beirut, Paris and New York,
paying particular attention to his friendships with men like Rodin,
Yeats and Carl Jung. ``Kahlil Gibran: Man and Poet'' also amplifies
Gibran's relationship with Mary Haskell, furnishing poignant detail
of her November-December marriage with the widower Jacob Florance
Minis, which she embarked upon in 1921 when she was 48, as she and
Gibran were completing their collaboration on ``The Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell asked Gibran if she could truthfully tell her Minis that
she loved him ``better than anyone else in the world,'' as he so
often asked her. Gibran told her she could say yes, because ``every
love is the best in the world, and the dearest.'' Haskell married
Minis, but eight years later, while keeping house for Minis in
Savannah, Ga., she still edited Gibran's works in secret,
registering her thoughts about him in her diary in code.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jean and Kahlil Gibran before them, Bushrui and Jenkins are
not afraid to acknowledge the poet's foibles. They readily admit
that he mythologized himself, cultivated famous people and had
sexual relationships with women. They quote a dialogue between
Haskell and Gibran in full: Haskell asked if Gibran thought it was
all right for a man or woman to have as many as seven sexual
partners; he replied, ``If the seven were all willing, yes.'' No
nudges or winks required.
</P>
<P>
   Gibran's widely varying critical reception can be laid not to
any deficit of character or talent, they suggest, but to the
problem of categorization. His writing ``is neither pure literature
nor pure philosophy, and as an Arab work written in English it
belongs exclusively to no particular tradition.'' In other words 9
million people have bought the book and don't know where to shelve
it.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of book is ``The Prophet''? No one could call it
humble, no one could say it is not derivative. It is a slim volume
of fewer than 20,000 words, in which its hero, Almustafa (Gibran),
at the invitation of his muse, Almitra (Mary Haskell), tells the
people of Orphalese (New York) what he really thinks about
everything. Its poems are incantatory and willfully symbolic, and
they resonate of Blake, Yeats, the King James Bible, Laotzu and,
occasionally, the off-kilter whimsy of the Portuguese poet Fernando
Pessoa.
</P>
<P>
   Bushrui and Jenkins, wishing to claim Gibran for Islam, insist
that he also echoes Sufi precepts, and there is no reason to rule
that out, either. Gibran's drawings and watercolors, which are
often dismissed as overpretty, resonate of Rodin, Redon, Picasso's
``Romeo and Juliet'' and assorted Pre-Raphaelites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the themes he chooses to discuss are in no way
original: Gibran wrote on love, family, beauty, pain and death. Of
married love, he wrote: ``Make not a bond of love: Let it rather be
a moving sea between the shores of your souls.'' Of children, he
wrote: ``Your children are not your children. They are the sons and
daughters of Life's longing for itself.'' Beauty, he apostrophized,
is ``eternity gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity
and you are the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it gnomic nonsense, but ``thy nose is as the tower of
Lebanon'' sounds absurd if you don't know it's from the Song of
Solomon, and ``the cut worm forgives the plow'' is gibberish to
someone who does not admire Blake. Only somehow more people are
willing to confess admiration for Blake than for Gibran.
</P>
<P>
   On April 11, 1931, Kahlil Gibran died in his studio in New York.
The woman by his side was his secretary and later his biographer,
Barbara Young, who had begun working for him seven years earlier,
after Haskell married Minis. In his most significant addition to
Gibran lore, Waterfield furnishes the dramatic post-script. Because
both Haskell and Gibran had been exceedingly discreet, nobody, much
less Young, suspected the strength of their attachment, and when
Young discovered Haskell's letters in the studio, he recounts, she
was shocked. Gibran's will had left the management of his art
collection to Haskell, but Young soon began to appropriate not only
his artworks but his correspondence and other artifacts, claiming
that Gibran had meant her to have them.
</P>
<P>
   Gibran's will also incensed many of his Boston relatives,
because it bequeathed royalties from sales of ``The Prophet'' to
Bsherri, the tiny mountainside town he had left in 1895. Waterfield
suggests that the grandiose gesture was a bid to retroactively
create the myth Gibran had spread among his American friends --
that his family had been wealthy. If so, it was a scheme worthy of
a Gatsby. However, once hundreds of thousands of dollars began
flowing from the publisher into Bsherri, fierce squabbles divided
the villagers; the Lebanese government had to step in to restore
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The larger squabble over the worth of Gibran's literary legacy
may never be resolved. Bushrui and Jenkins glumly conclude that the
critical split that Jean and Kahil Gibran deplored decades ago
plagues Gibran scholars today: ``those who have deified him and
those who have dismissed him as a mere populist poet'' still refuse
to be reconciled. A solution to this troubled opposition may lurk
within the multipurpose wisdom of ``The Prophet.'' Just as Gibran
instructed married couples to imagine their love as an ocean that
unites as well as separates them, the quarreling camps might as
well acknowledge that their shared obsession joins them in a
partnership of opposed minds. Like it or not, Kahlil Gibran is
``the moving sea between the shores of their souls.''

   The Life and Adventures of a Clever Woman.

 &UR; A VULGAR PUSHING WOMAN
</P>
<P>
   BY LINDA SIMON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clever'' is hardly sufficient to describe Fanny Trollope.
Essayist, novelist, travel writer and, not incidentally, mother of
Anthony, she was clever to be sure. But ``indomitable,''
``tireless'' and ``determined'' seem closer to the reality of her
breathtakingly energetic life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning her writing career under duress at the age of 53, she
rose each day before dawn to produce, over the next two decades,
more than 40 books. If some critics thought her surname an apt
epithet for her stature as a writer, if Robert Browning warned his
wife against seeing ``that vulgar pushing woman who is not fit to
speak to you,'' still Fanny Trollope became, in her own time,
nothing less than a literary phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A contemporary of Jane Austen, Frances Milton grew up learning
the skills that should have enabled her to glide effortlessly into
a good marriage, but she managed to reach the age of 29 without an
offer. In ``Fanny Trollope: The Life and Adventures of a Clever
Woman,'' Pamela Neville-Sington, an American literary scholar who
now lives in London, suggests a few reasons: Growing up motherless,
Fanny never developed what one observer called ``taste and female
intelligence in regard to dress.'' A more significant drawback to
marriage was her lively mind, invigorated by her father's abundant
library. Women's ``terror of being called learned,'' she later
wrote, ``is in general more powerful than that of being classed as
ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a formidable match, but at last, early in 1808, she met
a man who was not daunted by her. He was Thomas Anthony Trollope, a
shy, serious barrister who had just moved into the Milton family's
London neighborhood. By summer, the two were exchanging books and
letters. In May 1809, they married. Immediately, the Trollopes
began a family; within nine years, they had six children. With
Fanny in charge of the nursery, Thomas assumed control of the
budget, for which he had little talent. As financial worries took
their toll, Thomas became increasingly morose and withdrawn. He was
no companion for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1820s, she found one: the Scottish social
reformer Frances Wright, recently returned from Tennessee, where
she had established Nashoba, a community dedicated to educating
freed slaves. Trollope was beguiled by her intrepid friend and
leapt at the chance to accompany Wright back to America. In early
November 1827, Trollope, with her 16-year-old son, Henry, her two
daughters and Auguste Hervieu, a struggling young artist who had
tutored her sons (and whose relationship with Trollope generated
considerable gossip), left England.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of arduous travel, they finally reached
Nashoba, outside Memphis. But one glimpse of its dismal, roofless
log cabins, Fanny said, ``sufficed to convince me that every idea I
had formed of the place was as far as possible from the truth.
Desolation was the only feeling -- the only word that presented
itself.'' There was no question of staying, and within two weeks
Trollope had devised a new plan. Her party would head up the Ohio
River to Cincinnati, reputedly the fastest-growing city in America.
</P>
<P>
   She brimmed with ideas for making money. First, she advertised
her son as a Latin tutor, but no students appeared. Undaunted, she
proposed to a local museum an entertainment she called ``The
Invisible Girl,'' in which Henry portrayed a mock Delphic oracle.
The public loved it, and Trollope was given another commission,
this time for a wax museum attraction called ``Infernal Regions,''
featuring terrifying scenes from Dante. These successes were not
enough to support the Trollope menage, however, and Fanny threw
herself into a grander scheme: the Bazaar, a combination mall,
theater, amusement park and museum. With the family's future riding
on this venture, Fanny spared no cost in making it spectacular. But
she had miscalculated. The Bazaar, the Americans decided, was too
decadent. They refused to come.
</P>
<P>
   Facing destitution, Trollope needed to act and act quickly. Her
next plan seemed just as risky: she would write a book based on her
American journey. A woman's view of the frontier, she believed,
just might find a receptive audience. Supported by Hervieu's
earnings as an artist, she stayed in America until she had gathered
enough material; back in England, she found a publisher willing to
take a chance on an unknown writer. In March 1832, nine days after
her 53d birthday, ``The Domestic Manners of the Americans''
appeared. ``I awoke one morning and found myself famous,'' she
wrote to her eldest son, echoing Lord Byron.
</P>
<P>
   The book sold through four editions in its first year. Her
candid, often acerbic critique of America fed British skepticism
about the supposed wonders of democracy, while at the same time
offering a vivid, lively commentary on social conditions in the
still-new world. American readers were less generous: Margaret
Fuller, for one, felt that Trollope had ``violated the virgin
beauty'' of her native land.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans were not Trollope's audience, and the enormous
popularity of her book in England inspired her travels to France,
Austria and Italy. Her success as a travel writer led her to
publish, to equal acclaim, 35 novels. Neville-Sington reads this
fiction as a reflection of Trollope's experiences, frequently
citing the novels to help us understand Trollope's responses and
relationships. Since Trollope, throughout her work, was above all a
social critic, this strategy seems appropriate and illuminating.
Although at some moments the biography takes on the pace and tone
of Trollope's own romances (abundant cheerfulness! many exclamation
points!), still Neville-Sington, attentive to historical context
and telling detail, has captured the spirit of the times -- and of
her subject.
</P>
<P>
   If Trollope merits a biography for her own accomplishments,
certainly some readers will come to this book for insights about
her famous son, whose literary reputation far exceeds hers. Feeling
abandoned when she left for America without him, Anthony never
established the rapport with her that his brothers had managed, and
his portrait of her in his memoirs often bristles with anger. Yet
Neville-Sington believes that Fanny inspired one of Anthony's
particularly fearless and charming fictional heroines, Glencora
Palliser. ``I do not know that she was at all points a lady,'' he
wrote, ``but had Fate so willed it she would have been a thorough
gentleman.''

   Crossing Over From Romanticism to Rock and Roll.

<P>
   By Perry Meisel.

 &UR; PERCY B. GOODE
</P>
<P>
   BY TERRY TEACHOUT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor of the melting pot is now desperately
unfashionable, but you cannot begin to tell the story of American
music without recourse to it. Virtually every musical idiom that
has left its mark on our culture -- jazz, musical comedy, country,
bluegrass, rock -- has been the product of ethnic hybridization.
Even the best American classical music bears its stamp: witness
Aaron Copland, whose ``American-sounding'' music was composed by a
Brooklyn-born Jew of Russian lineage who studied in France and
salted his scores with jazz-derived syncopations, Mexican folk
tunes and cowboy ballads.
</P>
<P>
   As Copland's example suggests, musical crossbreeding also
frequently involves a like encounter between vernacular and
cultivated traditions -- what Philip Rahv famously called ``redskin
and paleface.'' Though Perry Meisel makes no mention of Rahv's
dichotomy in ``The Cowboy and the Dandy,'' it is hard to overlook
its distant echoes in this intelligent but poorly focused
exploration of the wellsprings of postwar pop music.
</P>
<P>
   According to Meisel, a part-time rock critic and full-time
professor of English at New York University who has previously
written on Thomas Hardy, Virginia Woolf and Walter Pater, rock is
the product of a confluence of ``country and city'' -- 19th-century
English Romanticism and African-American blues tradition -- that is
prefigured in the process by which the small-group ``jump'' jazz of
urban jukebox idols of the 1940's like Louis Jordan evolved into
full-fledged rhythm and blues. ``Rock-and-roll,'' Meisel writes,
``is the crossing of cowboy and dandy. If you grew up on westerns
and Sherlock Holmes, your destiny was rock-and-roll. . . . Little
Richard, Jimi Hendrix, Prince -- all balance in a single style the
cowboy's strength, the dandy's charm; the cowboy's rage, the
dandy's melancholia.''
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven is a parallel discussion of the cowboy and the dandy
in English and American literature. ``Much as rhythm and blues is
the link between jazz and rock-and-roll,'' Meisel asserts,
``estheticism is the link between Romanticism and literary
modernism.'' But he is more interesting when talking about music,
though the ostentatious erudition of ``The Cowboy and the Dandy''
fails to conceal its author's sometimes shaky grasp of musical
fundamentals; he seems to think, for example, that Charlie Parker
and the beboppers were the first to introduce to jazz the
``Euro-harmonics'' that were in fact present from its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   The use of a loaded term like ``Euro-harmonics'' is a dead
give-away that Meisel is dealing from a politically stacked deck.
Not that there are all that many dead give-aways in this often
indigestible prose, which is full of clotted sentences that only a
post-modern literary scholar could love: ``Jazz's originary and
agonistic relation to European music proceeds, moreover, by means
of its use of fugitive African sources as the only defense at first
available with which to deflect the discourse of the oppressor.''
</P>
<P>
   Meisel's sludgy style will come as no surprise to those
masochists who keep up with high academic fashion. Small wonder
that the fruits of contemporary scholarship in the humanities are
so widely viewed with contemptuous incomprehension by nonscholarly
critics and the common reader, since the members of the
professoriate are so reluctant to translate their ideas into the
plain English of the public intellectual. In most cases, of course,
translation would be an exercise in futility -- jargon-jugglers are
rarely capable of disciplined thought -- but I suspect there is a
genuinely worthy book lurking somewhere in the midst of ``The
Cowboy and the Dandy,'' which contains unexpectedly shrewd comments
on such varied figures as Muddy Waters and Willa Cather. Alas,
Meisel has not taken the trouble to write it, and so it isn't
likely that very many people will take the trouble to read it.

 &UR; TWO BELLES OF AMHERST
</P>
<P>
   BY RENEE TURSI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the late 1870's Emily Dickinson wrote the
following lines to her sister-in-law, Susan Huntington Dickinson:
``Susan knows /
</P>
<P>
   she is a Siren -- /
</P>
<P>
   and that at a /
</P>
<P>
   word from her, /
</P>
<P>
   Emily would /
</P>
<P>
   forfeit Righteousness -- .''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson's complex relationship with Susan, the wife of her
brother, Austin, remains a knotty one for biographers. Local lore
has handed down a tale of two young impassioned friends who, while
eventually living only ``a hedge away'' from each other on Main
Street in Amherst, Mass., went on to have a 15-year falling-out.
Rumors that Susan was a ruthless social snubber who had wronged
Emily may be problematic, given that their source is Mabel Loomis
Todd, with whom Austin carried on a highly public, lasting affair.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly no more credible is Martha Dickinson Bianchi, Susan and
Austin's daughter, who insisted that the affection between her
much-maligned mother and ``Aunt Emily'' never waned. After all, it
was Susan who prepared the poet's body for burial and wrote her
obituary. At the very least, most scholars agree that Susan was a
force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson's surviving letters to Susan, which began ardently a
few years before Susan's marriage and continued almost until the
poet's death in 1886, outnumber her letters to anyone else. After
an examination of these cryptic messages, Ellen Louise Hart and
Martha Nell Smith have emerged up in arms for Susan. In compiling
``Open Me Carefully'' (which includes more than 20 poems and one
letter not previously connected to Susan), they aim to show that
the women enjoyed a long, close relationship, one whose workaday
exchange of ``letter-poems'' (Susan's term) contributed to ``the
texture of their daily life.'' Even more urgent, however, is their
intent to champion Susan as Dickinson's ``primary reader'' -- the
person they believe exerted the most significant, sustaining
influence on Dickinson's poetic and erotic sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   This claim is probably a stretch, considering Dickinson's rich
correspondence with intellectuals like Thomas Wentworth Higginson
and Samuel Bowles. Nonetheless, Susan not only seems to elicit some
of Dickinson's most exquisite phrasings but also a free and mature
expression of desire. Moreover, it was Susan who recognized that
Dickinson's early poems deserved to be published, unlike both
Higginson and Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   While few of Susan's replies exist, her response to a version of
Dickinson's poem ``Safe in Their Alabaster Chambers'' shows her to
be an astute reader. She observes that the second verse ``does not
go with the ghostly shimmer of the first verse'' -- a critique that
evoked not only a new stanza from Dickinson but also a letter-poem,
apparently in gratitude, that reads: ``Your praise is good -- /
</P>
<P>
   to me -- because I know /
</P>
<P>
   it knows -- and suppose -- /
</P>
<P>
   it means --.''

   As Dickinson's biographer Richard Sewall has commented, the
poet's publication history might have been vastly different if her
audience ``had all been Sues.'' Dickinson herself, near the end of
her life, wrote to Susan: ``With the Exception of Shakespeare, you
have told me of more knowledge than any one living -- To say that
sincerely is strange praise --.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange, perhaps. At the age of 20, Dickinson longs to hold her
friend ``in my arms.'' A few years later Susan is told she can ``go
or stay'' because ``we differ often lately, and this must be the
last.'' And when both women had reached their 40s, Dickinson wrote:
``Sue -- to be /
</P>
<P>
   lovely as you /
</P>
<P>
   is a touching /
</P>
<P>
   Contest, though /
</P>
<P>
   like the Siege /
</P>
<P>
   of Eden, impracticable, /
</P>
<P>
   Eden never /capitulates --.''
</P>
<P>
   In her contemplation of Susan, Dickinson mused: ``What depths /
</P>
<P>
   of Domingo /
</P>
<P>
   in that torrid /
</P>
<P>
   Spirit!'' and, using phrases that may neatly compress the
enigmatic quality of their bond, writes: ``In a Life that /
</P>
<P>
   stopped guessing, /
</P>
<P>
   you and I should /
</P>
<P>
   not feel at home.''
</P>
<P>
   With spare commentary, Smith, who teaches English at the
University of Maryland, College Park, and Hart, who teaches writing
and literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, wisely
let these letters speak for themselves. Most important, unlike
previous editors who altered line breaks to fit their sense of what
is poetry or prose, Hart and Smith offer faithful reproductions of
the letters' genre-defying form as the words unravel spectacularly
down the original page. All the better to appreciate, in a fresh
and overdue context, that poetic voice we have come to know --
iridescent, puzzling, explosive.

 &UR; ONE PICTURE WAS WORTH A MILLION BUCKS
</P>
<P>
   BY BERNARD WEINRAUB
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was two tough and strong-willed sons of an Italian immigrant
farmer from the Santa Clara Valley near San Jose, Calif., who
revolutionized the movie business. The time was 1906. The young
men, the bankers Amadeo Peter Giannini and his brother Attilio,
made a $100 loan to Sol Lesser, a 17-year-old nickelodeon owner who
needed the money to pay for the delivery of a film. (Lesser later
became one of the major exhibitors in California.) Over the next
few years, the Giannini brothers expanded their business with
several other movie companies and began to develop relationships
with some of the most powerful men in the fledgling industry. ``The
Gianninis were the first bankers to recognize the motion picture
business as a legitimate industry,'' David Puttnam writes in
``Movies and Money.'' He adds, ``The extent of the affinity between
the Gianninis and the pioneers of the movie colony was
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giannini brothers are two of the lesser-known, if colorful,
figures in a sober book about the movie business that struggles to
deal with several overlapping themes: the birth of the film
industry and the rivalries among the early innovators; the
inevitable and long-running collision between art and commerce;
Hollywood's hegemony over European films and the sometimes angry,
sometimes silly intellectual posturing in which European (mostly
French) filmmakers sputter about all those beastly American values
polluting Continental shores. (Jean-Luc Godard claimed that his
struggle against Hollywood's commercial imperialism was analogous
to the workers' struggle against capitalism. But as Puttnam points
out, Godard was forced to concede that ``workers don't come to see
my films.'')
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam is now Lord Puttnam, one of Tony Blair's life peers. He
is also an Oscar-winning producer, responsible for such impressive
films as ``Chariots of Fire,'' ``Midnight Express,'' ``Local
Hero,'' ``The Killing Fields'' and ``The Mission.'' But in
Hollywood Puttnam is best known for his tumultuous 15-month reign
in 1986-87 as chairman and chief executive officer of Columbia
Pictures, then owned by Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   No studio head had challenged so many top producers, agents and
movie stars in such a short period of time. Puttnam contended more
than a decade ago that the costs of filmmaking were out of control,
that movie stars were treated like spoiled children and that
studios had yielded too much power to agents and producers. He may
have had a tendency to pontificate and, surprisingly, never quite
understood Hollywood's rules of behavior, which fall somewhere
between ``The Godfather'' and a Kabuki drama. But he was right.
</P>
<P>
   If only Puttnam had used ``Movies and Money'' to explore those
turbulent months when he tangled with Ray Stark, Michael Ovitz,
Dustin Hoffman, Bill Murray and numerous others. What happened?
What did he learn? Instead, Puttnam vaguely addresses his Hollywood
tenure: ``Many factors contributed to my eventual departure,'' he
remarks. With the kind of stiff-upper-lip reticence that seems
entirely uncharacteristic of the author, he says that ``it became a
conflict between two differing ideas of cinema which, in some ways,
seemed to be at the heart of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this reticence is symptomatic of a sometimes
dramatic, sometimes thoughtful and often ambiguous book (written
with Neil Watson), one that is based on a series of lectures
Puttnam gave in Berlin in 1994 and at Oxford University one year
later. ``Movies and Money'' leaps only sporadically from its
academic roots, and rarely makes the movie business any more alive
-- or zany -- than the insurance business. In fact, it starts
pulsing only at midpoint, when Puttnam deals with the eccentric and
often brilliant moguls of the 1930's and 40's, like Irving
Thalberg, Louis B. Mayer, Darryl Zanuck and David O. Selznick.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stories may be old, but they're priceless. Like Jack
Warner telling Albert Einstein, who was visiting the studio,
``Well, professor, I have a theory of relatives too -- don't hire
'em.'' Or Harry Cohn betting his brother Jack $50 that he couldn't
recite the Lord's Prayer. Jack started, ``Now I lay me down to
sleep. . . .'' Harry interrupted and gave him the money. ``That's
enough -- I really didn't realize you knew it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Puttnam observes shrewdly, ``if there was one thing
that bound the bosses together, moguls and production chiefs alike,
it was their passion for gambling. Cards, horses, roulette --
despite their cultural differences gambling became an all-embracing
passion.'' He goes on, ``It was hardly surprising that such men
should find their natural home in a high-risk business like the
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam seems less interested in moguls, though, than in the
unresolvable debate over whether movies are an art or merely a
commodity like cars or jeans. His focal point is the contentious
1993 trade talks between the Clinton Administration and Hollywood
on one side and many European countries on the other. The Americans
wanted films to trade freely like any other manufactured goods. The
Europeans objected, believing that their own industries would
collapse under the weight of all those Sylvester Stallone and Bruce
Willis movies. The issue, which is, of course, about American
culture dominating Europe, was left stalemated.
</P>
<P>
   As Puttnam observes, the conflicting visions of filmmaking --
and filmmakers -- date back to the birth of the business. ``The
physical and intellectual remoteness of Los Angeles from the rest
of America, combined with the feelings of hope and optimism
engendered by the California sunshine, all played a part in shaping
the distinctive ethos of Hollywood cinema,'' he writes. ``The
situation was very different in Europe, where filmmaking was
overwhelmingly concentrated in Berlin, London, Paris and Rome --
cities that were also centers of traditional culture. Consequently,
in Europe there was far more interaction between the film community
and those involved with theater and literature.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MOVIES-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: literature.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, although European directors and producers have
naturally wanted to make money, their film tradition was often far
more intellectual, and suffused with a cultural lineage missing in
Hollywood. Unfortunately for them, Hollywood films, with their
fantasy and sheer entertainment value, have dwarfed European
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam sides with the Europeans, but only up to a point. ``It
is frankly dangerous to allow Hollywood's extraordinary dominance
in the field of filmed entertainment to go on intensifying,'' he
writes. Films and television, he says, shape attitudes, reinforce
or undermine values. Yet he also points out that film audiences
abroad have all but fled from locally made films; American movies
account for at least 80 percent of the box office across most of
the Continent. One of the reasons, he explains, is that ``European
filmmakers have on occasion, most notably in the late 1960's and
1970's, displayed varying degrees of irresponsibility toward their
financial backers, and something approaching contempt toward the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   PUTTNAM'S conclusions are blurry. He suggests that the Europeans
should probably forget about competing head on with Hollywood
because ``Americans understand, better than anyone else, how to
produce and market films, just as the Germans make cars, the French
make perfume and the Scots make whisky.'' He raises the idea that
Europeans should focus more on new technologies in information and
education.
</P>
<P>
   While he seems unmistakably ambivalent about the studio system,
Puttnam clearly admires the men who created it: ``Whatever else
happened to them, they were determined to have the priceless sense
of security that came from wealth and power. That was why, when it
came to fighting for overseas markets, they found it so easy to put
aside all the personal hatreds, their internecine rivalries and
their quarrels over talent. Cinema might aspire to become an art
form or be a wonderful vehicle for the dissemination of political
and ethical values, but finally it was a business like any other.''
</P>
<P>
   American movies were built on what Puttnam terms the twin
pillars of investment and profit. ``The Europeans,'' he declares,
``never really seemed prepared to address these obvious and simple
realities.''

 &UR; WORLDS APART
</P>
<P>
   BY GERALDINE BROOKS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Girls' friendships haven't been well served by either literature
or popular culture. There's no Huck and Jim paradigm; with the
exception of ``Thelma and Louise,'' no notable buddy movies.
Instead, female friendships have mostly been portrayed as perilous
alliances, destined to be undone by sexual rivalry, cattiness,
witchcraft or PMS.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a relief to meet Lois and Fran, inseparable high school
friends in 1950's suburban Los Angeles. Smart, artistic and
athletic at a time when girls were supposed to be watchers, not
doers, they dreamed of adventuring together someday in New York.
Fran would paint, Lois would sing and any brilliant future might be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But then the two lost touch and years passed. Lois W. Banner
became a feminist historian and a professor at the University of
Southern California. Fran converted to Islam and became Noura,
living behind the veil in the closed Saudi Arabian city of Mecca
before settling with her family in Egypt. Banner, who has
specialized in retrieving women's forgotten histories, decided to
find her own lost friend and write the narrative of their lives,
together and apart.
</P>
<P>
   The result is part memoir, part social history and only partly
successful. I wish Banner had decided to write a story rather than
conduct a study. Instead, she tries to do both. When she allows
herself to be a storyteller, the prose unfolds with affecting
spontaneity. But then she seems suddenly to remember that she's a
professor and starts studding the text with analysis delivered in
language-withering academese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding Fran'' is at its best when Banner writes about her
not-always-happy childhood. Her extended family lived in one of the
grandest mansions in the suburb of Inglewood, not because they were
rich but because it was the only house big enough to hold them.
Into an imposing Gothic pile with an Italian marble fireplace and
velvet-embossed wallpaper moved Lois and her three siblings, her
parents, one set of grandparents, a great-grandmother, an uncle and
a threadbare collection of Salvation Army furnishings. Her
description of this setting and its characters is clear-eyed and
convincingly complex, as is her evocation of the depressingly low
expectations for the girls at her suburban high.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two life stories in this book, and while Banner's
is the better told, it isn't the better tale. It is her friend Fran
who has led the more unusual life: fleeing suburbia to join a
famous commune, Lama, on a mountain in New Mexico; then shaking the
place to its foundations by leaving her husband and running off
with one of the community's founders; finally, plunging into the
rigors of a Muslim life that included three years studying in Mecca
-- a city closed to nonbelievers in which few American women have
ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   This is rich material, but Banner approaches it too tentatively.
She fails to delve into Fran's acceptance of Saudi Arabia's
restrictions on women. She hints at the way these restrictions have
created a parallel, separatist female world, but offers
frustratingly few details of Fran's life within it. Likewise,
Fran's current life in Alexandria, Egypt, is barely sketched.
</P>
<P>
   For an academic, Banner is also oddly uncritical of sources like
Jehan Sadat's self-serving autobiography, and occasionally careless
with facts. For example, describing Fran's formative sojourn among
Palestinians in Jerusalem, she writes: ``In the mid-1970's, Muslims
still predominated in Jerusalem; Jews migrating there weren't yet
in the majority. It was still a city of domes and minarets.'' But
in Jerusalem's modern history Jews have been more than half the
population since 1860; by 1967 the city was 75 percent Jewish, and
a considerable portion of the remaining minority was Christian.
</P>
<P>
   What Banner achieves in this book is an insightful portrait of
her own family and her experiences in post-World War II America.
She has found herself. Fran, alas, remains elusive.

 IF A LION COULD TALK

<P>
   Animal Intelligence and the Evolution of Consciousness.

 &UR; STUPID LION TRICKS
</P>
<P>
   BY JERRY A. COYNE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A premier tourist attraction of Edinburgh is a statue of
Greyfriars Bobby, arguably the most famous dog in British history.
In 1856 John Gray, a Scottish constable, acquired this small Skye
terrier as a working pet. Two years later Gray died, and until his
own death 14 years after, Bobby kept a constant vigil at his
master's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Sentimental Victorians, touched by the dog's loyalty and hopeful
that they would be remembered, made him a national celebrity.
Bobby's tale has spawned several movies and dozens of books,
obviously plucking a deep emotional chord.
</P>
<P>
   Valuing animals in proportion to their apparent possession of
human emotions and mentality is the subject of ``If a Lion Could
Talk,'' an extended critique of anthropomorphism in animal behavior
research.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stephen Budiansky, a writer for The Atlantic
Monthly, professional biologists are almost as sentimental as the
admirers of Bobby, a trait that has produced dozens of flawed and
biased studies showing that animals, particularly primates, have
emotions, intellect and consciousness similar in kind if not in
degree to those of humans.
</P>
<P>
   He abhors such work because it yields false scientific
conclusions and buttresses the political agenda of ``animal-rights
advocates and New Age mystics,'' who base their ethics on the
similarity between humans and animals. He takes on many areas of
behavioral science infected by anthropomorphism, including
communication, navigation, intelligence and consciousness. Although
the descriptions and dissections of experiments are occasionally
confusing, they form a lively summary of the problems inherent in
this field (his analyses of animal ``counting'' and the use of sign
language by apes are particularly absorbing, while the discussion
of honeybee navigation is less successful).
</P>
<P>
   Budiansky sees three major problems with such research. First,
experimental designs are often flawed, as in the famous case of
Clever Hans, the counting horse whose ``mathematical abilities''
resulted from unconscious cues given by credulous onlookers.
Similar cues have cast doubt on studies of sign language in apes as
proof of their semantic abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some reports of animal emotion or intelligence could
merely be human misinterpretations of simple learning by
association. Casting a cold eye on Greyfriars Bobby, one might say
that he felt neither love nor bereavement, but, like a Skinnerian
pigeon pecking in vain for a tidbit, showed only a conditioned
response (association with his master) that gave rewards in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some supposed signs of animal consciousness may be only
evolved responses that do not involve subjective feelings. When I
poke an earthworm with a stick, does it recoil because it feels
pain, or merely because stimulating the proper nerves produces an
automatic (and adaptive) response?
</P>
<P>
   The main problems with Budiansky's own conclusions are clear to
those familiar with the scientific literature. The author makes
seemingly devastating and unrebutted attacks on experiments, but in
reality many of these studies seem quite credible. Budiansky, for
example, dismisses with withering scorn the use of mirrors by apes
as evidence for self-awareness, but many of his criticisms have
been answered already.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, his citation of ``the total failure of experiments to
support the idea that monkeys or apes are capable of imitation'' is
a gross distortion: recent work shows that apes may indeed perform
complex acts by imitating others. Conversely, the evolutionary
origins of some behaviors --such as ``alarm calls'' produced by
animals when they see a predator -- are still under debate, but
Budiansky writes as if the final answers are known. He does his
readers no favor by purveying such simplified and one-sided views.
</P>
<P>
   Budiansky concludes that work on animal intelligence is futile,
and that we should simply respect and treasure species as unique
products of natural selection. To a biologist this seems better
than valuing animals for their human qualities, although it does
not tell us whether it is acceptable to eat oysters but not veal.
</P>
<P>
   I am not convinced, however, that a few flawed studies negate
the whole venture of seeking the roots of human behavior by
studying our relatives. Comparative work on primates has given
valuable clues about the evolution of some human traits, and there
is no reason why well-designed work could not shed light on our
emotions and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   By far the book's biggest failing is the confusion and
contradiction imbuing the discussion of animal consciousness, which
occupies but one scant chapter. Budiansky simply finesses this
complex problem by defining consciousness in a way that limits it
to humans. Although virtually all philosophers of mind agree that
consciousness is the capacity to have subjective experience (e.g.,
to feel pain or pleasure), Budiansky's definition is ``the ability
to have thoughts about thoughts -- 'secondary representations' or
'meta-representations' '' -- in a word, to think about one's
motivations and to fathom the motivations and desires of others. He
admits that this requires the ability to think symbolically --
``language is so intimately tied to consciousness that the two seem
inseparable.'' Since only humans (but not infants!) have language,
only humans can be conscious. Moreover, he gives a controversial
scenario for the evolution of consciousness, suggesting that it
``may have been an adaptive strategy precisely because it provided
the material for speculating about the thoughts (and thus the
motives) of others.'' But such selection could operate on any
highly social animal, whether or not it has language. Budiansky
also ignores an important alternative theory: consciousness may not
have been a direct product of natural selection, but simply a
feature that arose in brains reaching a certain level of
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two pages, Budiansky considers the looser definition
of consciousness, concluding that no nonhuman species has
subjective experience, feels pain or is self-aware. In our state of
ignorance, this declaration is foolish. Whether members of other
species are conscious (and, if so, what aspects of the nervous
system produce this phenomenon) may never be known, for solutions
require either self-reporting animals or a very deep understanding
of the brain. Nevertheless, I find it quite plausible that my cat
feels pain when I inadvertently step on his tail. (Cats also
produce endorphins, molecules whose main function is to relieve
pain.) And who can be certain that Greyfriars Bobby did not miss
his master?

</P>
<P>
   BY WILLIAM R. EVERDELL
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More like a catalogue than an encyclopedia, ``The Neighborhoods
of Brooklyn'' consists of short illustrated chapters on 47 big-city
neighborhoods, a baseball team and a bridge. The bridge is a
century old, the ball club is long gone, but the neighborhoods are
alive and kicking. Brooklyn is on a roll these days, ``an urban
delight,'' as this book says; and these neighborhoods, with their
fuzzy boundaries that so rarely show up on a map, are Brooklyn.
Each one has a real existence, streets full of people, a history
and a separate state of mind. And beyond the 47 that rate their own
chapters are the scores of smaller ones (like Homecrest, which
abuts Sheepshead Bay) that appear only in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped since Brooklyn's birth in the 1630's by the different
ways residents have used to get in and get out of them (the ferry,
the horsecar, the trolley, the bicycle, the brisk walk, the subway
and even, southeast of Flatbush, the automobile), the ``hoods''
have had three centuries to evolve, and have come to expect a long
and vigorous future. Indeed, since something they call the
``renaissance'' began in the late 1960's, Brooklynites have become
tireless and almost tiresome in their boosterism. ``The
Neighborhoods of Brooklyn'' is hardly the first book in this vein.
Now, 40 years after the Dodgers' betrayal and The Brooklyn Eagle's
last issue and 100 years since the city's absorption by New York, a
revived Eagle is on the newsstands, and stacks of folio Brooklyn
books threaten to punch right through the old hardwood floors of
all those row houses.
</P>
<P>
   But this Brooklyn book comes not from a neighborhood association
or a real estate sales campaign but out of an ad hoc scholarly
program, a civic-minded effort to reintegrate the great American
cities into American culture. The task is surprisingly difficult.
We Americans have always tended to insist that ``nature'' civilizes
better than the cities that created civilization and still sustain
it, though this is a very strange idea in the ancestor culture of
Europe. When the Dodgers departed and The Eagle folded, American
history was at just the point where the population of cities, as
defined by the census, was exceeded by the population of noncities,
suburbs and the like. It was then that the political agenda of the
cities, the ``New Deal liberalism'' that had flourished between the
1920 and 1960 censuses, began to be replaced by the ``emerging
Republican majority.'' The tilt to the suburbs is a major event in
American history, though it is now overshadowed in the history
texts I teach from by the contemporaneous cold war. If the
textbooks ever demote the cold war for this more important event,
Brooklyn will be a major example of it, and the ``further reading''
will be books by Kenneth Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a scholar, and scholars cannot command much better
placement in national media than the rest of us. One form of
scholarly ambition is to be known beyond the boundaries of one's
own small subdivision of a discipline -- to be read, listened to
and made use of in the towns and counties of scholarship spread
over more than one of its states. By this measure Jackson, a
historian of the contemporary United States, is a major American
voice, with well over 300 citations in the past 10 years in
publications covering fields that neighbor history and employ it,
including archeology, antiques, geography, political science,
ecology, economics, urban studies and law. It has taken time. There
were far fewer Jackson citations in the previous decade, and most
were for a book called ``Crabgrass Frontier'' (1985), which was the
first comprehensive history of suburbanization in the United States
and stands, with John Stilgoe's ``Borderland,'' as the best. Other
living scholars are more widely cited -- more famous in this
measurable sense -- but Jackson is cited for things that are
notably unpalatable to the news media and others who control public
access to the national debate. His work makes cities look good,
cars look bad and privatization seem a decidedly mixed blessing for
democratic republicans -- or for a citizen majority. ``Crabgrass
Frontier,'' its fuse ticking away in the obscurity of scholarly
exchange, is a mine set under some of the more important
load-bearing pillars of the current social order.
</P>
<P>
   No mere theorist, but an established, unpolemical historian who
knows cities inside and out, Jackson is a New Yorker by choice, not
inheritance. Born in 1939 in Memphis and a graduate of Memphis
State University, Jackson in his first book, ``The Ku Klux Klan in
the City'' (1967), devastatingly anatomized how American fascism
was organized in cities like Memphis by people who hated city
values. After a stint in Chicago, Jackson came to teach at Columbia
University in 1968, the year of student upheaval; he is still
there. By now, his contributions to his adoptive city have made him
what was once called a ``leading citizen''; and the big folio
``Encyclopedia of New York City'' that he edited in 1995 has become
an instant classic, its authoritative details turning up in ever
larger numbers in the gamut of New York's journalism. In each book,
Jackson has conscientiously plumbed sources both vast and various,
from statistical abstracts to dusty local histories by provincial
patriots (Brooklyn has more than its share of those), and made them
part of a national -- even a global -- story about the rise, sprawl
and decline of big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn'' continues the project of a
pro-urban urban history, this time by detailing in charming and
highly accessible form the facts about a city that works. Once a
county of six farming villages, now more populous than Boston, San
Francisco, St. Louis and Atlanta combined, Brooklyn has been around
since the story started. It was, in fact, created by
suburbanization -- of the pre-automobile variety. (Contemporary
escapees from the suburbs to Brooklyn Heights should know that
Jackson's ``Crabgrass Frontier'' correctly identified this
neighborhood -- my own -- as the first true commuter suburb in the
world, dating from the opening of Fulton's ferry to New York in
1814.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BROOKLYN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: 1814.)) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet after King's County's 81 square miles were all built on,
low-rise Brooklyn found itself densely settled enough to be a city.
By comparison with later suburbs, its transportation links --
wharfs, streets and rails -- took up little of its space. Its
factories, though collectively strong enough to have made Brooklyn
one of the most productive cities in the world until the 1940's,
were individually not so big. The lots Brooklynites built on were
relatively small, and public land was sparse, even by comparison
with Manhattan. The tree that grew in Brooklyn grew on a street (in
the Williamsburg neighborhood), and even today the best way to
survey the public spaces of Brooklyn is from the seat of a bicycle.
Pictures of greensward in this book emphasize how precious parkland
still is, and make Bay Ridge, Cypress Hills, Brooklyn Heights,
Flatbush, Fort Greene, Park Slope, Prospect Heights,
Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Prospect Park South and Windsor Terrace
look embarrassingly rich. There are, of course, beaches, which is
why the former summer colonies of Bath Beach, Bergen Beach,
Brighton Beach, Coney Island, Gerritsen Beach, Manhattan Beach,
Mill Basin, Sea Gate and Sheepshead Bay lose playgrounds in the
winter. Perhaps the only true tycoons are Dyker Heights and Marine
Park, with beaches on one end and parks on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the principal public spaces in this city of former
suburbs are not parks but streets, and the streets show every kind
of variety. Their complicated history has given these neighborhoods
the kind of public civility and cooperation among strangers that
makes cities livable and discourages citizens from moving out.
Brooklyn is so determinedly provincial, so conspicuously lacking in
resident celebrities (even Richard Wright and Spike Lee eventually
left Fort Greene), and so peaceful in recent years, that outsiders
don't take much account of its astonishing mix of peoples; but that
mix is still world-class. With the exception of Sea Gate (one of
the nation's earliest gated communities), the Brooklyn
neighborhoods constitute the most wide-open multiethnic settlements
anywhere. Whatever it is that makes up the state of mind of a
Sunset Park or a Boerum Hill, it has repeatedly shown itself
capable of trumping other loyalties, including creed, color and
even class. Crown Heights was settled in the 1600's, like South
Africa, by Dutch farmers and their African slaves. It blossomed in
the 19th century with freedmen's villages, and a suburb that mixed
otherwise feuding European-Americans from England, Ireland,
Germany, Italy and Scandinavia. Now its majority is about evenly
divided between English-speaking, Spanish-speaking and
French-speaking Caribbean-Americans on the one hand and Lubavitcher
Hasidim on the other. The two subcultures are now slowly backing
off from a 1991 confrontation that made headlines, and cooperating
in a community-service group called Project CURE!, trying to turn
the recently hostile residents back into citizens.
</P>
<P>
   So it is only right that the neighborhood should be the
organizing principle for this book. The alphabet might serve for
Jackson's New York encyclopedia, but for Brooklyn only the
neighborhood idea can bring myriad details together.
</P>
<P>
   The details are mostly accurate, but one shouldn't demand the
same sort of precision as one might from the Encyclopedia
Britannica. Local history drips with little myths and although
Jackson, the consulting editor, John B. Manbeck, and other members
of the team are conscientious about dismissing them, a few creep
in. For example, Buffalo Bill's Wild West show played in Ambrose
Park (now Bush Terminal in Sunset Park) in June 1894, not 1892, and
St. Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights ceased being a church school
more than 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Thomas Wolfe, who never again lived in
Carolina, did indeed write ``You Can't Go Home Again'' in Brooklyn
Heights and ``Only the Dead Know Brooklyn'' in Cobble Hill. Now,
thanks to Kenneth Jackson, you can find out where those places are
even if you are still alive.

 &UR; GOATS' TOWN
</P>
<P>
   BY CLYDE HABERMAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things you learn on picking up ``Gotham'' -- in
itself no easy task, this super-thick book being heavy enough to
cause back spasms -- is that Gotham is Anglo-Saxon for ``Goats'
Town.'' Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   There actually is an English village called Gotham, not far from
Sherwood Forest. Legend has it that old Gotham was filled with
blockheads, like the farmer who rode to market on horseback
carrying a bushel of wheat on his shoulders in order not to burden
the poor animal. Washington Irving slapped the nickname on
Manhattan in the early 19th century (and it may be the only
Anglo-Saxonism not routinely heard today on the sidewalks of New
York).
</P>
<P>
   Why would New Yorkers have ever agreed to a moniker of such
unfortunate origin? Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, history
professors at the City University of New York, suggest it may be
because legendary Gotham played the fool to mask real wisdom.
Doltishness was a subterfuge to throw enemy outsiders off balance.
In other words, if you accept this theory, Gothamites were con
artists at heart. What better role models for a city that has
rarely objected with vehemence to a little artful flimflam?
</P>
<P>
   Burrows and Wallace should be congratulated for, among other
things, exquisite timing. This year marks the 100th anniversary of
New York's consolidation into a megacity of five boroughs,
including formerly independent Brooklyn. There has been no shortage
of retrospectives on the way things were over the last century.
Here is a book to bring us up to speed on what took place in
Manhattan before 1898, as far back as the ice age, when ``packs of
glaciers crept down from Labrador.'' That tidbit falls under the
sly heading of ``immigrant ice.'' In New York, everyone and
everything come from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotham'' often has fun like that. But no book this
encyclopedic can be expected to read like a romp. This is a serious
reference work. So many facts are crammed into every square inch
that trying to absorb them all will guarantee a headache bigger
than the one the city already has over Yankee Stadium's future.
Stray details are sure to stick, though, not necessarily in any
order of importance or chronology.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that New York's first hotel opened in 1794, called
simply the City Hotel, on Broadway just north of Trinity Church? Or
that the supposed $24 purchase of Manhattan by Dutch traders was
worth the equivalent of $669.42 (and even at that bargain price,
the Dutch may have been fleeced)? Or that the fabulously wealthy
John Jacob Astor made part of his fortune smuggling opium as
``America's first large-scale drug dealer''? Or that the brownstone
for the rows of houses that give New York streets their distinctive
look came from Paterson, N.J., and Portland, Conn.?
</P>
<P>
   Oddments like those add spice to a book focused more on the
powerful forces that shaped both city and country. After quickly
dispensing with the ice age and the rest of prehistory, it marches
relentlessly across the nearly three centuries from the Dutch
landing to the emergence of the unified boroughs. The countless
topics include, to list but a few, New York's wars with the Indians
and its pro-Crown leanings, its financial support for the slave
trade and its bloody draft riots during the Civil War, the
commercial imperatives and the waves of immigration that constantly
redefined it.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the authors take a break from big-picture themes
to provide insights into day-to-day life. They glide easily around
town, peeking inside brothels for working men in Five Points, then
pressing noses to the gilt-edged windows of the uptown rich. Even a
self-impressed modern like Donald Trump might find it hard to top
this for extravagance: ``James Fenimore Cooper, writing to his wife
in the winter of 1850, described a party where one woman wore 'a
dress that cost, including jewels, $30,000' -- a fantastic sum at a
time when skilled mechanics and craftsmen took home between $1.25
and $2 a day in wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster revelations of the you-read-it-here-first variety do
not make themselves obvious in ``Gotham.'' But important themes
emerge, not the least of which is Manhattan's dominance as a
mercantile center from the moment the Dutch plopped themselves down
there in the early 1600's. Not much has changed on that score, or
others. In so many ways, New York's evolution proves the ultimate
wisdom of the great 20th-century philosopher Yogi Berra. Life in
the big city is often deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Think of some of today's major issues:
</P>
<P>
   Vast gaps between rich and poor? At the start of George
Washington's Presidency in 1789, the richest 20 percent of the
city's population owned 75 percent of the wealth. The poorest 20
percent held a scant 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crime? ``As early as 1749,'' the authors say, ``one local paper
reported that it had 'become dangerous for the good People of this
City to be out late at Nights, without being sufficiently strong or
well armed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tight housing? Around 1700, a harried colonial official
complained that ``houses are so scarce and dear, and lodgings worst
in this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost of living? By 1720, ``the diversity of imported goods in
New York was matched by their costliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Municipal egoism? An 1837 guidebook mocked New Yorkers' tendency
to see everything they did as the biggest and the best.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the rest of the country? '' 'New York is
notoriously the largest and least loved of any of our great
cities,' wrote Harper's Monthly in 1856.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the quality-of-life campaign championed by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani echoes attempts by Peter Stuyvesant, New Amsterdam's
Governor in the mid-17th century, to browbeat the citizenry into
orderliness. Giuliani may wish to note what can happen to scolds if
they are not careful: ``The more Stuyvesant insisted on his
authority, the more he was resented -- above all among the colony's
burgeoning merchant elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are being ironic or sober, Burrows and Wallace
offer a large-canvas portrait of a city they clearly love. One
compelling reason seems to be New York's ability to recover from
adversity. Its determination was powerfully shown when lower
Manhattan was wiped out in December 1835 by a fire that raged for
two weeks in subzero temperatures. While only two people died, 674
buildings were destroyed in a ``13-acre ocean of burning
waves.''Yet within a year, 500 new buildings were constructed and
the area was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Then or now, you see, New York is the city that never weeps. It
simply does not give up.

</P>
<P>
   BY ANN HARLEMAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The title of Annabel Thomas' first novel echoes the narrative's
tone and rhythm -- flat-footed, stark, terse -- and also serves as
a warning. Readers who balk at destruction, mutilation and death
should exercise caution before proceeding. By the time it ends,
``Blood Feud'' is littered with more corpses than ``Titus
Andronicus.''
</P>
<P>
   We hear this grim tale from a winsome, tough-and-tender
13-year-old girl. The scion of one of two feuding families in the
Yamoden Valley of southeastern Ohio, Winnie Clemmer wants to tell
not only the story of the feud -- its origins and culmination --
but the story of her love for Dave Kilkinney, a 15-year-old member
of the other family. ``Here we hang,'' she says, ``like bugs in
amber. Scarcely one among us has a notion how to look back nor an
idea how to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   As it unfolds, ``Blood Feud'' offers the expected ingredients of
a story set in Appalachia during the late 1930's: a coal miners'
strike, a tragic and fatal accident at the mine, incendiary family
rivalries. The challenge that Thomas (the author of two collections
of short stories) sets herself in this novel is to make the
expected surprising, to make the familiar -- or, at any rate, the
cliched -- seem unusual. Does she succeed? Only intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Blood Feud'' include the ``good'' patriarch,
John Kilkinney, a font of apparently endless wisdom; the ``evil''
patriarch, Cap Clemmer, father of Winnie; Licorice Mary, Dave's mad
mother, who roams the woods; Winnie's cigar-smoking Aunt Charlotte;
Fergus Kilkinney, the bad seed; and Joella Kilkinney, a whore with
a heart of, if not gold, at least stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes and villains. It's clear from the outset which is which,
and no one changes his or her stripes as the novel progresses. What
saves these characters from continually falling into stereotype is
their voices. Despite a few too many ``jest's'' and ``yore's,'' the
regional dialect is handled adroitly, allowing its speakers to
reveal themselves as passionate and persuasive individuals. Winnie
herself employs a powerful version of mountain speech with many a
simile, some arresting (``mad as a meat ax,'' ``moody as a miser'')
and some less so (``wet as a muskrat,'' ``sour as persimmons'').
After the first dozen or so, such comparisons begin to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   IF the characters in ``Blood Feud'' are a bit short on
contradiction and ambiguity, the narrative itself is short on the
texture of life -- the details that would let us feel these
people's experiences. It's as if Thomas were trying to keep her
terrifically strong material from running away with the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Characters who are rigidly defined and unchanging keep human
nature within bounds; a setting sparely described helps keep Nature
under control. Instead of letting both kinds of unruliness
intensify and deepen the novel, Thomas places the story firmly in
the fist of a narrator who points out the significance of every
scene, often before we've had a chance to witness it for ourselves.
Young Winnie is always on top of events, even though they are not
recollected in tranquillity but presented as if happening right as
she speaks. The result -- with the happy exception of first love, a
theme she treats beautifully -- is a loss of mystery, a feeling
that there is nothing here for us to discover.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad, because by the end of ``Blood Feud'' we've
come to like this intrepid, vulnerable, too-wise-for-her-years
narrator. Few could fail to be moved by the intensity of Winnie's
desire (some would say it's the deepest desire of the human heart)
to be listened to, to be heard and truly understood. If only her
creator had trusted our reciprocal desire to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   When they aren't constrained by an imposed interpretation or
moral, Thomas's eye and ear can yield graceful and rewarding prose:
``Outside was bright moonlight. The evening was so still we could
hear a cowbell down by the mine. The ground felt hard under our
feet and frost sparkled in the fields, but no snow had fallen. The
hills laid long moon shadows on us as we went up the road.''
</P>
<P>
   As intensely as the young lovers of ``Blood Feud'' long to be
with each other, so the reader will long to be left alone,
unsupervised, with passages like that -- a whole novelful of them.
Maybe next time?

   Barbara Jordan came into this world black -- too black, she
learned soon enough. ``Why is she so dark?'' Ben Jordan asked
immediately after his daughter was born on Feb. 21, 1936, in
Houston. Her blackness meant that Barbara Jordan had to overcome
two racial barriers in her life -- one erected by white racism, the
other by black culture. In her early years, she was more conscious
of the latter than the former.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black was not beautiful,'' Mary Beth Rogers writes in
``Barbara Jordan: American Hero.'' ``It was a burden. For a
girl-child, the degree of melanin pigmentation in her skin and the
turn of her features mattered. The shape of her nose or the texture
of her hair determined acceptance, opportunity and status. Ben
Jordan knew all of that, and he knew he would have to demand much
more of his new baby girl to compensate for her blackness. Mind,
will, discipline, work, achievement -- those attributes would be
the hope, and the challenge, for this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan met that challenge. She could not change her skin color,
but she was able to use her remarkable mind and her riveting voice
to overcome. And what a voice it was -- clear, resonant, musical,
soaring, inspirational. Its authority and eloquence could be both
uplifting and overpowering, as when she spoke during the House
Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against President
Richard M. Nixon. ``My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is
complete, it is total,'' she told her spellbound colleagues and a
national television audience. ``I am not going to sit here and be
an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the
destruction of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, on a hot July day in 1974, Jordan, a Democratic
Congresswoman from Texas, became an American hero and patriot.
Before that turning point, she was known as an ambitious politician
who often seemed more comfortable as a political insider than as an
activist for any cause. Idealism had its place, but Jordan was
interested in results. In the deal-making corridors of power in
Austin and Washington, Jordan's pragmatism and willingness to
compromise got results, though she was often criticized by white
liberals, black caucuses and feminists for settling for too little.
She made it clear to the white men who ruled the Texas Legislature
and the United States Congress that she would never betray ``her
people'' but that everything else was on the table. She played a
key role in the battle to extend the Voting Rights Act, but she
also was a reliable vote for her state's oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   If her personal struggle to rise above racism and her
legislative record were the sum of Jordan's life, her story would
be impressive but not extraordinary. She would be remembered
primarily for her ``firsts'' -- the first African-American to serve
in the Texas Senate since Reconstruction, the first black woman
ever elected to Congress from the South and the first black to be a
keynote speaker at a national political convention (the 1976
Democratic National Convention). But Jordan was much more than a
series of firsts. At a time when African-Americans had to look to
the entertainment world and the civil rights movement for heroes,
she became the first black elected official to attain that status.
She became a national hero who transcended race and touched a
nation's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Barbara Jordan it came together during the impeachment
proceedings,'' Rogers writes. ``As she talked about the
Constitution, she began her transformation from a politician to a
patriot, from an inside player who could get a law passed to an
inspirational leader. . . . Now she had a message that matched her
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who is the chief executive officer of public television
station KLRU in Austin, came to know Jordan when their paths
crossed in Texas politics and later at the Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, where both taught.
Despite her public life, Jordan was a stoic, intensely private
person. Even many of her close friends were not fully aware of her
20-year struggle against debilitating illnesses, including multiple
sclerosis and leukemia, which took her life at the age of 59 in
1996. In her autobiography, ``Self-Portrait,'' Jordan chose to
ignore or gloss over some of the facts. Fortunately, Rogers has
filled in many of the blanks, and between Jordan's autobiography
and this splendid biography, history has an ample and inspiring
account of Barbara Jordan's remarkable life.

   A Memoir of Love, Loss,
</P>
<P>
   Hope, and Healing.
</P>
<P>
   By Judy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Books, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 A.M. on April 19, 1978, Judy Collins writes, she had her
``last drink -- by the grace of God -- eight ounces of vodka out of
a jelly jar, in a stall in the ladies' room at the airport in
Reading, Pennsylvania.'' In ``Singing Lessons,'' Collins discusses
the personal turmoil that played counterpoint to the songs that
brought her fame. Provoked by her struggle to come to terms with
the suicide of her son, Clark, in 1992, this often moving but
unevenly written memoir is as contradictory as the life it
chronicles. Wonderfully lyrical language too often is juxtaposed
with cliches and psychobabble. Collins, now 57 years old, is at her
best describing growing up in a household in which ``glorious
music'' was underscored by darker themes. The eldest of five
children, she idolized her father, Charlie Collins, one of the
pioneers during the early years of radio. Blind since the age of 4,
he began every day by singing in the shower before inserting his
specially ordered blue glass eyes. Along with confidence, social
conscience and musical talent, Collins inherited from her father
the family ``failing.'' The man who ``celebrated each new day,
singing at the breakfast table'' could also be ``drunk, morose . .
. unpredictable . . . angry, terrifying.'' ``Music,'' she writes,
``gave me shelter from the pain of thinking'' that her father's
alcoholism ``was my fault.'' Almost seven years after her son's
death, Collins credits singing, a healthy life and an idyllic
second marriage with helping her battle grief and ``the black dog
of depression,'' a beast that has stalked her since childhood. ``I
see my son everywhere, in the glint of the diamonds on the snow,
the songs of birds,'' she writes. ``You are the music of the
spheres now,'' she writes to Clark, ``in your death, even more
vibrant.'' _ LESLIE CHESS FELLER

</P>
<P>
   By Ronald Hayman.

<P>
   Bloomsbury/St. Martin's, $24.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Geli Raubal was Hitler's niece, the daughter of his half sister,
Angela. For two years, beginning in November 1929, she and her
uncle lived together in Munich, and though the precise nature of
their relationship is unclear, Hitler declared repeatedly that she
was the only woman he ever loved. In September 1931 she was found
dead in their apartment. The police reported a suicide, but
questions have surrounded her life and death ever since. In
``Hitler and Geli,'' Ronald Hayman, the author of biographies of
Nietzsche, Kafka and the Marquis de Sade, has collected every bit
of information he can find about the couple. Some of it is
fascinating, some of it is merely prurient and some of it is
fascinatingly prurient (one chapter is entitled ``Things He Makes
Me Do''). Unfortunately, there is not very much of it, so Hayman is
forced to fill out his pages with a banal recitation of Hitler's
rise to power and wobbly speculations based on rumor and hearsay.
The book is crammed with probablys, seems-to-haves and
it-is-unlikelys. Hayman devotes four chapters to the circumstances
of Geli's death, examining everything from the angle of the bullet
wound to Hitler's whereabouts at the time. It is clear that he
would like to say that Hitler pulled the trigger, yet all of his
labors on this point are not only inconclusive but also
anticlimactic and redundant. For even if the evidence were more
substantial than it is, the worst that Hayman would be able to show
is that -- surprise! -- Hitler was a murderer. _ BARRY GEWEN

</P>
<P>
   In 1978, a year after winning the Nobel Prize, Rosalyn Sussman
Yalow was called ``a Madame Curie from the Bronx.'' Only the second
woman ever to win the prize for medicine, she identified closely
with Curie, the ideal scientist, wife and mother, three roles in
which she also sought to excel. In this biographical memoir, Eugene
Straus, a longtime friend and colleague, pays tribute to an
extraordinary woman. Yalow emerges from these pages as brilliant,
ambitious and driven in her professional life, rigid, humorless and
cold-blooded on a personal level. According to her biographer,
Yalow believes that women scientists should marry, rear children,
cook and clean in order to be fulfilled; while pursuing her career,
she had a son and daughter. Outside her family, though, Yalow could
appear unfeeling; when Solomon Berson, the dazzling colleague with
whom she shared dozens of important discoveries and prizes, died
suddenly in 1972, her public display of grief surprised several
onlookers. Five years later, she achieved the Nobel -- to universal
acclaim if not universal affection. _ LYNN KARPEN

   &UR; ONE RIVER MORE
</P>
<P>
   By W. D. Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   W. D. Wetherell wants us to think that he is writing about
fishing, but clearly that is just an excuse for this series of
thoughtful, evocative meditations on the environment, culture,
relationships and, incidentally, fly fishing. In ``One River
More,'' his third and, he says, last book on the subject, Wetherell
takes us through three seasons and 15 years of fishing in the upper
Connecticut River region and Montana. He writes entertainingly of
family trips and stratagems to slip in fishing while spending time
with his children. He muses on the benefits and drawbacks of clubs
(``private water'') and speaks lovingly of the Rangeley Lakes of
western Maine. He sometimes skirts perilously close to
curmudgeonhood as he decries changes in a sport ``that requires
thinking and creativity in a culture that often punishes both.''
But frequently he is right on the mark. ``American consumerism at
full throttle is not a pretty sight,'' he grumbles. And he is
exceedingly grumpy about the new breed of fisher-folk, ``their
competitive fires fully stoked,'' who bring their ``new
sullenness'' and cellular phones to a ``quiet and simple pursuit.''
The most important factor in fly fishing, he says, is ``not casting
ability . . . but coming to appreciate and understand something of
the landscape, terrain, history and culture of the region through
which your river flows.'' Respect for such ``interconnectedness''
is all-important because ``the brutal fact is that our future
depends on our culture's attitude toward the natural world.'' _

</P>
<P>
   By Peter Sis

<P>
   Frances Foster/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man returns to his childhood home in Prague after many years
and nervously climbs the stairs to his father's empty study. On the
desk he finds a mysterious red-lacquered box, which was off limits
to him as a child. He unlocks it with a rusted key, and finds
inside ``pages and pages of fragile paper covered with faded
handwriting and fine drawings and maps blending into the text, all
of it barely holding together, like brittle autumn leaves.'' It's a
diary kept by his father when he was lost in Tibet in the 1950's --
and ground zero for all the magical stories that later captivated
his son. That is the swift and surefooted set-up for the enchanting
TIBET: Through the Red Box (Frances Foster/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$25) by Peter Sis, best known as a writer and illustrator of
children's books. His father, a documentary filmmaker drafted by
the Czechoslovak Army and sent to China to teach and make movies,
was stranded in Tibet during the construction of a highway across
the Himalayas. His diary, embellished with factual notes in the
margins, is interwined with Sis' own recollections of his father's
encounters with nomads, yetis, lamas who fly like kites -- and with
a magical blue lake where the fish have human faces. His wanderings
culminate in a visit to the Forbidden City of Lhasa, where he tries
to warn the Dalai Lama of the threat posed by the coming highway:
``It might well bring hospitals, electricity and technology, but
little roads will then go to the lake, to the Valley of the Yetis,
to the caves and monasteries. What will it take away? It might take
more than it brings.'' All this is accompanied by exquisite
illustrations of his father's adventures, finely detailed mandalas
and dreamlike images that provide a rich counterpoint to the
simple, direct text. Younger readers will be transported by the
folk tales and the artwork, but this is more than a ripping yarn:
with its mystical underpinnings and the muted sadness that washes
over the whole enterprise, it is a personal account of a son still
struggling to understand the absence of his father, and poetic
testimony to the power of the imagination to transfigure reality. _

 THE DARK ROOM
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Julia Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The initial mystery of why an author of self-help guides for
perplexed writers would chose a detective story for her fictional
debut is solved about a hundred pages into ``The Dark Room,'' a
wildly incredible tale of cops and psycho killers. There Julia
Cameron has her protagonist, the aging but honorable Elliot Mayo,
interrupt his pursuit of a murderer to deliver a lecture about
encountering a Darth Vaderish archetype, devised by the Swiss
psychiatrist Carl Jung, that is supposed to stand for our darkest
desire. And suddenly what had been the increasingly preposterous
mean-streets narrative of a wisecracking, conveniently divorced
police detective being romanced by a kooky female surgeon is
revealed as just an artist-as-hero slog, certain to delight fans of
Jung's arcanely mystical notions but just as certain to leave
conventional whoduniteers stranded. So that quirky Jewish medical
examiner who warns Mayo to bathe in Epsom salts to keep the
Satanists away is not merely a delightful eccentric inhabiting a
dreary Chicago neighborhood -- he's a blazing beacon of Jungian
obscurantism who doesn't make the pages turn any faster. Too bad,
since Cameron's tough-guy prose often sparkles with wry turns and
snappy comebacks. Cameron's wit might have excused her symbolist
excesses if she had simply let her detective detect. Instead, Mayo
is pulled about by a plot that forces him to explore the
all-too-horrifying effects of a sex crime involving his son and
battle evil forces inhabiting a ``power ring.'' These gimmicks --
not to mention the overheated taunts of Mayo's love interest and a
twisted killer bent on doing good -- might make sense in terms of
Jungian symbolism but as plot devices they remain beyond Mayo's
belief, as well as our own. _ BILL KENT

</P>
<P>
   Red Greet is a strange and wonderful old man. When we meet him,
at the age of 87, he's behind bars and dancing with his jailer, the
son of an old friend. And he's talking. This unusual introduction
pulls up the curtain on an account of Greet's life and leads into a
stream of stories as he takes us on a tour of his memory's
touchstones. An inveterate but strangely honest thief, Greet has
what he himself describes as a ``soul of hard-packed dung'' -- not
exactly pure, but incredibly fertile in raw human emotion. As the
book proceeds, Greet tells of his lifelong love for Recita Holguin
-- a woman he finally marries when they are both in their 80s --
and of his first wife, Cecilia, who dies in middle age, partly
unloved because of Greet's inconstancy. He tells, too, of the
friendships he has made in the New Mexico village of Las Almas,
especially with his ``dearest friend,'' Francisco Velasco, who
becomes a priest when Greet wins over his true love -- Cecilia --
and who eventually rises to become the local bishop. Greet also
tells a fractured tale of religious turmoil, of the molding of
Roman Catholic ritual to everyday reality, symbolized by the
novel's title. (Hyssop is the soul-healing balm that comes of
confession and the sharing of secrets.) Greet is a jackdaw of
memory, collecting shiny, often unrelated bits of the past and
presenting them with effusive joy. _ ERIK BURNS

   Selected Stories, 1986-1996
</P>
<P>
   By Diane Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Dalkey Archive, paper, $13.50. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Diane Williams has gathered 107 stories and a 44-part novella in
her latest collection, which takes its title from a story about
romance and nostalgia that appeared in her 1996 volume, ``The
Stupefaction.'' Although the story itself hasn't been included
here, ``excitability'' is an apt precis of this new book's
lightning-quick, innovative style. Williams defies narrative
convention with her disembodied, unnamed characters, whose concerns
include sex, marriage and child rearing and whose predicaments have
no beginning, middle or end. Frequently told in the first person,
her work elicits a reader's voyeuristic complicity and wish to
understand -- if not identify with -- the speaker's state of mind.
At their best, Williams's stories achieve a high degree of lyric
intensity and suggestiveness. But while the brevity and esthetic
discernment of individual stories may be thought-provoking, a
succession of them can seem tiresome, even insubstantial. _ GARDNER

   &UR; THE CLEFT: And Other Odd Tales
</P>
<P>
   By Gahan Wilson
</P>
<P>
   Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gahan Wilson turns his pictures into thousands of words in this
collection of meticulously eccentric stories. But the illustrations
are definitely the icing on this devil's food cake of a book. The
best story is the tenderly heartbreaking ``Frog Prince,'' about a
poor little creature with a recurring dream about a kingly father
and a spell that until broken holds him fast in the loneliness of
his watery world: ``Frog watched from his lily pad, confident that
the magic would work on its own, that his salvation was
approaching.'' Salvation, alas, is not an option for most of
Wilson's characters. Spiders devour the curious, sea gulls wreak
vengeance on the guilty, cats claw their owners to death -- and
what people do to people is even worse. The title story, about
monks decorating the precipitous route to their mountainside
shrine, is a brisk lesson in human folly. In ``The Power of the
Mandarin,'' a fictional character undoes a real-life foe, thinking:
``The idiot had discovered Evan Trowbridge's strength, which was
implacable hatred, but he had shared, and therefore missed
altogether, his weakness, which was a lack of sufficient
imagination.'' Happily, this is a weakness that Wilson doesn't
share. _ ANDREA HIGBIE

   By Angela Huth.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, $23.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In her latest novel, Angela Huth (the author of ``Land Girls'')
tells of the lifelong, heartfelt friendship -- laced nonetheless
with rivalry, jealousy and disapproval -- between two women who
live in a tiny, secluded fishing village on the east coast of
Scotland. Myrtle Duns is the plain but intelligent friend of Annie
Mcleoud, a beautiful, frivolous, self-centered charmer. With these
characters, Huth drops curtsies to George Eliot and, in particular,
Jane Austen: Myrtle is deliciously slow to recognize that a man she
sees only as a friend is, in fact, her future husband. (We, of
course, have twigged to this long before she has.) But while Huth
enables readers to be perceptive when it comes to the undercurrents
of her story, she muddles us in other ways. Myrtle and Annie have
televisions and microwaves, yet often Huth's characters express
themselves with 19th-century circumspection. (A marriage proposal
is delivered with sober formality: ``You must know that I would be
far from averse . . . to changing the solitary nature of my
life.'') Luckily, this winds up being charming rather than
disturbing because it puts us into a timeless realm. And the novel
offers the additional pleasure of Huth's precise and piquant
descriptions: the ``velutinous black'' on the horizon where the sea
merges with the sky; the ``plushy warm air of a late summer
evening.'' ``I'm one of those who finds more than enough in a small
world,'' Myrtle concludes. Huth makes us share that sentiment. _

   'Twas the day before the night before the night before the night
before the night before Christmas -- or something like that. Fired
from his job, unsure about his sexuality, about to lose his sublet
apartment and suspecting that his doctoral dissertation will never
get written, Tad Leary is remarkably unprepared for revelry of any
kind. But since he's unprepared for anything else either, he
decides to take in a whole succession of holiday parties. In his
frothy second novel, Mark O'Donnell follows Tad through Manhattan
on an expedition to various circles of social hell. He begins with
a strained family gathering on the East Side. (Tad's father is
recovering from a heart attack and one of his brothers from a
bankruptcy-induced suicide attempt; his mother makes tactless
remarks designed to find out if Tad has AIDS.) From there, he flees
to an artistically unsatisfying session of performance art in the
East Village, repairs to the home of a Swedish friend where
everyone speaks in exclamatory sentences (``I see you're in your
trademark jeans and white shirt!'') and briefly crashes the holiday
party of the school that fired him before ending up at a
titanically superficial gala in a garish penthouse on Fifth Avenue.
What can Tad expect (besides a monumental hangover) from this
pilgrimage? Maybe just a bit of peace in the tiny corner of the
world he calls his own. _ JAMES POLK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Adams is not a flashy writer; but in his quiet way, he
applies his spare, unruffled style to the creation of a modest
kingdom of the imagination where the landscape has a comforting
familiarity, where values seem certain and where characters come
and go with the confident step of people who know they belong here.
In NO BADGE, NO GUN (Walker, $22.95), as in earlier books in this
offbeat series, the stranger in this land is Carl Wilcox, an
itinerant sign painter and sometime sleuth who wanders across South
Dakota during the Great Depression, settling in a town just long
enough to get the lay of the land, spruce up the drugstore or dance
hall and maybe solve a murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like getting to know a place in a day or two,'' Carl says.
``Who runs it, why, all that. It's easy to get acquainted.'' Here,
Carl's traveling feet take him to Jonesville, where a stern pastor
hires him to solve the murder of his 15-year-old niece, who was
raped and strangled in the church basement. Carl pursues this one
to the bitter end; but being a keen student of human nature, he
also picks up on the local prejudices about sex and strangers,
adding to his already considerable store of knowledge about life in
rural America during a period when irresistible social changes were
beginning to sweep across the prairie.

   Edith Skom evokes ``the indefinable essence of dormitory'' to
transport us to a women's residence hall at the University of
Chicago in the late 1940's for her academic mystery THE CHARLES
DICKENS MURDERS (Delacorte, $21.95). Wafted on eau de tuna
casserole, Tabu and the hormonal heat of virginal intellectuals,
this smartly plotted whodunit progresses from incidents of petty
theft and boyfriend poaching to a murder that destroys the girlish
loyalties of a group of friends. ``The whole dorm looks at each
other now,'' one says, ``sort of suspicious, sort of scared.''
Years later, the survivors still wonder which one of them is a
murderer -- and if the killing is truly over.
</P>
<P>
   When Beth Austin, a professor of literature and the brainy star
of this series, learns of the unsolved crime from her mother, a
member of the dorm clique, she hunts down all the old girls and
puts them through some Dickensian analysis. This one reminds her of
Lady Dedlock; that one, of the cruel and conniving lawyer
Tulkinghorn; while the actual murder, ``like the case of Jarndyce
and Jarndyce'' in ``Bleak House,'' ``stretched back to the past and
blighted the present.'' Even when the Dickens connections become
forced or intrusive, Skom maintains the wit to deliver a lively and
affectionate picture of dorm life in an earlier but hardly innocent
generation.

   Lynda S. Robinson has an interesting theory about how Queen
Nefertiti died. (Hint: it was not of the plague that scourged Egypt
during the reign of her husband, the heretic King Ikhnaton.) Having
raised the tantalizing issue of regicide in ``Eater of Souls,''
Robinson now resolves it in DRINKER OF BLOOD (Mysterious Press/
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $22) through gorgeously textured vignettes that trace
the Queen's career from Pharaoh's 12-year-old child bride to ``the
focus of court intrigue'' as the true power behind the throne. Even
in fragments, the story has a dark, romantic power.
</P>
<P>
   But why the fragmentary treatment in the first place? Within the
broader scheme of this vividly dramatized series, Nefertiti's fate
is the obsessive concern of the fictional hero, Lord Meren, the
subtle spy master who serves as ``the Eyes and Ears of Pharaoh'' in
the court of Tutankhamen. Despite Meren's convincing argument that
the dead queen's enemies threaten his own monarch, the double
narrative is a double distraction. For all that, it's always a
pleasure to negotiate the treacherous corridors of power with Lord
Meren and his wily associates, eavesdropping on the priests in
Pharaoh's court, ducking the knife fights on the back streets of
Memphis -- and picking up beauty tips from Nefertiti.
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe that Russian spies, Mafia gangsters and rogue
C.I.A. agents are running amok in Vermont? I have trouble with that
one, too, and Archer Mayor is less than persuasive on the matter in
THE DISPOSABLE MAN (Mysterious Press/Warner, $22). Lieut. Joe
Gunther, the local lawman in this series, keeps his rock-jawed face
from cracking when a dead Russian mobster is found floating in a
soapstone quarry. ``I prided myself on keeping cool, keeping my
emotional cards out of sight, maintaining a professional stance,''
Gunther says. But after tearing around the state chasing renegade
spooks and landing himself in jail, the stoical hero finally blows
his composure. Despite a sensational mountaintop shootout that
clinches the action, this one is on hostile territory.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but Patricia Carlon is back with another novel
of psychological suspense that confounds every neat notion about
what an intellectual thriller is supposed to be. CRIME OF SILENCE
(Soho, $21) opens as a conventional kidnapping case: Evan Kiley's
little boy has been snatched by the same villains who took George
Winton's little girl, but later returned her for a ransom and her
father's promise of silence. Appealing to Winton's guilty
conscience, Kiley enlists his aid in dealing with the kidnappers,
and on that level alone, the tension is terrific. But Carlon, an
Australian novelist whose work has just recently begun to surface
here, turns the formula inside out to raise the deeper issue of
what a man must do to pay off a moral debt. The game of nerves that
Kiley and Winton play is so manipulative that only one thing is
clear: this is a writer who is good enough to make up her own
rules.

<P>
   &UR; SELECTED POEMS: 1960-1990
</P>
<P>
   By Maxine Kumin.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, $17.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This collection by a versatile elegist and observer of nature
features vivid poems that are, refreshingly, about something: many
tell stories that serve to preserve her family's history. Last year
in the Book Review, Richard Tillinghast called the book ``a welcome
addition to any poetry library.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A JOURNEY WITH ELSA CLOUD
</P>
<P>
   By Leila Hadley.
</P>
<P>
   Penguin, $14.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Invited to India by her estranged hippie daughter, a demanding,
perfectionist mother embarks on a voyage of self-discovery that
takes her from New Delhi to the home of the exiled Dalai Lama, with
epiphanies and emotional awakenings along the way. ``Hadley is a
gifted travel writer with an artist's eye for the composition --
and the look, smell and history -- of every scene,'' Diane Johnson
wrote here last year. In India: From Midnight to the Millennium, by
Shashi Tharoor (Harper Perennial, $14), an expatriate takes a hard
look at his country's first 50 years of independence, and explains
why parliamentary democracy has done so little to relieve poverty,
illiteracy and disease. ``Few books in recent years, if any, offer
such a comprehensive overview of what ails India, its politicians
and its people,'' John F. Burns said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOUR LETTERS OF LOVE
</P>
<P>
   By Niall Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $13.99. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of this tale of romance and fate is a Dubliner
whose search for one of his artist father's paintings leads him
into the arms of a young woman on the Irish coast. Last year our
reviewer, Katharine Weber, called the novel ``a luminously written,
magical work of fiction . . . filled with marvelous characters,
large and small.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE END OF THE NOVEL OF LOVE
</P>
<P>
   By Vivian Gornick.
</P>
<P>
   Beacon, $12. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Examining the works of writers like Willa Cather and Grace
Paley, a critic argues that literature has lost its faith in the
transformative power of love. ``Gornick makes forceful and dramatic
judgments,'' Elizabeth Frank wrote here in 1997. ``Reading her
essays, one is reassured that the conversation between life and
literature is mutually sustaining as well as mutually corrective.''
The Merry Heart: Reflections on Reading, Writing, and the World of
Books, by Robertson Davies (Penguin, $14.95), is a posthumous
collection of lectures and essays by the Canadian novelist on the
literary life and matters of humane concern. Last year our
reviewer, Sven Birkerts, said that even though much of his public
prose is less successful on the written page, ``Davies was a
relaxed and winning raconteur, a beguiling autocrat of the
rostrum.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAIN WHISTLE GUITAR
</P>
<P>
   By Albert Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage International, $13. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This novel, just restored to print, is about a black boy growing
up in Alabama in the 1920's and his idol, a blues guitarist named
Luzana Cholly. In 1974 in these pages, John Wideman admired the
``long passages of dialogue, monologue, the lyric descriptions of
countryside and fireside, which are nothing so much as the riffs
and choruses of a blues artist translated into speech and action.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FILE: A PERSONAL HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy Garton Ash.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage, $13. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A British historian tells how he found a blurred image of his
younger self in an old East German secret police file, and how he
tracked down the people who had informed on him. The result is ``a
political thriller, reminiscent of Graham Greene and John le Carre,
and a treatise on memory, forgetting and forgiving in the great
tradition of Proust,'' Tomas Venclova wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HALLUCINATING FOUCAULT
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Duncker.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage International, $12. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This intricate first novel focuses on a graduate student who
tracks down and falls in love with the subject of his dissertation,
a French novelist in an insane asylum. The result is ``a
fascinating drama of knowledge and power, reason and desire,''
Allen Lincoln said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MURDER IN THE MUSEUM OF MAN
</P>
<P>
   By Alfred Alcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Zoland, $13. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When a university dean is found dead in the Museum of Man, the
museum's courtly recording secretary turns sleuth. The result is a
``stylish, occasionally fiendish detective story . . . out to
skewer glitzy academic corruption,'' Nina Auerbach said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUMAN CAPOTE:
</P>
<P>
   In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors
Recall His Turbulent Career
</P>
<P>
   By George Plimpton.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor/Doubleday, $16.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This chronicle shows how the talented Capote turned fame into an
art form, and finally into a substitute for art itself. His lurid
story is told mostly through the firsthand accounts of fellow
celebrities. In 1997 our reviewer, Julia Reed, found the book to be
filled with old gossip, but said ``some of the best bits reveal
more about the speaker than about the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PILGRIMS
</P>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, $12. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pilgrims in this first short-story collection are
working-class folks searching for redemption but skeptical of
spiritual enlightenment. The author ``embraces the bizarre and
fabulous with similar enthusiasm,'' Liam Callanan wrote here in
1997. ``She moves stealthily, avoiding the temptation to
grandstand, moralize or, especially, patronize.''

   CALIFORNIA -- FEMA. Berkeley won a federal emergency-disaster
relief award Wednesday, earning recognition for its efforts at
limiting damage when earthquakes and mudslides hit. While the city
is sometimes known derisively as the ``People's Republic of
Berkeley,'' city officials said it is precisely because of the
city's high taxes, which it uses for seismic retrofitting, that led
to the honor. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- SOCIAL. Lawmakers seem to be moving toward a rough
consensus around a group of proposals to invest Social Security
money in the market to save the benefits program from future
insolvency -- a position backed by Sen. Wayne Allard. One of his
party's most vocal advocates of reform, Allard is one of 12 Senate
Republicans who took part in a five-hour closed-door meeting with
President Clinton at the White House. Davant
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- CUBA. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd on his recent trip
to Cuba. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   -- IMPEACH. What delegation members are thinking about next
week's likely impeachment vote. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA -- FEC. The lack of competition in South Florida House
races this year has left most of the region's eight-member
delegation with piles of money to throw into their 2000 campaigns.
Williams
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA -- FEC. U.S. Sen. Fritz Hollings outraised and outspent
U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis in this year's South Carolina Senate race by
more than 2-1 on his way to winning a seventh term. Cookie magnate
Michael Coles, able to draw on his personal fortune, was more
financially competitive with Sen. Paul Coverdell in the Georgia
Senate contest. But he also lost the battle for campaign dollars to
the incumbent as he came up short in the vote tally. Williams
</P>
<P>
   MAINE -- SOCIAL. Lawmakers seem to be moving toward a rough
consensus around a group of proposals to invest some Social
Security money in the market to save the benefits program from
future insolvency -- a position advocated by Sen. Susan M. Collins.
She is one of 12 Senate Republicans who attended today's White
House conference on the subject, and, as a member of the Social
Security task force appointed by Majority Leader Trent Lott, she is
likely to have a role in shaping any reform measure that makes it
to the Senate floor for a vote. Davant
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS -- WELD. Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld
testified today before the House Judiciary Committee. Preston
</P>
<P>
   -- WELD2000. Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld took himself
out of the running for a 2000 Senate campaign. Preston
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN -- CONGRESS. With at least four representatives
undecided on their vote, Michigan's congressional coalition may
hold the key to whether President Clinton is eventually impeached
by the House. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- NEY-IMPEACH. Rep. Bob Ney, R-St. Clairsville, is
garnering national media attention as an ``undecided'' Republican
when it comes to the possible impeachment of President Clinton. CNN
and the New York Times plan to follow him around the district on
Thursday as he meets and greets constituents. However, the St.
Clairsville Republican said he is simply doing what he said he
would do when he voted for the impeachment inquiry: waiting to hear
the facts before making a decision. Hurt
</P>
<P>
   -- FARM-BILL. (WORKING FOR WEEKEND) With bad weather and
plummeting commodity prices, the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act faced its
first real test this year since its passage. This year, Congress
ended up doling out nearly $7 billion in emergency spending to help
farmers through a tough season -- problems that may have been
solved through the crop subsidies that were slashed in the farm
bill. Does the bill adequately address the needs of farmers? Hurt
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- SOCSEC. Republican Sen. Rick Santorum had the
president's ear on his plan to privatize social security. The two
emerged side by side from a closed door meeting Clinton held today
with lawmakers to discuss the reform of social security. Santorum
said he feels Democrats, like Clinton, are more open to some form
of privatization than he ever thought they would be. The two-day
conference ended today. Fine
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA -- GRAHAM. U.S. Rep. Lindsey Graham is unmoved by
President Clinton's defense to impeachment charges, and appears
poised to vote with fellow Republicans on the House Judiciary
Committee to send the case to the House floor. (Working.) Williams
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS -- REAX. Rio Grande Valley lawmakers are refraining from
commenting on the Judiciary committee hearings. Brown
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- IMPEACH-REACT. Reaction from the Wisconsin
delegation about the impeachment hearings. (Possible.) Hurt
</P>
<P>
   -- IMPEACH-NEW. After spending a long election season and its
aftermath setting goals for their first session in Congress,
Wisconsin's newly elected members may find themselves returning to
a Washington that is paralyzed by a Senate trial of President
Clinton. (Possible.) Hurt

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The sky is falling, in the form of dust dropping
to Earth from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   This rain of particles may vary in cycles, periodically dimming
sunlight and cooling Earth. The variations may partly trigger ice
ages every 100,000 years or so, some scientists think.
</P>
<P>
   But others are skeptical, at least until better data come in,
they said at the American Geophysical Union conference in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So in a sort of scientific spring cleaning, researchers are
plumbing the ocean floor and flying into the upper atmosphere to
collect dust that has fallen to Earth over millions of years, or
what is falling right now through the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In high-resolution images, these interplanetary dust particles
vaguely resemble stale popcorn. Scientists hope the particles will
tell reveal something about Earth's climate history and outer
space.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist collects outer-space particles that drop onto
rooftop collectors atop a building at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena. But given Los Angeles' notorious smog, a
rooftop collector isn't ideal ``because of all the gunk from the
sky that falls on it,'' said the researcher, space scientist
Kenneth A. Farley.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Muller, a noted space scientist and physicist at the
University of California at Berkeley, has argued for years that
Earth's pendulum-like swings between glacial and warmer conditions
might be caused, in part, by the planet swinging into and out of
the solar system's dust belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said this is a wonderful session because none of the
speakers agree with any of the other speakers,'' Muller said
Tuesday during his talk at a symposium, ``Accretion of
Extraterrestrial Matter Throughout Earth's History.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller said cyclical variations in the inclination of Earth's
orbit cause it to pass in and out of solar system dust rings
sloughed off giant asteroids _ some as big as cities, others the
size of small states. Over time, these rings slowly drift toward
the inner solar system and periodically encounter Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Muller suspects Earth's encunters with the rings partly account
for an apparent 100,000-year cycle in ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   Is the 100,000-year cycle real, or a statistical illusion like
so many natural ``cycles'' that scientists have reported for
centuries?
</P>
<P>
   The 100,000-year cycle is real, at least if Steven J.
Kortenkamp's data are right. The Carnegie Institution of Washington
researcher used computer models to show how dust would flow into
the inner solar system by flaking off three ``families'' of
asteroids known as Eos, Themis and Koronis.
</P>
<P>
   His computer model suggests that over the past 1.2 million
years, ``the accretion rate of asteroidal dust varies ... with a
100,000-year periodicity.''
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists said it's too early to credit the invisible
dusty downpour for the ice ages, the semi-global freezes that
buried much of North America under ice sheets miles thick, lowered
sea levels, and enabled the ancestors of Native Americans to cross
from Siberia into the New World.
</P>
<P>
   The last ice age ended roughly 10,000 years ago, just before the
mass peopling of the Americas and the rise of the great ancient
civilizations of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some scientists believe there is no evidence that waves of
interplanetary particles peak every 100,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Trull and Will Howard of Australia, and Bernard Marty of
France dated the age of particles found in primeval sediments by
illuminating them with lasers. This technique allowed them to
measure the particles' abundance of an isotope called helium-3,
which is common in space particles. They found no evidence of a
100,000-year periodicity in the volumes of particles that have
dropped to Earth over time.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists suspect the periods are real but have a more
down-to-Earth cause _ namely, variations in oceanic processes that
cause helium-3-rich particles that clump together in certain
portions of sediments.

SANTA'S GOT A HO-HO-WHOLE LOT OF PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ho, Ho, Ho! 'Tis the season of holiday-related news releases,
and we're buried in a blizzard of paper, surrounded by flakes.
Among the jewels of prose that urge us to consider Christmas as the
most wonderful time of the year to worry about eczema, that cajole
us to help readers quit smoking this holy season with the help of
pampered pets, and that promote out-and-out excess in the form of
$80 desk-top coffee-heating microwaves, we occasionally find the
work of a public relations team with a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   So Merry Christmas to the PR specialists at Methodist Health
Care System in Houston, who put their yuletide spin this year on
Santa's health habits, which they say are no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeeeees _ and no. Here's a slice of their jolly release
detailing the big guy's problems, and what he needs to do about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Santa's overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms: Abdomen shakes like ``bowl full of jelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns: Heart disease, adult-onset diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Comprehensive healthful lifestyle changes _
beginning with a prescribed weight-loss plan such the ones offered
at the Institute for Preventive Medicine at Methodist Health Care
System and Baylor College of Medicine. Santa needs a
physician-supervised program for people needing to shed more than
40 pounds. Santa should also begin regular aerobic exercise to
improve cardiovascular conditioning as well as keep the weight off.
</P>
<P>
   His cholesterol is high.
</P>
<P>
   Cause: Eggnog-and-cookie diet (perpetuated by well-meaning
youngsters).
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Try bringing along some fat-free snacks
(raisins, carrot sticks, apple wedges) to take the edge off
Christmas Eve cravings. Weight management programs can offer some
great suggestions (see ``Overweight'').
</P>
<P>
   Santa suffers from back and knee pain.
</P>
<P>
   Cause: Hefting large sacks of toys; obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Enroll in weight-control programs and head for
the gym (see ``Overweight''). Use ergonomically correct cart or
dolly for toys.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't hear so well.
</P>
<P>
   Cause: Spending most of the year in a noisy workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Use of OSHA-approved ear protection while at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Annual auditory screening; get fitted for hearing aids, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He has a real problem with sleigh safety.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns: No head protection or seat belts in evidence;
inadequate illumination provided by single glowing reindeer nose.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations: Replace fur cap with crash helmet; retrofit
sleigh with shoulder harness, lap belt, air bag and
government-approved landing lights.
</P>
<P>
   It's a prostate thing.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating factors: Age; long hours of sitting during
around-the-world flights.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: As for all men older than 40, an annual
screening for prostate cancer is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   There's that nose like a cherry.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns: Could be a sign of eczema, windburn, sun exposure or
other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Annual skin cancer screening. Check for
allergies to reindeer, mistletoe, holly.
</P>
<P>
   Also, lay off the hot rum toddies.
</P>
<P>
   He's plagued by pre-cancerous lung, mouth and throat irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Causes: Pipe smoking, exposure to large amounts of chimney soot.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Stop smoking immediately. Seek alternative means
of access to dwellings, or wear OSHA-approved respirator when
working in or near chimneys and fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   He's subject to animal-borne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cause: Working in close association with reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Keep stables clean and wash hands often when
working with animals. Check for flea and tick infestations. See
doctor about possible vaccination against Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   He's a victim of carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Cause: Making long lists, checking them twice.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Use of voice-activated word-processing software
to relieve stress on hands and wrists.
</P>
<P>
   He's really got issues.
</P>
<P>
   Manifestation: Irrationally jolly all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Indication: ``North Polar Disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommendation: Immediate evaluation by a board-certified
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa is a paragon of generosity and goodwill, but no one
should consider him a role model for healthy living,'' sums up
Molly Gee, manager of the Institute for Preventive Medicine. ``For
an elf on the high side of 400, he looks to be in pretty good
shape. But if St. Nick wants to be around for another
half-millennium or so, he might want to consider some lifestyle
changes in 1999.''

STUFFED ANIMALS AND A WEB PAGE SOOTHE A SICK BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (af) 
 By ANN KIRSCHNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How do you cope with the serious illness of a child?
Some ways are primal, and others are learned on the job.
</P>
<P>
   I tried both the old and the new during the last year, after my
10-year-old son, Peter, was told that he had ulcerative colitis.
But when he was hospitalized just a few weeks ago to have his colon
removed, I packed my laptop computer along with his favorite
blanket and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   In another era, I would have paced in the family waiting room
with my address book and a bag of quarters to pass on hospital news
to friends and relatives. But on that day, my connection was
achieved with a Web site on his surgery and hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   Since Peter got sick, in November 1997, I have used the Internet
for many things related to his illness. It was natural for me: as
the founder and general manager of NFL.com, I've been running an
extremely busy Web site for more than four years. That makes me
just slightly younger than John Glenn in Internet years.
</P>
<P>
   I rely on the Internet every day for research and communication;
still, I could never have anticipated its significance as our
bridge from the confinement of the hospital to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Peter had begged me for months to help him create a personal
home page. When I finally got around to it, he was too weak to
participate. Too many months of steroids had weakened his bones,
distorted his features and bloated his body. My handsome and skinny
10-year-old was trapped in a form that seemed stolen from the
Cartman character on ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as Peter played with old friends and made new ones,
we worked with his doctors to try new drugs and new therapies,
hoping to avoid surgery. Peter's spirits never flagged. When he
became too weak to bike around his beloved summer haunts on Fire
Island, he borrowed an adult tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   He had a pinch runner for softball games, he finished ``The Lord
of the Rings,'' and he played endless games of Monopoly with his
sisters and dad. According to Peter, it was the best summer of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't rate my own summer quite so highly, squeezed between
Peter's medical needs and work, with pockets of time when I lost
myself on the Internet, looking for miracles and sharing
information about the disease with others on line.
</P>
<P>
   But no miracles materialized, and on Nov. 1, we were finally
preparing Peter for surgery. I alternated between fussing over him
with chicken soup that he didn't have the appetite to eat and
banging on my computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange dual role. I could do little to ease Peter's
discomfort, so the hassle of giving myself a crash course in Web
design was a good distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my experience at the NFL Web site, I had never really
done the heavy lifting myself. Other people, far more proficient in
Internet technology, had created the basic site architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Now I was the uncertain Webmaster of www.kirschner.org. My goal
was to open a Web site that would provide basic information about
Peter's recovery as well as answer general questions about colitis,
colectomies and how to get in touch with us. The site had to be
easy to use and visually appealing. Most important, and most
difficult to achieve, it had to be interactive.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the better part of the day before Peter's surgery
huddled over the computer and weeping as I listened to the
television coverage of the New York Marathon. Just one year before,
I had run the marathon for the first time. From the exhilaration
and pride of that moment to the terror and melancholy of this day
was too far to fall.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at Mount Sinai-New York University Medical Center on
a Monday morning at 6:45. In addition to the usual patient
paraphernalia, I carried a cellular phone, a laptop, a digital
camera, a digital tape recorder, a microphone and assorted plugs,
wires and adapters.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery began at 8:30 a.m. We were prepared to wait for at
least three hours. Mercifully, by 10 a.m., Dr. Stephen Dolgin sent
Nan Lim-Sulit, a nurse practitioner, to tell us that all had gone
well, that the doctor was nearly done and that Peter would be in
the recovery room shortly. It was a true act of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   By early that afternoon, Peter was sleeping deeply in his
hospital room, tubes and wires connecting him to various
intravenous pain medicine and nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   While he rested, I, too, got wired. An adjustable hospital bed
table made an admirable mobile desk. The Web site was up and
running. My first technical challenge was just logging on to the
Internet through the hospital's unpredictable telephone system. I
had to dial in again and again, frequently losing the connection
midstream.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Peter became more alert, he and I settled into a routine. His
job was to rest and submit to the hospital staff's questions and
examinations. In addition to good old-fashioned mothering, my duty
was to update the home page in the evening, adding digital photos
and audio clips.
</P>
<P>
   Peter's pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Keith Benkov, and
Dolgin submitted gracefully to posing for the home page with their
patient and his stuffed animals. Peter particularly loved to show
visitors a picture in our online family album that was taken before
he became sick and strikingly ``cushingoid,'' exhibiting the
moon-faced steroid effect named after a real Cushing.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital staff, too, seemed to enjoy the Web site. Three
medical students trooped in one day, having heard about the site
when Peter's case was presented in pediatric rounds. Modern
medicine!
</P>
<P>
   On the third night, I tried to install a new computer game for
Peter. To my horror, my brand-new laptop crashed. Suddenly, I was
staring dumbly at a screen that was beyond Windows, beyond DOS, a
relic from some prehistoric setup protocol.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the computer help line at first brought no relief, as
Stan, the laconic technician, diagnosed a fatal system board error.
Send it back tomorrow, he commanded. ``Just think up one more
fix,'' I pleaded. ``The hospital setting, Peter's illness _ I need
desperately to get back on line!''
</P>
<P>
   I was just about ready to offer him my Super Bowl tickets when
he offhandedly suggested a voodoo reboot with keyboarding
combinations I had never heard of. Suddenly, there was the friendly
face of Windows back again. Thanks, Stan.
</P>
<P>
   The best feature of the Web site was a guest book, which was
eventually signed by more than 100 people. (A counter on the home
page has registered more than 1,000 visits, probably suggesting
that our guests have been on the site about 10 times each.) I had
wrested these features from the software late the night before
surgery, and the victory was worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Every evening, I rolled the computer over to Peter's bedside and
we read the guest book together. Every single message was a little
jolt of energy for Peter and me. Our oldest visitor was well into
his 80s, and many of Peter's fourth-grade classmates signed the
book on their own or with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few clowns in every crowd: my nephew revealed his
diabolical plot to alter Peter's photos digitally and send him nude
around the Internet. A business colleague offered to handle
advertising sales on this highly trafficked site.
</P>
<P>
   The site documented Peter's first walk in the hospital, his
first meal, his return home and his triumphant welcome back to
school just 15 days after surgery. Recently we celebrated his last
dose of steroids.
</P>
<P>
   At some time in the future, he will return to the hospital for
reconstructive surgery, but we are grateful for each strong new day
and are not looking too far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Was this all a little too much like ``The Truman Show,'' as I
produced a site that invited people to experience Peter's illness
and recovery in something close to real time? Perhaps it seems
uncomfortably close to the wacky stories of live medical events on
the Internet, where total strangers are sharing everything from
childbirth to open heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   For now, I'll beg off on the deeper ethical considerations. All
I know is that the Internet enabled us to create a living community
that temporarily knit together everyone close to us in a deep and
emotional connection. Digital never felt so warm.

<P>
   Was a key part of the Christmas story borrowed from the Dead Sea
Scrolls?
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars think it was and point to a scroll they say was
written a generation before Jesus' birth that sounds like the angel
Gabriel's announcement to Mary that her son would be the messiah.
</P>
<P>
   But overlooked for the 50 years since that little-known scroll
was discovered is evidence that the scholars are wrong and that it
-- along with other Dead Sea Scrolls -- could not have been written
until long after the rise of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Son of God'' text, the scroll reads, in part:
``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the son
of the most high ... . His kingdom will be an eternal kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Luke's New Testament account of the annunciation, the angel
Gabriel told Mary: ``He will be great, and will be called the son
of the Most High ... and of His kingdom there will be no end.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dead Sea Scroll scholars have used the scrolls to
support an increasingly popular view that there was little
originality in the divine claims of the carpenter from Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   But University of Chicago scholar John Collins goes farther than
most in discussing the titles ``Son of God'' and ``Son of the Most
High.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is overwhelmingly probable that Luke borrowed these titles,
either from this text or from a common tradition to identify Jesus
as the messiah,'' Collins writes in his 1997 book, ``Apocalypticism
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   One scholar, John Walvoord, chancellor of Dallas Theological
Seminary, said the implications of Collins' statement are profound
because he ``implies that Luke's gospel is not divinely inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead Sea Scrolls are right and the Bible is wrong? How do
they know this?'' Walvoord asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians and Jews, questions about the significance and
dating of the scrolls are as important as the Bible itself.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that the Son of God text and other Dead Sea Scrolls are
ancient, scroll scholars have convinced publishers of Christian
Bibles to make hundreds of changes to some recent editions of the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   But the Son of God text contains long-ignored Hebrew letters,
vowel marks and tiny letters that did not come into use until after
600 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have seen the vowels cannot explain their presence.
</P>
<P>
   And just as important as the physical evidence attesting to the
scroll's age are the ideas it contains and the way they are
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   For any Jewish scribe before Christ to have described a man --
even the coming messiah -- as immortal, divine and the son of God
would have been far beyond the bounds of Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that a Jew of that time didn't write this,''
said Rabbi Kenneth Weiss of El Paso, Texas. ``It's not a Jewish way
to refer to a messiah, and I don't believe a Jewish source would
ever use that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Friedman, director of Feinstein Center for
American-Jewish History at Philadelphia's Temple University, was
shocked to hear that a document like the Son of God text was found
among the Dead Sea Scrolls at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable!'' he said. ``If this is real ... Jesus has
been authenticated. If it's a BC document, it announces in strict,
clear-cut terms the arrival of the messiah. But if it's after, it's
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Also disagreeing with the views of established scroll scholars
is Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the former president of that institution,
who said he does ``not think the Son of God text was written before
the time of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoch Guy, professor of Hebrew and coordinator of Hebrew
Studies at Temple University in Philadelphia agrees that ``the
language is absolutely Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is a Christian text,'' Guy said of
the Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Sea Scrolls supposedly were written by a Jewish sect
over a period that began as early as 200 years before the birth of
Christ and ended early in the first century.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   About 68 AD, most scholars believe, the scrolls were stashed in
caves overlooking the Dead Sea, where they remained undisturbed
until 1947 when an Arab shepherd boy stumbled upon them.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   But more than 50 years after the first scrolls came to light,
many questions remain about their origins.
</P>
<P>
   While the scrolls are a national treasure to Israel and the
basis for changes being made in the Old Testament of some Christian
Bibles, publishers of Jewish Bibles are reluctant to make the same
changes, even though the scrolls are thought to be the oldest
existing copies of Jewish holy texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are really leaving the (Bible) as is,'' said
Helaine Denenberg, editorial assistant with the Jewish Publication
Society, North America's foremost publisher of Jewish Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews are even more adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrolls are not from mainstream Judaism, but from an
extremist sect,'' said Rabbi Yehoshua Kaganoff of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the existence of the Son of God text was known only
to a handful of scholars. But in the mid-1990s, the entire text was
published, revealing striking New Testament themes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to describing a divine messiah, the text also echoes
the New Testament description of Jesus' return and of the end
times:
</P>
<P>
   ``One nation shall trample on another nation ... (Then) his
kingdom (shall be) an everlasting kingdom ... He shall judge the
earth in righteousness, and everyone shall have peace ... and every
nation will submit to Him.'' (Parentheses represent reconstructed
passages.)
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to portray the Son of God text as a
pre-Christian document, some scroll scholars theorize that it
referred to a figure who lived a century or more before the birth
of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence -- so hard to explain, so easy to overlook --
repeatedly suggests that the writer of the scroll was aware of New
Testament theology, of Jesus and of the end of the world that he
described.

<P>
   Every day, hundreds of blind and visually impaired people in
Asheville, N.C., rely on Bob Brummond's radio reading service for
their national and local news.
</P>
<P>
   One of about 150 such services in the United States, Brummond's
programming lets listeners who own a specialized radio receiver
listen to the reading of newspapers and magazines and hear exercise
programs. If they have a computer with Internet capability, a
screen reader and a speech synthesizer, they can also listen to
news off the Web page Brummond set up last year.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in January, Brummond expects, anyone with a
telephone will be able to gain access to his page, the Regional
Audio Information Service Enterprise site, raise.new-era.net, and
hear the news read without a special radio or a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Brummond, who is general manager of the service, will be trying
out a new voice-based browsing device from Productivity Works
(www.prodworks.com) in Trenton, N.J., that will allow a caller to
make his way through the Web page by punching buttons on a
touch-tone telephone and picking out items of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Voice access to the Internet, along with ways of using
speech-recognition technology to make computers respond to voice
commands, is a growing focus of research.
</P>
<P>
   In October, for instance, Motorola Inc., Visa International and
several other companies announced an alliance to create
speech-recognition standards that could potentially make the
Internet accessible to anyone with a telephone, reducing the need
for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   So new products like the Productivity Works browsing device,
while intended primarily to help the blind, are being closely
watched for possible broader applications.
</P>
<P>
   The Productivity Works product, Pwtelephone, runs on software
compatible with Windows, and will essentially turn Brummond's Web
page into a voice on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any blind or low-vision person with a touch-tone phone can now
read the paper,'' said Brummond, who estimates that only about 5
percent to 10 percent of the blind people in his area use the
Internet. Many blind people use screen readers to surf the Web, but
the graphics elements are hard for such programs to digest.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites, however, including The New York Times'
(www.nytimes.com), offer alternative, low-graphics versions.
</P>
<P>
   Pwtelephone is among a growing number of products coming onto
the market that are designed to make computers and the Web more
accessible to the handicapped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pwtelephone, which will sell for about $550, was introduced
in month. When a person with a Web page buys the device, anyone can
call in and listen to the contents of the page via a regular
telephone. Productivity Works is widely known among the blind
because it created Pwwebspeak, a browser that uses just type,
instead of the visual elements required by Netscape and Internet
Explorer, and therefore does not need a screen reader.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 customers use Pwwebspeak, according Mark Hakkinen,
cofounder and senior vice president of Productivity Works.
</P>
<P>
   The product's usefulness may not be limited to the handicapped.
Hakkinen said people who are on the road without a computer or
otherwise not near one _ what he called ``situationally disabled''
_ can also use it to have access to the Web. If a company hooks its
Web page up to Pwtelephone, an employee can call in and listen to
information posted there.
</P>
<P>
   Speech-recognition and voice technology are developing quickly,
with some successes occurring in various areas. But the current
version of this particular product has a big limitation: only one
person can call in at a time to each pwTelephone, because it
responds to each user's request.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the Web over the telephone, rather than using a
computer and having to manipulate a mouse, may also help others who
are disabled, said Neal Ewers, who is blind and does research and
product testing at the Trace Research and Development Center at the
University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with use of one hand may find the keyboard difficult,
but he can use a touchtone phone,'' said Ewers. ``It opens up the
web for that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Another product to aid visually impaired computer users is
scheduled for release by IBM (www.ibm.com) in January. The Home
Page Reader for Windows, which will cost $149, will read computer
screen text out loud. It will be sold with Netscape Communications'
Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these are examples of technology that provide better
access to internet and web pages,'' said Professor Gregg
Vanderheiden, director of Trace and a member of the World Wide Web
Consortium, a group of volunteer computer experts who are working
to make the Web more accessible. These products will allow ``more
people to interact with more types of Web pages than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Home Page Reader was developed in IBM's Tokyo Research
Laboratory with Chieko Asakawa, a blind researcher who worked on
the early development of the software. It has been available in
Japan for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Chong, director of technology for the National Federation
of the Blind, said he sees the product as an important step for the
blind because it is made by the computer giant IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for a major company to be using speech on a
commercially available application,'' Chong said. ``This is a step
in the right direction by a major company, which holds out a
promise for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The best way to think of this is a supplement for
Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Home Page Reader can read HTML tags and decipher tables and
columns, but like all top-of-the-line screen readers, it cannot
read a graphic unless there is a written description of that
graphic on the page.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some Web pages that will not be accessible
because they lack text, Chong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good the browser is, it won't help poorly
designed web pages,'' he said.

YOU MAY NOT FIND SOME WELL-KNOWN BRANDS EASILY _ OR AT ALL _ ON THE
WEB

<P>
   With online sales booming, millions of people are going to try
to see if they can cut down on trips to the mall this holiday
season and do some shopping over the Internet. A lot of them will
find that you can't always get what you want on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone whose shopping list includes, say, a Ralph Lauren
sweater, a Pioneer car radio, a Burton snowboard or even the latest
Beanie Baby from Ty Inc. will search high and low in cyberspace
without, in most cases, finding them. The reason? These
manufacturers prohibit retailers from selling their products on
line.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Web is brimming with retailers, and new stores
and shops are coming on line every day, leaving the impression that
the Internet is a vast, freewheeling bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many well-known brands cannot be found on line because
their manufacturers contend that the Internet flattens even the
most luxurious item to a garish, flickering image and then pits
retailers around the world in a grueling price war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think of our products as commodities that can be
managed by point, click and order,'' said Ed Sachs, executive vice
president for sales at Pioneer Electronics, which prohibits dealers
from selling its audio and video products on line.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's stance is still common in many industries. That is
especially so among makers of more expensive lines, which are
concerned about controlling the image of their brand and have
always tried to have a small number of local stores, whose loyalty
they are loath to upset.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers are resisting the Internet for a different
reason: they want to join it later, selling their goods themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Internet shopping remains a very slim slice of the
retailing pie. A study by the Direct Marketing Association predicts
that this year, $4.7 billion worth of goods and services will be
sold over the Internet _ slightly more than 5 percent of the $87
billion that will be sold by direct mail and telemarketing and a
tiny fraction of the $2.6 trillion in overall retail sales in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, of course, Internet selling is expected to claim
a much bigger share of the shopping dollar. Virtually nonexistent
four years ago, shopping on line is now the fastest growing form of
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Christmas sales are expected to be two and a half
times last year's, with hundreds of thousands of people buying on
line for the first time. Consumers have been lured by the
shop-at-home convenience, as well as by the ability to pick from a
huge selection of products, whatever the omissions. What is more,
early fears about credit card fraud are fading as millions of
people buy products on line with few reported problems.
</P>
<P>
   As online shopping begins to move into the mainstream,
manufacturers are coming under increasing pressure to allow their
products to be sold in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a spiral effect,'' said Maria Latour Kadison, an
analyst with Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting
firm. ``As more consumers come on the Internet, it drives retailers
to expand their offerings on line. And when the retailers offer
better selection and easier-to-use stores, it draws even more
consumers on line.''
</P>
<P>
   So while many manufacturers are ``afraid to hurt the existing
brick-and-mortar retail channels that have supported their
brands,'' she said, ``they will either change their minds or they
will lose out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already many brands that encourage online sales,
including Philips Electronics, Donna Karan and Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers have been keeping online stores from selling
their goods simply because they want to cut out the middleman and
sell their goods themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's flagship store in Herald Square in Manhattan, for
example, has rack upon rack of jeans and chinos from Levi Strauss.
But Macy's new Internet site Macys.com does not carry a single pair
of Levi's among its 250,000 items. Why? Because Levi's insists that
the only place to buy its products on the Internet is at
www.Levis.com
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to present our brand at its best, both in terms of
assortment and presentation,'' said Jay Thomas, Levi's director of
digital marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's, moreover, faces vigorous competition from the Gap, which
has been doing a brisk business at its Internet store. The Gap
(www.gap.com) does not face any retailer-manufacturer conflicts,
because it makes and sells its own products.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers, however, have been forced to restrict online
sales because of pressure from their existing dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we sold to a number of Internet sites, but we had to
stop,'' said Lee Carlson, president of Belinda Barton Furnishings
for Children, a maker of expensive sheets and towels in Cutchogue,
N.Y. ``Our stores were upset. Their main concern was that people
would go on line and find prices that were lower than what they
were selling for.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line shoppers are caught in the middle of these squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Frye, for example, is such a fan of Calvin Klein that he
has set up a Web site with an homage to the designer's ads. But
crawling the Internet, he has been able to find only a few Calvin
Klein perfume items at Macy's and some of the underwear line at a
small site called www.metromanusa.com.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Triefus, a senior vice president for Calvin Klein, said
the designer was worried that it would lose control of its brand
image if its goods were sold on the Internet. Moreover, the company
has not figured out how cyberspace fits into its existing
geographic distribution agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our licensees have agreements that cover certain
territories,'' Triefus said. ``The Internet, by definition, is
worldwide distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns about control show that the retail universe in
cyberspace, despite the booming online trade in books, compact
discs and computer equipment itself, is still at a fledgling stage.

FLEDGLING CHURCHES ARE RELIGIOUS NOMADS
</HEADLINE>

By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For most of the week, United Artist Fossil
Creek 11 is a temple where film-lovers can worship the art of
moviemaking in stadium seating, with popcorn, candy and a choice of
Hollywood's latest offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But starting about 8 a.m. each Sunday, the movie house in north
Fort Worth becomes a temple of a different kind.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the box office opens on moviedom's big day, pastor
Paul C. Gomez, his wife, Teresa, and about 10 volunteers spend at
least an hour replacing the traces of such films as ``I Still Know
What You Did Last Summer'' with the message of CrossRoads Church, a
new and growing Baptist congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to see God's hand in it all,'' Teresa Gomez said.
``It's so obvious when you're here in a movie theater and see it
transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   For many starting churches, transformation is part of the ritual
of Sunday-morning worship services. Without a place to call home _
and a desire to keep expenses down _ beginning congregations often
seek temporary shelters that range from hotel boardrooms and school
auditoriums to funeral homes and plastics factories.
</P>
<P>
   Building a church certainly requires heavenly inspiration,
pastors and congregants say. But before God is given his due by a
new congregation at the start of each week, there are also earthly
considerations. And that means that pastors and church volunteers
often spend the early Sunday morning hours moving furniture,
setting up sound equipment and turning lobbies into nurseries and
Sunday-school meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like birthing a baby,'' said Larry R. Taylor, pastor of
The River, a church that is getting its start at the same theater
as CrossRoads. ``There are labor pains involved. It's worth it, but
it's a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellowship Church in Grapevine is probably North Texas' most
visible example of a congregation for whom the hard work paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church has almost 6,000 members, it began in
February 1990 in an Irving office complex with about 150 members,
said senior pastor Ed Young.
</P>
<P>
   When the congregation outgrew the office, it spilled over into
the Irving Arts Center. Later, the congregation met at MacArthur
High School, where professional movers were employed to help
volunteers turn part of the school into a church, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the congregation trekked 15 miles to its new
150,000-square-foot home on Texas 121 next to Grapevine Mills mall.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fitting a growing congregation into various
arenas for worship services took a lot of work, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very labor intensive,'' he said. ``The great
thing about it was that early on, it gave our church a can-do
spirit, a real pioneer spirit,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of starting a church vary depending on the
circumstances, said Taylor, who is taking his second stab at
starting a congregation. The River, which began in August when
three couples started meeting in Taylor's home, moved its services
to the movie theater about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who recently returned to the area after traveling
through Texas and Louisiana as an evangelist, was pastor of a
fledgling Baptist church in Livingston in East Texas in the 1980s.
That church was affiliated with an older church that contributed
money and congregants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of resources, you usually have a little more
available to you in terms of people and finances,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Rev. Michael Beaugh has the financial and
emotional backing of the regional and national leadership of the
Presbyterian Church. At least he does for the next five years, as
he and a group of congregants build the membership of Southlake
Boulevard Presbyterian Church in Southlake, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new church has about 5 acres on Southlake Boulevard
waiting for construction, the 120 members have met since
mid-September at Johnson Elementary School in Southlake. The
congregation hopes to be chartered by next summer and into its own
building by the end of 1999, Beaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the elementary school has worked well for the church,
``There are a lot of things you have to figure out,'' Beaugh said.
``In fact, the whole thing, you have to figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Beaugh and church volunteers must coordinate
details such as how to get into the locked building and where to
set up props that range from the pulpit to changing tables for the
nursery rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For CrossRoads, the process of transforming a movie theater into
a church begins about 8 a.m. each Sunday when Paul Gomez and
volunteers arrive, dragging two trailers full of sound equipment
and children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater, volunteers hook up computer equipment and do
sound checks. Meanwhile, Sonya Pannell of Hurst and Jessica
Woodruff of North Richland Hills cover the movie theater carpets
with more child-friendly _ and cleaner _ rugs. They set up
child-size kitchens and unpack large plastic containers of blocks,
dolls and plastic telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The Pannells and Woodruffs are two of a handful of families,
members of First Baptist Colleyville, that have joined forces with
Gomez to start CrossRoads Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's neat to know you are in there on the ground floor
to see God's work growing,'' Pannell said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the new church is to reach out to young couples and
singles, said Gomez, a former associate pastor at Colleyville
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Sunday service, Gomez took center stage wearing
khakis, a black T-shirt and clunky black shoes. His presentation
used computer images flashed onto a movie screen and videos of a
prospective social service project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not out to cast away all tradition,'' Gomez said. ``We
do think there is room for a little more informal preaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Gomez said, the church aims to reach out to young
people of all ethnic backgrounds, including those who do not
regularly attend worship services. Meeting in a theater is one way
to reach an audience that may be turned off by a white steeple and
a pastor in a collar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create an environment where unchurched people
... will feel comfortable,'' Gomez said. ``This theater is where
they likely have been before. They know where the restrooms are and
how to escape.'' .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

 UNDATED: fledgling stage.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without access to the merchandise, online entrepreneurs cannot
hope to become the next Amazon.com. The best example is in consumer
electronics, where none of the small online merchants have anything
close to a complete selection.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Drew, the chief executive of 800.com, a start-up company
with an Internet consumer electronics store, said he has been able
to buy the basic lines of television and audio equipment that are
sold in such mass market retailers as Kmart, but not the sort of
sophisticated models that many Internet users want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get the low-end stuff, but the high-end stuff we can't
even get close to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many makers of consumer appliances, like Maytag, have
not been willing to let their dealers sell on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appliances are a huge business which has become increasingly
concentrated through the major retail chains: Sears, Circuit City,
etc,'' said Trevor Traina of Compare.Net, an electronic shopping
guide. ``Their cozy relationships with retailers are keeping them
from doing things that will build their business.''
</P>
<P>
   James G. Powell, a spokesman for Maytag, said local dealers
provided better service and support for its products than Internet
sellers who might be halfway across the country from the buyer.
``We want to protect our premium brand reputation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, designers, electronics companies and others have long
sought to preserve their reputations and prices by limiting the
number of stores they sell through. And whole industries have
evolved to help consumers get around those restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In fashion, there are many stores selling close-out items and
overstocks at discount prices. There are discount electronics
stores that sell goods purchased in the gray market _ that is,
through unauthorized distribution channels _ rather than directly
from the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   All these businesses have their counterparts on the Internet.
Bluefly.Com sells off-price clothing, including some items from
designers like Ralph Lauren who will not directly supply Internet
stores with their goods.
</P>
<P>
   And there has also been a rise of gray market dealers of other
goods, even Beanie Babies, those small stuffed animals whose
ever-so-cute variations have made them a rage among collectors.
There is a vast secondary market for older Beanie Babies among the
Internet auctions. But Ty refuses to sell directly to any company
that wants to offer new Beanies on line. (A spokesman for Ty did
not return several calls for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to get Beanie Babies, but we get them,'' said
Toby Lenk, the chief executive of Etoys, an online store
(etoys.com) that is usually able to buy directly from the big toy
makers. ``But since we go through a middleman, we charge $8.99 or
$9.99 for a model that people who get the product directly sell for
$5.99.''
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of Beanie Babies is an exception, and most
manufacturers fear that the gray market, and Internet sales in
general, will lower, rather than raise, the prices of their goods.
They argue that this will ultimately hurt them and their customers
by squeezing out local stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if you bought a snowboard on the Internet it might be a
few bucks cheaper, but it wouldn't help the sport,'' said Jake
Burton, the founder and chairman of Burton Snowboards in
Burlington, Vt., which will not let its products be sold on line.
``The specialty retailer has played a huge role in getting this
sport off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a number of online stores have been able to persuade
manufacturers to sell to them by promising not to discount their
products or otherwise cheapen their image.
</P>
<P>
   Fragrance Counter, an online cosmetics store has won over some
of the most reluctant and image-conscious manufacturers by seeking
to create an upscale boutique that is the ``57th Street and Madison
Avenue of cyberspace,'' said Eli Katz, the chief operating officer
of the company (www.fragrancecounter.com). ``We sell everything at
suggested retail price, and we romance and describe every product.
</P>
<P>
   But perfume makers were not convinced at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started calling on vendors, they thought that
selling fragrances on a computer was bizarre,'' Katz said. ``I
couldn't get the time of day from anyone. Now the perception has
changed as people see how the Internet adds incremental sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Fragrance Counter now carries nearly every major perfume line
except for some very expensive brands like Annick Goutal.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet holdouts, like Oakley, the maker of futuristic
sun glasses, are also beginning to dip their toes in the online
waters. But Oakley has spurned the Web sites of big dealers like
Sunglass Hut (sunglass.com), granting online rights only to
Eyevault (www.eyevault.com), a California start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always focused on selective distribution,'' said Link
Newcomb, Oakley's chief executive. I don't think that online retail
should be any different.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For most of the week, United Artist Fossil
Creek 11 is a temple where film-lovers can worship the art of
moviemaking in stadium seating, with popcorn, candy and a choice of
Hollywood's latest offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But starting about 8 a.m. each Sunday, the movie house in north
Fort Worth becomes a temple of a different kind.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the box office opens on moviedom's big day, pastor
Paul C. Gomez, his wife, Teresa, and about 10 volunteers spend at
least an hour replacing the traces of such films as ``I Still Know
What You Did Last Summer'' with the message of CrossRoads Church, a
new and growing Baptist congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to see God's hand in it all,'' Teresa Gomez said.
``It's so obvious when you're here in a movie theater and see it
transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   For many starting churches, transformation is part of the ritual
of Sunday-morning worship services. Without a place to call home _
and a desire to keep expenses down _ beginning congregations often
seek temporary shelters that range from hotel boardrooms and school
auditoriums to funeral homes and plastics factories.
</P>
<P>
   Building a church certainly requires heavenly inspiration,
pastors and congregants say. But before God is given his due by a
new congregation at the start of each week, there are also earthly
considerations. And that means that pastors and church volunteers
often spend the early Sunday morning hours moving furniture,
setting up sound equipment and turning lobbies into nurseries and
Sunday-school meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like birthing a baby,'' said Larry R. Taylor, pastor of
The River, a church that is getting its start at the same theater
as CrossRoads. ``There are labor pains involved. It's worth it, but
it's a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellowship Church in Grapevine is probably North Texas' most
visible example of a congregation for whom the hard work paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church has almost 6,000 members, it began in
February 1990 in an Irving office complex with about 150 members,
said senior pastor Ed Young.
</P>
<P>
   When the congregation outgrew the office, it spilled over into
the Irving Arts Center. Later, the congregation met at MacArthur
High School, where professional movers were employed to help
volunteers turn part of the school into a church, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the congregation trekked 15 miles to its new
150,000-square-foot home on Texas 121 next to Grapevine Mills mall.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fitting a growing congregation into various
arenas for worship services took a lot of work, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very labor intensive,'' he said. ``The great
thing about it was that early on, it gave our church a can-do
spirit, a real pioneer spirit,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of starting a church vary depending on the
circumstances, said Taylor, who is taking his second stab at
starting a congregation. The River, which began in August when
three couples started meeting in Taylor's home, moved its services
to the movie theater about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who recently returned to the area after traveling
through Texas and Louisiana as an evangelist, was pastor of a
fledgling Baptist church in Livingston in East Texas in the 1980s.
That church was affiliated with an older church that contributed
money and congregants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of resources, you usually have a little more
available to you in terms of people and finances,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Rev. Michael Beaugh has the financial and
emotional backing of the regional and national leadership of the
Presbyterian Church. At least he does for the next five years, as
he and a group of congregants build the membership of Southlake
Boulevard Presbyterian Church in Southlake, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new church has about 5 acres on Southlake Boulevard
waiting for construction, the 120 members have met since
mid-September at Johnson Elementary School in Southlake. The
congregation hopes to be chartered by next summer and into its own
building by the end of 1999, Beaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the elementary school has worked well for the church,
``There are a lot of things you have to figure out,'' Beaugh said.
``In fact, the whole thing, you have to figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Beaugh and church volunteers must coordinate
details such as how to get into the locked building and where to
set up props that range from the pulpit to changing tables for the
nursery rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For CrossRoads, the process of transforming a movie theater into
a church begins about 8 a.m. each Sunday when Paul Gomez and
volunteers arrive, dragging two trailers full of sound equipment
and children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater, volunteers hook up computer equipment and do
sound checks. Meanwhile, Sonya Pannell of Hurst and Jessica
Woodruff of North Richland Hills cover the movie theater carpets
with more child-friendly _ and cleaner _ rugs. They set up
child-size kitchens and unpack large plastic containers of blocks,
dolls and plastic telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The Pannells and Woodruffs are two of a handful of families,
members of First Baptist Colleyville, that have joined forces with
Gomez to start CrossRoads Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's neat to know you are in there on the ground floor
to see God's work growing,'' Pannell said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the new church is to reach out to young couples and
singles, said Gomez, a former associate pastor at Colleyville
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Sunday service, Gomez took center stage wearing
khakis, a black T-shirt and clunky black shoes. His presentation
used computer images flashed onto a movie screen and videos of a
prospective social service project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not out to cast away all tradition,'' Gomez said. ``We
do think there is room for a little more informal preaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Gomez said, the church aims to reach out to young
people of all ethnic backgrounds, including those who do not
regularly attend worship services. Meeting in a theater is one way
to reach an audience that may be turned off by a white steeple and
a pastor in a collar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create an environment where unchurched people
... will feel comfortable,'' Gomez said. ``This theater is where
they likely have been before. They know where the restrooms are and
how to escape.'' .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

OAKLAND NEEDS RICKEY HENDERSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Rickey Henderson could be an Athletic again,
even if it is only as a slab of bronze in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way, though. Neither possibility is very
likely, and given the latest bum's rush he has been given, neither
should be. After all, if you're out after three strikes, what ought
to happen after four?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the team's refusal to offer him arbitration for 1999
sort of fits the profile for this team as it enters the new
millennium _ if it looks familiar, it looks better somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Now this won't be a salute to Henderson's long and illustrious
career, of which we know plenty already. And this won't be another
cautionary tale about what happened to Mark McGwire, whose 1996
trade to the Hall of Fame via St. Louis is still indefensible, even
though some CPA with more courage than sense will occasionally try.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, this is just to ask the musical question, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Henderson's numbers in 1998 (.236 batting, .376
on-base, and other than his 66 steals, a bunch of ordinary
ordinals) do not cry out in his defense with their usual verve. He
often looked, frankly, like a guy who is going to turn 40 on
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   And granted, it isn't as though he brought thousands of people
into the ballpark on the strength of his name alone, because
nothing could have overcome the foul atmosphere offered up by a
flinty ownership that takes its cut first. The best you can say for
him, in fact, is that he didn't chase thousands more away.
</P>
<P>
   And granted again, sentiment is usually wasted on the modern
athlete. If your time has come, it's come, and those who try to get
that one last squeeze out of the toothpaste tube usually end up
with a sore arm and gingivitis.
</P>
<P>
   But even though there is nothing that could logically return him
to Oakland now, the question deserves to be asked by someone _ what
harm would it have done bringing him back?
</P>
<P>
   For one, as near as anyone knows, there is no glorious leadoff
hitter waiting in the wings. The A's have some interesting young
talent, but interesting is not the same as foolproof, or even
necessarily good. Ben Grieve, the Rookie of the Year, isn't really
any better positioned as a left fielder than he was in right, Matt
Stairs is a designated hitter pure and simple, and there is nobody
else who makes you whistle and go, ``Here's the offensive spark
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   For two, most observers found Henderson to be a veritable
delight in the clubhouse, openly helpful to the younger players,
agreeable to the manager and coaches, and downright charming to
those usually ungrateful swine in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   And for three, and this is the clincher, what is the gain in
telling a Hall of Famer to take a hike for the fourth time? At this
point in their development, with a fan base small enough to fit
around a hermit's holiday table and well-earned cynicism greeting
their every decision, just knowing that he might not want to be
remembered in Cooperstown as an Athletic should sober general
manager Billy Beane and what else is left of the front office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the only unambiguous bit of good news the A's have
brought us since the end of the season was Grieve's Rookie of the
Year Award. Even retaining Kenny Rogers had a slightly bittersweet
taste to it, since nobody believes he will survive until the next
in-season trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of it has surrounded the asking price for a sale of the
team, or a place to move the team, or settling lawsuits with the
city. Every time a free agent signs somewhere, A's fans yawn,
because they knew their team wasn't involved. Every time a trade is
announced, A's fans remember with nostalgia the days when Oakland
made trades itself. Baseball isn't happening in Oakland these days.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Rickey Henderson's departure, for either New York or
Seattle if the speculation is true, should tug at you a bit more
than it already has. Not because there will be such a hue and cry
when he breaks his next record, but because it would have been an
affirmative decision to keep him at a time when the A's need all
the affirmations they can get.

AN OLD ROW HOUSE BASKS IN ITS SECOND YOUTH
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A sidebar listing decorating supply stores follows story.) 
(bl)  
By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Working with a decorator was kind of like, `Whoa,'''
said Amanda Sacks, who lives in a newly decorated four-story
Victorian town house in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ``Because I'd never
actually worked with a decorator before.'' Ms. Sacks, age 9, said
she thought the experience was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might choose Chris again,'' she said, referring to future
homes. ``If he's still decorating.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, when Karen Sacks; her husband, Bradley; their
16-year-old daughter, Jilian, and their 9-year-old twins, Amanda
and Blaire, hired Christopher Coleman, a New York decorator, they
made it clear that they were all clients _ and available for
consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Sacks herself was no remodeling pushover. She is a
magazine consultant and an ex-editor in chief of a design magazine,
American Homestyle &AMP; Gardening. In short order, Ms. Sacks learned
things she'd never told her readers _ like, what you think you can
do in three months will take a neat year.
</P>
<P>
   She had never hired a decorator. Coleman had never designed a
house.
</P>
<P>
   The job: one of those gorgeous late-19th-century piles that
would have made a great funeral home. There was beautiful wood
paneling _ wall to wall. Rooms were small parlors. A deep row house
with windows only at the front and back, it had ceremonial darkness
inhabiting its center hall, where a large stairway rose up through
the house like organ music swelling.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sacks family, who had outgrown a house half the size,
needed the space. And the top floor had matching bedrooms _ perfect
for twins. Ms. Sacks had admired a modern room Coleman had recently
done for a traditional Park Avenue show house. She called him the
month they moved in _ with no furnishings in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to have fun with the new house,'' Ms. Sacks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks, a trial lawyer, weighed in on opening remarks. ``Nothing
in the house was to be looked at and not used,'' he recalled
telling the decorator.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's design dead-lifted the heavy interior in two muscular
strokes: bright colors and big shapes. The palette and scale made
the house stylish and playful _ both adult- and child-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Above the paneling, Coleman installed a background of wallpapers
in light shades of yellow and blue with soft paintlike patterns.
They pulled the house together as a design, giving every recess a
view _ a dappled landscape of wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nicely economical decision. ``It's putting up a coat of
adhesive and slapping on wallpaper as opposed to doing
faux-painting,'' Coleman said. ``You're talking about a morning of
work for a room instead of days _ about $1,000 instead of $3,000 to
$5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Furnishings fill the foreground with a boisterous freedom of
shape and scale.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, the standard set is there, but it has been
radically rethought. A long, kidney-shaped sofa, designed by
Coleman, wraps snugly into a wide bay window. Two broad club
chairs, upholstered in a zigzag fabric that looks like lightning in
a comic strip, hold the other end. A French 1950s wrought-iron and
glass coffee table could be a couturier's chandelier resting on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   In place of a living room mantelpiece _ the ground floor's
fireplace is in the center hall _ Coleman designed a tall console
for books and magazines that houses an ottoman beneath. A gong-size
bronze mirror hangs above.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of big furniture in small rooms here,'' Coleman
said. ``The scale of this stuff says it's contemporary before you
even get to the fabrics and color.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the master bedroom, the decorator reversed the
scheme and removed the color to make the parents' room a quiet and
peaceful respite from the family life of the house. Modulating
grays give it a whisper instead of a shout: a dove-toned smudged
checkerboard wallpaper, a silver-papered ceiling, a cut-velvet
damask carpet and a custom-made armoire paneled in silver leaf and
clouded-pearl washes of stain. The surfaces look like water gliding
over stones.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman worked individually with each daughter, helping her
establish important territory: my room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the largest room,'' Jilian Sacks said, ``so I decided
I wanted it to be purely a bedroom. I told Chris I wanted a
comfortable room I could lounge in.'' She was swiveling in a low,
two-person tufted 1940s armchair that Coleman had found at a thrift
store and reupholstered in a harlequinade of colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue is my favorite color,'' Ms. Sacks said, ``and I told
Chris that. Then I couldn't decide between red and yellow. So we
went for all of them.'' The palette repeats on a cartoon camelback
headboard and polka-dot curtains.
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor, the twins rule _ separate but equal and by no
means a matched set.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very specific,'' Coleman said. ``One likes blue, and
one likes green. They each had to have the same chair, in their own
colors.'' He designed plastic-laminate desks and display shelves
for each, from sketches she approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted places to put my books and dolls instead of just
putting them on the floor,'' Blaire said, sitting in her blue
bedroom. ``He was good with ideas. I couldn't have really done it
myself _ it's too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda designed her tented bed from a model Coleman showed her
in a catalog; she also chose the Laura Ashley fabric. The wallpaper
was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't actually know there were going to be stars and
moons,'' she said of the stenciled cosmos. ``When it's dark, I feel
like I'm up in the sky.'' Ms. Sacks showed the patience of a good
client. ``You get used to seeing stars all over your room,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A guest bedroom, also on the top floor, is a short resume of
Coleman's resourcefulness. The rug is inexpensive commercial
carpeting that he had cut in bands of color, backed and glued as a
piece, then laid down. On the walls is a rough Mexican tree bark
paper, bought in sheets at an art-supply store.
</P>
<P>
   Though major renovations _ and the expenses connected with them
_ were already history when the Sackses bought the house, budget
was still a nervous subject for clients who had never worked with a
decorator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the scariest part,'' Sacks said. ``Spending all this
money at one time, because we were doing everything start to
finish.'' Coleman calculated the cost of the fully furnished four
floors, which included items specified by the clients, like a
security system and other home electronics, at $250,000 _ within 20
percent of the proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Sackses love their decorated house, each for his or her own
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each room really has a personality to it,'' Jilian Sacks said.
``It's not just things thrown here or there.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Sacks gave the collaboration high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with a decorator is sort of working by yourself,
because you have all these choices,'' she said. ``But really he's
there just to help you and to choose what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the profession's strong suit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Specs
</P>
<P>
   Like any decorator, Christopher Coleman has his tactics: how to
spend less, when to spend more, and where to find it:
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTING is highly visible and worth some expense, he said. The
Sacks house has commissioned designs by Stephen McKay (216 W. 18th
St.; 212-255-2110) and pieces like an Alvar pendant (Hinson &AMP; Co.;
979 Third Ave., near 59th Street; 688-7754, to the trade).
</P>
<P>
   ART WORK can be a big expense. Coleman goes to shows at schools,
including the Fashion Institute of Technology (next one, May 11
through 25, 1999) and Parsons School of Design (spring schedule
available from 212-229-8987).
</P>
<P>
   ART-SUPPLY STORES are good bets for unusual papers, like the
Mexican bark used in the Sackses' guest room, from New York Central
Art Supply (62 Third Ave., at 11th Street; 473-7705).
</P>
<P>
   SAMPLE SALES save money and delivery time: be on mailing lists.
Coleman got a lime-green Christine Van Der Hurd rug at the
Cappellini Modern Age sale (next one is Jan. 9-20, 1999; 102
Wooster St., near Spring Street; 343-9070).
</P>
<P>
   CARPETING can be cut into rugs, then trimmed, like the Sackses'
leather-edge living-room rug, from Misha Carpet (18 E. 53rd St.;
688-5912, to the trade). Coleman uses remnants the same way, from
ABC Carpet and Home (881 Broadway, near 19th Street; 473-3000).

REMEMBER THE REASON FOR THE TREE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in elementary school, my family had a silver
Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   I loved that tree. It was about 5 feet tall, and no matter where
I stood, I could see right through it because the branches were
sparse and so far apart. I don't know what the tree was made of,
but I think it might have been aluminum, because after Christmas
we'd stick a couple of the sparkly limbs on top of the television
to improve the reception.
</P>
<P>
   My friends all had live trees that dwarfed the furniture in
their living rooms. Their humongous trees shed needles all over the
floor. Our tree never shed unless you grabbed a strand of that
silver stuff and tugged real hard, which was dangerous, because the
tree was so lightweight that it would fall over if you sneezed.
</P>
<P>
   We decorated our tree with red and green ornaments and 12 feet
of some more silver stuff that looked like a showgirl's feather
boa. It was awesome. Dad topped it with a silver star studded with
plastic gems. Then we plugged in the rotating spotlight that cast
alternating beams of red, blue, yellow and green on the artificial
tree.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, that sounds like an awfully ugly tree, doesn't
it? But I clearly remember lying on the floor next to that tree
every night, imagining all of the wonderful things that Santa was
going to bring me.
</P>
<P>
   Waking up on Christmas morning and finding those colorful
presents snuggled beneath that tree gave me a feeling that words
cannot describe. Sometimes Santa even used the same wrapping paper
that my mother used on the gifts for grandma. Now, people say that
this holiday is ``too commercial'' and that those of us who
celebrate Christmas have forgotten the reason for the season.
</P>
<P>
   I agree with the over-commercialization aspect of that
criticism, but I don't believe that most of us have forgotten the
Christ in Christmas. However, it is easy to become distracted by
all of the secular holiday traditions. I'm not sure how to fix
that. It is an issue to be considered and addressed in each
household.
</P>
<P>
   What I am certain of is that with the proper perspective and
attitude, Christmas can still be a time of tremendous joy, sharing
and love.
</P>
<P>
   So, as we endure the hustle and bustle of the next few weeks,
let's remember the real reason for the celebration and do what I
did years ago as I watched that pathetic little tree change colors.
</P>
<P>
   Just smile, smile, smile.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For most of the week, United Artist Fossil
Creek 11 is a temple where film-lovers can worship the art of
moviemaking in stadium seating, with popcorn, candy and a choice of
Hollywood's latest offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But starting about 8 a.m. each Sunday, the movie house in north
Fort Worth becomes a temple of a different kind.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the box office opens on moviedom's big day, pastor
Paul C. Gomez, his wife, Teresa, and about 10 volunteers spend at
least an hour replacing the traces of such films as ``I Still Know
What You Did Last Summer'' with the message of CrossRoads Church, a
new and growing Baptist congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to see God's hand in it all,'' Teresa Gomez said.
``It's so obvious when you're here in a movie theater and see it
transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   For many starting churches, transformation is part of the ritual
of Sunday-morning worship services. Without a place to call home _
and a desire to keep expenses down _ beginning congregations often
seek temporary shelters that range from hotel boardrooms and school
auditoriums to funeral homes and plastics factories.
</P>
<P>
   Building a church certainly requires heavenly inspiration,
pastors and congregants say. But before God is given his due by a
new congregation at the start of each week, there are also earthly
considerations. And that means that pastors and church volunteers
often spend the early Sunday morning hours moving furniture,
setting up sound equipment and turning lobbies into nurseries and
Sunday-school meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like birthing a baby,'' said Larry R. Taylor, pastor of
The River, a church that is getting its start at the same theater
as CrossRoads. ``There are labor pains involved. It's worth it, but
it's a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellowship Church in Grapevine is probably North Texas' most
visible example of a congregation for whom the hard work paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church has almost 6,000 members, it began in
February 1990 in an Irving office complex with about 150 members,
said senior pastor Ed Young.
</P>
<P>
   When the congregation outgrew the office, it spilled over into
the Irving Arts Center. Later, the congregation met at MacArthur
High School, where professional movers were employed to help
volunteers turn part of the school into a church, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the congregation trekked 15 miles to its new
150,000-square-foot home on Texas 121 next to Grapevine Mills mall.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fitting a growing congregation into various
arenas for worship services took a lot of work, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very labor intensive,'' he said. ``The great
thing about it was that early on, it gave our church a can-do
spirit, a real pioneer spirit,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of starting a church vary depending on the
circumstances, said Taylor, who is taking his second stab at
starting a congregation. The River, which began in August when
three couples started meeting in Taylor's home, moved its services
to the movie theater about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who recently returned to the area after traveling
through Texas and Louisiana as an evangelist, was pastor of a
fledgling Baptist church in Livingston in East Texas in the 1980s.
That church was affiliated with an older church that contributed
money and congregants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of resources, you usually have a little more
available to you in terms of people and finances,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Rev. Michael Beaugh has the financial and
emotional backing of the regional and national leadership of the
Presbyterian Church. At least he does for the next five years, as
he and a group of congregants build the membership of Southlake
Boulevard Presbyterian Church in Southlake, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new church has about 5 acres on Southlake Boulevard
waiting for construction, the 120 members have met since
mid-September at Johnson Elementary School in Southlake. The
congregation hopes to be chartered by next summer and into its own
building by the end of 1999, Beaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the elementary school has worked well for the church,
``There are a lot of things you have to figure out,'' Beaugh said.
``In fact, the whole thing, you have to figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Beaugh and church volunteers must coordinate
details such as how to get into the locked building and where to
set up props that range from the pulpit to changing tables for the
nursery rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For CrossRoads, the process of transforming a movie theater into
a church begins about 8 a.m. each Sunday when Paul Gomez and
volunteers arrive, dragging two trailers full of sound equipment
and children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater, volunteers hook up computer equipment and do
sound checks. Meanwhile, Sonya Pannell of Hurst and Jessica
Woodruff of North Richland Hills cover the movie theater carpets
with more child-friendly _ and cleaner _ rugs. They set up
child-size kitchens and unpack large plastic containers of blocks,
dolls and plastic telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The Pannells and Woodruffs are two of a handful of families,
members of First Baptist Colleyville, that have joined forces with
Gomez to start CrossRoads Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's neat to know you are in there on the ground floor
to see God's work growing,'' Pannell said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the new church is to reach out to young couples and
singles, said Gomez, a former associate pastor at Colleyville
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Sunday service, Gomez took center stage wearing
khakis, a black T-shirt and clunky black shoes. His presentation
used computer images flashed onto a movie screen and videos of a
prospective social service project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not out to cast away all tradition,'' Gomez said. ``We
do think there is room for a little more informal preaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Gomez said, the church aims to reach out to young
people of all ethnic backgrounds, including those who do not
regularly attend worship services. Meeting in a theater is one way
to reach an audience that may be turned off by a white steeple and
a pastor in a collar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create an environment where unchurched people
... will feel comfortable,'' Gomez said. ``This theater is where
they likely have been before. They know where the restrooms are and
how to escape.'' .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS SEEK GOOD SAMARITAN LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The bathroom rape and murder of a
7-year-old girl, a crime seen in progress but not reported by a
University of California student, has prompted three lawmakers to
introduce ``good Samaritan'' laws requiring people to report
assaults they may witness.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage surrounding student David Cash's failure to save
Sherrice Iverson when he happened on the assault and his decision
not to tell the police about the May 25, 1997, killing prompted
protests at the Berkeley campus and calls for the expulsion of
Cash.
</P>
<P>
   But neither state law nor campus rules allow punishment for
refusing to report a crime. Cash, meanwhile, continues to attend
Berkeley while his former friend, Jeremy Strohmeyer, serves a life
sentence for the girl's death.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the opening of the state Legislature's 1999-2000
session on Monday, three bills were introduced that would impose
various criminal penalties for failure to report crime,
particularly if the victim is a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who have children know the worst fear is that
something terrible could happen to them and that it could have been
prevented if someone had intervened,'' said Assemblyman Tom
Torlakson, a Democrat from Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bills would allow authorities to retroactively
prosecute Cash and subsequently kick him out of school. The
university has said it can expel students convicted of crimes, but
it has no authority to kick out students for failing to report a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., recently introduced a measure in
the Senate that would penalize states for not enacting so-called
good Samaritan laws. Boxer's bill would make the states ineligible
for federal child-abuse prevention funds if they failed to enact
such laws.
</P>
<P>
   California law already requires teachers, health care workers,
the clergy and day care providers to report suspected child abuse.
Doctors must report certain gunshot wounds to the police. And
hunters who witness the wounding or killing of another hunter or
domestic animal must report the incident to the Department of Fish
and Game _ or face a misdemeanor charge.
</P>
<P>
   But the three bills introduced Monday would significantly
broaden that area of the law to require the same kind of morality
from all California residents. Several states, including
Massachusetts, Ohio, Washington and Rhode Island, already have good
Samaritan laws that contain various degrees of punishment.

GO CHEAP OR BUY THE BEST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping for a personal computer can be more confusing than
shopping for a car, as was pointed out in this space last week. But
it is significantly cheaper, unless one gets a really big computer
or a really lousy car.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping is easier for people who already own a computer. For
one thing, they already know something about computers. For
another, they can often use the Internet to gather information and
do comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, according to market researchers, the majority of
computer shoppers will be first-time PC buyers. Many of these
novices tell researchers that they have been enticed into computer
stores because of a desire to get connected to the Internet. Many
of them do not understand computer terms like megabytes and
megahertz, other than that ``mega'' means big and ``bytes'' and
``hertz'' sound painful.
</P>
<P>
   For them, shopping is also a big pain. It does not have to be
so.
</P>
<P>
   Basically any new PC sold today has all the capability needed to
connect to the Internet, send and receive electronic mail, browse
Web sites and download software, and perform standard productivity
tasks like word processing or scheduling. Such systems cost as
little as $500 and are the closest things yet in the computer
industry to being disposable.
</P>
<P>
   Given the rate at which computer prices are falling, and given
the trend among some companies to subsidize the cost of electronic
devices like cell phones and cable set-top boxes in return for the
customer agreeing to a long-term service contract, one can expect
to see ``free'' or very cheap Internet-connected PCs being offered
to consumers in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   But that day has not yet arrived, alas, so take your wallet when
you go shopping for a PC. According to market researchers, the
average home computer shopper has a budget of $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Although today's sub-$500 computers can do basic tasks, they
typically cannot do all the things that most consumers might want
them to do, like play the newest games and process the latest audio
and video applications. So, we recommended last week that people
consider buying a more robust (i.e. expensive) computer, one that
has enough power to do everything today, and that can be upgraded
for an even longer useful life.
</P>
<P>
   That caused some readers to fly to their keyboards, arguing by
e-mail that upgrading a PC these days is often not worth the
expense or effort.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point, at least when it comes to inexpensive PC's.
The El Cheapo computers typically use pipsqueak processors that
will probably be too feeble to handle new software in two or three
years. While it may be possible to rejuvenate the computer with a
few strategic upgrades, it will probably make more economic sense
simply to replace it with a new one when the time comes. After all,
PC's that are more powerful and less expensive are being introduced
every few months.
</P>
<P>
   But for the kind of computer that offers good performance for
the best educational software, games and Internet applications that
a consumer might want to use today, as well as a fighting chance at
being useful in 2001, a brawnier PC is needed. Our basic
specifications were for a minimum of an Intel Pentium II 350 or AMD
K6-2 300 chip, a 6-gigabyte or bigger hard disk, at least 64
megabytes of system memory, decent video and audio cards, a v.90
modem, and so on. With a 17-inch monitor, such machines cost $1,200
and up.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq _ three titans of the
corporate world who used to ignore the home PC market _ are now
considered among the leaders in this category.
</P>
<P>
   While $1,500 is typical consumer budget, those who want the
ultimate home PC system, with the best components and features
across the board, can easily spend $3,000. But bargains abound,
even among the fastest PC's.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, for example, sells its Dimension XPS R450 computer, winner
of PC Computing magazines MVP award for desktop computers, for
$1,859 to $2,899 depending on options. The base price includes a
big monitor, a DVD drive, and just about every advanced feature a
PC user might desire. PC Magazine gave its latest Editors Choice
award for home computers to the Gateway G6-450 desktop computer, a
$1,998 model that is similarly loaded and includes a big monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users wrote in as usual to express their outrage that
last weeks column basically ignored the Macintosh. Since its
introduction last summer, the Apple iMac has been the single most
popular PC sold in computer stores each month. Why? It is not
because the iMac is better than any other Macintoshes. In my view,
it has some drawbacks. But at $1,299 _ or, more realistically,
$1,500 with the extra components needed to make it truly useful _
the iMac is hundreds of dollars less expensive than other Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also has been successful in persuading consumers that the
iMac is easier to use than Windows-based computers. In survey after
survey, fear of technological complexity is a major deterrent for
people thinking about buying a first PC. Macs are indeed easier.
Even so, I would recommend one of the (more expensive) desktop G3
Macs over the iMac for the same upgradeability reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, incidentally, has just released Mac OS 8.5.1, a bug-fix
for its relatively new 8.5 operating system. The 3-megabyte
download is available from Apples web site, at
 &UR; www.info.apple.com/support &LR; . The upgrade will be available on
CD-ROM in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to Windows machines, another issue is not just what
to buy, but where to buy it. Some people prefer to shop in a
computer or consumer electronics store. Others find the convenience
of shopping on line to be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the shopper does not already have a PC, it is hard
to go on line. In that case, many of the major direct sellers of
computers companies like Dell, Gateway and Micron offer impressive
help by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can shop on line and buy directly from the PC
maker, there are advantages. Prices are generally lower, and
knowledgeable sales help is abundant. The customer can custom-order
a PC with a wide variety of options. The direct-sales companies
pioneered the idea of on-site service, where technicians come to
your home or office to fix any problems in the first year. On-line
shopping is also a boon for busy people, because the Web sites stay
open around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disadvantages to online shopping. Foremost
among them is that online shoppers cannot see or touch the
computers before they buy. (Gateway has opened about 100 showrooms
to fix this problem.) The customer can choose any kind of a
computer, as long as it is made by the one company. Then it often
takes a week or more to get the computer. The customer has to pay a
considerable shipping charge, which often offsets any gain from a
lack of sales tax, and if something goes wrong with the computer,
returns are a hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the computer stores often carry several different
brands of computers, which makes comparison shopping easier. In
theory, the potential buyer can touch the computers and test their
look and feel. Gratification is usually instant, and many stores
have service and repair departments. Some stores offer classes.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, getting good help in a computer store is
notoriously difficult.
</P>
<P>
   After wandering the aisles unmolested by sales help for nearly
20 minutes last week, I finally located one very knowledgeable
sales assistant at the local CompUSA store and ambushed him while
he was stocking the shelves. The guy knew his stuff, but it quickly
became apparent that in the balance of things, his technical skills
were as impressive as his social skills were alarming. Mumbling,
refusing to make eye contact and in obvious pain at dealing with
customers, he answered each question as if there were electrode
shocks attached to his feet and I held the controls.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, my contacts on the telephone at Dell and Gateway
sounded like James Bond.

GREAT PIANISTS COLLECTION IS HUGE AND FULL OF HOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 20th century has been the best of times and the worst of
times for the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Philips Classics is celebrating the place of the piano in the
century with the most ambitious commercial recording release of all
time, the ``Great Pianists of the 20th Century,'' a collection of
200 discs by such familiar artists as Van Cliburn and Vladimir
Horowitz. The first discs began appearing in stores in August; they
will be released through August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The set looks back on a century in which the piano's prestige
has fluctuated. In 1900, the piano was the dominant force in
music-making, with a huge, wonderful repertoire, a large group of
skilled practitioners, and the prevalent notion that no European or
American home was complete without one.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, electronic equipment had replaced the piano as the
center of home life, and ``serious'' composers went out of their
way to avoid any traditional use of the instrument. Although the
piano was still the most popular concerto instrument on orchestral
concerts, not one new piano concerto had entered the standard
repertoire since mid-century.
</P>
<P>
   But as of 1998, the piano is on the way up again. The piano solo
recital, declared dead in 1975, is back. More good pianists are
alive today than ever before. Composers are rediscovering the
special qualities of the instrument. And, yes, it's still the
favorite concerto feature at orchestral concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, whatever one might say for the fine qualities of other
instruments, you won't find a 200-disc set devoted to great
violinists of the 20th century, or great saxophonists of the 20th
century, or great anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes 70 pianists, from Geza Anda to Krystian
Zimerman, each represented by at least one two-disc set, except for
two ``teams'' included in one volume each. Several _ the likes of
Rubinstein, Richter, Gilels _ are represented in more than one
two-disc volume, bringing the total to 100 separate volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you don't have to buy all of it. Each two-disc
volume is available for $23.99 _ or you can pay $2,399 for the
whole set, if you're that serious about it.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a few reasons you might not want to be that
serious about it. Before you start collecting, make sure your
favorite pianist is on the list. All of the obvious greats are
there, of course _ Cliburn, Paderewski, Horowitz, Gieseking,
Hofmann _ but there are some disturbing omissions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Fort Worth favorite and internationally renowned
Mozart, Schubert and Bartok expert Lili Kraus is not included. Nor
is Tatiana Nikolaieva, the Russian muse who, through her
performances of keyboard music of J.S. Bach, inspired
Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues, and whose sublime performance
of those is on record. Or Kurt Masur's favorite pianist, Cecile
Ousset. Or John Browning, who inspired Barber's Piano Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   How much record company politics went into making the list? If
Andre Previn, with his high-profile name, is on the list, why not
real pianists such as Emanuel Ax, Abbey Simon, Philippe Entrement?
</P>
<P>
   If Mitsuko Uchida, why not Mischa Dichter, Peter Serkin or Ruth
Laredo? One could almost build a major collection out of recordings
by pianists not included in Philips' 70.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are plenty of names on the list included solely
because they really were great pianists who, fortunately, were
captured on record. That the set exists at all is a testimony to
the recording industry's faith that, at the end of the 20th
century, music lovers will invest time and money to hear great
piano music played by great artists. How much that faith is
justified will be evident if, at the end of the 21st century,
there's another list of great pianists, some playing masterpieces
we know, some playing masterpieces yet to be composed.

TEXAS AUTHOR HAS A FEUD WITH THE BILLY THE KID LEGEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In legend and song, one William Bonney _ Billy the Kid to you _
killed 20 or 21 or 22 men. How many was it, really?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four,'' snaps Willard Ballow, pleased to have a question that
he can answer at some length.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been more, but only four killings have been
proved.'' It was a convenience, Ballow implies, to pin just about
any unsolved murder during New Mexico's fabled, notorious Lincoln
County range war of 1880-81 on Billy the Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Ballow, a bantam of a man with wispy white hair, at 68
resembles a slick riverboat gambler or perhaps a more raffish
hustler. He is inhaling satisfaction, fulfillment, redemption, for
now he is an author. More than that, he is a revisionist historian.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of ``Billy the Kid: A Graphic History'' is a native
and lifelong resident of Weatherford, Texas, high school Class of
1949. He was in that kid cycle that romanticized the old Wild West
by playing cowboy _ with or without Indians, but always with
desperate hombres. At his own insistence, he was always Billy the
Kid in those skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always fascinated by him, long as I can remember,'' Ballow
says.
</P>
<P>
   Most people shelve their childhood fascinations when they ``grow
up,'' but Ballow claims never to have grown up so completely, and
his interest in Billy the Kid intensified over the years.
Researching Billy's life became first a hobby, then an obsession,
long before there was any notion of a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 10 or 12 years ago that it struck me I really was going
to write a book,'' he says. ``It was slow going for a time, but
then in 1993 I retired (after 42 years in the art department of the
company that evolved into General Dynamics), and I really got busy
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   His investigation was not confined to old newspapers and other
library resources, or even to interviews with descendants of those
who knew or were crossed by William Bonney. He has, of course, read
every existing account of Billy and the Lincoln County War, and has
seen ``The Outlaw'' and other movies, which always display someone
prettier than Billy really was. But Ballow literally hit the trail,
or the trails _ all of them _ tracking the Kid's rather extensive
odyssey in the western reaches of the Southwest frontier.
</P>
<P>
   One immediately senses in Willard Ballow a romantic disposition
that is anchored in an Old West not inhabited exclusively by Billy
the Kid. Ballow is also keenly knowledgeable about Jesse and Frank
James and perhaps other notorious outlaws and gunfighters. But he
has no literary aspirations beyond the disarming book that he
wrote, illustrated and essentially designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas A&AMP;M wanted to publish the book, but I wasn't pleased
about the royalty they offered,'' he says. Reminded that the stated
royalty was standard, Ballow grins and says: ``Well, I knew that.
Maybe I just needed to have control, which I wouldn't have had if
anyone but myself was the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballow's ``Billy the Kid'' is an altogether smart job of
book-making, and his illustrations are as captivating as they are
professional. As a free-lance artist, Ballow has illustrated for
``True West, Frontier Times'' and other magazines; back in the
1970s, he even did a Christmas comic strip for the
``Star-Telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   He found in Fort Worth the resources _ mainly Leway Composing
and Westbridge Printing Services _ for assuring first-rate
production of an oversized, horizontal book to be looked through
and read.
</P>
<P>
   So how about it, Willard _ what was Billy the Kid really like?
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave it to the reader to make his own judgment about
Billy,'' Ballow says. ``When he killed his first man, the fellow
was a loudmouth who sort of asked for it; but that set the pattern
for a good boy to go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``good boy'' is a revelation in Ballow's well-documented
text. The New York-born Bill Bonney was a surprisingly
sophisticated young man, schooled in social graces and quite
literate. He was even in demand as a singer for social occasions.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps he truly was wronged. Ballow writes that Billy was
promised a pardon if he would give testimony in a case. Billy kept
his part of the bargain, but the other side reneged. The governor
in question _ an important figure in Billy's story _ was Lew
Wallace, former Union general in the Civil War, whose ``Ben-Hur''
was published at the time of the Lincoln County War.
</P>
<P>
   Billy the Kid was eventually captured, convicted of murder and
sentenced to hang. He broke out of jail but was tracked down and
killed by Pat Garrett _ the sheriff who, by many accounts, was a
former friend of the Kid. Ballow isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably knew each other, because at different times they
were in the same places,'' he says, ``but there's nothing to
indicate they were buddies or even well-acquainted. One thing I'm
sure of, though: They made Pat Garrett sheriff for the sole purpose
of killing Billy.
</P>
<P>
   William Bonney was slain before reaching age 22. Ballow may
believe that his narrative of Billy's grim misadventures is
``objective,'' and it may well be that. But the reader is swayed in
Billy's favor, liking as well as pitying him, without condoning the
Old West violence that consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of Ballow's ``graphic history'' has been a splashy
event in Weatherford, reflecting local glory on its author and
instilling pride in Wanda Ballow _ Willard's wife for 47 years _
and their daughters Vickie, Jacque and Tammie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's happy for them,'' attests Leway Composing's John
Hoover, who runs interference for Ballow on the promotion route.
``Willard wants people to read his book for what they can learn
about Billy the Kid, not what they can learn about himself. He's
totally without ego.''
</P>
<P>
   But not without joy. Billy's ebullient biographer is eternally
Willard the Kid.

 &HT;    AT VIRGINIA COUNTRY STORE, THEY'RE NOT BUYING IMPEACHMENT PITCH
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE HALL, Va. _ The time has come, the people in these parts
say, to speak of things like the unusually dry and warm weather,
the poor hunting season, and rising property taxes _ not about what
is going on down the road in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten real old,'' Lauren Morris said Wednesday as the
House Judiciary Committee, 135 miles away, entered the final stages
of its hearings on whether to impeach President Clinton. ``They've
really overdone it. I disagree with his lying, but he didn't bother
me so much to think that he should be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old mother of two, a pharmaceutical sales
representative, has joined a handful of craftsmen, farmers and
hunters who gather in the mornings at her father's country store
and, over coffee and Marlboros, discuss the news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Their cracker-barrel wisdom this day helps prove the point of
Democratic pollster Fred Yang: ``The farther away you are from
D.C., the less people care'' about the scandal and impeachment
drama that's consuming Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wasting time and money,'' said Morris's father, Larry
Wyant. ``And if you threw everybody out of Congress who's done what
the president did, you wouldn't have hardly anybody in Congress to
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyant's store has been here at the foot of Virginia's Blue Ridge
Mountains for decades. His grandfather ran it before him. It's the
local source for $1 bologna sandwiches, fishing lures, bow-hunting
videos and Flatt and Scruggs cassette tapes. On the shelves behind
the cash register are baseball mementos and a framed newspaper
clipping about his son, Hunter, signing to play baseball at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The store and the white cement block community center across the
highway are ``downtown'' White Hall, one of the regulars jokes. The
``mayor'' is the nickname they've given ``this fellow down the road
who's never been to school a day in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyant's store is one of the many so-called ``disconnect'' points
beyond Capitol Hill that so exasperates congressional Republicans
bent on throwing Clinton out of office for lying about an affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't watch the TV or read the newspapers,'' said Dennis
Taylor, a 26-year-old carpenter who stopped by Wyant's for coffee
on the first cool, crisp day of December. ``I don't follow
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor doesn't like it that Clinton lied about his affair with
Lewinsky. But he has other priorities: ``I'm just trying to support
my family.'' He and his wife, Angie, have a 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``that's what most folks around here are concerned
about _ their families,'' said Wyant. Times are good, with plenty
of work for everyone, he added. So when the morning talk does
occasionally turn from hunting and the weather to politics, the
topic is usually ever-rising local property taxes, not Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all these Yankees coming in,'' said Charles Ryan, a
45-year-old painter. He is referring to the scores of
multimillion-dollar estates with names like Fox Chase, Mountvue and
Garth Gate that have been carved out of the farmland surrounding
nearby Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject does turn to Clinton, it is clear that the
folks in White Hall are simply ignoring the Judiciary Committee's
televised impeachment hearings, even if they are history in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Americans are paying so little attention to the hearings
that, if the House votes to impeach the president, most of them
will be shocked, former White House spokesman Mike McCurry told a
University of Virginia audience dining in the Thomas
Jefferson-designed Rotunda Dome on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are going to wake up and say, 'They did
WHAT?' `` said McCurry.

POWER OUTAGE: PRACTICE SESSION FOR QUAKE-PRONE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD and CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Plunged into a power failure, city officials
launched a well-rehearsed plan to maintain vital emergency, medical
and transportation services.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Works dispatched street sweepers to
direct traffic. The police guided trapped passengers from subway
tunnels. Firefighters freed people from frozen elevators. And with
half its lines dead, the Municipal Railway deployed dozens of
reserve diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
   Services were largely restored when power returned by the end of
the day Tuesday, and the officials _ from Mayor Willie Brown on
down _ declared the city's response an overwhelming success. And
many of them saw the episode as an almost welcome test run for a
big earthquake or other major disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went very well. We had rapid response from department
heads. They came in knowing what they needed to do,'' said Lucien
Canton, director of the mayor's Office of Emergency Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make light of it,'' Canton said, ``but it was
an opportunity to learn. This was an opportunity to deal with a
real emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   A mistake made by a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. work crew shut
down a power substation in the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday
morning, triggering an outage that left 1 million people without
electricity for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Brown, the department chiefs coordinated their response
efforts from the Office of Emergency Services, a command center of
computers, cellular phones and bulletin boards housed in a
low-slung, non-descript building several blocks from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into teams wearing color-coded vests, officials from
city departments and PG&AMP;E huddled around a horseshoe-shaped group
of tables in the Operations Room, keeping in constant touch with
colleagues in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Next door in the Planning Room, officials wearing blue vests
prepared situation reports for the decision makers, who wore purple
vests in yet another room and were led by Fire Chief Bob Demmons
and the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, amateur radio operators were connected to a network
of 50 volunteers across the city, including in fire stations.
</P>
<P>
   For Brown and other officials, Tuesday began routinely enough.
When the power died at 8:17 a.m., the mayor was in his car heading
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Canton immediately summoned city officials to the
command center, where the mayor stayed throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency generators at the Hall of Justice and city jails
kicked in, maintaining essential power to the police switchboard
and computers. But the Hall of Justice was closed to the public,
its corridors darkened and its court hearings rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Fred Lau called in extra dispatchers to handle a
flood of calls from people to be freed from elevators and from
behind automated garage doors. Some just wanted to know what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the police said, they received no reports of looting
during the outage. To ease traffic, Parking and Traffic Director
Stuart Sunshine sent 130 parking control officers and street
sweepers to 60 key intersections.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Unified School District kept all public
schools open Tuesday, and district officials did not release
students unless their parents picked them up.
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco General Hospital, emergency generators kicked
in within seconds, powering operating rooms and critical and
neonatal intensive care units first, said Jene O'Connell, chief
administrator of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the beauties of living in San Francisco,''
O'Connell said. ``We plan for the worst, so this is actually
minimal compared to what we are prepared for. We can handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:50 p.m., Brown declared a state of emergency, allowing
passengers to ride buses free and city employees to work overtime.
The declaration also extended the property tax deadline of Thursday
to the close of business Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most areas of the city had power a short time later.

THE 20TH CENTURY, ONE OF MONUMENTAL CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 13)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the next year, regardless of the outcome of
the Clinton impeachment drama, this country will explode with
evaluations of the 20th century and the events and personalities
that shaped it.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the brink of the millennium, we will be inundated
with reminiscences and retrospectives as well as predictions about
the future as we prepare to leave one century and enter another.
</P>
<P>
   A vivid panorama, stretching from Jan. 1, 1900, to Dec. 31,
1999, will pass before our eyes. It will recount great victories
and advances in human achievement while also recording tragedies
and declines in moral values.
</P>
<P>
   We will learn from historians and other observers who they
believe should be enshrined in the century's pantheon of greatness
_ the political leaders who made and expedited the great decisions
to safeguard and improve our well-being, the scientists and
inventors who guided us far beyond our old horizons, the titans of
business who developed great industries, the military heroes who
won the wars that were critical to our survival, the writers and
performers who illuminated our souls, the social crusaders who
extended justice to those who had not previously known it, the men
and women who nourished our spiritual health, the adventurers who
explored the universe and those who triumphed in the sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th has been a century of monumental change. Individuals
born in 1900 grew to adulthood in a far different world than those
born a half century or more later.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century began, our nation, having won the
Spanish-American War and gained dominion over Cuba, Puerto Rico,
Guam and the Philippines, was just emerging as a world power. Today
it is the single great world power.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the imperialist nations of old, America did not
simply take from other lands. It also gave to other lands. In the
wake of World War II, it provided the money and the leadership to
guide its former enemies, Germany and Japan, to democracy and
economic rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with aid to Greece and Turkey and continuing with the
remarkable Marshall Plan, America demonstrated to the world that it
was as adept at winning the peace as it had been at winning the
war. The republic's days of isolationism were but a vestige of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Our passage through the 20th century has been both tumultuous
and torturous.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the century, people everywhere traveled by
horse-drawn vehicles and sailing vessels. But by 1917 when America
entered World War I, many were riding in automobiles and staring
skyward in awe of flying machines. Since the radio and television
had not been invented, newspapers provided people with their
primary source of information.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, most American homes depended on water from wells
for drinking and bathing. Indoor plumbing was found primarily in
the homes of the well-to-do. Houses were heated by wood-burning
stoves or coal-burning furnaces that required constant attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before I was born, my parents lost a 13-year-old son to tetanus
and, some years later, a dear family friend to peritonitis.
Pioneers of medical science eventually made those ailments a part
of history, along with smallpox, diphtheria and typhoid fever.
</P>
<P>
   When I was about 10 years old, I was whisked off to a hospital
because my parents and our family physician feared I had polio _
the most dreaded disease of childhood. Fortunately, they were
wrong, and even more fortunately, thanks to Drs. Jonas Salk and
Albert Sabin, polio is now a disease of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, medical scientists have done a spectacular job
of abolishing illnesses that once led inevitably to death. They
have not yet conquered cancer, stroke, heart disease and AIDS, but
they continue to make important strides.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, the man of the family worked 10 or 12 hours a day. His
income, small though it was, bought a home, food, clothing and
schooling for his family. His wife stayed home, cooked the meals,
did the laundry and reared the children.
</P>
<P>
   It was rare for a woman to work outside the home, but some _ who
were teachers, nurses, secretaries and seamstresses _ did so. No
women were able to vote until the 19th Amendment was ratified in
1920.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day provided most workers with their only guaranteed paid
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no job security. When my father joined a union early
in the century, he was blacklisted from finding employment
elsewhere in his home town, Los Angeles. He was forced to go to
other communities in search of employment.
</P>
<P>
   When a working man reached his 60s in the early decades of the
century, he had no retirement income to depend on. Neither business
nor government provided him with a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security did not become law until 1935, and its first
payments were not made until 1940. It then took another 26 years
before Medicare also became part of our social fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 63 years after the passage of Social Security, bipartisan
leaders are seeking ways to safeguard it when the post-World War II
baby boomers begin to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The savings that a working family had laid away often
disappeared during hard times. In the Great Depression of the
1930s, millions of Americans lost their homes and their jobs. Older
Americans often were forced to move in with their children.
</P>
<P>
   In the century now ending, we have fought five major wars on
foreign soil, triumphed in the Cold War with the communist empire,
finally dismantled the barriers to equality of opportunity for
minorities and women, and learned in Vietnam that while we are
powerful, we are not omnipotent. At the moment, we are working with
our former Cold War opponents on an international space station 240
miles above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger, poverty and crime continue to haunt us. But life
expectancy is longer than ever, and today more Americans may be
living more comfortably than ever.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way and learned a great many lessons.
</P>
<P>
   But our learning is not over. The 21st century holds great
challenges and opportunities as well as probable disasters.

I LOVE YOU, BUT IS IT TIME TO MOVE ON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the long months of my first pregnancy, I exhibited the
usual range of tender maternal feelings. As I lay awake at night, I
hoped that my daughter would be born healthy, with my husband's
hair and with a strong aversion to dating boys who rode
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   But when I went into labor, I forgot such trivial concerns.
Between contractions, I was seized by a single thought: I needed to
find my hardcover copy of ``Emma,'' by Jane Austen.
</P>
<P>
   If my husband's recollections of the events are to be believed
(and since I have repressed most memories of labor, his is the only
firsthand account to survive), I refused to go to the hospital
without the book, which I had purchased on a whim and then promptly
forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, the one with the red spine is my lucky copy!'' I
shrieked, according to my husband, when he tried to placate me with
a paperback version. We found the book on an unlikely shelf in the
living room, when the contractions were barely 90 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the next time, I would plan ahead and pack
``Emma'' during a less action-packed trimester. But no. An
essential component of the highly emotional connection I have to
certain security objects is this: the feeling sneaks up on me.
</P>
<P>
   That brings me to my old laptop, an Apple Powerbook 160. When I
bought it in 1992, the computer was just another tool. Lately, it
has become a nearly forgotten middle child in a clamorous household
of faster, newer siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Demoted from the days of glory when I wrote my first nonfiction
book with it, the outdated machine now travels with my 9-year-old
daughter on her daily backyard reconnaissance so she can type
Harriet-the-Spy-like observations about the neighbors (``7:55: Mrs.
O. drives by in GREEN VAN _ taking K. to school???'').
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Thanksgiving, my daughter carried the laptop
into the house, its screen dark, its power cord limp and its motor
silent. She said it refused to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddling confirmed the symptoms, but I couldn't make a
diagnosis. The problem could be almost anything _ as simple as a
dead battery or as fatal as a frazzled hard drive. I did a quick
calculation. Let's see: the warranty has long ago expired, the
hourly rates the local Apple dealership charges for service are
astronomical, and the Powerbook (which cost $3,000 in 1992) is
worth about 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The practical solution would have been to put the Powerbook in
the graveyard in my office until my husband offered a second
opinion. But then, the practical thing to do during labor is to go
to the hospital without making a fuss about a dusty book that
previously meant nothing to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your coat,'' I said to Zoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to B.C. Communications, aren't we?'' she asked
warily. B.C. Communications is the quirky Apple dealership I
patronize for reasons I find hard to articulate. Am I attracted by
the prestige (the owner, Bill Cranz, boasts that his Long Island
shop is the oldest independent Apple dealership east of the
Mississippi)?
</P>
<P>
   Or the broad range of merchandise, including surveillance
equipment and accouterments for gun lovers? Or is it Cranz himself,
who doubles as the proprieter of Depot Firearms and who could have
just as easily doubled for Marlon Brando in ``The Godfather'' if
the part called for a gray ponytail, a khaki-colored safari suit
and a haze of smoke from a pipe?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in trouble,'' Cranz said by way of greetings, eyeing my
relic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time, it was just a battery,'' I said defensively,
gently placing the Powerbook on the service counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in 1995, invoice 950328, $13.02,'' he barked as a
technician prodded at my machine. ``Back then, you were covered
under an Apple Care service policy.''
</P>
<P>
   A technician popped in a new battery. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the power cord?'' I asked hopefully, as my daughter
wandered off to play with a new Apple iMac on display.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a voltmeter was produced _ and, in fact, registered no
response from the power adapter. As a test, Cranz plugged a new
power cord into the computer. ``Problem solved,'' he said, as the
screen brightened. ``How much?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's $162.70, including tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a cord?''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, my daughter reappeared at the counter. ``How much is
that green computer?'' she said, gesturing toward the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve ninety-nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes lit up. ``Twelve dollars and ninety-nine cents?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are your mother's daughter,'' Cranz said, puffing on his
pipe. ``Listen, little girl, I only make $65 profit on each one I
sell.'' Then he said to me, ``You want the cord?''
</P>
<P>
   As I looked down at my computer, I saw a potential money pit _
an ailing reminder of the earliest generation of Apple's Powerbook
line.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. On screen were icons for the first e-mail program I
ever configured and for Glider, the first computer game to which I
became addicted. And this was my first Apple: the machine that made
me realize that the phrase ``new technology'' wasn't always a
synonym for ``alien menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, in my mind I saw all my other heirlooms, the talismans
that I arrange superstitiously throughout my house to keep me safe
from vague, unknown dangers: the tablecloth my grandmother
cross-stitched, the big-eyed photo of my mother when she was 3, the
set of six colored shot glasses that I inherited after the death of
the last relative who drank ritual Manischewitz each Christmas.
``I'll take it,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   In the car my daughter examined invoice 954274, then asked how I
was going to explain this rash expense to her more practical
parent, her father. I said I would say that I had found another
copy of ``Emma,'' one with a red spine. He would know better than
to mess with me.

 CALM, COOL LaHOOD IS PICKED TO KEEP PEACE DURING IMPEACHMENT VOTE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Ray LaHood, the unflappable congressman from
Peoria, Ill., who will preside over the House during the historic
impeachment vote next week, promised Wednesday that he will work to
assure that all members are heard during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood, who was asked by Speaker Newt Gingrich to chair the
debate, said he understands why Gingrich did not want to be
remembered in the history books for presiding over the House when
it takes up the controversy over President Clinton's role in the
White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high honor and a privilege to be asked to do this,''
said LaHood. ``The fact that Speaker Gingrich is the one who
selected me, I think, speaks volumes for the fact that he believes
I have the experience and the knowledge and the know-how to conduct
this most historic debate in a way that dignifies the House.''
</P>
<P>
   LaHood said he foresees ``a high spirited debate with a lot of
theatrics.'' His role will be to ensure that ``the debate is
conducted in a fair and balanced manner so all members have an
opportunity to feel heard.''

<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is expected later this week to
approve articles of impeachment and send them to the House floor.
The full House, with LaHood in the chair, would then vote on
whether to approve the articles of impeachment. If the House
approved the articles, the Senate would then conduct a trial. If
the Senate voted by a two-thirds majority to convict him, Clinton
would automatically be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood, 53, has worked to bring civility to the House since he
was first elected in 1994 with the Republican insurgents who won
control of the House for the first time since 1954. He was one of
the main organizers behind a week-long retreat in Hershey, Pa., for
House members in March 1997 that was intended to ease conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., said he enlisted LaHood to help
organize the Hershey retreat because Lahood ``seemed to be the kind
of guy that might take an interest in getting the place calmed down
and on some kind of more mutually respectful terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs said chairing the House requires a lot of instinct and
intuition and is essentially ``an art form.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to know when members are on the verge of getting out
of line, or when something that is fermenting can use a little bit
of humor or a little bit of time out to help neutralize it,''
Skaggs said. ``Ray is one of the people who has that talent and can
make the place get the business done with as little as grief as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   LaHood, a conservative Republican, has staked out his
independence from the GOP leadership on some hot issues. For
example, he refused to sign Gingrich's 1994 Contract with America,
saying its tax cuts and increases in defense spending would worsen
the federal deficit. In 1995, LaHood also refused to vote with the
Republican leadership on a $17 billion package of spending cuts
because it would be used to pay for tax cuts instead of cutting the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   However, LaHood said he has had ``a very cordial friendly
relationship'' with Gingrich for a decade, going back to the time
when he was a staffer for House Republican Leader Robert H. Michel
and Gingrich was the party's chief vote counter. After Michel
retired in 1994, LaHood won his congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Peoria, Ill., LaHood, 53, is a former junior high school
social studies teacher and was for 12 years an aide to Michel,
rising to become his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Michel, now senior counsel at the Washington law firm of Hogan &AMP;
Hartson, said LaHood became an expert in House floor procedure
while working for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good reputation on both sides of the aisle for being
very fair and conciliatory and always keeping his cool and not
blowing his stack,'' Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   Michel said LaHood knows the House rules and how to ``make sure
the debate is carried on in a fair manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of LaHood's former employers, retired Rep. Tom
Railsback, R-Ill., who served on the House Judiciary panel in 1974
when it voted to impeach President Richard Nixon, said LaHood will
need to use every ounce of the civility that he is known for.
</P>
<P>
   Railsback appointed LaHood as his district director because ``he
gets along very well with people, he treated everyone with respect
and was very well liked.'' ``He is a very decent, well-intentioned
smart person who is going to do what he thinks is right and that's
why the Democrats and the Republicans both respect him,'' Railsback
said.
</P>
<P>
   Railsback, who has watched the impeachment hearings from his
Rancho Mirage home near Palm Springs, Calif., said this time around
the atmosphere is much surlier and tinged with a greater degree of
``rancor, finger pointing and condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the civility and gentility has gone by the wayside,''
Railsback said. ``You have people who are ready to go into
combat.''

<P>
   William Hall, chairman of the political science department at
Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., LaHood's alma mater, said
LaHood has shown an ability in his home district to balance
competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   When LaHood chaired a committee of the members of the Peoria
Catholic Diocese a dozen years ago that was charged with the heated
matter of closing one of the city's two Catholic high schools, he
managed to ease tensions while steering the board to close down the
oldest school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feelings ran high and a lot of tough calls had to be made,''
Hall said. ``Ray not only presided but helped guide them toward the
resolution of the problem by knowing when to let people vent and
when to shut them off.''

LOOKING AT LIFE IN BLACK AND WHITE

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little boy came to my door dressed as a skeleton. I didn't
see him, but my husband said that he was no more than 5 or 6 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   We'd seen a lot of children around the same age that night,
dressed in similar fashion. Because it was Halloween, this was not
all that unusual. What happened next was.
</P>
<P>
   As the little boy left, he called out to those standing watch at
the end of our walkway, ``Mommy, Mommy, a black man.''
</P>
<P>
   I shared this story with some colleagues, and laughter filled
the newsroom. The more I thought about it, though, the more
horrified I became. I wondered how was it that that little boy
could have been surprised (I don't think he was frightened) at the
sight of an African-American male.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the black men he had seen didn't stand in doorways,
handing out candy. Maybe what he was used to seeing were black men
being led away in handcuffs, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I kept thinking about that little boy, his
innocence and his honesty. I realized that I really didn't know
what to make of his reaction to my husband. It saddened me to think
that someone could live in a world so small, so confining. But the
more I thought about him, the more I was forced to look at my own
life. What I finally realized was that my world isn't much larger
than his.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen men and women of all races and ethnicities, met people
from every walk of life. Every day, I work with a diverse group of
colleagues. I talk to them. I laugh with them. I've shared meals
with them, and I've joined them in a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   When they've been met with good fortune or tragedy, I've called
to offer congratulations or condolences. I send and receive cards
and telephone calls marking special occasions. Occasionally, one of
these friends from work, such as Wilma Campbell, will reappear out
of the blue, and it's as if we never parted. Friends are like that.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma surprised me recently with an appearance at my office
while she was visiting Fort Worth. I screamed. We embraced, and I
called my husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never guess who's at my desk,'' I told him. After he
had offered several misses, Wilma suggested, laughing, ``Tell him
it's a white woman.''
</P>
<P>
   I met Wilma while working at the Sacramento Bee. I liked her
because she was honest and she made the best Mississippi mud pie
I'd ever tasted. She was also kind enough to take care of my dog,
Snuggles, when I went out of town.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other white women like her in my life, women
I've felt close to, but the truth is that I've never known one to
be a close friend _ someone with whom to share secrets, to push
back the darkness in each other's lives and to go forward together,
still loving each other.
</P>
<P>
   And so when I recently read an Essence magazine column by a
black woman about her friendship with a white woman, I was at once
saddened and elated.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the same feelings I have watching my daughters'
friendships with their white schoolmates. The same sorts of
feelings you feel when you see something for the first time, the
same feeling that little boy must have felt on Halloween night.
</P>
<P>
   Watching my daughters and their friends, I wonder what drew them
together, what they like about one another and if their friendships
will mature into adulthood and deepen like the one I'd just read
about in Essence.
</P>
<P>
   As moving a piece as it was, their relationship and those of my
daughters are as foreign to me as my husband's blackness was to the
little boy on Halloween night.

   &UR; Checking Out New Software &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I tell whether certain software applications I am
interested in will run under Windows 98? Products in stores are
often in boxes printed before Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   A. For most applications, if ``Windows 95 or later'' or just
``Windows 95'' is specified, it is generally understood that any
Windows operating system released later than Windows 95 _ Windows
98 in this case _ is acceptable. There are exceptions to the rule,
of course, like maintenance programs (Norton Utilities and so on)
for a specific system and device drivers for the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not comprehensive and the search function can be
erratic, Microsoft maintains a list of software and hardware that
has proved to be compatible with Windows 98 at
www.microsoft.com/windows98/guide/Win98/Compatible/default.asp.
</P>
<P>
   And just about every software company has a Web page to
advertise and even sell its products. Such sites often offer
up-to-date information, including system requirements, for the
company's products. The Web page for Macromedia's Dreamweaver 2
(www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/productinfo/sysreq), for
example, says it runs under Windows 95 and 98 and NT version 4.0 or
later.
</P>
<P>
   If software problems have been discovered, many of these sites
will also offer free upgrades and patches to download.

 &HT;    Barnes re-creates another ugly chapter in South
 &HT;    By Don O' Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to know about murder and corruption in the South,
ask Margaret Anne Barnes. ``Murder in Coweta County,'' the Newnan
native's Edgar Award-winning book about a Georgia sheriff who
pursued a rich man for murder, was made into a television movie
starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith. The book and movie were so
popular, Barnes' publisher clamored for another sensational tale of
the gothic South.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken 14 years to find and write such a story, but Barnes
discovered one just across the state line from Columbus in Phenix
City, Ala. ``The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama''
(Mercer University Press, $24.95) is a true account of events as
dramatic as any novel. Until 1954, the Alabama town was known as a
Southern sin city because of prostitution, gambling and rampant
crime. Soldiers from nearby Fort Benning who ventured into the town
frequently lost their money and sometimes their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' story focuses on three heroes: Hugh Bentley, a
sporting-goods store owner who campaigned against the criminal
elements in Phenix City; Albert Patterson, an attorney general who
vowed to fight racketeering, but who was murdered in 1954; and Gen.
Walter ``Crack'' Hanna, who led the National Guard in cleaning up
the town. The next year, Phenix City was voted an All-American
City.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who said she received several threatening calls while
writing the book, sees parallels between this work and ``Murder in
Coweta County.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both show the integrity of the South,'' she says. ``The local
folks took care of the problem without any help from the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mailer on Wolfe: Norman Mailer's review of Tom Wolfe's novel
``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $28.95) should be
called a review in full. Mailer's assessment of the novel covers
five pages in The New York Review of Books and opens with a long
excerpt from Mailer's book ``Cannibals and Christians'' about the
obligation of American writers to tackle grand themes. Noting that
he and Wolfe were comrades in arms on that subject, Mailer praises
much of Wolfe's writing, but criticizes the deus ex machina ending.
What bothers Mailer the most, however, is that Wolfe chose the
commercial, best-seller route rather than the literary one. Had he
not sold out, Mailer says, he ``might at least have tried to bring
off one of the most important books of the half-century.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whole hog: The timing couldn't have been better for William
Hedgepeth's tome on things porcine. The paperback edition of ``The
Hog Book'' (University of Georgia Press, $17.95) arrives in stores
at a time when ``Babe'' is back on the big screen and interest in
pigs is greater than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta writer's book is a tongue-in-jowl look at everything
to do with hogs, from swine in art, sport and show biz to hog lore.
Throughout history, hogs have had a negative connotation, Hedgepeth
says, citing such derogatory terms as ``sweating like a hog'' and
``fat as a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is to change the status of the hog,'' he says.
``Our motto is `Livestock no longer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hedgepeth will sign copies of his book from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Saturday at, appropriately, Dusty's Barbecue, 1815 Briarcliff Road,
404-320-6264.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Country life: Nothing sells a book quicker than a good title,
and Jim Minter has a great one for the collection of columns he has
written for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``Some Things I Wish
We Wouldn't Forget (and others I wish we could): Adventures in
goat-keeping, big-city newspapering &AMP; semi-rural living'' (Midtown
Publishing Corp., $24.95) pretty much says it all. As author Terry
Kay aptly writes in his introduction, ``This is the work of a
gifted man who finds joy in the tall tales of gossip, a man who can
be righteously indignant over absurdity, a man who can make you
swallow tears over moments so tender you swear you can taste
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The columns _ which range from humorous tales of goat farming
and rural life to poignant memories of loved ones and war heroes _
do just that. And the proceeds go to a good cause. Minter, a
retired editor of the Journal-Constitution who lives in Fayette
County, is donating profits to the Inman Heritage Trust, a
nonprofit foundation devoted to preserving slices of the rural
past.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 8:30 on a Saturday night, the holiday shooting
stars suspended above Nassau Street are aglow, illuminating only
blocks of rolled-down aluminum security shutters. There are no
coffee shops still open, no magazine shops, no bars _ and even more
strikingly _ there are no people.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, men on giant cranes are stringing colored
lights and hanging giant red and green balls on the second-largest
Christmas tree in Manhattan. No one is watching. Tracey White, in a
lipstick-red coat, runs out the door of her apartment at 25 Broad
St., hails a taxi and heads up to the Village for some night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved in last February, there was supposed to be a
grocery store coming,'' she said, looking back pointedly at the
empty ground floor windows in her building, one of the financial
district's new rental conversions. ``It's really dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, the air was filled with the babble of
developers outbidding one another for the old limestone office
towers along Wall, John and Broad streets, which they announced
they would turn into 7,000 new apartments. Would-be tenants could
be seen on weekends toting newspapers advertising the first wave of
rental apartments. One magazine trumpeted Wall Street as ``New
York's Next Hot Place to Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and developers announced goals for the vast
conversion of vacant office space into rental and condominium
apartments, and dreamed of transforming the Wall Street canyons _
the area roughly bounded by Fulton Street, South Street and
Broadway _ into a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dream delayed. While no one is labeling the Wall Street
experiment in living a bust, the pace has definitely slowed. In the
last six months, residential development ``has been chilled,'' said
Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a
business group that has lobbied hard for that development.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for co-ops and condominiums have fizzled, said developers
and real estate agents interviewed in the last two weeks. Major
projects slated for conversion to condominiums have changed
direction _ either to rentals or to offices, as the market for
downtown office space unexpectedly rebounded. Other developers
backed off from investing when building prices tripled and
quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   To date, fewer than 2,500 new apartments have been created _
almost all rentals, and the turnover in some of them has been high.
Just ask Todd Parsapour, 24, who moved to Wall Street in July 1997
and left a year later for the West 50s. ``When I graduated in 1997,
10 of my friends went to live at 45 Wall St.,'' he said of a
popular rental conversion. ``I don't think any of them are still
there.'' (Soon, no one will live there. The 441-apartment building
is slated for demolition as part of the New York Stock Exchange's
expansion plans).
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the financial district ``was billed as either
the Promised Land or the new Wild West,'' said Barbara Corcoran,
chairman of the Corcoran Group. ``But Wall Street still has a
commercial image: when it comes to actually living there, customers
think of dark canyons at night, and that seems foreboding.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corcoran's company had hung a big red banner outside 17 John
St., advertising condominiums for sale. A month ago, the owners
yanked down the flag and announced they would create 111 rental
units. Greystone &AMP; Co., which owns the office building at 75 Broad
St., has decided the building will remain commercial. Because of
the area's growing popularity with high-tech companies, Greystone
plans to create a technologically ``smart'' building and name it
the New York Technology Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Some developers blamed the increasingly stingy banks for the
lack of condos. Time Equities chief executive Francis Greenburger
said, ``It's hard enough to find anybody to lend money for a rental
down here _ never mind a condo, where the market is considered
riskier.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, developers add that because of the lack of services
in the financial district, including a perceived dearth of schools,
people hesitate to buy a co-op or condominium, but they don't mind
signing a one- or two-year lease at a rent the Corcoran Group says
is at least 15 to 20 percent below those in more established
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The developers call the rental conversions a success, and
Weisbrod said that 1,000 more rental units are in the pipeline.
Nevertheless, he said, three years ago _ right after tax incentives
were passed to speed residential redevelopment _ construction
activity exploded. ``We thought we'd hit 7,000 units a lot
sooner.'' The financial district, he said, is still ``a community
in the making, a community on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Turri likes living on the edge. Turri, a disk jockey and
aspiring record producer who goes by the name Joe T. Turri, lives
with his label manager, Janine Sugawara, in the curvy red-brick
building at 56 Beaver St. that houses the restaurant Delmonico.
They moved in almost two years ago and pay $1,915-a-month rent.
</P>
<P>
   The couple say they are happy in their one-bedroom apartment,
where the decor is basically a keyboard and a wall of speakers _
along with a large television set. ``I really pump music in here,''
said Turri, 30. ``It's loud, but the walls are thick.''
</P>
<P>
   The desolation appeals to him. ``This is heaven,'' he said,
surveying the empty streets from the building's roof deck. ``This
is like the closest thing to living in the suburbs.''

 NEW YORK: the suburbs.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening of Cipriani Wall Street has ``brought in a fashion
element,'' Ms. Sugawara said of the limousines pulling up with Puff
Daddy, Martha Stewart and other celebrities. But then she sighed.
``I really wish they'd get a clean, modern grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   A supermarket _ or the lack of one _ seems to be the rallying
cry of the disenchanted here _ and developers and politicians know
it. Last week, Henry Elghanayan, whose family owns Rockrose
Development, said he was negotiating with supermarket chains,
trying to entice them with ``better rents _ yes, subsidizing them,
in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket is targeted for the company's building at 99
John St. And two days ago, Weisbrod announced that the Amish Market
would open a third Manhattan store near Battery Park City _ partly
subsidized by some financial-district developers.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elghanayan who approached Mayor Rudolph Giuliani about
offering developers like himself tax incentives to reinvent the
ailing financial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market crash of '87 caused the big office shells
here to empty out,'' he explained. ``There was a flight from
downtown to midtown, where there was an oversupply of brand-new
office space, which was going cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I had a chat with Rudy at a wedding, where he was
officiating,'' Elghanayan said with a chuckle. ``The tax incentives
_ to give developers eight years with no taxes if they converted
the buildings to residential use _ seemed like a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The incentives were passed in 1995, and developers started
trading the grand old office towers lining Wall, Broad and Beaver
streets like Monopoly hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But as the developers were ripping apart the venerable buildings
_ putting in new wiring and air-conditioning ducts _ the market
changed in a way that almost no one predicted. Because of the
seemingly endless bull market, the office market came roaring back
(stockbrokers and investment bankers have to work somewhere). And
developers, in the midst of renovations, realized they could make a
lot more money creating new office space _ no gourmet kitchens and
a lot fewer bathrooms. So they changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the concierge at 40 Wall St., a landmark that Donald Trump
bought with the announced intent of selling condominiums in the
tower, turns apartment hunters away. ``No condos, no apartments,''
the smartly uniformed man said. ``This is Corporate America now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's winging it down here,'' said Chris Miele, who
bought a loft on Broadway between John Street and Maiden Lane six
months ago. ``On Sunday morning, I have to go to the World Trade
Center to get a newspaper. There's a little store across the
street, but toilet paper is $2 a roll, and my friends say it costs
$10 or $12 for a six-pack of beer.'' For groceries, she goes to the
Gourmet Garage in SoHo and takes a cab home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miele is one of the area's rare apartment owners. There are
a handful of small co-op buildings, most of them converted in the
early 1980s, with varying success. Catharine Lover and her husband,
Richard Brotherton, bought their apartment at 3 Hanover Square 15
years ago. ``It was cheap,'' he explained. ``And we're not around
on weekends anyway.'' Sales figures, however, show that apartments
there have not appreciated much in value; one owner, who has left
the city, said his apartment had actually depreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miele, who, with a partner, owns Regeneration, a shop full
of 1950s furniture and objects near the Holland Tunnel, bought her
loft for $175,000 _ less than half the price of apartments she'd
looked at in Tribeca. ``I had been looking for a year,'' she said.
``I wanted light, a terrace and a fireplace.'' She laughed. ``I got
none of them.'' She paused. ``But I got 1,100 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miele spent last Monday night showing a reporter spots that
stay open _ on weeknights _ and discovered a few places herself.
</P>
<P>
   She began at the Roxy, a diner at 20 John St., which says it is
open 24 hours but closes at 1 p.m. on Saturday and all day Sunday.
Then on to the John Street Bar &AMP; Grill, a vast basement with a pool
table, where bartender Denis Kinkela reports that the clientele has
become a lot younger in the last couple of years. At 55 Liberty
St., Ms. Miele came upon the Divine Bar, which at 7 was crowded
with suits and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the bar, David McElroy, 40, an insurance
underwriter, said he moved to Nassau Street because he hated
commuting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live here, you're serious _ you get to know where
everything is,'' he explained. ``People know where to shop. They
get value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here, it's not Tribeca. It never will be Tribeca. But
that's OK. It's really OK.''

   FBC-LAST-HEISMAN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky Williams could soon
become the 63rd college football player to be presented the
prestigious Heisman Trophy by the Downtown Athletic Club . ``He may
be the last,'' said Jim Spitzer, a lawyer representing a group that
holds the club's mortgage. ``He ought not to be.'' The Heisman
Trophy, given each year to the player judged to be the best in all
of college football, is synonymous with success. But the grand old
club that awards the Heisman, and which has one decorating its
lobby, has fallen on some troubled times. The DAC owes $3 million
in back taxes, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and has a $9.5
million mortgage held by a group of outsiders, B&AMP;D Management, very
actively pushing for changes. B&AMP;D could be presenting a plan for
the club in bankruptcy court within a few days of when Williams
picks up the Heisman. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   w/FBC-HEISMAN-TROPHY _ Sculptor Frank Eliscu once said of the
Heisman Trophy, ``It was not one of my best works of art, but it
turned out to be like the Statue of Liberty: not beautiful, but
it's dear to people's hearts.'' Eliscu, who died two years ago,
created a wide variety of works during his lifetime, including the
Cascade of Books outside the Library of Congress and a Presidential
Eagle for the Oval Office. Yet, his most coveted work, the one that
every college football player in this country would love to own,
was his first commission. And yes, there was a real, live,

find out his role in creating the Heisman Trophy until decades

ALBRIGHT PRESSES RUSSIA ON MISSILE SALES TO IRAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
pressed the Russian foreign minister Wednesday for a Russian
commitment to limit cooperation with the Iranian missile program.
</P>
<P>
   An American official said Albright, who is here for a NATO
meeting, had reminded Igor Ivanov, the foreign minister, that the
United States provided financial support to keep Russian scientists
from going to work on foreign weapons programs and had urged the
Russian government to ``make a maximum effort'' to limit technology
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after meetings with Ivanov, Albright
described the issue of Russian cooperation with Iranian programs as
``an issue of major concern to us.'' She said she hoped to begin a
new round of talks on reducing United States and Russian nuclear
arsenals next month on a visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov told allied foreign ministers that by the end of the
month the Russian Parliament would ratify a treaty that the two
countries signed in 1993 to cut nuclear stockpiles, to 3,000 to
3,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in ratification of the treaty had made it uncertain when
the next round of cuts in nuclear arms would begin.
</P>
<P>
   NATO foreign ministers met Ivanov here after frictions resulted
from the alliance's decision in October to threaten Serbia with
bombing unless its forces stopped attacking ethnic Albanians in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia objected, and Ivanov said here Russia still believed that
NATO could not use force outside its territory without a mandate
from the U.N Security Council, a mandate that Russia blocked for
Kosovo. But he said Russian relations with the alliance were much
better than they were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Russia was smarting from a NATO decision in July
1997 to admit three former Warsaw Pact members, the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland, to NATO next year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ivanov said Russia still believed that expanding the
alliance was a mistake, he added that Moscow was considering
whether ``technical problems'' stood in the way of a NATO
invitation to join air surveillance over Kosovo to monitor the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Russian civilian monitors will also be in Kosovo, with a
European team protected by a NATO force in Macedonia, and Russian
troops are working with NATO forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Albright invited Ivanov or Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
Washington in April to meet President Clinton and other allied
leaders. The allies agreed to regular meetings with the Russians
after Moscow had reluctantly acquiesced in the Czech, Hungarian and
Polish NATO memberships. Ivanov did not say whether the Russian
leadership would accept the invitation to the meeting, which would
be on the fringes of a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the
alliance and include its three new members.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and other allied officials said the Foreign Minister
had reacted positively to NATO proposals to adapt a treaty that
would limit conventional forces in Europe to take into account the
collapse of the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet-led alliance signed the
treaty with NATO in 1990, shortly before it collapsed, and many
former members started trying to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on adapting the treaty will begin next year in Vienna and
are to end by November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The allied proposal for reworking the treaty said many NATO
countries were prepared to accept significant reductions in their
arsenals of tanks, artillery and armored vehicles.

CHILE RECALLS AMBASSADOR TO LONDON TO PROTEST PINOCHET RULING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Chilean government recalled its ambassador
to London Wednesday to protest the British home secretary's refusal
to block a Spanish extradition request for Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
Chile's onetime dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government energetically rejects the decision by Secretary
Jack Straw,'' said Interior Minister Raul Troncoso, speaking for
President Eduardo Frei, who was in Brazil when the British decision
was announced. ``No tribunal of a foreign country has the right to
judge a Chilean citizen who has committed crimes in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Warning of ``worrisome passions'' that might still be set loose
here, Troncoso pledged that Chile would continue appeals to try to
block the extradition, a process that could take months or even
years.
</P>
<P>
   The recall of Ambassador Mario Artaza follows weeks of public
criticism by senior conservative opposition politicians that the
government was not using all its diplomatic influence to defend
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   In recent private meetings of military commanders, several
officers called for the government to cut off diplomatic relations
with Britain and Spain despite their importance as Chilean trading
partners, sources of foreign investment and arms suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The newest legal setback for Pinochet came as no surprise. The
early reaction in Santiago was muted compared with the anger
expressed by some and the joy expressed by others two weeks ago
when England's highest court, drawn from the House of Lords, ruled
that Pinochet did not have immunity for crimes committed when he
was a head of state. Spanish courts are seeking the extradition of
the 83-year-old general on charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture in connection with the murders or ``disappearances'' of
3,179 people in the years after he seized power in Chile in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations by activists of the left and right have been
largely orderly, with only sporadic incidents of violence, since
Pinochet was first arrested in London two months ago. But some
political analysts have suggested that violence will become more
likely if Pinochet is blocked from returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to be calm, but let's not forget that General
Pinochet created all we have today in Chile,'' said Hernan Guiloff,
head of the Pinochet Foundation, a group dedicated to promoting the
former dictator's image.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Diaz, leader of the Group of the Families of the
Detained and Disappeared, said: ``We're satisfied and we're happy.
After 25 years of being denied justice in Chile, we're finally
getting somewhere.''

A COMMUNITY OF ACTORS, BUT HARDLY COMMUNITY THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C., Del., Texas, Nev.)   (bl)  
 By SHAWN G. KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   TRUCKEE, Calif. _ A man and woman locked in an amorous embrace
tumbled again and again across three folding chairs. At first jerky
and self-conscious, with each repetition the actors' movements
became smoother and more confident. As the choreography of their
entanglement was refined, dialogue was added and other characters
joined the skit; a slapstick Marx-brothers-style bit emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights of Indulgence Theater United States were being
serious about being silly. For the next few hours, rehearsing in a
community center gymnasium here, members of this small theater
company polished ``Marxist Quack'' and other comedy sketches,
pantomimes, monologues and dance numbers for ``Punch and Cookies,''
the troupe's current show.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Punch and Cookies' everyone is just sort of getting
things out of their brains,'' said Brent Lindsay, a company member
who is directing ``Marxist Quack.'' ``It is experimental, very
unstructured, even for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Knights of Indulgence audiences, Lindsay added, have come to
expect the unexpected. ``People who come to our shows are
curious,'' he said during a break in the rehearsal. ``They know by
now that they won't be getting just another road company version of
`Grease.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Other pieces in the show are as esoteric as ``Marxist
Quack'' is zany and accessible. ``Glass Cage,'' for example, was
inspired by the music of Philip Glass and John Cage. Frida Kahlo,
the Mexican painter, figures into the plot of another vignette.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of material is not the only expression of risk-taking
for the Knights of Indulgence players. Last year, seven of them _
Lindsay, Margret Moreira Valdes, Beth Lorio, Stephen Patterson,
Andy Thornton, Amy Pinto and Barry Morgan _ pulled up stakes after
four years in Delaware and headed for Truckee, a town in the Sierra
Nevada mountains near Lake Tahoe that only Lindsay had visited
before. Like some traveling New Age circus, they just showed up and
started performing.
</P>
<P>
   Their faith that an audience would emerge for their
anything-goes brand of theater was rewarded. The company's first
show, ``Hallows Eve in Brickeltown,'' drew more than 150 children
and adults. In June the Knights of Indulgence presented ``Silent
Night,'' three short plays without dialogue that recreated the
silent screen for the stage. It played in Truckee as well as at
nearby Tahoe City.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of the troupe's work is shaped by a reverence for
medicine shows, vaudeville and silent films, nothing seems beyond
its consideration. ``We're thinking of developing a lounge act,''
said Thornton, with no hint of sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights of Indulgence players, whose average age is 30, met
in the mid-1980s at the North Carolina School of the Arts in
Winston-Salem. They kept in touch, and five years ago the former
classmates were reunited when Morgan, now on a leave of absence,
invited some of his college friends to join him for a summer of
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan had the use of a one-room schoolhouse on a farm his
mother owned in Roxana, Del.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been trying since college to figure out a way to work
together,'' said Patterson, who was playing in a band in Austin,
Texas, when he heard from Morgan. ``After five years it seemed like
it was never going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   They were drawn to the project by the prospect of theater on
their own terms. Ms. Lorio said, ``A big part of our sensibility as
a company, particularly in the beginning, had to do with us wanting
complete control over everything, because coming out of school,
coming out of our respective experiences with charismatic but
controlling theatrical leaders gave us a need for that.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also musicians and dancers as well as actors, and they
write their material and most of the music for their shows, build
sets and take turns directing.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a summer theater project gradually grew into a
full-fledged company as more in the group settled in Delaware. But
after four years, the Knights of Indulgence decided that their
commune-style living and location, in the middle of chicken-farming
country, were liabilities to their development. Seven of the nine
members agreed to give Northern California a try.
</P>
<P>
   Truckee, with its proximity to Lake Tahoe and Reno, Nev., held
the prospect of larger audiences and flexible jobs in restaurants
and shops that allow the performers to devote as much time as
possible to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Knights of Indulgence have not turned a profit on
any production, many costs, such as rent on the rehearsal space,
are covered by members. The next goal is to find a permanent home
for the company, which is looking for someone to donate space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to up the ante,'' Ms. Valdes said. ``We want expand
our repertory and to be out in front of audiences more than two or
three times each year.''

JUSTICES SKEPTICAL OF CHICAGO'S ANTI-GANG LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Chicago and the American Civil
Liberties Union squared off Wednesday before an apparently divided
Supreme Court over the constitutionality of a city ordinance that
increases the authority of police in combating gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Rosenthal, Chicago's deputy corporation counsel, told
the justices that the threat of violence justifies the ordinance,
which allows police to disperse people congregating on street
corners if an officer believes a gang member is present.
</P>
<P>
   But ACLU attorney Harvey Grossman countered that Chicago's Gang
Congregation Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague, making it too
easy for police to act arbitrarily and punish law-abiding citizens
in the officers' zeal to frighten gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices questioned the law's constitutionality, asking
Rosenthal what protection it provides to innocent residents who
unknowingly find themselves on the same street corner as a gang
member. However, justices also asked Grossman whether the
Constitution is flexible enough to let police take extraordinary
steps to prevent the scourge of gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's argument has won before Illinois judges as the state
Supreme Court said the ordinance unreasonably infringes on the
liberty of people standing in public places. Chicago appealed the
case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, pressing Chicago's case, urged the justices to uphold
the ordinance, which the city suspended after the state appellate
court decision three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, addressing Rosenthal, expressed concern
that the ordinance enables police to arrest law-abiding people who
are perhaps doing nothing more threatening than watching cars go by
while standing near a stranger on a street corner. Under the
statute, police can order the people to leave if the stranger is a
suspected gang member; officers can then arrest the people if they
refuse to leave, Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal responded that the city was justified, due to
escalating violence, in passing a reasonable ordinance to give
police greater authority to disperse suspected gang members,
particularly in high-crime neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these neighborhoods, police can't tell if people are just
watching cars go by,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Souter also noted that the ordinance gives people no guidance
for determining when they are running afoul of the law. ``It's a
judgment that's left entirely to the police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the controversial statute has
the ``potential for arbitrariness by the police.'' Even a good
Samaritan urging gang members to abandon their violent ways can be
ordered to leave if a policeman sees her dispensing the advice on a
sidewalk, O'Connor added.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the ordinance might discourage
law-abiding residents from leaving their homes, fearing arrest if
they innocently walk near a gang member when a policeman is
present.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Rosenthal said the ordinance's goal is not only to
scare gang members but to protect law-abiding citizens from
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Police, by dispersing groups of individuals, protect innocent
residents from the potential harm of being near a gang member if a
rival attempts a drive-by shooting, Rosenthal said. In addition,
the police dispersal of people makes it more difficult for gangs to
recruit new members on public streets, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's Grossman said the ordinance unconstitutionally lets
police target anybody loitering on a street corner, whether they
belong to a gang or not.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Breyer asked Grossman whether the
authority the ordinance gives police is any different than the
recognized right of officers to set up roadblocks and arbitrarily
test motorists to determine if they are driving drunk. Both police
actions are designed to prevent people from getting hurt or killed,
the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Grossman said a drunken driver presents a more
immediate threat to public safety than do people standing on street
corners. Grossman argued the case on behalf of Jesus Morales and
about 65 other people arrested under the controversial law.

TRACKING THE EVOLUTION OF E-MAIL ETIQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas, N.Y.)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As technologies evolve, so do the manners surrounding their use.
</P>
<P>
   Take the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell considered ``Ahoy!
Ahoy!'' the correct way to answer a telephone. Allen Koenigsberg, a
classics professor at Brooklyn College, said it took until 1880,
three years after commercial service was introduced in the United
States, for the jauntier ``hello'' to win out over Bell's choice
and other contenders, like the impossibly proper ``What is
wanted?'' and a confused ``Is anybody there?''
</P>
<P>
   The etiquette of e-mail, the ever more popular flow of messages
from computer to computer via the Internet, is still in its
formative stages. But that doesn't mean nobody is thinking about
it. Dozens of e-mail etiquette primers can be found on the Web. And
many companies now distribute guidelines on e-mail usage to
employees, although the guidelines tend to focus on the contents of
messages.
</P>
<P>
   A few conventions are widely accepted. By now, most electronic
correspondents know that informal salutations and sign-offs are
perfectly acceptable but that typing in all capital letters, which
comes across as virtual shouting, is not.
</P>
<P>
   Regular e-mailers know that they must watch what they write
because e-mail is not necessarily private and that chain letters
are not just considered tacky but are banned from many corporate
e-mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   As the flood of e-mail has grown, it has become clear that
people are seeing far more of other people's unedited thoughts than
ever before, both at work and outside it. That is partly because
e-mail is so much easier to use than paper correspondence, as are
the features that allow people to reply to, send, forward and
redirect _ and occasionally misdirect _ a message.
</P>
<P>
   But people are usually left to their own devices when it comes
to use of Redirect, Forward, Cc (carbon), Bcc (blind carbon) and
other features that appear in the e-mail header, the part of the
message that serves as a virtual envelope and contains the time,
date and addressing information.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, people have developed personal styles on
the use of these functions that are highly idiosyncratic yet
sometimes carefully considered.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail has been around since the mid-60s, when it was used on
computer time-sharing systems, and it has offered carbon, reply and
forward features since the early 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of e-mail sent from machine to machine first cropped up
in the 1970s, and its use has been growing ever since. According to
the International Data Corp., a market research company, roughly
2.1 billion e-mail messages are sent each day in the United States,
nearly double the volume at the end of 1997. That number is
expected to reach 8 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail mores and faux pas matter most in workplaces where a
growing reliance on e-mail for discussions and decisions means that
entire days can pass without a single face-to-face meeting. E-mail
usage at work now rivals, and in some cases eclipses, the use of
the telephone. One misdirected message, or an ill-tempered e-mail
sent when emotions are heated, can threaten a career.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been using e-mail for a long time have learned
to be judicious in using the Cc feature.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry J. Saal, a philanthropist and entrepreneur in Silicon
Valley, began using e-mail more than 20 years ago, when he was a
manager at International Business Machines and used the company's
internal e-mail system. ``One of the things I've realized is how
very much my usage of Cc and Bcc has changed over the years,'' Dr.
Saal said.
</P>
<P>
   Saal once used the Cc feature ``as a kind of not very effective
bludgeon to bug someone to do something, somehow involving someone
else as an observer in the process, maybe their boss,'' he said.
Now he rarely uses Cc because he considers it unnecessary. ``About
the only times I use Cc these days is for trying to set up a joint
meeting with more than two people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even relative beginners _ which includes most people _ can be
highly sophisticated in their thinking about their e-mail. ``We all
use Cc for the right and wrong reasons,'' said Martha Feingold,
director of talent at ZDTV in San Francisco. ``We use it to praise
ourselves,'' she said, or for self-protection. She said some people
used Cc as a way to show off, including people in the Cc field not
because they need to be there but because they want to advertise
the acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who regularly send out e-mail _ jokes, say, or a
newsletter _ to a large number of people hide their recipient lists
to avoid clutter. Some e-mail programs have an option for hiding
recipients in the Cc field, but people do it different ways,
depending on the software used.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more conspicuous slips of the finger took place in
the summer of 1997, when John Perry Barlow, who is known to
socialize with celebrities both in and out of the digerati,
accidentally forgot to hide the recipients on his ``BarlowFriendz''
list when sending out one of his periodic dispatches. So several
hundred private e-mail addresses, including those of John F.
Kennedy Jr. and the actress Darryl Hannah, landed in the In box of
each person on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after discovering the gaffe, Barlow sent out a lengthy,
self-effacing apology to the people on the list. ``I felt terrible
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Winer, the author of a newsletter about the computer
industry, came up with a more creative solution for masking his
recipient list. When the Davenet newsletter goes out, he uses a
random number generator to select 11 names and put them in the To
field of the e-mail header _ each person in the group therefore
finds out the e-mail addresses of the other people in that group.
</P>
<P>
   The process continues 90 more times, until the newsletter has
been sent to all of the 1,000 recipients. ``It makes it more
interesting,'' Winer said. ``There's this sense of connection they
get.'' Winer said he had seen e-mail discussions break out on
several occasions among the 11 recipients in a group.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent e-mail users draw a sharp distinction between being
included in the To field and being included in the Cc field. As
they see it, to be in the To field is to be part of the discussion
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel obliged to get into the fray if I'm part of the To
field,'' said Daphne Kis, president and chief executive of
Edventure Holdings, an information services and venture-capital
firm in New York. Recipients included in the Cc field, however,
consider themselves bystanders who have no particular obligation to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Bcc _ the feature for sending blind copies, hidden from the view
of the recipient in the To field _ is more controversial. ``Bcc
should be illegal,'' said Guy Hoffman, chief executive of Deja
News, a company in Austin, Texas, that archives Usenet newsgroups.
``It's like recording a call without informing the other party.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mark Erickson, vice president for culinary development at
Digital Chef, an online retailer of specialty foods and cookware in
St. Helena, Calif., agrees. ``The whole concept of `blind copy'
gives me a feeling of inner-office politics that aren't on the up
and up,'' he said. ``I have never used it in all my years of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people ease a guilty conscience by forwarding a copy of a
piece of e-mail to someone without telling the recipient of the
original. The effect is the same: someone receives a message
without the original recipient knowing that has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Spertus, an assistant professor of computer science at
Mills College in Oakland, Calif., said she used Bcc occasionally
but also forwarded copies of messages separately. ``I consider it
more honest to forward the mail separately than to do Bcc,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the Bcc function is nothing to be ashamed of. At
Michael Kaminer Public Relations in New York, Bcc's fly around the
office nearly as often as out-in-the-open e-mail. ``Bcc's the best
thing in the world,'' said Kaminer, the company's president. ``At
my company we like to let every single person know everything about
every single account I work on. It's a nice way for me to keep
everyone here up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want everyone to know you're copying 15 people on a
a message,'' he added. ``A note to someone seems a lot less
personal when there are 10 other names in the Cc field.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people don't use Bcc because they don't trust it. Allison
Thomas, a management consultant in Studio City, Calif., simply does
not trust the e-mail program to send a blind carbon copy that is
truly blind. ``Everyone's probably gotten burned somewhere along
the line,'' she said. Instead, like those who feel guilty about
sending an actual blind copy, Ms. Thomas sends copies of e-mail to
third parties after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   The Reply function may seem perfectly straightforward, but it,
too, has its drawbacks. Most e-mail programs, upon receiving this
command, include the text of the previous message _ as well as all
the messages that preceded it. The result can be a message that's a
mile long with history. Saal said he took great pains to winnow his
messages as an exchange continued, retaining only the most relevant
text.
</P>
<P>
   A different problem, at the other end of the spectrum, arises
when an electronic dialogue loses its context entirely. ``I get
pieces of mail responding to something I wrote a week earlier that
just says, `It's a deal!' and I have no idea what they're talking
about,'' Saal said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Reply to All function, which can bring in all
too many people on a heated discussion. ``I discovered the
potential for hostility in e-mail is huge, and very disruptive for
managing groups of people,'' said Stuart Gannes, vice president for
Internet applications at the Menlo Studio at AT&AMP;T Labs in Menlo
Park, Calif. ``People got on their high horse and became very
preachy toward each other. These incredibly hostile arguments that
were copied to everyone would erupt. You're challenging someone in
public. These things are like little wildfires.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such situations, Gannes has developed a rule for the
group he manages. ``If you want to directly confront somebody,
don't reply to all,'' he said. ``Just reply to the person who
disturbed you.''
</P>
<P>
   A stickier predicament arises from confusion over the Redirect
and Forward functions. People often choose Redirect (not found in
many e-mail programs) for a message without realizing that it
leaves the original sender's name in the From field. That means
that when recipients reply to the message, the reply makes a
beeline for the original sender, not for the person who redirected
the message.
</P>
<P>
   When someone uses Forward to send you a message, on the other
hand, you can choose Reply to send a message back to the person who
forwarded the e-mail message, not to the original sender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redirect is implemented in a terrible way, leading to terrible
faux pas situations,'' said Einar Stefferud, an Internet management
consultant in Huntington Beach, Calif. Stefferud, who used some of
the original e-mail systems in the 1970s, does not use his Redirect
feature.
</P>
<P>
   The Forward function comes with its own set of perils. ``You
forward an entire message to someone without necessarily thinking
about what's at the bottom,'' said Kaminer, the Bcc fan. ``You
might have said that person is a schmuck lower in the e-mail and
forgotten to take it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Misdirected e-mail can get messy. Nearly everyone has a story to
tell of embarrassment caused by a stray electronic arrow.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Wells, a reporter at The Oakland Tribune in Oakland,
Calif., recalled a nearly disastrous mistake that occurred when the
Newspaper Guild she was helping to organize was pursuing a contract
with management. When Ms. Wells sent out a confidential piece of
e-mail outlining the group's strategy, it accidentally ended up in
the computer of a high-level executive whose name stood dangerously
close to that of the intended recipient in an electronic address
book. ``We were nailed,'' Ms. Wells said. Naturally, the organizers
were forced to change their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Wells said, ``I double-read all my e-mail, and everyone
it's addressed to. And for anything that's the least bit personal,
I call them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a computer, it's so easy to hit the wrong button,'' said
Robert Bender, a senior editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster in New York. ``I
don't know how they avoid this kind of thing at the White House and
the Pentagon. Tell the Chinese prime minister to go jump in a lake
and the next thing you know, troops are lining up at the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Escape key, which can pull a message back from the
brink just as it is being sent _ if you're quick enough. ``The
Escape key has saved my life on several occasions,'' Kaminer said.
``But you have to have a really fast draw to get it in time.''

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST Thursday, December 10, 1998  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow fell Wednesday afternoon in the mountains of southern
Colorado as moist air from the southeast was drawn up the sloping
terrain ahead of an upper-level low pressure system pressing slowly
over Arizona. Thursday, the sluggish low will expand its inclement
sphere of influence to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A chilly rain will soak parts of southern, central and eastern
Texas as invading moist air from the Gulf of Mexico glides over
cooler air near the ground. Under assault from invading Gulf air,
cool air will retreat westward during the day, eventually halting
across central and northeast Texas. It is here that rain may be
heaviest as advancing moist Gulf air clashes and rises over defiant
cool air. Between one and three inches of rain are possible, with
thunder punctuating some of the rain. Thunderstorms are also
possible in the milder, moister air that will replace cool air
along the Texas seaboard. Rain will spread to parts of Arkansas and
Louisiana, while snow will fall on the high ground of west Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusting as high as 100 mph will course through mountain
passes in southern California as air circulating westward around
the periphery of strong high pressure in Nevada accelerates through
narrow canyons. Near the core of the cold high, temperatures will
again plummet below zero degrees Fahrenheit early Thursday morning
in a few spots across northern Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, patches of morning fog will develop across the still
parched northern Middle Atlantic States, where welcome rains
moistened the ground early this week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Canyon Winds &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusted to 100 mph through narrow canyons of the Santa Ana
Mountains in southern California Wednesday. These infamous Santa
Ana winds blow when air moving westward around strong high pressure
over the Great Basin accelerates as it squeezes through mountain
passes on descent from the high deserts on southern Nevada,
southern Utah, southern California and eastern Arizona. The Great
Basin high derived its strength from weighty cold air at low levels
in addition to the weighty convergence of air at high altitudes.
Gusts to 100 mph will roar through narrow canyons again Thursday.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY LISTS ANTI-SEMITISM AS A FORM OF RACISM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the first time in more than half a century,
the U.N. General Assembly decided Wednesday to list anti-Semitism
as a form of racism.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was adopted by consensus on the 50th anniversary
of the international convention against genocide and a day before
the United Nations celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a resolution introduced by Indonesia on behalf of more than
100 developing nations, the Assembly also warned against new
avenues for disseminating the ``repugnant views'' of racist
organizations, and asked governments to monitor communications for
misuse. Germany and Turkey co-sponsored the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   General Assembly resolutions do not carry the force of Security
Council resolutions, but they reflect world opinion. In the past,
the Assembly had voted to equate Zionism with racism.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cold War ended, the United States was able to have
those definitions removed from annual Assembly resolutions on human
rights. This year the Clinton administration lobbied hard to
include a condemnation of anti-Semitism in the resolution, titled
Measures to Combat Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. is about tolerance and inclusion,'' said Felice Gaer,
director of Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human
Rights, at the American Jewish Committee. ``But this is the first
time that the U.N. has used the phrase `anti-Semitism,' which has
been fought over for years and kept out of any resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase just narrowly made it into the resolution. In a
paragraph whose language Geraldine Ferraro helped negotiate four
years ago when she was the chief American representative at the
U.N. Human Rights Commission, the General Assembly listed a number
of targets to be investigated by the United Nations monitor on
racism.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor, known as a special rapporteur, was asked to examine
racist incidents ``against blacks, Arabs and Muslims'' and
``xenophobia, Negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan has lent his voice to broadening
definitions of intolerance, and for changes in the attitude of
members toward Israel, which is still denied a place in any of the
organization's regional groups. It is these groups that choose
candidates for rotating Security Council seats and other positions.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in March in Jerusalem to the Israel Foreign
Relations Council and the U.N. Association of Israel, Annan said he
was aware that ``the United Nations is regarded by many as biased
against the State of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Israelis see hypocrisy and double standards in the
intense scrutiny given to some of its actions, while other
situations fail to elicit the world's outrage and condemnations,''
he said. ``I know that Israelis are offended when other nations'
delegates leave the room as Israelis rise to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said it was time ``to usher in a new era of relations
between Israel and the United Nations.''

NEW NEW YORKER EDITOR RE-ENTERS BOOK RING WITH A MUCH-PUMMELED
ALI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali has been inspected, dissected, recapitulated,
covered in every form of print and picture, as befits one of the
most famous icons of this media-saturated century.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that deterred David Remnick from pursuing Ali once
more for his own book. Part of that decision came from the fact
that Ali was one of Remnick's youthful heroes, along with Bob
Dylan. But Remnick _ who won the Pulitzer Prize for ``Lenin's
Tomb,'' his first book on the Soviet Union _ was also drawn to
Ali's story because of what it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write a book that had the lines of a traditional
American novel,'' Remnick said in an interview. ``Most readers may
think of Ali as the most famous mug and pug on the face of the
Earth, someone with an electric presence. But after two big baggy
books on Russia, with too many characters and subplots, Ali's
story, focused on a finite time, really has the classical lines of
a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an American character who creates himself, a hero who
faces obstacles, overcomes them and changes over time, and you have
antagonist characters who reflect and oppose the hero. I can tell
you I was damn grateful to get a story with that narrative
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick's ``King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an
American Hero'' (Random House, 306 pages, $25) delivers a knockout
punch of a book, as quick-paced as an Ali Shuffle, but also slyly
deceptive in its economy. For in this era of doorstop biographies
of minor-league luminaries, Remnick uses a modest 300 pages to zero
in relentlessly on that fascinating, formative period when Cassius
Clay became Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   This subject might seem an odd choice for someone esteemed for
foreign correspondence and who recently was named the editor of The
New Yorker, to a five-minute ovation from the staff, after working
six years there as a staff writer and producing more than 100
articles.
</P>
<P>
   But the 40-year-old New Jersey native, a Wunderkind of the print
world, has a resume that includes a stint as a sportswriter on The
Washington Post and has always been known for his willingness to
cover anything that moves across the wide open spaces of his
eclectic interests.
</P>
<P>
   That might be reportorial chutzpah, but, in Remnick's case, it
is tempered with modesty, humor and self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the World'' showcases Remnick's great talent for
mining vast resources of material and then forging that material
into a compelling narrative. Remnick's writing distinguishes itself
through adroit use of telling quotations, pivotal incidents and
such high-wire descriptions as ``(Sonny) Liston trained the way
Liberace played piano; it was a garish representation of a boxer at
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick also manages to provide insight and context about such
disparate subjects as the mob's onetime stranglehold on boxing,
Malcolm X's split with the Black Muslims and the practice of sports
photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the World'' is a book about boxing, but a book about
boxing in the way that ``The Old Man and the Sea'' is a book about
fishing. The subject is merely an entree to examine more
fundamental questions.
</P>
<P>
   How Cassius Clay transformed himself into Muhammad Ali is
depicted by Remnick as an inspired and willful act of
self-invention squarely in the long American tradition of Davy
Crockett, Walt Whitman and Buffalo Bill. But behind Ali's acute
instincts as a showman was an often-overlooked work ethic that
dated from the days when he first put on boxing gloves as an
89-pound 12-year-old who pronounced himself ready for a fight after
having his new bike stolen.
</P>
<P>
   As Remnick writes: ``(Ali) proved to be one of the
hardest-working athletes anyone had ever seen in Louisville. From
the moment Clay won that first fight, he would come home in the
evening and tell his parents how he was going to become champion of
the world, was going to buy them all new cars and a new place to
live. ... He didn't just talk about it. Cassius practically lived
in the gym. He never smoked, never drank. ... Clay was training
like a professional when he was still in his mid-teens. At 18, he
had already compiled an amazing amateur record: 100 wins and only
eight losses, two national Golden Gloves championships, and two
national Amateur Athletic Union titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali still had to surmount his own demons, his great fear of
flying that prompted him to don a surplus parachute during his
first airplane flight to the Rome Olympics. But perhaps no fear was
greater than that of entering the ring as the underdog challenger
to the fearsome champ Sonny Liston. It was the first and only time
that Ali admitted he felt fear in the ring, fear that he usually
KO'd through outrageous pre-fight antics designed to psych out
opponents but also to fortify his own psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Ali now is a shell of his former self, shackled by all the
punishment he received in the ring and also by Parkinson's disease.
But Remnick, whose father also has Parkinson's, found the champion
at peace with himself during the day they spent together at his
Michigan farm.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick considers that time with Ali _ much of it spent watching
tapes of his ring exploits _ to be ``a great gift.'' The writer
uses that original material to open and close the book on lingering
high notes of power and poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali is an American myth who has come to mean many things to
many people: a symbol of faith, a symbol of conviction and
defiance, a symbol of beauty and skill and courage, a symbol of
racial pride, of wit and love,'' Remnick writes. ``Ali's physical
condition is shocking not least because it is an accelerated form
of what we all fear, the progression of aging, the unpredictability
and danger of life. In Ali we see the frailty of even a man whose
job it was to be the most fearsome figure on the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, like Ali, has enjoyed great success at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton after studying with
writing legend John McPhee. He was posted to Moscow at 28 for what
became ``the most incredible experience of my life'' as he
chronicled the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Then he succeeded media star Tina Brown as editor of The New
Yorker a few months before his 40th birthday. That plum job came
his way, even though his past editing experience was limited to his
stint at the helm of the twice-yearly Pascack Valley High School
Smoke Signal. And ascension to his dream job occurred only after
New Yorker owner S.I. Newhouse rescinded his day-old offer to
Michael Kinsley, the editor of Microsoft's online magazine Slate.
Kinsley draws nothing but praise from Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that Remnick seems to have failed to
achieve was his onetime dream of becoming a rock musician. His
rhythm-guitar work contributed to what he now considers the
necessary demise of Derek and the Dialectics, a truly terrible
group that assaulted the eardrums of fellow Princeton students just
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick looks back at what he has achieved and attributes it to
``luck and elbow grease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a pretty good writer and a pretty good reporter,
but luck is not to be overestimated,'' he said. ``Luck is why I got
sent to Moscow and luck may be partly why I got this new job at The
New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick readily admitted that he is ``still learning'' in his
new job, but delights in shouldering the responsibility to choose
and edit the articles in the prestigious magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over the moon in love with The New Yorker,'' Remnick
emphasized. ``I want it every week to be as great as it can be.
There are very few venues where there is no excuse for not being
great. We have no excuse.''

ISRAELI SUPREME COURT RULES YESHIVA MILITARY EXEMPTION ILLEGAL

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a landmark decision that touches a deep divide
between strictly religious and secular Israelis the Israeli Supreme
Court ruled Wednesday that a longstanding exemption for rigorously
Orthodox Jewish yeshiva students from army service was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, challenging a practice dating from Israel's
inception, highlighted the growing role of the Supreme Court in
deciding the struggle between religion and state.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption from compulsory service of a growing number of
yeshiva students _ 30,000 this year _ has embittered many secular
Israelis, who accuse the strictly Orthodox of shirking a duty borne
by the rest of society. In a country where many people risk life
and limb on army duty, the exemptions are a ``discrimination
between blood and blood,'' said Amnon Rubinstein, a lawmaker from
the leftist Meretz party who petitioned the court to set quotas for
the exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined in the suit by another Meretz legislator, Haim
Oron; by a group of army reservists, and by university and high
school students who sought to cancel the exemptions entirely.
</P>
<P>
   After months of deliberations an 11-judge panel headed by Chief
Justice Aharon Barak ruled that the system, under which the defense
minister grants exemptions, was illegal. The court gave Parliament
a year to pass legislation on the issue, adding that if none is
passed the present system would be automatically canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The exemptions had created a ``deep rift in Israeli society and
a growing sense of inequality,'' and such matters of principle that
are ``disputed in the general public should be decided by the
legislator,'' Barak wrote in the unanimous opinion, which the two
religious judges on the bench also endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   Because they cannot work under the terms of the study exemption,
strictly Orthodox yeshiva students had become impoverished,
creating ``a social problem of the first order,'' the court said.
``The current situation has created an entire population that is
not integrated into the labor market and is increasingly dependent
on state stipends.''
</P>
<P>
   Originated by the first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, to
preserve the scholarly remnants of Orthodox Jewry that were almost
destroyed in the Holocaust, the system applied to 400 students in
1948. But the number mushroomed over the years, as thousands of
strictly Orthodox young men sought refuge from military service
through enrollment in full-time yeshivas. Significant numbers work,
despite their official registrations as full-time students.
</P>
<P>
   According to army figures, 8 percent of the exemptions from
military service are given to people registered as strictly
Orthodox yeshiva students. Other exemptions are given to Israeli
Arabs and to people found unfit for service.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, legislators from Meretz and strictly Orthodox
parties indicated that they were ready to negotiate a compromise
bill that would regulate the exemptions and prevent abuses. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he intended to submit a bill that
would be ``an agreed proposal that will prevent a rift in the
nation and, I think, insure the unity of the nation.''

OBITUARY GAME AMUSES, ENRAGES RADIO LISTENERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first day it was Carroll O'Connor. Then it was David
Letterman. The bonus round one morning was the woman with Marty
Feldman eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Can you pick which of the photographs on The Dallas Morning News
obituary page most resembles those celebrities? Be the ninth caller
to get it right, and you win CDs and a T-shirt. If you're real
lucky, you take home the camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity Stiffies,'' a game on Dallas station KDGE (94.5 FM),
is the latest radio gag to raise the questions of what's funny, and
what's offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it's not Howard Stern. It's not gay jokes, sex
talk or racist jabs. This time, radio hosts are making fun of the
one thing we all have in common, besides taxes: death.
</P>
<P>
   While entertainers try to put the ``fun'' into funeral, not
everyone agrees that it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does `beneath contempt' sound?'' said Bob Mong, Morning
News president and general manager. ``Those are two words that pop
into my mind. It's grotesque and it's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas journalism Professor Marvin Olasky said
society has long made light of the things it didn't understand,
death included. But the trend he sees is no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``Pulp Fiction'' broke ground with its dark-humor view
of death and torture. Since then, films such as ``Very Bad Things''
have taken death to new highs, or new lows, depending on your
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky said the problem with the radio game is that it takes
mankind's nervousness about death and unleashes it on a ritual that
helps people mourn: the obituaries. ``It's a theater of cruelty,''
Olasky said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jagger, the radio host who invented the game, said death
is part of the human experience, and therefore, fodder for humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is so scary you do one of two things: You huddle and
you're afraid, or you do what I do, the opposite _ you find
something humorous in it, and go with that angle,'' Jagger said.
``I know, there's a real divided line; it's either a sacred thing,
one of those you-shouldn't-go-there areas, or it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea came to him last week when a co-host was reading the
morning obituaries. Why would a 32-year-old man read about
strangers who died? The question was a topic of banter when Jagger
noticed one of the dead men looked like Archie Bunker. So he asked
listeners if they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger said that some callers are offended, but that every time
the alternative rock station plays the game, the ``phone lines are
jammed.'' They play only on the mornings he finds a celebrity
look-alike in the obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people understand what we're doing is harmless, bringing
notoriety to these people who got no recognition in life, and we're
giving them one more plug on the way out,'' Jagger said.
</P>
<P>
   Mong, at ``The Morning News,'' did not know about the contest
until asked for his reaction. He said he didn't know what action,
if any, the newspaper will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us feel there is a sanctity to the passing of a
human being, and to make light of it is sort of beyond belief,''
Mong said. ``This whole thing violates what human beings feel is a
decent and good way to behave.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's DJs asked callers one morning to find which of the
men in military uniforms most resembled Billy Baldwin. Another day,
the only possible match was a man who favored Ed McMahon ``after
eight chemo treatments,'' Jagger said. ``So we drew the line there.
We didn't play that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jensen, a University of Texas professor of media law and
ethics, said the game is part of a trend in which sick humor sells,
and humanity suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This death stuff even pushes it further,'' Jensen said. ``Our
collective humanity doesn't mean anything. In a way, it's more
frightening. It's not targeting groups that can be easily trashed.
It's saying everybody is up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagger stands by his game. ``We don't sit there and think,
`Let's do this game and see how much money we can make.' Why did
CBS run Jack Kevorkian whacking off some guy? Is it about ratings?
Absolutely it's about ratings. My job is to get as many listeners
as possible. How do I get them? Here you go.''

AMERICA'S KEROSENE KING, LIKE GATES, WAS TITAN OF CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a man who's been dead for 61 years, John D. Rockefeller sure
gets his picture in the newspaper a lot. His visage glares down
from articles on the proposed Exxon-Mobil merger. He is widely
compared with Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   It is an apt comparison. Each saw a future that others didn't,
and started a company from scratch. Each was a success by 25 and a
tycoon by 35. Each held a 90 percent market share. Each was
vilified by rivals and targeted by trust-busters. Each was
convinced of his own good and treated his accusers with some
disdain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ron Chernow's bestselling book, ``Titan,'' when
Rockefeller created Standard Oil in the 1860s, all the petroleum in
the world was produced in one corner of Pennsylvania.
(``Pennzoil,'' indeed.) Nobody knew when the wells would play out,
or whether ``rock oil'' could be extracted anywhere else. The price
of oil was at the mercy of each new gusher.
</P>
<P>
   Oil was then refined into kerosene, which competed with a
distillate of turpentine for use in lanterns and stoves. Refining,
writes Chernow, was largely conducted by Civil War veterans who
``betrayed little sense of how to fashion a stable, lasting
business.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1890, Rockefeller had changed everything. He had connected
the wells by pipeline. He had bought out the little refineries,
which were constantly catching fire, and built big ones. He had
built his own barrels, then railcars and then ships. He had
provided his blue cans of kerosene to customers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   He was a master negotiator. In 1868 he cut a deal with rail
tycoon Jay Gould for a 75 percent discount on the Erie Railroad.
This was attacked as an unfair rebate. Journalist Ida Tarbell wrote
years later that it allowed Rockefeller to succeed though he ``had
no legitimate superiority over those competing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on what's legitimate and what's not. His deal cut
the Erie's unit costs. It required Rockefeller to run his Cleveland
refineries at full bore, regardless of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller would use rebates for decades. Most controversial
was his 1872 scheme in which Standard and its allies would get
rebates not only on their business but their competitors'. (And
Microsoft used to charge on a PC maker's entire volume, Windows and
non-Windows.) The 1872 scheme provoked a boycott by well owners and
quickly fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller has been charged with cutting prices in one market
in order to block a competitor. He occasionally did that, Chernow
writes. But Rockefeller's main way of forestalling competitors was
to keep prices low everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Chernow writes, ``He was obsessed with high-volume, low-cost
production to maintain market share.'' In 1890, Rockefeller boasted
that in 20 years, kerosene had plunged from 23.5 cents a gallon at
retail to 7.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller didn't try to stamp out competitors so much as bring
them under one tent. A master competitor, he hated unruly
competition. Yet the opening of the first gas station in 1907
increased competition by vastly expanding the market.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, Shell was already challenging Standard's blue cans
with its red ones, which were filled with kerosene from Russia.
Sun, Texaco and Gulf were formed after the gusher at Spindletop,
Texas, in 1901. By 1911, when Standard Oil was broken up into what
now includes Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Arco and Conoco, its market
share had already slipped.
</P>
<P>
   It had, however, been dominant for years. Most of those who had
challenged it, including Tarbell's father, had cause to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason was Rockefeller himself. He was ``a matchless
executive,'' Chernow writes. A sponge of information, he was ``an
unerring monitor of the stream of proposals channeled to him
daily.'' He was a math whiz, and used numbers to ``cut through the
false claims of subordinates'' and impose rationality on the
farthest corners of his business.
</P>
<P>
   His success forestalled the plans of others. Whether they would
have developed the industry faster if he hadn't done it first is a
question ``that allows no easy answer,'' Chernow writes. All we can
say is that he did it and they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of Gates. One difference: Kerosene was a
commodity; Windows is a copyrighted product. That may make Gates's
position harder to break in the market, but easier to explain to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Gates also has a more favorable public. When Standard Oil was in
the dock, muckrakers and socialists had businessmen under withering
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Today, said Chernow to Fortune magazine, ``we are living through
a period that glorifies business heroes.'' The average American is
less likely to curse Microsoft than to buy shares in it.

   Cars that Open up to Computers, Literally &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, computers are on a collision course with cars.
On Dec. 5, the British journal New Scientist reported a new
automotive use for the infrared port on the popular Palm Pilot
handheld organizers.
</P>
<P>
   After modifying the Pilot to capture and retransmit infrared
signals from a television set, in an attempt to use the Pilot as a
replacement for the standard remote control device, a computer
journalist discovered that it could also duplicate the signals that
control some automobile security systems.
</P>
<P>
   After the owner locks the car using a remote control device
(typically on the keychain) and walks away, the Pilot could capture
the signal, send it back to the car and unlock the doors. According
to the Insurance Information Institute in New York, 23.5 percent of
all cars built in North America in 1997 had electronic anti-theft
systems, though many use radio waves, not infrared, systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilot represents a potentially cheaper alternative for those
auto thieves thinking of paying thousands of dollars for
black-market devices that perform similar tricks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper LA Weekly, some car thieves in Los
Angeles are using custom-made electronic devices the size of a
walkie-talkie that send out volleys of automobile security code
combinations. Thieves park near the target car and bombard it
electronically for a couple of minutes until the car's security
system chirps and the doors unlock.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, the Mercedes-Benz division of what is now
DaimlerChrysler Corp. warned that the electromagnetic radiation
generated by the microprocessors in mobile phones could disrupt the
computer circuitry in airbag restraint systems, anti-lock brake
systems and potentially other electronic systems in the car.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought talking on a cellular phone while driving was
dangerous. &QL;

   A Low-Tech Companion For High-Tech Goofing Off &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the low-tech innovation file comes a new way to evade the
snooping eyes of Big Brother, Corporate America, siblings, spouses
and all other off-line interlopers. It's a device known as ``Cyber
Eyes.'' So what exactly is this high-tech-era digital defender?
Nothing more than a rear-view mirror specially built to be affixed
to a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a corporate citizen who might be surfing the
Net rather than crunching a spreadsheet, or playing Minesweeper
instead of catering to a client, can check to see if the boss is
coming up quickly from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It prevents bad hair days, and it keeps you from getting
ambushed in your cubicle,'' said its creator, Ellen Hendin, the
Cleveland entrepreneur behind Cyber Eyes Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hendin meant the $4.99 mirror as a gag gift, but there has
been nothing funny about the strong sales, she said. Now Ms.
Hendin, a former financial securities analyst, has taken on the
business full time. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps We Should Be Amazed That It Can Surf the Web at All &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since 3Com announced its newest version of the popular Palm
Pilot, the Palm VII, it has been criticized by some users for
offering only limited Web access. That access, called Web
Clippings, allows Palm users to see updated, albeit abridged,
information from 22 corporate Web sites through a wireless
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sipher, director of wireless products for 3Com, of Santa
Clara, Calif., said the company had concluded that it would be too
costly and unwieldy to offer full Web access on its personal
digital assistant. ``Try hooking into the Web on a Windows CE
device,'' he said. ``It's a terrible, terrible experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The information available through Web Clippings is restricted to
that which is well suited for the Palm's small screen and very slow
access speed of 8 kilobits per second. For instance, Etrade will
allow access to stock quotes, but not trades; the Yahoo function
will allow telephone and address searches, and USA Today Online
will provide a digest of news and sports.
</P>
<P>
   The service is not designed to offer general Web access, nor is
it cheap. The wireless access will cost $9.99 a month for about 6
transactions a day, or $24.99 for up to 18 a day, Sipher said. &QL;

   Lowly PDA Stylus Is Going Multimedia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With personal digital assistants continuing to add more
functions, it was only a matter of time before some company decided
that the stylus _ that inkless pen used to write on and access data
from PDAs _ needed upgrading, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Corp., a pen maker, has joined a handful of smaller
companies in marketing styluses that aren't just styluses anymore.
The new-fangled Pentopia line, due out in stores in January,
combines a stylus, a ballpoint pen and, in one case, a pencil. This
triple-threat will sell for $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may want to get information with the stylus _ at times
they have to sign something and they turn around and there are no
pens available,'' said a company spokeswoman, Cindy Jecusco.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even now someone's working on a laptop tote bag that
doubles as a briefcase. &QL;

<P>
   Virgina Panel Recommends Tough New Penalties on Spam &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virginia will not be the first state to pass a law against mass
producers of electronic junk mail. But what the state lacked in
speed, it may make up with strength, and the impact could be
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   A commission appointed by Gov. Jim Gilmore has recommended
imposing criminal and civil penalties, including possible jail
terms, for sending spam using Internet service providers based in
Virginia. In an interview this week, Gilmore said that the
recommended penalties suited him just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a model for many other states,'' said the
governor, who has referred to Virginia as the ``Internet capital of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion from the panel, the Commission on Information
Technology, suggested extending the Virginia Computer Crimes Act to
cover people who sent spam using a Virginia ISP or who falsified
e-mail return addresses, harvested e-mail addresses from an ISP for
purposes of sending spam or sold spam software.
</P>
<P>
   Violators could be subject to fines of $500 per e-mail, and even
to criminal prosecution by the attorney general's office, Gilmore
said.
</P>
<P>
   That potential impact is large because Virginia is home to some
of the most widely used ISPs, including America Online. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-Line Journalists Meet to Form an Association &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A journalistic barn-raising of sorts took place in Chicago on
Friday, as new media reporters and newsroom expatriates hammered
together the framework of a new association of online journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to create an organization whose members would know
the languages and folkways of the old world and the new, and would
have high-bandwidth connections to both. Its members would ideally
help the online world understand journalism and help hidebound
journalists understand new media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new medium. We've got a lot to learn about how this
works,'' said Douglas B. Feaver of Washingtonpost.com. ``If you're
looking for a grand mission statment, you're ahead of where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   ` ``We're looking at the most difficult questions journalists
are facing in all mediums _ the question of journalistic standards
and how they should be applied and the question of how you maintain
peace in the family that has both a business and editorial side,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization came about when Rich Jaroslovsky, the managing
editor of The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, flipped
through his Rolodex earlier this fall and called the people with
whom he had been swapping war stories for months _ people like
Feaver, Jai Singh of C-Net's news.com, Bernard Gwertzman, editor of
The New York Times on the Web, Lynn Povich of MSNBC.com., Janice
Castro of Time Daily, Beau Brendler of ABCnews.com, Jamie Heller of
thestreet.com, Paul Maidment of The Financial Times' site, ft.com,
and a dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   Jaroslovsky said representatives of any online news
organizations missing from the inaugural gathering, particularly
online sports sites, were absent simply because they weren't in his
Rolodex and could join any time.

   Nice, but Can It Fix A Flat Tire When You Need It? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Microsoft Corp. and the Clarion Corp. introduced
the Auto PC, a Windows CE-based dashboard computer that uses voice
commands to control a digital radio, a CD player, a cellular phone
and a navigation system. It also uses voice synthesis to read
traffic reports, incoming e-mail and the driver's personal contact
directory.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto PC is currently available only in California and
Washington State, but Microsoft says it will soon be offered
nationwide as an option on high-end automobiles, with prices
starting at $1,299.

OUTAGE GROUNDS BUSY AIRPORT, BUT NOT FOR LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nobody was going anywhere. Planes couldn't take
off. Passengers couldn't check in. Baggage couldn't be picked up.
And there wasn't a caffe latte or toasted bagel to be had for any
price.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Francisco International Airport, when the lights went
out, the world stood still. The good news was that the delays
lasted less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A mistake made by a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. work crew shut
down a power substation in the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday
morning, triggering an outage that left 1 million people without
electricity for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like hospitals, the airport is deemed an essential facility,
meaning that restoring power there was a priority for PG&AMP;E and
other utilities, said Ron Wilson, the airport spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:10 a.m., less than an hour after a massive power outage hit
the city, the lights were back on, computers were humming, and all
was OK _ or as OK as things get at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has backup generators that kicked in as soon as the
first lights flickered, so the heart of the airport _ the
air-traffic control tower _ never lost radio contact with pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, San Francisco International is like a
miniature city, a microcosm of businesses and cars and public
transit and people. And the effect of the blackout on the airport
illustrates how much modern life relies on electricity and its
high-tech dependent, the computer.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco International consumes 15 million watts of
electricity every second. That adds up to a $20.2 million annual
electricity bill, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without power, baggage carousels and conveyor belts didn't work.
No computers meant passengers couldn't check in, get seat
assignments or change their ticketing. And the monitors showing
arrival and departure times were blank.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around the airport also was a hassle. With elevators,
escalators and people-movers out, there was no choice but to hoof
it, up and down stairs and through the interminable terminals.
</P>
<P>
   With the X-ray machines out at the security checkpoints,
passengers got the once-over with hand-wands and their carry-ons
were searched by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 40 planes sat stranded on runways, Wilson said. Some
had not fuel because the pumps run on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the air, traffic was slowed, and 18 planes were diverted
to other airports, Wilson said. But even those that landed couldn't
release passengers because those accordion bridges between the gate
and the plane door run on electric motors.

`THE ENDURANCE': ICE, WONDROUS EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (editors: publication notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To cross the Antarctic continent from the Weddell to the Ross
Sea on foot: in retrospect the project seems a little banal, maybe
because we've been spoiled by what exploration has accomplished in
the meantime. But to Sir Ernest Shackleton in 1914, the
trans-Antarctic hike was one of the last remaining prizes in
exploration. So writes Caroline Alexander in her stirring new
account, ``The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic
Expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   As Shackleton himself put it in the prospectus for his Imperial
Trans-Antarctic Expedition: ``It will be a greater journey than the
journey to the pole and back, and I feel it is up to the British
nation to accomplish this, for we have been beaten at the conquest
of the North Pole and beaten at the conquest of the South Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   To this end, he bought a 300-ton barquentine from a Norwegian
shipyard, renamed it Endurance after his family motto, ``By
endurance we conquer,'' manned it with a mixed company of officers,
scientists and seamen, 27 in all, and set off from England on Aug.
8, 1914, a week after World War I began.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable story of what happened to the expedition has been
told in several previous books, most notably in Shackleton's
classic account, ``South,'' published in 1919 to help defray the
cost of the project. Yet in Ms. Alexander's telling, the terrifying
details of the journey come as vividly to life as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ice conditions were unusually severe that year, with pack
extending farther north than it had in anyone's recollection.
Although Shackleton delayed his departure from South Georgia, an
island east of the Falklands, until Dec. 5, he was soon surrounded
by the sea ice that churned in an interminable clockwise circle in
the Weddell Sea. By Jan. 15 the Endurance was locked in, 80 miles
away, or a day's sail, from its port of destination to the south.
</P>
<P>
   As the pack ice bore the Endurance away to the north, it
squeezed harder and harder, eventually crushing it on Oct. 27 and
forcing its crew to abandon ship with its three lifeboats. For
another six months the men drifted northward on floes until the ice
began to break up. This permitted them to sail west in the most
adverse weather conditions and to land eventually on Elephant
Island, some 599 miles to the north of the Antarctic Peninsula and
as grim and hostile a piece of land as was possible to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no chance that anyone would ever find them
there, Shackleton took the desperate measure of picking five men
and trying to sail one of the 22-foot lifeboats to South Georgia,
which meant traveling 800 miles across the most formidable ocean on
earth, in winter. Miraculously, they succeeded, landing on the west
coast of South Georgia 16 days later in what was subsequently
ranked as one of the greatest boat journeys ever accomplished.
Trekking over the island's glaciers, Shackleton rejoined
civilization and set in motion the rescue of all 22 men on Elephant
Island, which was finally achieved four months after he had left
them.
</P>
<P>
   How has Ms. Alexander managed to retell Shackleton's adventure
so vividly? For one thing, she avails herself of all prior sources,
some of them unavailable until now. A travel writer and the author
of four previous books _ among them ``One Dry Season: Traveling in
Equatorial Africa'' and ``Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The
Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Bound Cat'' _ she
skillfully weaves together diary entries and memoirs so as to evoke
both the beauty and the terror of the Antarctic, the eerie
landscape of ice blocks piling up like sugar cubes, the sound of
emperor penguins crying soulfully as if lamenting the breakup of
the Endurance.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, Ms. Alexander has included 140 of the
photographs taken by Frank Hurley, who was enlisted by Shackleton
to create a visual record of the expedition. These photographs, by
turns abstractly beautiful and graphic, were stored in hermetically
sealed canisters that somehow survived the journey and have never
before been published comprehensively. They will be shown in an
exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History to open in
April 1999, with Ms. Alexander as the curator.
</P>
<P>
   The only distraction from her powerful narrative is one's
feeling of the absurdity of the venture, a nagging sense that the
only force to match Shackleton's heroism in bringing his men
through was his foolishness in having placed them at such risk in
the first place. Of course, what Ms. Alexander also makes clear is
that we are viewing the whole enterprise across the historical
divide of World War I, which brought to an end what the author
calls ``the Heroic Age of polar exploration'' and undermined faith
in all forms of human striving. (Britain's preoccupation with the
war explains why Shackleton took so long getting help to rescue his
men from Elephant Island and finally had to turn to the Chilean
government for a ship.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet if history distances Shackleton's exploits, Hurley's
photographs return them to immediacy. We can look into the eyes of
the men and recall how they described their feelings. One of them,
Thomas Orde-Lees, a marine captain, wrote in his diary after one
failed attempt by the crew to march over the ice pack, ``Were it
not for a little natural anxiety as to our ultimate progress I have
never been happier in my life than I am now, for is not this kind
of existence the `real thing,' the thing I have for years set my
heart on. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Ms. Alexander quotes Shackleton in ``South''
describing the end of his final trek across South Georgia: ``In
memories we were rich. We had pierced the veneer of outside things.
We had `suffered, starved and triumphed, groveled down yet grasped
at glory, grown bigger in the bigness of the whole.' We had seen
God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders. We had
reached the naked soul of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Such effusions of romantic agony combined with Hurley's
remarkably crisp visual record serve to collapse history into a
universal truth. What men will risk death for is any alternative to
boredom.

A SNUBBED TOM WOLFE PARRIES WITH 2 MEN OF LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From where did all this fury come? Could it simply be that two
of the most celebrated literary icons of our time, Norman Mailer
and John Updike, are jealous of Tom Wolfe? In their reviews, both
authors struggled mightily and not with tender heart to establish
that Wolfe's new best-selling novel, ``A Man in Full,'' was
guaranteed not to be literature. Entertainment, sometimes.
Journalism, probably. Art, certainly not.
</P>
<P>
   Which made many in book publishing ask who made Mailer and
Updike, granting their years of fruitful toil, the adjudicators of
what constitutes a literary work. Usually there is some ebullience
in literary feuds, in observing authors flaying each other with
gusto, but this one seems pretty dour, with a certain weediness
about it, and the only one enjoying himself appears to be Wolfe,
who is counting up the sales. Mailer and Updike apparently feel
that they have been pushed to defend some novelist autarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to take Mailer and Updike as a matched set,
and ask why are those old bones rising up to try and shoot down
this book,'' Wolfe said in an interview. ``It's because their own
works of the past few years have been sinking without a bubble.''
Now this is Wolfe's line, that there's envy in the land. Well,
there's no need to recall the many successes of Mailer and Updike
over the years, and there are others, besides the two writers, who
don't think ``A Man in Full'' is good. The reviews have ranged from
laudatory to mixed to terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bickering among the three has a yesteryear. In 1965,
Wolfe attacked The New Yorker and particularly mocked Updike, a
mainstay of that magazine; in 1973 he wrote that novelists who
didn't go out and report were, well, washed up. And in an essay in
Harper's magazine in 1989, subtitled ``A literary manifesto for the
new social novel,'' he reiterated that theme, writing that
``reporting is the most valuable and least understood resource
available to any writer with exalted ambitions.'' In short, he
wrote, great moments in literature often would have been
``impossible without that peculiar drudgery that Zola called
documentation.'' Or reporting, to use a less prissy word.
</P>
<P>
   So when ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) was
published in October, some of the literati were ready. After all,
Wolfe has yet to be voted into the American Academy of Arts and
Letters and therefore has not officially become an immortal despite
his many contributions to the American idiom.
</P>
<P>
   Updike, reviewing ``A Man in Full'' for The New Yorker, wrote
that though touched with ``its grand ambition,'' the novel ``still
amounts to entertainment, not literature, even literature in a
modest aspirant form.''
</P>
<P>
   Mailer, in a review in The New York Review of Books so lengthy
that one thought that perhaps, like Dickens, he was being paid by
the word, there was his usual spikiness, but also at times a
tutorial tone. He cautioned Wolfe not to be drugged by plot,
admonished him that he needed to learn, if he could, to create
interesting female characters, and added that he had to master the
skill of making characters grow through the events of the story,
flowing and rounding out to maturity.
</P>
<P>
   But all this seemed to be a cover for what perhaps most got
under Mailer's skin, that Wolfe had written another best-selling
novel after his ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mailer wrote: ``It is Tom Wolfe's best book by far, it begins to
promise that he is ready to become a great American novelist, and
then it loses its air and settles (with all the canniness of a
hard-nosed business judgment) for being a mega-best seller.''
</P>
<P>
   It follows, then, Mailer goes on, that ``at the highest level,
it's a failure _ at a more modest plateau (which is to say, at the
corrupt level), it is bound to prove a resounding success with its
large popular merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse even than that, and advanced by Mailer as a reason for the
book's literary failure, is that Wolfe is, uh-oh, a journalist. He
had been a good young reporter who was promoted to feature writer,
which meant, Mailer wrote, that he didn't ``form those novelistic
habits that are learned best when you are young.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget Defoe (considered in his time by many to be but a grub
street journalist), Thackeray, Balzac, Dickens, Dostoyevsky,
Dreiser, Mailer himself. To say nothing of Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John, who provided the research for Mailer's ``The Gospel According
to the Son'' (Random House, 1997). All did considerable reporting
at the behest of their literary calling. Wolfe pointed out that
Sinclair Lewis actually got in the pulpit and preached before he
felt ready to write ``Elmer Gantry.''
</P>
<P>
   So the gospel according to Wolfe is the issue of what he calls
``gullet'' writing versus exploration. ``It's time for writers to
realize that valid material is not consigned to what's in your
gullet,'' he said, adding that ``Emerson believed everyone had one
great autobiography to tell, but Emerson didn't say everyone had
two. You have to come up with things that unaided imagination
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Age is gnawing'' at Mailer and Updike, he continued, and his
own kind of novel is the future, and perhaps they are afraid of the
future. In fact, Wolfe's future novel is prologue, considering the
past practitioners of the art; he really is calling for a return to
the kind of social novels that went before. And in some ways his
criticism of Mailer, at any rate, is about as fair as some of
Mailer's criticism is about ``A Man in Full.'' Mailer does get
about.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what the whole debate is about is labeling. Is it
literature, entertainment, art or pop culture? Graham Greene called
his less serious novels ``entertainments.'' If he didn't, others no
doubt would have called them literature.
</P>
<P>
   What perhaps can only be truly said now about ``A Man in Full''
is that it's the one novel that people are clamoring to read. What
will be considered literature or entertainment 100 years from now
no one can know. When Dreiser's ``Sister Carrie'' was reissued 71
years ago (it received no recognition when it was first published
in 1900) The New York Times' review concluded with this line: ``It
is a book one can very well get along without reading.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Wolfe, watch out. His next novel is going to be about
education, he says; furthermore, he's going to do it in three years
and he's going to do a lot of reporting for it. It's a proud
tradition, the reporter-novelist. Even Louisa May Alcott, it seems,
got out of the house and into the street for research.

`THE WHOLE WORLD WAS WATCHING': DARK TO LIGHT IN 1968 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Whole World Was Watching'' is yet another 30th-anniversary
rundown of the tumultuous year of 1968, this one with an
inspirational spin. The familiar history _ of anti-Vietnam War
demonstrations, the Democratic political convention, the murders of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and other
events that shook the nation _ has been handled more searchingly on
other recent programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night is human-interest time, with Connie Chung and
Diane Sawyer applying the soft soap and squeezing out the tears and
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   They bring us an Army squad leader named Tom Corey who was
severely wounded in the Tet offensive and has become a leader in
the campaign for rights of the disabled; a peek into the diary of
Lady Bird Johnson written as her husband's time in the White House
was running out, and a view by Hubert Humphrey's son Skip of his
father's failed run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The happy news is that some of the anti-war radicals of the
time, blessedly forgotten now, are busying themselves with worthy
causes: David Mixner has moved through alcohol, drugs and
breakdowns to become ``something of a hero'' in the movement for
homosexual rights. Former Weathermen Bill Ayers and Bernardine
Dohrn say they are working to help children.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour compilation, produced by Paul and Holly Fine, ends
on a poignant note with Lloyd Bucher, the naval commander who
surrendered his intelligence ship, the Pueblo, to North Korea and
was forced under the threat of having his crew tortured to
announce, ``We are criminals who committed hostile acts.'' In the
upbeat spirit of ``The World Was Watching,'' this episode ends with
Bucher and his crew members cheering one another.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that I cannot explain, the program, which has its
moving moments, ends with the Apollo 8 mission. Ms. Sawyer or her
script reports: ``The darkness of 1968 was receding at last. The
courage of Apollo turned us toward light, the promise of a more
merciful future.'' Like much of the rest of this where-are-they-now
exercise, it doesn't tell much about either past or future, but
maybe some will find it heartening.

   The easiest way to create a free home page is through community
sites like www.tripod.com, www.geocities.com or www.angelfire.com.
America Online and most other Internet service providers also offer
free home pages.
</P>
<P>
   But your free personal Web site will probably have a complicated
address and be only a few megabytes. And your host will probably
put ads on your pages.
</P>
<P>
   But you can register an available domain name at internic.net
for an annual fee of $75, as I did. ISPs like Earthlink, AT&AMP;T
Worldnet and Mindspring will do all of the above for you for a
monthly fee starting around $20.
</P>
<P>
   To design the site, software tools are available through
community sites. I used Microsoft Frontpage ($140) and bought the
book ``Frontpage 98, Fast and Easy,'' by Coletta Witherspoon (Prima
Publishing, $16.99).
</P>
<P>
   An inexpensive way to spice up your Web site with pictures is to
scan in ordinary photographs, which can be done at many copying
centers or photo-processing shops.
</P>
<P>
   Digital audio is a nice addition and relatively accessible; to
use the one built into Windows, go to Programs, then Accessories,
then Multimedia, then Sound Recorder. Keep the sound clip short,
save the file, and add it to your site. I rigged our Web site to
open with my son's voice saying, ``Welcome to my Web site.''

   ``One Shenandoah Winter''
</P>
<P>
   By T. Davis Bunn
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, $12.99
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of life we are in death.'' You wouldn't think
that phrase from the Book of Common Prayer could serve as the theme
for a pair of short holiday novels, but Christmas has long been a
season for surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is terribly befuddling for a relaxed Baptist like
myself,'' Richard Lee thinks in the opening pages of ``Epiphany.''
It's a bit of an understatement, considering that he has just
dropped dead near his house in the small town of Peabody.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCusker's title proves to have been well-chosen, as
Richard ``haunts'' the members of his family and their memories,
and as all parties involved learn how flawed their knowledge of one
another has been. Each of the three adult children gradually comes
to grips with an inner struggle: Jonathan with his frustrated
creativity, Ruth with her failures in the big city, and David with
his cynical misunderstanding of his father's life.
</P>
<P>
   McCusker's story is simple, simply written and not overly
sentimental _ perhaps just the proper comfortable prelude for a
long winter's nap.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a glance at the dust jacket of ``One Shenandoah
Winter'' might send visions of the Currier-and-Ives era dancing in
one's head. And yes, T. Davis Bunn's latest novel is traditional _
but it's not THAT tradition.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1961, and Connie Wilkes _ assistant mayor of the
Appalachian town of Hillsboro, Va. _ has problems. Not only has a
friend's vibrant daughter taken up with a man for whom Wilkes has
little use, but the community's new, handsome and desperately
needed doctor is as prickly as a pine-cone mattress. Connie soon
learns the reason behind Dr. Nathan Reynolds' anger, even as the
physician begins to work his way through it _ but not without a
sorrow that still has its redemptive qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Shenandoah Winter'' ends with a striking baptismal scene,
although its subject seems to be a long time getting there. Bunn's
book mirrors McCusker's in its simplicity, although Bunn plays more
spiritedly on the chords of emotion and evangelism. Neither empty
sugarplums nor theologically heavy turkey-and-dressing,
``Epiphany'' and ``One Shenandoah Winter'' may provide readers with
something to chew on during the holidays.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Away from the clattering miniature electric trains
and the twinkling Christmas tree tickling the glass roof of the
Enid Haupt Conservatory came a moment of truth: ``It smells like
winter out here,'' said Ashali Bhandari, 7, of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It should have: She was looking at the Winter Solstice Garden at
the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, where freshly cut
branches of 100 spruce trees have been made into furry hedges and
carpets outdoors at the entrance to the Palm Dome. Worked into the
intricate display of more than 20 outsize evergreen chessmen,
medieval jousting standards and fat Russian hats are enough silver
reindeer moss and pungent blueberry juniper berries for Santa's
team to browse on all winter.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on a hedge are 40 gleaming balls. Not the usual colored
glass, they are darkly streaked like marbled halvah and nestle down
heavily in the spruce branches. In fact, they are solid onyx. Gary
Barnum and his collaborators from Cooperstown, N.Y., who put this
winter garden together, call them the ``fallen apples.'' Think
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   For five years Barnum, Timothy Gill and Tony Costanzo, who call
themselves Fernleigh Productions, have decorated Cooperstown for
the winter holidays as part of their horticultural beautification
program for the Clark Foundation there. This year they are
displaying their work in New York at the invitation of the garden's
director, Gregory Long. Planning began in January.
</P>
<P>
   Their style, based on the classical orders of architecture,
looks more like phantasmagoric green sculpture than holiday
decoration. The challenge was how to adapt small-town porch and
pediment ornaments to the larger scale of the botanical garden,
particularly the imposing glass and iron conservatory, with its
daytime glitter and evening glow.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen pear trees, each 22 feet tall and twined with 1,800
lights, frame other treasures, including the garden's focal point,
a five-tier, 12-foot topiary tree with elaborately jeweled mosaic
surfaces of red and brown fruits, nuts, ferns and dried flowers.
Its radial geometry echoes that of the nearby huge glass house, and
the tree is so firmly proportioned it holds the eye despite the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aim for amplitude,'' Barnum said, patting his little David
of a tree, ``and with the conservatory ballooning up behind, we
wanted to give the effect of lift and motion.'' They have done that
by dividing the five tiers in wedges, suggesting a liftoff. Barnum
calls it the ``Gozzoli tree,'' after the Renaissance artist who in
the mid-15th century included startling topiary trees studded with
fruit in the otherwise naturalistic landscape of his mural ``The
Journey of the Magi'' in the Medici-Riccardi chapel in Florence,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The same surreal segue from nature into fantasy and back happens
in the Winter Solstice Garden. Beech leaves rustle in the taller
standards just as they do in the botanical garden woods, where
sweet-gum balls inlaid in the mosaics were collected from trees
last year. The all-natural artifice in the solstice garden
contrasts with the nature around it.
</P>
<P>
   Barnum makes winter darkness a pleasure: At dusk, only the pear
trees are brightly lighted. Elsewhere, tiny spotlights pick out the
hand-forged iron standards and strap work. Tinsel is forbidden, but
lead, it turns out, makes a gleaming holiday decoration, as do
brass chains from a jewelers' supply store cut into three-inch
golden danglers that tremble enticingly on the Gozzoli tree.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If your idea of a social evening is to call tech support, you
might want to consider celebrating at least part of the holiday
season online. Beyond shopping, the Net has:
</P>
<P>
   _ Advent calendars. These countdowns to Christmas, with the
little windows that children used to open to get candy or see a
picture, are all over the Web. Choose from animated, musical,
Episcopal or German-American Advent calendars 
(www.yahoo.com/societyandculture/holidays/christmas/adventcalendars/
) or one that has a different cookie recipe for each day before
Christmas (www.cookierecipe.com/cat/christmas.asp).
</P>
<P>
   _ Holiday cards. The folks, or actually the software at
americangreetings.com/index.pd, will send e-mail greetings and
arrange for cards to be delivered via snail mail to friends who
don't have modems, the sort who waste good online time outside
singing Christmas carols.
</P>
<P>
   _ An online menorah. You can find out how many lights to light
each day of Hanukkah at torah.org/chanukah.html. (Add one if you
view the site from Australia.) The site also offers this advice:
``Note! Rabbinic authorities agree: You can't fulfill the Mitzvah
by looking at a computer screen!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Letters to Santa. Kids can write to Santa at emailsanta.com.
For parents worried about their children's writing to strangers
online, the site doesn't require much personal information, just a
first name, age, city and state, so Santa can reply (an e-mail
address is optional).
</P>
<P>
   _ Carols. At rememberjosie.org/xmas/toc.html, there are lyrics
and tunes for 77 old favorites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Live cameras. You can see the Christmas market in Nuremburg,
Germany, at www.christkindlesmarkt.de/live/elivecam1.html, or check
out Rockefeller Center, at www.ftna.com/ cents.cgi.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kwanzaa events. The calendar at the Kwanzaa Information Center
(new.melanet.com/apps/calendar/calendar.cgi) includes
Kwanzaa-related events across the country.
</P>
<P>
   _ Script. Need to stage a Christmas pageant? Download the script
at ccvp.com/hatfield/CAPNSLA.TXT.
</P>
<P>
   _ For Web treasure-hunters, there is a contest on at
excape.excite.com/howto.html to piece together clues to figure out
where on earth Excite's correspondent Mike Cerre is during his
search for the origins of holiday traditions. The top prize: a trip
around the world for two.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twelve Days of Commerce. At
www.pncbank.com/12days/cardindex.html, you can learn the cost of
the gifts My True Love Gave to Me. ``In a significant triumph in
the age-old wage dispute among the sexes, the song's nine ladies
dancing received a wage increase to $3,932.72 or 20.69 percent,
this year, moving their salaries ahead of the carol's men, the 10
lords-a-leaping, 11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming (based
on the assumption that during medieval times, when the song was
written, pipers and drummers were male).''

WAAAY COOL GIFTS FOR WAAAY KEWL GRRRLS
</HEADLINE>
 (for use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year, the Barbie Dream House does it for them. The next,
it's all over. Your little girl has metamorphosed into a
peer-pressured, fashion-forward,
way-too-cool-to-be-seen-at-the-mall-with-you, picky preteen.
</P>
<P>
   And although pandering to pre-pubescent whims isn't a parenting
path worth considering, a certain challenge arises during the
holiday season: We want our kids to be happy. We want to give them
gifts they'll like. Which brings us to the great question, which
even Freud was unable to answer: What exactly does a little diva
want?
</P>
<P>
   To help us with this timeless quandary, we turned this season to
the experts in all things kewl: the editorial gurus of our nation's
top teen magazines.
</P>
<P>
   For parents searching for a clue: our look at the top 10 trends
for young girls who love glam.
</P>
<P>
   1. Makeup is all about glitter. ``Anything glittery and sparkly
with makeup is hot,'' says Dawn Yoselowitz, senior market editor at
``Seventeen,'' who adds that silver nail polish would make a good
stocking stuffer. At ``Teen'' magazine, Beth Lawrence, senior
market editor, says the look of the moment is bright colors ``in
long strips of glitter and big hunks of sparkle.'' In the
magazine's December issue, this translates into models boasting
silvery mascara (like Revlon StreetWear in Chill or Lancome Mascara
in Frost), shimmery metallic eye shadows (try Revlon Custom Eyes in
Iced Silver), and toenails alternatively bedecked in shades of
silver and gold. U.K. teen mag ``Sugar'' takes the look to
extremes: Beauty editors suggest applying bright-pink lipstick,
coating heavily with lip gloss and then pressing on loose glitter,
in pink, from art shops and stationers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pajamas are big news. Maybe it's the Ally McBeal inspiration.
Big and baggy men's-style pj's are hot. ``There's a cherry print in
the Alloy catalog that is the cutest thing I've ever seen,''
Lawrence says. ``And Delia's catalog has a snowflake print that's
great.'' ``YM'' editors give their nod to the look with a pair of
clothes-print pj's from GapKids in its current ``Groovy gifts for
$20 or less'' feature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Hair matters. ``Give a flowerpot full of little jeweled hair
pins shaped like bugs,'' suggests Lawrence, ``or try the red and
green hair elastiques (translation: headbands) with sassy French
sayings _ Fantastique! _ from Frederic Fekkai.'' Yoselowitz
suggests barrettes (again, think sparkly, glittery, and pink!, or
little butterflies) _ ``they're really into those these days.''
California-based Moxie Girl, a new hybrid ``magalog'' or
``catazine'' features a gardenful of jeweled hair clips, including
butterflies, flowers and bugs.
</P>
<P>
   4. Girls just wanna wacky wake-up call. ``In our January issue,
we feature of bunch of funny alarm clocks,'' says Yoselowitz.
``Like one in the shape of a pineapple, one that looks like Lego
pieces, and one out of a can of Spam.'' Lawrence suggests looking
for the Roxy brand: ``Their hula girl would, like, really cheer you
up in the morning.'' Other time-keeping ideas: ``really cool
watches like the pastel pink and blue ones from G Shock,'' suggests
Yoselowitz; and the editors at the new ``Girl'' magazine like Mine
Design magnetic clocks for your daughter's locker (which they found
at L.A.'s Pickett Fences where, gasp, Calista Flockhart shops!).
</P>
<P>
   5. They like to bag it. Day or night, small beaded handbags _ in
velvet or satin _ are the scene-stealers this year. For school, go
with a more durable and fun messenger bag, says Yoselowitz, who
offers this advice on what to look for: a big, long strap, a
rectangular shape, and a big flap in the front. (Our hint: try Old
Navy.)
</P>
<P>
   6. Room stuff rocks. ``Beaded curtains used to be big,'' says
Lawrence, ``but the car-wash curtain is new _ it's plastic and it
comes in all different colors.'' Lawrence says she saw one recently
that has inserts where your daughter can put photos of friends, or
even stash jewelry. ``It's like a wallpaper you can take off and
update,'' she says. Also kewl: CD holders in fun colors, picture
frames, plastic blow-up furniture, and sheets and pillowcases in
prints such as butterfly patterns.
</P>
<P>
   7. Shoes should have attitude. ``Birkenstocks come in wool
now,'' says Yoselowitz, ``and they're a great item to have.'' For
the more princessy preteen, Lawrence says the Prada-inspired loafer
is modern and minimalistic.
</P>
<P>
   8. Tiaras aren't just for nighttime anymore. We had trouble
believing this one, but a recent trip to sorority-sister-favorite
Cotton Island in Dallas convinced us that the kids today really are
wearing these. Look for silver headbands with rhinestones and
feathers. ``You can wear them to school with jeans and a T-shirt,''
assures Yoselowitz. ``You can totally get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Beading is the best. Again, this traditionally formal look
gives a twist to casual styles. ``A beaded cardigan could be
vintage or new,'' says Lawrence. ``Pastels are really popular, but
follow the person's tastes. Black is a great option.'' Also: Look
for beading detail on dresses and bags.
</P>
<P>
   10. Gift certificates rock. ``So cool,'' says Lawrence.
Suggestions from the front lines on where to get 'em: movie
theaters (so kids can catch the latest Leonardo flick), Contempo
clothing stores, Gadzooks, Claire's, beauty salons (where they can
get their toenails done), bookstores and Blockbuster. Or try one of
the newish teen catalogs, where they can find all the trends fit to
print: Delia's, (800) 335-4217, www.delias.com; Alloy, (888)
552-5569, www.alloyonline.com; Brat (800) 598-5264,
www.bratcatalog.com; or catazine Moxie Girl (888) MOX-STUF,

`UNDERGROUND MAN' FLED ITALIAN DRUG SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the clock ticking toward eviction, underground man Thomas
Johnson said Wednesday he will not provoke a confrontation when
Nantucket authorities come to remove him from his 8-foot-deep home.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm not going to make a standoff,'' Johnson said. ``I'll move
when they tell me to move. But I'll stay in here as long as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   A Nantucket deputy sheriff served Johnson with a 30-day eviction
notice Saturday at his secluded hideaway on a Boy Scout camp. If he
does not leave by that time, Johnson said, the eviction notice
states that the Nantucket district of the Boy Scouts will go to
court to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   Bertyl Johnson Jr., a Nantucket lawyer who represents the local
Scouts in this matter, did not return phone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Johnson said the eviction notice represents a change by
the Scouts, who apparently did not know he had been living for 10
years in a remote part of Camp Richard until a deer hunter stumbled
on the home's stovepipe several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   One island official familiar with the situation said the Scouts
had been willing to let Johnson remain on the property through the
winter. But when the news media last week wrote of Johnson's
elaborately furnished, three-room home, the Nantucket Scouts felt
pressured to speed up the eviction process, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Scout executive Michael Riley of the Cape and Islands Council,
which includes Nantucket, said he had been unaware of Johnson's
presence at Camp Richard until last Thursday. Scouting officials on
the island, he said, ``are going to do what has to be done and
whatever's the right thing to do in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' Riley continued, ``they're trying to show
some compassion and dignity for Tom Johnson in accordance with the
three points of the Scout code: to be courteous, friendly, and
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Johnson said, local support for him has been
heartening. ``It's incredible,'' added Johnson, who created a
subterranean life on Nantucket after fleeing an Italian prison
sentence for heroin smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The two years he spent in a Rome prison changed his life,
Johnson said, and led him to an underground existence where he
could strengthen himself morally and avoid the chafing routine he
sees in mainstream living.
</P>
<P>
   Italian authorities confirmed this week that Johnson fled the
country in 1985, following 26 months in a Rome prison and one month
of subsequent house arrest on a heroin-smuggling conviction.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian law enforcement official, who did not wish to be
identified, said authorities had not known if Johnson was still
alive. &UR;  &LR; The prospect of extradition is not high, he said, because
the United States generally does not return one of its citizens on
such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was apprehended at the Rome airport in May 1983
while attempting to smuggle 2 kilograms of Thai heroin into Italy
via Amsterdam. The heroin had a street value of $2.6 million at the
time, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was to have been paid $10,000 for stashing the
heroin, stitched into a suitcase, in a locker at the Rome train
station. The trip was his third in Europe as a heroin courier,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Other details about Johnson's past also have been confirmed,
including statements that his father was a city judge in
Binghamton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   According to Broome County historian Gerald Smith, Johnson was
one of seven children born to William H. Johnson Jr., a prominent
arts supporter, judge, and municipal official who resigned from the
Binghamton Housing Authority after he alleged there had been
political interference in tenant selection.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Johnson served as city judge from 1959 to 1962. He
also had been chairman of the Tri-Cities Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Johnson said his father died in his arms, of liver and
colon cancer, in 1981. The family fell apart after the death,
Johnson said.

A ROCKETTES-STYLE CHRISTMAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rockettes dancer Anne Mason's Christmas job has
legs _ 40 of them.
</P>
<P>
   As a performer with the mighty 20-member dance troupe known for
its world-famous kick line, Mason is looking forward to bringing a
Gotham holiday tradition to sunny Los Angeles for 40 performances
at the Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Universal is a concert hall, so the logistics of putting
on the Rockettes was a challenge,'' explains Houston-bred Mason, a
Rockette for almost eight years. ``So many brilliant minds were at
work, especially in terms of making room for everything
backstage.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of 55 includes the high-stepping Rockettes, 22 singers
and dancers, four children, two ice skaters and Santa Claus _ plus
a dog, three camels, five sheep and two donkeys.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the amphitheatre stage had to be nearly doubled by the
use of an annex that extends out the back of the venue. On a recent
visit to rehearsals, 30 truckloads of props, costumes and staging
materials were in use as the production came together under the
expert eye of director-choreographer Linda Haberman, who has worked
with the Rockettes since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Radio City Rockettes' ``Christmas Spectacular'' opened
Wednesday and runs through Dec. 29 at the Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   When the curtain goes up, you can expect to see a nonstop
extravaganza of colorful costumes, high-kicking routines, holiday
music, animals, Santa, elves, dancing snowmen and baby bears
featuring a cast of more than 100 actor-dancers performing in
what's billed as the world's biggest Christmas show. Classic
holiday numbers among the show's 10 scenes include ``Parade of the
Wooden Soldiers,'' ``Carol of the Bells'' and ``Living Nativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular,'' which premiered at
Radio City Music Hall in 1933, is known as the most successful live
theatrical production in the nation, grossing a record-setting $68
million in 1997. Last year, five simultaneous productions were seen
by more than 1.7 million people in New York; Chicago; Detroit;
Branson, Mo.; and Myrtle Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a three-year process bringing the Rockettes to Los
Angeles,'' said Alex Hodges, senior vice president of Universal
Concerts. ``Some of the questions we asked were: Can it work in a
warm climate, in a city this spread out? We had to wrestle with the
issue of, will this work in a city where you can play golf in
December, in a city that doesn't have four distinct seasons?''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the transformation from concert hall to Rockettes
launching pad, the seating capacity of the amphitheatre was scaled
down from 6,200 to 3,400. Sightlines from the very last row to the
stage are now just 130 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This production is bigger and better than any of the other
traveling Rockettes shows,'' said ``Christmas Spectacular''
producer David Nash. ``And we needed a lot of room to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The original concept of the Rockettes dance line was to achieve
absolute precision, as if the dancers were moving as one.
Everything _ height, costumes and steps _ were kept identical. The
illusion of uniform height is maintained by putting the tallest
dancers in the center and gradually decreasing the height until the
shortest women are at either end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really feel you are part of history,'' Rockette Mason
said. ``To be part of that tradition _ that's why it's a such a
thrill.''

RUFF TRIES TO TORPEDO CHARGE OF PERJURY AGAINST CLINTON  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff abandoned his
customary behind-the-scenes approach Wednesday to wage a public
campaign to sidetrack House Judiciary Committee preparations to
vote articles of impeachment against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, urging an outcome sought by the White House, told the
panel that the president is ``looking for an end to this process''
with a speedy congressional vote of censure imposed upon the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it does not advance the public weal to drag it out
further,'' Ruff said. ``We are open to any reasonable suggestion
from any side as a way of finding an end to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old lawyer climaxed the White House's two-day legal
and public relations offensive before the committee with a
relentless recitation of facts and arguments designed to scuttle
the articles of impeachment being weighed by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans released four draft articles of impeachment before
Ruff completed his testimony. Two articles accused Clinton of
perjury, one cited alleged obstruction of justice and one cited
alleged abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats quickly countered with a proposal to censure
Clinton for ``reprehensible conduct'' with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. Democrats vowed to insist upon Clinton's
signature on the instrument of his censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No person is above the law and the president remains subject
to criminal and civil penalties for this conduct,'' the Democrats'
proposal said.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-member panel is expected to approve one or more articles
of impeachment by week's end. The vote would set the stage for a
vote on impeachment by the full House next week _ action that could
refer the matter to the Senate for the first impeachment trial
since the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said Clinton's misleading statements in legal proceedings
since his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
came to light fall short of federal prosecution or the gravity
required to justify impeachment by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's misstatements in a civil deposition and before a
federal grand jury were either unintentional or irrelevant or in
response to an ambiguous question, Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be the rule, to add to an old phrase, that `Close
only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades and perjury,''' Ruff
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff appealed for each committee member to ask: ``Am I prepared
to impeach the president because, after having admitted to having
engaged in egregiously wrongful conduct, he falsely described the
particulars of that conduct?''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, a former Watergate prosecutor and long-time partner in a
Washington law firm, offered lawmakers the preferred White House
response: ``The answer must be no.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, who uses a wheelchair because of paralysis from polio
contracted on a youthful trip to Africa, offered a contrast to the
telegenic style of White House lawyer Gregory Craig, who appeared
on the president's behalf on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff painstakingly tried to build a record that Clinton didn't
commit perjury and that he didn't deserve impeachment for his
actions in the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're obviously the president's clean-up hitter,'' Rep. F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., told Ruff at the outset of several
hours of questions and answers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff ducked repeated questions about whether Clinton had
``lied'' about his conduct in his January deposition in the Paula
Jones' civil lawsuit and in his Aug. 17 videotaped testimony before
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff stuck with the phrasing offered repeatedly by Craig the day
before _ that Clinton had ``misled'' the legal proceedings,
admitted doing so and has apologized for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between misleading and lying?'' inquired
Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C. ``You like the word misleading better than
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., bluntly told Ruff: ``I believe the
elements of perjury are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., told Ruff: ``I believe when the
president gave those answers he was lying. I am concerned that
we're still not getting straight talk and the truth.''

</P>
<P>
   For Ruff, appearing before a congressional panel for
afternoon-long nationally broadcast testimony was a long way from
his preferred method of dealing with clients' legal difficulties
away from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   A partner in the prestigious law firm of Covington &AMP; Burling,
Ruff has the reputation of working off stage to negotiate graceful
exits for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff worked a deal five years ago to enable Sen. Charles Robb,
D-Va., son-in-law of the late President Lyndon Johnson, to appear
at the last minute before a grand jury investigating his Senate
office's acquisition of an illegally recorded tape of a phone call
by a political rival. Robb's appearance helped persuade the grand
jury not to return an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff also steered clear of the limelight in working to extricate
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, from the legal repercussions stemming form
the scandal surrounding savings-and-loan owner Charles Keating.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, a graduate of Swarthmore College and Columbia Law School,
joined the White House as Clinton's fifth counsel in January 1997.
A former attorney for the government in the District of Columbia,
Ruff had been considered for the No. 2 post at the Justice
Department at the outset of the Clinton administration but he was
selected after questions arose over his failure to pay Social
Security taxes for a semi-retired household worker.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Susan Lee, who just passed the bar exam and
works in a law office, stayed at work even though there was no
electricity in the building.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, one elevator was operating on a generator, but
when she looked out the window, she could see two window washers
stuck high on the outside of the Maritime Plaza Building, unable to
move their power-operated perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were there in one spot for two or three hours,'' Lee
said. ``That one window got pretty clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside her building it was a little dark and a little cold, she
said. Oh, and the toilets wouldn't flush without power. ``They
could get the elevator going, but not the toilets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A mistake made by a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. work crew shut
down a power substation in the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday
morning, triggering an outage that left 1 million people without
electricity for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people tried to look at the bright side of the
situation. ``The power outage doesn't bother me. I can't see
anyway,'' said Johnny Serrano, a blind musician.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan van Rijn, a sophomore at Lowell High School, said the
power failure had given him and his friends the bright idea of
going to Baskin Robbins for ice cream after school. ``We were
hoping they would give us some free ice cream, that maybe it would
be melting, but that turned out not to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more than a few students waiting in line hoping for
the same thing, ``but they ended up paying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who were locked out of their offices flocked to nearby
taverns.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the morning hour, Harrington's Irish Bar on
Front Street became a lively, noisy center of conviviality, though
only dimly lighted.
</P>
<P>
   Among those gathered around a table was Don Querio, a lawyer
with Sevrson &AMP; Werson, who had fled his office. ``There is very
little in the way of lights and no water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And how was it that Harrington's remained an island of light
while all around it, including a McDonald's next door, remained in
darkness? ``God must be an Irishman,'' Kathleen Harrington said
with a laugh, admitting she didn't really know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Avid morning gym goers also suffered through the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Ostrofsky emerged from the Nikko Hotel Health Club
shortly after 9 a.m., his hair was wet. The club's hair dryers had
ceased to function along with the club's sauna, its Jacuzzi
whirlpool, its stair climber and its treadmill machines.
</P>
<P>
   Showers were operating for those who didn't mind showering in
the dark, with only cold water.
</P>
<P>
   The rowing machines worked, said Wes Tanaka, the club's chief
trainer. ``They operate on human power.''

BRITAIN TAKES FIRST STEP TOWARD EXTRADITION OF PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's Home Secretary Wednesday turned down Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's plea to be set free, ruling that a Spanish
extradition case against the former Chilean dictator can could go
forward in English courts.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old general now faces an indefinite stay in England
as the case proceeds. In the first step of the legal process, he
must appear Friday at a hearing on a Spanish petition to have him
stand trial in Madrid on charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   While any extradition remains a long time and many legal twists
and turns away, the decision on Wednesday was a significant step
that brought exuberant cheers from the general's enemies and angry
denunciations from his backers.
</P>
<P>
   In a diplomatic protest, the Chilean government immediately
recalled its ambassador to London, Mario Artaza, explaining, ``It
is to give more information and is also a gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw, the British government's law
enforcement minister, issued the decision in a brief statement. ``I
signed an Authority to Proceed in respect of Senator Pinochet
today,'' he said. ``The Spanish request for his extradition will
now be considered by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, coming two days before Friday's deadline, dashed
the hopes of Pinochet's supporters and the Chilean government that
Straw would put an end to the extraordinary case and let him return
to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that outcome, the general's opponents were in court
Wednesday afternoon seeking to delay Pinochet's departure to allow
them to file an appeal keeping the case open. They lost that effort
in London's High Court, but minutes later Straw's announcement made
the matter moot.
</P>
<P>
   Straw had been weighing Pinochet's fate since the five Law Lords
of the House of Lords, England's highest court, ruled on Nov. 25
that he did not enjoy immunity from arrest as a former head of
state and could be held in England while the extradition request
was considered. It was Straw's task to judge the validity of the
Spanish claim.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A one-time student activist who took part in anti-Pinochet
rallies 25 years ago, Straw had said he was acting in a
``quasi-judicial'' capacity and would base his decision on the law
and not on any political consideration. Friends and foes of the
verdict chose to see it according to their own convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups hailed it as a victory against tyrants and
noted that it came a day before the 50th anniversary of the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ``This is a
wonderful birthday present,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director of
Human Rights Watch. ``The wall of impunity which Pinochet built in
Chile by force of arms is being torn down by international law and
the political will of the world community.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a friend and
supporter of Pinochet, described Straw's action as a ``grave
mistake,'' saying, ``He had ample power to put an end to this
shameful and damaging episode. He has chosen instead to prolong it.
Neither he nor the government can hide behind legal posturing. This
was a political decision, and it represents a failure of political
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, leader of the Conservative Party, said it was a
``cowardly decision and instead of doing the right thing, he has
given in to activists within the Labor Party and to his own
prejudices from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   British law is generous in allowing appeals of the periodic
steps in a lengthy process like extradition, and the Pinochet case
could work its way back up to the House of Lords for future
judgments. The final move to extradite requires another decision
from Straw once all the legal remedies have been exhausted, and
legal experts have said it would probably be more than a year
before Pinochet could face an order to go to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-page written reply to a parliamentary question in
which he detailed his reasoning, Straw said he could not sustain
the charges of genocide and murder in the petition because they did
not fit the legal definitions of extraditable crimes under
Britain's Extradition Act of 1989. He said, however, that he was
able to match the accusations by a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon,
with equivalent British criminal charges of attempted murder,
conspiracy to murder, torture, conspiracy to torture,
hostage-taking and conspiracy to take hostages.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Addressing the other issues he said he was legally bound to
consider, Straw said he did not find that Pinochet was entitled to
sovereign immunity, that the charges against him were not ``of a
political character,'' that the length of time since the alleged
offenses did not make trying them now ``unjust'' and that
Pinochet's health did not call into question his fitness to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had considered claims by the Chilean government that
Pinochet might stand trial in Chile but noted he did not ``consider
the possibility of a trial in Chile to be a factor which outweighs
the U.K.'s obligations under the European Convention on Extradition
to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain.'' In Chile, Pinochet is a
senator for life, a title that among other things gives him
immunity from prosecution there.

   In a final segment entitled ``other factors,'' Straw said he had
listened to arguments about the possible effect of extradition on
``the stability of Chile and its future democracy'' and on ``the
U.K. national interest'' and had concluded that neither amounted to
``sufficient grounds'' to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office said Wednesday night that for reasons of
security Friday's hearing had been moved from Bow Street
Magistrates Court in downtown London to Belmarsh Magistrates Court
in south London. Belmarsh is a maximum security court next to a
prison where cases of suspected international terrorists are
generally heard.
</P>
<P>
   cc Spokesmen for Kingsley Napley, the law firm representing
Pinochet, declined to comment on whether it was considering an
emergency application for High Court review of Straw's decision,
which might put off the Friday hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court earlier Wednesday rebuffed an emergency bid by
Amnesty International for an order to keep Pinochet here in the
event Straw's ruling had freed the general to leave. A Chilean Air
Force plane has been at Brize Norton Royal Air Force Base in
Oxfordshire for two months prepared to fly the general home
immediately upon his release from custody.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Justice Simon Brown said, ``Here the proposed and intended
effect of any interim relief would be to reimpose physical
restraint on someone whom the home secretary on any putative
decision will have freed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, a self-declared Anglophile, has made a number of
visits here in recent years without incident. He arrived this time
on Sept. 21 and was treated as a VIP by the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered back pains during the flight to Britain from
Santiago, and a doctor recommended immediate surgery. The operation
took place on Oct. 9 and he was recuperating in the London Clinic
when he was arrested on Oct. 16. He is now staying in a
nine-bedroom rented house in an exclusive residential enclave
called the Wentworth Estate, in Virginia Water, Surrey.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise action was brought by Garzon as part of his
investigation of human rights atrocities committed during the
``dirty wars'' of the 1970s and 1980s in Latin America. In his
charge, Garzon held Pinochet responsible for the deaths or
disappearances of more than 3,000 people after he seized power in a
1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28 London's High Court ruled unanimously that Pinochet
had immunity from arrest as a former head of state. The court
ordered him to stay in England until the outcome of an appeal
brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. It was a matter of some
surprise when the House of Lords overturned that decision on Nov.
25, leading to the ruling Wednesday.

 &HT;    CLINTON DEFENDERS JOIN IN DISAPPROVAL
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two days, lawyers and professors came to defend
President Clinton in the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But for viewers tuning into the proceedings, their tone may have
been baffling, since some of the harshest criticism of the
president came from his own camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the president nor anyone speaking on his behalf will
defend the morality of his personal conduct,'' White House chief
counsel Charles Ruff said Wednesday in remarks much like those made
a day earlier by presidential counsel Greg Craig.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., inserted a reminder to
viewers that the panel of witnesses ``are all called by his lawyers
to testify in his favor.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even Democrats on the committee repeatedly registered
their disapproval of the president. ``Let me again clearly state
that I find the president's behavior unacceptable and morally
wrong,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Clinton's defenders used their condemnation to
highlight a central point: that such behavior and the president's
attempt to conceal it do not meet the constitutional ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' standard for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most positive remarks about the president came from
a Republican, former Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, called as
a last-minute addition to the president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some months ago, ``I was troubled by the conduct at issue
here,'' Weld said of the allegations of perjury and sexual
misconduct. The governor said that he was concerned that Clinton
would not be taken seriously as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Weld, who was nominated by Clinton to be ambassador to Mexico
and failed to win Senate confirmation, told the panel that he has
been persuaded that the president can still be effective. He said
he was convinced after seeing Clinton receive a standing ovation at
the United Nations, negotiate a Middle East agreement and win
``better than half a loaf'' in the budget battle on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it appears to me that people are taking him seriously,''
Weld said.

GLOVES FOR THE PALM PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What the Furby electronic pet is to the single-digit set the
leather Palm Pilot case is to the adult digital one: the hottest
gift item of the season. Encasing the Palm Pilot in lizard or
saddle leather is part of the fervid culture that has grown up
around this digital record keeper, calendar, address book and
organizer. Both Furby and the Palm Pilot attempt to wrap technology
in texture, one making electronics fuzzy and friendly, the other
making them slick and chic.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Pilot, of course, is the latest prestige electronic
tool _ some would say toy _ and one of the fastest-selling pieces
of computer equipment of all time. Part Ben Franklin, part New Age,
the Palm Pilot, which can synchronize with a desktop computer
through a clever cradle mechanism, has inspired a whole aftermarket
of electronic add-ons. Now it has, in effect, a line of leather
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   From Coach to Cole-Haan, leather makers are pushing Palm cases.
Cole-Haan offers cases of woven leather; its midtown Manhattan
store sold three in the first few hours after they went on sale a
few days ago, said Aroz Paz, the manager of the store. ``We've had
to reorder twice already,'' Paz said. For some buyers, the $70
cases are an office gift _ professional but personal at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Dooney &AMP; Burke was among the first into the market _ its cases
appeared in the early Palm Pilot accessory catalogs. It now offers
the Java Lizard at $125 and a $225 alligator model. Its Palm cases
are lined in calfskin, the better to protect the screen. Vuitton,
which doesn't offer a Palm pack, recently custom-built one for a
devotee.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors of leather goods, like those of watches and jewelry,
always do well at the holidays, when the imminent new year inspires
a desire for order and new resolutions. The equipment, too, is
wrapped in a culture _ some would say cult _ that is at once
organizational and uplifting. Introduced by a company once named US
Robotics, now part of 3Com, the Palm Pilot enjoys extreme loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has my life on it,'' one entrepreneur was quoted as saying
recently. The Palm Pilot is at least as valuable as a wallet to its
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Combining traditions of self-improvement and New Age business
gospel, a Palm Pilot is prestigious because it says your life is
full and complex. The leather case amplifies this message. Eighteen
months ago, the makers of the Franklin Planner teamed up with
Stephen R. Covey, the author of the best-selling ``The 7 Habits of
Highly Effective People,'' to sell organizing and inspirational
products in a chain of Franklin Covey stores. Palm Pilot
accessories have become an important part of their wares.
</P>
<P>
   The Franklin Covey Palm cases come in a dizzying variety of
styles. Owners can hook Palm Pilots to their belts or bind them
with Velcro or brass clips into portfolios shared by pads and
credit-card holders. The pitches for the products hint at
one-upmanship: the needle-textured leather of Evergreen, the
Franklin Covey catalog promises, ``will leave your friends green
with envy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases signal both protection for precious and delicate
equipment and mediation between the technological world and the
social one. Leather is as much high prestige as it is high finish.
That it is required to encase the Palm Pilot suggests a deficiency
in the original plastic. Competitors, like Philips' Nino, offer
metallic finishes and rubber buttons. But a more organic, touchable
material is needed for an item so important, that spends so much
time in close proximity to hand and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Leather has long served as a mediating material between skin and
metal, as in cameras and binoculars. ``The design of these things
is still pretty generic,'' said Bob Brunner, former head of design
at Apple Computer, now a designer at Pentagram. ``And since you
carry them with you virtually all the time, it's a natural thing to
personalize. It's clothing for electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate Palm case is perhaps the leather jacket offered by
the company itself, with an inside pocket for the device and the
words ``Palm Pilot'' emblazoned on the outside. Like the garb of a
motorcycle gang, it is the most explicit indicator that ownership
of a Palm Pilot also implies membership.
</P>
<P>
   The leather cases ignore the fact that the Palm Pilot comes with
its own rudimentary case, reminiscent of a plastic pocket
protector, once the signal of true computer geekdom. ``Nerd
packs,'' they were called. Just as computers have moved from geek
to chic, Palm Pilot cases have gone from plastic to leather: call
it the revenge of the nerd pack.

IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AN `ORDINARY CITIZEN'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: STANDS for CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House witnesses told the House Judiciary
Committee Wednesday that President Clinton is being held to a
tougher standard of conduct than ordinary citizens would be and
therefore should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of former federal prosecutors called by the White House
to defend Clinton contended that if he was not the president of the
United States, no prosecutor in the country would bring a case of
perjury against him.
</P>
<P>
   That argument came under heavy fire from Republicans on the
committee, who noted that numerous people have been convicted of
perjury and are currently serving time for it. In state courts
thousands of people are convicted of perjury every year, and as of
this October, 115 people were serving sentences for perjury in
federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Sullivan, who served as U.S. attorney in Chicago from
1977 to 1981, told the committee that ``if the president were not
involved, if an ordinary citizen were the subject of the inquiry
... the case simply wouldn't get in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``undoing an election'' over a case that would not
even be considered by prosecutors was ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Davis, a member of the Watergate special prosecution
force in the early 1970s, also said that in the ``real world'' a
case of perjury against Clinton would never be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said perjury would be difficult to prove in Clinton's case
because Monica Lewinsky, the former intern with whom the president
had an affair, would be considered an unreliable witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case would not be brought by a prosecutor since it would
not be won at a trial,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Charles Ruff also contended that House
Republicans were holding the president to a higher standard than
ordinary citizens. ``I can't conceive of this case going forward to
a jury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican committee members disputed the argument that no
prosecutor would take the case, and others contended that the
president of the United States is not an ordinary citizen and
should be held to a higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton holds the most powerful position in the world ...
and sets an example for us all,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas.
He added that the president has a ``special responsibility'' that
goes beyond that of average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, said the president should ``set a
standard for all the citizens of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., disagreed that a perjury case would
never be brought against Clinton if he were not the president. He
said that each year there are more federal perjury prosecutions
than kidnapping prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this in mind, I would not be so quick to say this is an
impossible case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson added that regardless of whether a federal prosecutor
would bring charges against Clinton, allowing the chief law
enforcement officer of the country to commit perjury would have
``terrible consequences for the fabric of our legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the perjury case against the
president was about ``more than just the law. It's about the
national interest. If the president is guilty of perjury, that
undermines the country's trust in the office, and no president can
lead without the trust of the people,'' he said.

   CLIMATE _ The flipflop from summer's heat and drought to
October's floods may seem like typical Texas weather. But
scientists say it also fit right in with the forecast for global
warming: i.e., more weather extremes, dryer drys and wetter wets,
particularly more floods. But such forecasts are in doubt because
the computer models that make them have too many flaws. UT
scientists are trying to improve the models by building in what
they currently lack, such as rivers and their effect on
precipitation. (Stanley, Austin American-Statesman).

   MACARTHUR _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For a few moments today, the
Florida land will be the center of attention for the board of the

commentator and its epidemiologist who helped rid the world of

thinking about how they should give away $150 million and start

   TEXAS-ECONOMY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas job growth has cooled
considerably in the last year, but the state's economic outlook is
still good for next year. That's the view of Sheila Dolmas, an
assistant economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who is
on the team that keeps a regular check on the state's economic
pulse. ``The Texas economy is still very healthy. Employment growth
has slowed, but we expect the (state's economic) expansion to
continue next year,'' said Dolmas. While Texas' job growth exceeded
the U.S. average job growth this decade, the rate of new job
creation has ``slipped considerably'' over the last year, Dolmas
said. (Tyson, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

 &HT;    IS MICROSOFT AN UNWELCOME FRAT BOY AT THE JAVA PARTY?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. portrayed itself in federal court
Wednesday as a rich and clever member of the software fraternity
who, because of either jealousy or fear, wasn't invited to the
party that Sun Microsystems Inc. threw for its Java technology.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Microsoft charged that Sun had welcomed Netscape
Communications Corp., a Microsoft rival in the Internet browser
wars, to join the big Java blast, even though Netscape showed signs
of being a badly behaved guest.
</P>
<P>
   With the landmark Microsoft antitrust trial in its eighth week,
Tom Burt, the software's giant's associate general counsel, put
into evidence an ``Attorneys Eyes Only'' 1996 e-mail message
between two high-level Sun executives titled ``Netscape Sneaky
Move.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressed to Eric Schmidt, then Sun's chief technology officer,
the message complained that Netscape was six weeks late in signing
Sun's licensing agreement for JavaScript, which Sun was pushing as
an industry coding standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode illustrates why I think throwing our lot back in
with Netscape is foolish,'' the message read. ``They are completely
untrustworthy. They don't do what they say they will and they do
what they say they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No agreement with Netscape is worth the ink it's written
with,'' the Sun message concluded. Go sign a deal with Saddam
Hussein. It has a better chance of being honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Burt put the bitter complaint into evidence in a bid to
undermine the testimony of James Gosling, Sun's chief scientist and
the creator of the Java programming language, who claimed that it
was Microsoft who had refused to play by the industry rules by
writing its own version of Java.
</P>
<P>
   ``We viewed what (Microsoft) was doing as something of a poison
pill because the Microsoft (Java) standard was not supported on any
platform except Windows,'' Gosling said in a second day of
cross-examination by Burt. ``Neither we nor our other licensees
were willing to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep harping on those licensing difficulties'' with
Netscape, Gosling added. ``But it was Microsoft who said they
weren't going to comply until the (federal) court (in California)
ordered them to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burt, however, asserted that when Sun began working to improve
the ability of Java-written programs to work on a host of
computers, Microsoft, unlike Netscape and other favored Java
licensees, was deliberately frozen out of the revived
standards-setting process.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's exclusion, Burt contended, did not stem from the
software's giant's go-our-way arrogant attitude, as Sun and
government antitrust officials who have sued Microsoft have
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   By way of proof, he cited an e-mail message that Russ Arun, a
Microsoft Java developer, wrote to his Sun handler in May 1996:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please to keep us in the loop on the other interfaces that you
mentioned. It was not clear to me whether the (Java) interface you
had written has already been shared with other licensees. If so, we
were not in the loop and would like to be. The same goes for any of
the other forthcoming interfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary ruling, a U.S. District Court judge in San Jose
found last month that Microsoft may have used unfair methods to
undermine's Sun's bid to develop Java as a potential replacement
operating system for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes in this case are far higher. The Justice
Department, joined by 19 states, has accused Microsoft of illegally
using Windows, which is being shipped with more than 9 out of 10
personal computers, to retain and extend its dominant status to the
Internet and to other budding technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Burt said he would conclude his cross-examination of Gosling,
the ninth of 12 scheduled prosecution witnesses, sometime Thursday.
David Boies, the lead government attorney in the case, said his
next witness was likely to be Edward Felten, a Princeton computer
professor who has ``deconstructed'' Windows 98 in an experimental
effort to exclude the Internet Explorer browser code from
Microsoft's flagship operating system.

<P>
   In his book ``Man's Search for Meaning,'' Austrian psychiatrist
Viktor Frankl documents the profound power that a life purpose
exerts over an individual under even the worst of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Frankl, who survived the Nazi concentration camps, described how
prisoners who felt they had nothing to live for succumbed, while
those who perceived themselves as having a mission to complete
struggled to survive. Deprived of all external supports that might
give life meaning, these survivors came to realize that, in
Frankl's words, ``It did not really matter what we expected of
life, but rather what life expected of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Their sense of an inner purpose pulled them through the most
horrible physical and emotional experiences so that they might make
their unique contribution to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a purpose in life beyond one's immediate interests
and gratifications, though that purpose frequently goes
undiscovered. Since God has given us everything potentially, we
need to learn how to discover his gifts by making them spiritually
active in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many people devote their entire lives to the pursuit of greater
ease and pleasure. Those who have not found the ``why'' that gives
meaning to existence may achieve material success, yet the real
goodness of life eludes them. One true meaning of life lies in
sharing our particular qualities of greatness with others.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple way you can discover your special purpose in
life. Draw up a list of all the qualities you value in yourself and
that other people admire in you. If you're a humorous person, you
have the ability to uplift and entertain. If clear thinking is your
strong suit and you're skilled at developing ideas, accept this as
a gift that can benefit those around you in many ways. Since we
sometimes think poorly of ourselves, it is important to dig a
little to unearth those skills and talents that may lie hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Next, examine the ways in which you interact with other people
and make a list of those ways that work the best. Does it excite
you to teach someone a skill that will help him? Do you enjoy
simply listening while someone shares a problem with you? Are you
happiest when organizing a group for a project, or perhaps when
encouraging someone who feels hopeless about himself?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, imagine what your world would be like under the best of
all possible circumstances. Would it be clean, peaceful, and
productive? Form a mental picture of the world that you'd like you
and your loved ones to live in, and write down that vision in as
much specific detail as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Your mission in life is to have a ``why'' to live for, to use
your best qualities in the service of the kind of world in which
you would like to live. That is your purpose. This is what life
expects of you.
</P>
<P>
   And when you live according to your purpose, setting goals that
support it, you may find the pieces of your life drawn together
into a strong internal whole. Then, no matter how difficult life's
experiences may prove to be, you can be able to endure and even
prevail.

IRAQ BARS INSPECTION OF PARTY HEADQUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq blocked a team of UN weapons inspectors
from conducting a search Wednesday of the country's ruling party
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials said that the violation was not
enough to trigger an immediate military response, but it undermined
Iraqi efforts to persuade the Security Council to conduct a
comprehensive review of Baghdad's compliance with UN demands. Iraq
insists that such a review will lead to the lifting of economic
sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Wednesday that it is waiting for Richard
Butler, the chief UN weapons inspector, to assess Iraqi compliance
since the United States forced Iraq on Nov. 14 to allow
inspections. Butler is expected to issue a report as early as
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no comprehensive review if they are not
cooperating,'' warned Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
``And if they are not, the use of force is an option that is on the
table and I think that needs to be made very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq accused the United Nations of conducting a ``provocative''
search of the headquarters of the country's ruling Baath political
party, which is controlled by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   General Hossam Mohammed Amin, Iraq's chief liaison to the UN
inspectors, said that a party official demanded that the United
Nations provide a written description of the materials they were
seeking. He said the United Nations rejected the demand and left
the site. The UN team, he charged, had ``the clear goal of creating
crises and problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler countered Wednesday that the inspection was a legitimate
test of Baghdad's willingness to meet its obligations to provide
unimpeded access to any facilities suspected of containing evidence
of a secret weapons program. ``This was an absolutely legal,
no-notice inspection and they blocked us,'' said Butler. ``It was
blockage and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The US initially opposed such a review, first proposed by UN
Secretary Genral Kofi Annan last February. But Washington relented
on Oct. 30 after persuading other Security Council members that the
review must address a series of outstanding Iraqi obligations
including disarmament, the return of Kuwaiti property, and the
status of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   US officials predict that the comprehensive review may backfire
on Iraq by providing a forum to demonstrate that Baghdad has failed
repeatedly to honor its disarmament obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, the American who resigned as a UN inspector, told
reporters at a breakfast press conference this week that the
comprehensive review is the beginning of the end of US efforts to
contain Iraq. He maintained that the review will increase the
burden on UN inspectors to demonstrate that Iraq possesses banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter is concerned about growing opposition in the Security
Council to US efforts to maintain economic sanctions against Iraq.
``This administration doesn't have the intestinal fortitude,'' he
said. ``Unless we go to war for UNSCOM right now, Iraq is going to
win.''

   The latest action by Baghdad follows two weeks of Iraqi
evasions. Two weeks ago, Iraq refused to hand over a series of
Iraqi air force documents containing an account of the country's
use of chemical warheads. Since then, the UN inspectors have
charged that Baghdad has denied one UN team access to a rebel camp
used by Iranian rebel fighters and harassing another team with a
low-flying Iraqi helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats at the United Nations said they were surprised that
Iraq had begun to challenge the UN inspectors so quickly. ``We
thought they would be compliant coming up to comprehensive
review,'' said one senior European diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Washington's apparent willingness to use force to back
the inspectors, the Clinton administration is growing increasingly
convinced that its policy of containing Iraq with weapons
inspections and economic sanctions cannot be sustained
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this standoff continues, the harder it will be to
maintain the international support we have built for our policy,''
said Samuel R. Berger, the President's national security adviser,
during a speech at Stanford University on Tuesday night.

 &HT;    TEXANS ON JUDICIARY PANEL CLING TO OPPOSING STANCES
 &HT;    350 words

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two Texans on the House Judiciary Committee
appeared unswayed by two days of testimony from witnesses defending
President Clinton and instead solidified their positions _ one
Texan for, and one against, impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio refined his
pro-impeachment argument Wednesday as he repeated his contention
that Clinton's misleading statements were not concocted to conceal
a sexual affair, but ``were designed to thwart or impede the
investigation of the independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important as the Judiciary Committee prepares
to vote, perhaps as early as Saturday, on articles of impeachment
against Clinton. Smith is among the Republicans who see an
impeachable crime in Clinton's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, insist
Clinton's actions, no matter how reprehensible, are not crimes
worthy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me again clearly state that I find the president's
behavior unacceptable and morally wrong,'' Jackson Lee said
Wednesday. ``Unfortunately, what I would offer to say is there's
been no new thinking in this room, because as I read the provision
`treason and bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors,' I do
not hear the claim `treason and bribery and unfit morally.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're discussing, (in) actuality, apples and oranges for
the American people,'' Jackson Lee said. ``That confusion causes
the divide and the inability for us to come together in a
collaborative and bipartisan manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he found ``incredible'' the assertions from Clinton's
lawyers that the president was not deliberately trying to thwart a
criminal investigation into his false statements in the Paul Jones
sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just talking about that one instance, but the repeated
instances of admitted misleading, evasive answers, perhaps lying
under oath,'' Smith said. ``Let me just say to you, if there's 1
percent of the American people who don't think that he was trying
to, and intentionally trying to, mislead or impede the
investigation, I would be surprised.''

PATH CLEARED FOR PINOCHET EXTRADITION TO SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain cleared the way Wednesday for the extradition
to Spain of ex-Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet on charges
of torturing and murdering political opponents and ordinary
civilians during his 17-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw, who as a college student marched
against the Pinochet regime, agonized over whether to send the
83-year-old former leader home to Chile on compassionate grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Straw upheld the Nov. 25 decision by five judges
in the House of Lords, who ruled that Pinochet could not claim
sovereign immunity for human rights violations committed while he
ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990. A Chilean government report says
at least 3,197 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
reign, while human rights organizations say the figure is much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Straw's decision, which Pinochet's attorneys vowed to challenge,
further strained relations between Britain and Chile, which in
protest recalled its ambassador from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government emphatically rejects Straw's decision that
allows the continuation of the extradition process to Spain of
Senator Pinochet, infringing the sovereignty of Chile,'' Interior
Minister Raul Troncoso said at a news conference in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights activists hailed the decision, noting that it
came on the eve of Thursday's 50th anniversary of the Declaration
of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous birthday present to celebrate the 50th
anniversary,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human Rights
Watch, a New York-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Straw's decision clears the way for Pinochet's appearance Friday
in a London court to formally face the extradition charges lodged
by Spanish authorities. Pinochet learned of Straw's decision at the
mansion 20 miles west of London where he is living, under armed
guard, while the legal drama unfolds. A London hospital ordered
Pinochet to leave last week, saying he was an unwanted patient who
no longer needed care.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the extradition process in Britain could drag
on for months. Even if Pinochet is shipped to Spain and is
convicted, however, he will not be sent to prison because under
Spanish law no one over age 75 can be incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet could spend the twilight of his life on an endless
merry-go-round of trials. Other countries have lodged warrants for
his arrest or have hinted that they want to try Pinochet for
murdering and torturing their citizens who got caught up in his
regime's brutal crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, wants Pinochet to answer for
the deaths of 94 civilians, including Spaniards. Spain, France, and
Switzerland have formally asked that he be extradited to face
charges in the murders of their nationals, while Italy is
considering making a similar request.
</P>
<P>
   Straw said he had ``given precedence to the Spanish request, and
notified the French and Swiss governments accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, the decision whether to allow extradition
proceedings to proceed rested solely with Straw, who is in charge
of all matters related to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Straw's predicament was Britain's. While a liberal activist as a
college student, Straw, like the rest of Prime Minister Tony
Blair's cabinet of ``old lefties,'' has moved toward the center,
part of a shift that helped the formerly ideologically leftist
Labor Party take power after 18 years of Conservative rule.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals in this country are appalled that Pinochet traveled
regularly to Britain to avail of its exclusive boutiques and
medical care, which he was receiving after back surgery Oct. 16
when Metropolitan Police served him with an arrest warrant at his
hospital bedside.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives, including former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who hosted Pinochet for cocktails at her home two weeks
before his arrest, argue that he was a valued ally during Britain's
1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also say Pinochet rescued Chile from a disastrous
form of socialism imposed by Salvador Allende, the elected Marxist
leader who Pinochet overthrew in a CIA-backed coup. Conservatives
say the number of murders attributed to Pinochet's regime, while
horrible, pales in comparison to the atrocities committed by other
despots this century.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Alastair Hardy, chairman of the Chilean-British
Chamber of Commerce, complain that Britain is damaging commercial
and cultural links with Chile by following an uncharted legal path.
Noting that Chilean voters had approved a deal in which Pinochet
was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for stepping down
and allowing free elections in 1990, Hardy said the British
government was ``jeopardizing the goodwill of nearly two centuries
and acting against the wishes of the democratically elected
government of Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   But Straw refused to allow the effect on relations with one of
Britain's biggest trading partners in South America to sway his
decision. While Pinochet made himself a senator for life when he
stepped down, Straw said that title did not entitle him to
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's attorneys will be hard-pressed to come up with a way
to prevent his extradition, although they could delay the
proceedings indefinitely, so that Pinochet could live out his final
days in the slightly claustrophobic luxury of the mansion at
Wentworth.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Pinochet's attorneys complained that one of the law
lords who ruled against him was associated with Amnesty
International, which has been one of the human rights groups
arguing for Pinochet's extradition. But few legal experts here
believe that alleged conflict of interest offers much hope for the
former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   While Thatcher had led calls to show Pinochet mercy because of
his age and poor health, Straw rejected appeals on humanitarian
grounds, but said it could be ``reexamined in the light of any
developments,'' meaning if Pinochet's health deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher criticized Straw, saying ``he had ample power to put an
end to this shameful and damaging episode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a political decision and it represents a failure of
political leadership,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives say the Blair government is playing fast and
loose with the doctrine of diplomatic immunity and interfering with
another sovereign government's democratically endorsed decision to
forgive and forget a messy chapter of its own history. They say
Blair is orchestrating the prosecution of Pinochet behind the
scenes to mollify left wingers in his party, who accuse Blair of
selling out traditional Labor policies for political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   Straw, however, rejected suggestions that Pinochet is being
punished for political reasons.

 &HT;    New study discounts juvenile crime wave
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fear rather than fact is fueling unnecessarily harsh juvenile
justice policies throughout the United States, according to a
national study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur Foundation's two-year study of juvenile crime
statistics charges that tougher laws aimed at youthful lawbreakers
are based on ``deeply flawed analyses of juvenile violence
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not any more violent than we were 10 or 20 years ago.
We're just paying more attention to the violence,'' said Franklin
Zimring, author of the study and a law professor at the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Rick McDevitt, president of the Georgia Alliance for Children,
said the findings of the study are not news to many advocates for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens,'' said McDevitt, ``is that 2 percent of the bad
actors get 100 percent of the notoriety. It's the two percent that
are driving public policy. The other 98 percent of the kids out
there just need a little help and guidance before their problems
get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimring's findings will be published as a book by Oxford
University Press but were released at a news conference Wednesday
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by the private MacArthur Foundation, which
is best known for its annual ``genius grants'' but also funds
public policy research.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring said a change in how police report juvenile crimes,
particularly assault and aggravated assault, has resulted in ``an
artificial crime wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimring said his study shows that ``what you find out about
aggravated assault and assault since the mid-1980s, quite
independent of whether youth behavior has been changing, police
behavior has been changing significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have been reducing the threshhold of what constitutes
assault and aggravated assault, the study charges, thus the
apparent increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some other major findings of Zimring's study include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Arrest rates for juveniles age 13-17 accused of rape and
robbery show no significant trend either up or down since 1980 and
have actually declined slightly over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   -- The homicide arrest rate for juveniles ages 13-17 rose
sharply between 1984 and 1992 but fell by more than a third by
1996, according to FBI crime figures. The number of juveniles
arrested for homicide dropped another 16 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring said that in order to counter what is seen as a ``coming
storm of juvenile violence,'' many states have enacted laws that
lower the age at which juveniles can be charged as adults for
certain crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was among those states, enacting what is commonly known
as Senate Bill 440. Under provisions of this law, juveniles 13-17
are treated as adults if they are charged with any one of seven
crimes generally referred to as ``seven deadly sins.'' They are
murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, aggravated sodomy, aggravated
child molestation, aggravated sexual battery and armed robbery with
a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   From May 1, 1994, when the law went into effect, through June
30, 1998, about 2,300 juveniles have been arrested as adults under
Senate Bill 440. But not all of them were prosecuted as adults,
since local district attorneys have discretion whether to prosecute
juveniles as adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Juvenile Advocacy Division of the Georgia Indigent Defense
Council, which tracks Senate Bill 440 statistics, said it has been
able to determine the disposition of only 1,095 of those 2,300
cases because there is no central repository for that information.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 1,095 cases, 25 percent were transferred to juvenile
court, 29 percent pleaded guilty (but not necessarily to the
offense charged) and 22 percent were convicted, the council
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of a juvenile crime wave, ``either current or on the
horizon, is no more substantial than the evidence that supports the
existence of the Loch Ness Monster,'' Zimring said.

CANADA PURSUES STAY OF EXECUTION IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In Huntsville, Texas, it's just business as usual:
Another day, another execution. But Canada is recoiling in horror
at the prospect of a native son going under the lethal needle in
America's busiest death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to die Thursday is Stanley Faulder, a 61-year-old
former mechanic from Alberta convicted of killing an elderly oil
matriarch in a botched 1975 robbery. He would become the fourth man
executed this week alone at the Huntsville Unit prison, in an
extraordinary surge of executions that has grabbed world attention.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is waging a desperate final-hour diplomatic offensive to
win the killer a reprieve, claiming Texas violated international
law by failing to give Faulder access to consular assistance or
advise Canadian officials of his arrest and conviction. Officials
in Ottawa suggest the case has the potential to seriously strain
US-Canadian relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles Wednesday refused to
grant clemency. Although a federal judge shortly afterward ordered
a stay of execution, that ruling was expected to be quickly
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canada's ambassador to the US, Raymond Chretien, made
an unusual personal appeal to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, imploring
the governor to grant a 30-day reprieve to Faulder to allow for a
review of Canada's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue is not guilt or innocence, but our belief that there
has been a violation of his rights under Article 36 of the Vienna
Convention,'' said Rodney Moore, spokesman for the Canadian Embassy
in Washington. ``This is not a minor point, but a serious lapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department agrees. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has added her voice to the growing chorus of concern,
asking Bush to stop the execution to give time to consider whether
international law was violated by Texas's failure to notify Canada
of Faulder's situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which the United
States joined in 1969, requires that an individual arrested on
foreign soil be allowed to seek help from diplomatic
representatives from his own country. The treaty is routinely used
to protect the thousands of Americans arrested every year while
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials admit they failed to inform the Canadian
Consulate General in Dallas of Faulder's arrest or his 1981
conviction in the torture-slaying of a 75-year-old widow, Inez
Philips, in Gladewater, Texas. But they say the mistake is not
serious enough to warrant reconsideration of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a cause celebre in Canada, dominating front
pages and televison newscasts in a country that -- like most
Western nations -- outlawed capital punishment in the 1970s. Japan
and the United States are the only industrialized democracies that
sanction the killing of criminals by the state.
</P>
<P>
   If Faulder is executed, he will become the 498th prisoner put to
death since the US Supreme Court restored lethal punishment in
1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Canadians have descended upon Huntsville to
demonstrate against the scheduled execution. Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy has asked Washington to intercede on Faulder's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Texas pleading for clemency in Faulder's case was former
American prizefighter Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, who in the 1960s
faced the death penalty in New Jersey before his conviction for
triple murder was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in his shoes. This is real. We're talking about a
man's life,'' said Carter, now executive director of the
Toronto-based Association in Defense of the Wrongfully Convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Texas leads the US by far when it comes to executing criminals:
162 men and woman have died in the Huntsville death chamber since
1982. All Texas executions are carried out by lethal injection at
Huntsville's 19th Century prison, the largest employer in the small
east Texas city. Local inhabitants take executions in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Detroit and making cars -- it's what we do. No big
deal,'' said John Strickland, owner of the Cafe Texan.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's surge may set a deadly national record, with
executions carried out every day since Monday, and Faulder set to
die at 7 p.m. EST.

BUSINESS AGENCY URGES END TO `CLEAN' NUCLEAR ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The national Better Business Bureau Wednesday called on a
nuclear industry trade group to stop running advertisements that
flatly assert nuclear power is ``environmentally clean,'' in a
unique decision that attempts to stop misleading marketing claims
in the growing competition for consumers' electricity business.
</P>
<P>
   The business ethics group found that recent full-page
advertisements by the Nuclear Energy Institute went too far in
touting the safety and cleanliness of nuclear power, neglecting to
mention drawbacks such as radioactive waste and the air pollution
from making nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But the message went far beyond the nuclear industry. As
companies using telemarketing and direct mail gear up to battle for
electricity customers from Massachusetts to California, Better
Business Bureau officials warned energy advertisers that they will
be held to a higher standard than in the past when strict
regulation prevented competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it is very important that, as this market opens up, .
. . that claims about the environment be very clear and very
specific,'' said Andrea Levine, director of the national
advertising division at the Council of Better Business Bureaus in
New York City. ``You can sort of think of it as a warning shot to
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a Washington-based
group that represents more than 100 nuclear plants, objected to the
decision, arguing that the Better Business Bureau had no
jurisdiction to begin with. They said the ads, which appeared this
fall in 13 publications including the New York Times, Washington
Post and Atlantic Monthly, were aimed at influencing policy rather
than consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a campaign that is directed toward policy
makers. That's our charge: to coordinate policymaking for the
nuclear industry,'' said Nuclear Energy Institute spokesman Scott
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   However, the institute did not appeal the non-binding Better
Business Bureau decision, and promised to consider it in future
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists called the decision a big victory against
market-hungry energy suppliers who make blanket claims of
environmental virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies use vague environmental terms like clean or
green or safe they are on shaky ground because there are usually
facts that undermine the claim,'' said Lewis Milford, director of
the Vermont-based Clean Energy Group, one of several environmental
groups that brought the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long objected to energy industry
advertising claims, criticizing ads that assert coal plants are
environmentally beneficial or that now-closed Yankee Rowe nuclear
power plant in western Massachusetts is ``aging like fine wine.''
</P>
<P>
   However, until now, they had few places to turn with complaints.
Because power companies were government-regulated monopolies, the
Federal Trade Commission and Better Business Bureau alike treated
their ads as political statements rather than consumer advertising.
Political statements receive much broader free speech protection
than commercial advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, however, states increasingly have
eliminated the monopolies, allowing customers to choose their power
supplier just as they choose their telephone service provider. More
than 19 million people live in states where they can choose where
their power comes from, and the number could increase eight-fold in
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in Massachusetts so far has been limited, largely
because of a law that guaranteed customers a 10 percent electric
bill cut even if they stayed with their existing power company. But
100,000 California households have changed power providers, and
competition is heating up in states such as Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Better Business Bureau for the first time
agreed to hear a complaint about energy industry advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed ads consist mainly of attractive images of people,
nuclear plants, and other scenes with large-type words such as
``Reliable,'' ``Proven,'' ``Safe'' and ``Clean'' super-imposed. In
smaller print, the ads included statements such as: ``Nuclear power
plants don't burn anything to produce electricity, so they don't
pollute the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council argued that
the claims were misleading. Though nuclear plants do not release
conventional pollution from their stacks, the uranium fuel is
enriched with power from polluting coal plants, and the hot water
that reactors discharge kills fish. In addition, the group said,
there is no permanent place for the nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Energy Institute countered that critics were
bringing in issues beyond the scope of their ads, but the Better
Business Bureau disagreed. In the decision released Wednesday, the
panel ``recommends that the advertiser refrain from using overly
broad claims that nuclear energy is `environmentally clean' or
produces electricity `without polluting the environment.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One company that has jumped into the competitive power market,
Green Mountain Energy Resources of Vermont, said the decision will
make it easier for the firm to market renewable energy such as wind
power without being undermined by others' misleading claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want customers to have confidence in the information they
are getting from everyone,'' said Tom Rawls, Green Mountain's
director of environmental affairs.

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY CONFERENCE DECLARED A SUCCESS
 &HT;    520&AMP;add
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Participants in a two-day White House conference on
reforming Social Security declared it a stunning success Wednesday,
but warned that unless action occurs early next year the
opportunity will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense that there is a willingness to reach a consensus,''
said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., after a closed-door morning session
with President Clinton and congressional leaders held next door to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said the conference ``engaged the president,
congressional leaders and all Americans in a constructive
discussion'' about Social Security's problems and the alternatives
to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   The conference _ one day partly open to the public held at a
local hotel, the second day devoted to private meetings between
congressional leaders and administration officials _ was designed
to cap a year-long public discussion about Social Security's future
and set the stage for negotiations over a reform plan next month.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Social Security is reformed, income into the Social
Security trust fund will fall below benefit payments by 2013, and
the system's reserves will be depleted by 2032, leaving only enough
operating money to pay about three-fourths of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The closed session focused on two main questions: how to proceed
politically, and to what extent private investments would play a
role in bolstering the nation's retirement and disability program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very candid conversation, and there was, I thought,
(a remarkable) amount of good will and bipartisanship,'' said Gene
Sperling, the White House chief economic adviser. ``People felt
that the effort this morning of bringing everybody together had
been, as one key member called it, 'a sign of real momentum.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties said Clinton indicated he would offer a
plan to reform Social Security if lawmakers thought it would be
helpful _ rather than polarize positions _ but they said no
decision was made on when that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Archer again called on Clinton to offer a detailed plan soon,
but Democratic lawmakers suggested that the White House might delay
offering a plan until there was greater agreement over its main
points.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, at Clinton's suggestion, congressional
committees will begin compiling information to be given to all
members of Congress detailing the Social Security problem and
offering an objective analysis of the impact of various reform
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested another meeting with the same group of 48
congressional leaders for the end of December, to be followed by
further meetings with smaller groups early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats warned that efforts to reach a quick agreement on a
plan that could be enacted before next summer would be seriously
impaired if the House votes next week to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a severe, if not fatal, insertion,'' said Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., ``We've got to get this thing done in the next six
months, and if half is taken in an impeachment trial'' it would
lessen the chances.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question of how to proceed, Clinton and lawmakers
began wrestling with the question of how to reform the program.
</P>
<P>
   Various proposals revolve around two main alternatives, but both
involve some investment in private markets, a departure from Social
Security's 63-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and some Democrats have called for using a portion
of the 12.4 percent payroll tax for individual investment accounts.
Many Democrats have suggested allowing the government to invest the
Social Security surplus in private markets, the way many states
invest their pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., who has advocated
allowing individuals to voluntarily add a private investment to
their Social Security payroll deduction, said he'd be willing to
consider some form of personal investments out of the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could also consider, although it has grave complications,
using a part of the Social Security trust fund that's assigned to
individuals who can then assign those monies to plan A, B, or C,''
Gephardt said.

NEW YORK TREASURER SEEKS OVERHAUL OF STATE BORROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Comptroller H. Carl McCall said Wednesday he
wants state borrowing to rise and fall with the incomes of New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering on a campaign promise to introduce ways to control
state debt, the Democrat called for placing a cap on borrowing at
3.5 percent of total state personal income, which is running at
$550 billion. That would bring debt down to about half the current
6.5 percent level.
</P>
<P>
   McCall called the growth and reliance on debt during the 1990s
``scandalous.'' The state owes $34 billion and its public
authorities owe another $64 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The recently re-elected comptroller, now considering running for
U.S. Senate in two years, proposed a second control: Debt payments
each year could not be above 5.75 percent of the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Payments reached 4.8 percent of the $71.4 billion budget this
year and are on line to meet the proposed cap by the 2000-2001
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said his plan could be phased in by the Legislature
before a constitutional amendment is voted on in two years by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The last time debt reform was attempted, in 1995, voters
overwhelmingly defeated the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal I have now has no loopholes,'' McCall said. The
new proposal also has a lower cap, 3.5 percent instead of the 4.4
percent cap three years ago. Plus, the previous proposal did not
include a cap on debt payment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal received mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schulz, who has filed numerous lawsuits against state
officials for issuing bonds without voter approval, called McCall's
package a ``warmed over'' version of the one defeated by voters
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt limiting provisions we now have in the constitution
are adequate. We we have the best cap available _ voter approval,''
Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, seemed receptive to the reform
package, saying: ``It is certainly worthy of consideration and we
think there are some good ideas there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's plan would make sure the state only borrowed for
capital projects, such as highway or building construction. In the
past and as recently as this year, the state has borrowed to pay
for expenses and for items that have a short life span, such as
fire equipment and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the debt control is needed to improve the state's
low credit rating and to reduce the high debt level.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors
Service, which rates bonds, said that states with high credit
ratings have some form of debt control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comptroller's proposal, all of his proposals, would be an
important step in that direction,'' Kurtter said. But he predicted
the proposal would face ``difficult negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall proposes a bipartisan debt management board and public
hearings on capital spending plans.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Miss. _ Peggy Cantelou, a grandmother of seven whose
Southern accent is as soft and sweet as divinity candy, carries a
baseball bat when she steps out to get the morning newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since the killings of three older people in this drowsy
Mississippi city in just seven weeks, she seldom goes anywhere
alone. Like other, older people in Columbus, a city of 23,000
people just across the Alabama border, she has learned much about
home security systems, neighborhood watches and looking over her
shoulder. In a city where it was once considered polite to speak to
strangers, a simple ``hello'' can draw a quick, hard stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think nothing of going into my storeroom in my
house,'' said Mrs. Cantelou, 65. ``Not now. It's changed our lives.
People just aren't as carefree anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus police have been reluctant to use the words ``serial
killer'' _ investigators have said there may be more than one
killer _ but in this changed city, that is little comfort to older
people.
</P>
<P>
   Three of their friends and neighbors have been taken from them,
not by sickness or accident or by other things that people here
could understand, but in gruesome fashion. All three victims were
bound, gagged and strangled in their homes in quiet, middle-class
neighborhoods, as sane, normal life went on just outside their
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The dead, who had all lived in this city's northern section,
were well known in the tight community of elderly residents. Betty
Everett, 67, had been a beautician at the Trinity Retirement
Center. Louise Randall, 80, was the retired owner of a corner
grocery. Robert Hannah, 61, had often been seeing strolling the
sidewalks of the north side.
</P>
<P>
   The murders appear to be linked, but police here are saying
little else about them.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the first. Two more elderly people were killed in
similar fashion in 1996 and 1997. Those crimes, too, are unsolved.
Both victims, elderly men, were also strangled, although police
have said the slayings might not be linked to the the latest
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing anyone seems sure of is that someone is killing
the older residents of Columbus, and the investigation has not
produced a firm suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a couple of prime suspects,'' said Mayor George Wade,
but ``not to the point'' of charging anyone. The city has offered a
$45,000 reward in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Older people are buying locksmith shops out of deadbolts and
other locks and have installed security systems in houses that they
once thought nothing of leaving unlocked. Pistol sales have tripled
at least, and a firearms instructor at a city gun range is teaching
a class for elderly residents.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where people used to wave, even at strangers, people
spend a lot of time looking hard at people they do not know, and
some they do know. No one seems to go out much after dark unless
they are in a group, and many carry weapons of some kind, even if
it is just a baseball bat, like Mrs. Cantelou.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like a good idea,'' said Mary Francis Edmondson,
who will be 80 on her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus is a landscape of old-money mansions and small frame
homes, like other small Southern cities. Highway 82, a
strip-mall-lined main artery, ferries traffic away from a pretty,
tree-lined downtown dominated by the huge courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had anybody go into somebody's house and kill
them,'' said Jackie Ball, a city councilman. ``We have no way of
comprehending that. We're just hoping and praying this comes to an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings started in 1996, when Mack Fowler, 78, was found
dead in his kitchen on July 8, stabbed and strangled. Then, on Nov.
2, 1997, George Wilbanks, 75, died the same way. Both had lived
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Oct. 13, Hannah, a retired employee at a hospital
cafeteria, was found bound, gagged and strangled. On Oct. 21, Mrs.
Randall was strangled in her house. She was found days later, also
bound and gagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stuffed a sock in her throat,'' said Mrs. Edmondson, who
had known her for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Nov. 17, police found the body of Mrs. Everett, a
gentle and very religious woman who was beloved for her work as a
beautician at the retirement home because she did perms for the
women when they were going out for church functions or family
reunions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were going somewhere special, she gave them something
nice,'' said Amanda Hartel, the food service director at the
retirement home. ``She was a wonderful person.''
</P>
<P>
   All five victims lived within a three-mile radius in the
northern part of Columbus. Residents described their neighborhoods
as middle-class and religious, with many of the houses owned by
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   At the Trinity Retirement Center, the residents are protected by
employees, and by each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still afraid,'' Ms. Hartel said. ``Everybody is.''
</P>
<P>
   With police reluctant to say anything about the cases, residents
have been left to speculate on whether there is one killer or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all I heard, there are some distinct similarities,'' said
Jack Marshall, chief operations officer for the city of Columbus,
``but we have not been able to officially say that the murders were
committed by the same person or persons. We don't have anything
major at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbery did not seem to be the motive in any of the slayings,
city officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   That, residents said, is more frightening that anything else. A
killing done in the course of a robbery, as evil as that seems, is
easier for the elderly people here to accept than the notion that
someone is murdering their friends and neighbors for some twisted
satisfaction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the most disturbing things about it, the people say, is
how it upsets the natural order of living, and dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an older person dies in their 70s or 80s, we like to say,
`Well, they lived a good life,''' said Roger Short, assistant
director of the Lowndes County-Columbus Parks and Recreation
Department, and one of the many here who are enraged and frightened
by the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The killings have stolen the end of a life of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you sick, because you don't know what life they had
left, or how they might have relished it,'' said Short, whose
father died from black lung disease from decades of working in the
coal mines near Cordova, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' he said, ``are like the people who raised
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss seems greater, somehow, because people who have lived a
long time just naturally leave more of themselves in the collective
memory of a community.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Edmonson, whose husband owns a gas company, remembers when
she used to chat with Mrs. Randall at her store, ``back in those
days when they delivered your groceries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a house full of children, and I was so busy, back
then,'' Mrs. Edmonson said. ``One day Louise told me, `You know,
Mrs. so-and-so came in with some of these little green butter
beans.' And I said I'd love to have them, but I didn't have time to
shell them. When the boy brought my groceries home, there was a
sack of little green butter beans, already shelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have told reporters they are searching for links between
the victims that could pinpoint a suspect, and a criminal profiler
with the FBI has been helping them identify the kind of criminal
they are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Lilienfeld, an assistant professor of psychology at
Emory University in Atlanta, said the killer could be preying on
the elderly for the simplest of reasons: that they are often weaker
and more helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Randall could barely walk. Her house has a wheelchair ramp
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have just been the easiest thing to do,'' Lilienfeld
said.

PREZNEXT (Washington) - The rules governing impeachment are like an
interstate highway: clearly marked, but with lots of possible exits
into more uncharted territory. The Judiciary Committee vote this
week triggers a series of events outlined in the Constitution and
Congressional rules, but experts say that anything can happen from
there because rules were designed to be changed. `Hold onto your
hats. It's going to be a bumpy ride,` says Senate Parliamentarian
Robert Dove. By ADRIANNE FLYNN. Story will move in the ``A''

NOTARO-COLUMN (Undated) - The very second that the automatic door
swung open at the mega-super-plus toy store, my eardrums exploded
from the high-pitched screaming coming from within. I was scared. I
braced myself, took a deep breath and then a step. I had to go into
the store. I had no choice. I had upset the Little King on
Thanksgiving. We all try to please the Little King, known to the

 &HT;    TEXANS DEBATE EFFECT OF OMISSION FROM LIST OF TOP SCHOOLS FOR
BLACKS

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Students and faculty at Texas universities
expressed concerns Wednesday that their exclusion from a list of
top schools for blacks could further wound a reputation already
marred by the affirmative action debate.
</P>
<P>
   When Black Enterprise on Tuesday unveiled its ranking of top 50
schools for black students, no Texas schools made the list.
</P>
<P>
   The only Texas schools mentioned were the University of
Houston-Downtown, which ranked No. 3 among regional liberal arts
colleges and Prairie View A&AMP;M, which received an honorable mention
among all colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings, expected to hit newsstands late this month, come
at a time when Texas colleges are grappling with the demise of
affirmative action after a 1996 ruling, known as ``Hopwood,'' by
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer numbers, the University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M
University have boosted black and Hispanic enrollments above last
year, but neither school has reached the pre-Hopwood minority
enrollment levels of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that UT didn't make the cut because of the low
percentage of the black student population.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of students don't graduate or transfer because it's so
big and they feel lost,'' said UT senior Demitris Williams. ``That
becomes multiplied with students of color, because there are so few
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said though university life has been good to her, the
numbers of minority students may be small because some prospective
students believe the university fosters an atmosphere hostile to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Burt, director of the campus Minority Information Center,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our image is awful in the community, and it's awful because of
things like Hopwood ...,'' Burt said. ``When our students who leave
the campus don't go back and relay the positive things that go on
here, it does create a bad image.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Black Enterprise senior editor Marjorie
Whigham-Desir, Burt and Williams are partially right. She said what
ultimately set many schools apart in the rankings was not only
their ability to attract students, but their success in retaining
and graduating black students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas schools want to know what they have to do, then I
guess it's time for their administration to look at what kinds of
efforts are being made toward African-American students and getting
those students through the process and graduating them,''
Whigham-Desir said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Perry, executive associate provost at Texas A&AMP;M University,
said the rankings may further enhance the negative perception some
black students have of Texas schools, especially in the
post-Hopwood environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe these different rankings that are put out by
different newspapers and magazines that are widely publicized do
have an impact on the perceptions of high school students,'' Perry
said. ``When a school fails to be mentioned, you don't get a
positive stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry declined to comment further until he had seen the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ashlock, A&AMP;M executive director of university relations,
wasn't so sure students would give much weight to the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will have any effect on their perception,''
Ashlock said. ``Students looking at A&AMP;M either know they want to go
here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jennings, an A&AMP;M senior, also was skeptical of the
rankings, but said some potential students might take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can personally tell me what is a good
race-relations campus and what is not,'' Jennings said. ``I think
it will scare high school students, but it's up to high school
students to look into the college setting, and it shouldn't be your
sole decision why you don't go to the school.''

COURTING DISASTER, OR THE LITTLE KING AND I 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The very second that the automatic door swung open at
the mega-super-plus toy store, my eardrums exploded from the
high-pitched screaming coming from within. I was scared. I braced
myself, took a deep breath and then a step.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the air was thick and muggy with the perspiration of
hyperactive children. They ran from one aisle to the other and
discharged sound-barrier-breaking squeals as they climbed over
little gyms, rode bicycles and toppled displays with the same
ferocity the Nazis used when they destroyed France.
</P>
<P>
   Parents _ clearly the innocent civilians in the scenario _ hid
in dark corners, plastic playhouses, tents and on the book aisle.
They huddled close together, their eyes wide, collectively pushing
terrified newcomer parents out of their sanctuaries with the words,
``There's no more room! We'll be discovered! We heard there's an
empty box on Aisle 9 with an open spot!''
</P>
<P>
   I had to go into the store. I had no choice. I had upset the
Little King on Thanksgiving, and I had only one way to get back
into His Royal Highness' good graces.
</P>
<P>
   A Little King's ransom in Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   You have to appease the Little King.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he struts through the door, the atmosphere changes.
Every member of my family becomes a servant, footman, lady in
waiting, all eager to serve our 33-pound master.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would an audience with Elmo please you, Your Highness?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You require someone to fetch you chocolate milk, sir? Pick me!
Pick me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, we must destroy the talking Barney doll that
Grandpa paid $120 for by kicking it repeatedly. It frightens me,
too, sire. Shall we employ this metal lamp base to crush its
skull?''
</P>
<P>
   He'll tell us where to sit, mutely pointing at a couch, a chair
or (if you've angered the Little King) the floor. You can be
banished for simply sitting in the wrong place, talking to him
without being addressed first or merely suggesting that it isn't a
particularly good idea to rub purple Play-Doh into my mother's
beige carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   We all try to please the Little King, known to the outside world
as my 2-year-old nephew, Nicholas. He makes his demands in the
language of the Little King, a dialect we have been forced to
become as fluent in as we are our native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Num-num gigee peepah me!'' is easily understood to us as ``It
is none other than a necessity to have the presence of my giraffe
and my pacifier while I dine on pizza. And I mean NOW.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woo-woo rah eebah tub help!'' means simply, ``I must have my
dog, lion and zebra in my bath, and I demand you to assist me in
gathering them. And I mean NOW.''
</P>
<P>
   The Little King gets his way and will not hesitate to vomit if
he doesn't, emitting two distinct warning gags bef`Et met.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago at Thanksgiving, I went to the bathroom after
dinner, and while I was conducting business, the door suddenly
swung open and there he stood.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately pointed to the door and said, ``See-see toonoo
Orie bubbo nah! (You are not supposed to see Aunt Laurie on the
potty!)''
</P>
<P>
   ``Num-num rah Orie Nick pay peese ow (Jester Laurie, you must
return to court at this moment and engage with me in the game of
lion and giraffe, when I will continually chase you until that
herniated disk in your lower back pops out so far it breaks the
skin),'' the Little King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pe fo fo (Not now),'' I said, attempting to cover my
hindquarters. ``Orie, um . . . tee-tee (I'm, um . . . tinkling).''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me slightly out of the corner of his eye, opened
the door and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Aunt Laurie doing in there?'' my mother asked when he
returned to the dining room. He scrunched up his face so hard it
turned red and said simply, ``GRRR!'' in a hearty grunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did a doody in front of the baby?'' my mother screamed
when I returned to the table. ``What kind of weirdo, sicko thing is
that? Is that how you get your kicks?! ANIMAL!''
</P>
<P>
   As punishment, I was called to the head of the table by the
Little King, where I was commanded to perform a sullen little jig
in front of my entire family as he shouted, ``Da! Da! (Dance, you
silly half-wit, dance!)''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it wasn't enough. If I dare speak to him or say his
name aloud, he will look at me sternly, shout, ``No, bad Orie!''
and point to the floor, where my proper place is.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting between a haggard mother of four with a stress-related
skin condition and a weeping single dad inside the empty box on
Aisle 9, I wondered which was worse: being torn limb from limb by
ravenous children who had mistaken me for a life-size Teletubby, or
trying to shovel mashed potatoes between a little metal slit after
I've been pronounced as ``The Aunt in the Iron Mask.''
</P>
<P>
   With only one of my feet outside the box, an angry mob of
children charged, misidentified me as a parent and began screaming,
``Buy this for me!'' I dashed down the aisle and, in a mad haste,
grabbed the first box I could get my arms around and rushed toward
the checkout.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when I reached my car that I realized how lucky I
was. Looking at the package, I saw the words ``Ball Pit Jungle Gym
Carnival'' and realized that this, indeed, was the only toy in the
entire universe that the Little King did not already count among
his possessions.
</P>
<P>
   As I lifted the massive box out of the cart and into the back
seat of my car, the herniated disk popped out of my back, but I
continued to struggle until I was able to close the car door.
</P>
<P>
   I got in the driver's seat and wiped my brow. I had done it. The
Little King would be pleased, and I, in return, wouldn't have to
eat Christmas dinner in the garage next to a space heater.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the box shifted in the back seat and seemingly began
to move on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! Are we safe? Did we get out?'' I heard a parent say.
``Can we go back and save my husband? He's lying at the bottom of
an inflatable canoe at the end of Aisle 3!'' &QL;

<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ On the sunny Saturday afternoon of
Aug. 15, when a car bomb planted by an Irish Republican Army
splinter group killed 29 people and wounded about 400 here, Mick
Grimes was fussing over his newborn baby chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a bang,'' he said the other day. ``It sounded like a
bomb, but it could have been anything, anywhere.'' He kept working
to keep the chicks alive at his place in the nearby hamlet of
Beragh.
</P>
<P>
   What he heard that day was the car bomb exploding on Market
Street in Omagh at the height of shopping for back-to-school
clothes, books and pencils. It was the deadliest act of terrorism
in 29 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Grimes, 73, a retired fireman, learned that the
blast had killed his wife, Mary, 65; his granddaughter, Maura, 18
months, and his daughter, Avril, 30, and destroyed the
seven-month-old twin fetuses in Avril's womb.
</P>
<P>
   Like the bombers from the group calling itself the Real IRA _
who have not been caught but are known to be former members of the
overwhelmingly Catholic IRA _ Grimes and his family are Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly four months later, with the heavy mist drifting down
from the Sperrin Mountains giving Omagh a ghostly look, Grimes and
most of the 20,000 others in the area are trying to cope with the
lingering horror.
</P>
<P>
   They still have visions of loved ones ripped and splattered all
over Market Street, and they live with the huge hole in the low
skyline where six of the blasted buildings have been demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes still has two sons and four grandchildren, three of them
Avril's children. But he finds little joy in them.
</P>
<P>
   Like 500 other people here, he gets counseling from
government-financed doctors and social workers, who listen to his
pain and hope it will fade. In addition to the British government's
health plan coverage for the wounded and their immediate families,
more than 200 people have received about $600,000 from the
nongovernmental Omagh Fund, which has collected more than $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to concentrate on anything,'' Grimes said at the new
Trauma Center in Omagh, where adults go to weep and small children
frightened by the blast draw ghastly faces reflecting their
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Grimes said, he thinks of Mary, his wife, who was killed
as she stood in a Market Street shop buying baby clothes for her
other pregnant daughter, in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best woman,'' he said softly. ``You could never
say anything but good about her. She made jam _ gooseberry,
rhubarb. Sold it and gave the money to starving people, in Sudan, I
think it was.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that over the years, he had written a secret book of
poems, never showing them to anyone. One was about Mary, and last
year he recited it on a tape and and played it on her birthday.
``At least she got to hear it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy McCay, 15, a Protestant schoolgirl, was standing on Market
Street joking with friends when she was blown backward by the
exploded maroon Cavalier, a piece of which gashed and broke her
left arm. There is a deep, foot-long scar on her forearm. Before
the blast, she said, she wanted to become a physiotherapist, and
she still does.
</P>
<P>
   Now she frequently sees in her mind replays of the street
carnage and of the confusion and blood in the hospital. ``I never
know when it's coming,'' she said, ``in school, anywhere _ I see
the whole thing start to finish, just like a film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel unlucky to have been there, but lucky to be alive,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the people of Omagh are
suffering what doctors and social workers call ``survivor guilt.''
The guilt has come not only to ordinary citizens, but to the social
workers and police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a living out of this,'' one ambivalent welfare official
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   The area police chief, James Baxter, said he and his wife no
longer go to Market Street for coffee, partly because their
favorite cafe, Nicholl and Shiels, was blown away, but also, he
said, because he feels some guilt for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of the blast, he said, the guerrillas warned
the police that the bomb would explode near the courthouse. The
police began to evacuate that area and to move people down Market
Street, into the middle of the block, closer to where the bomb was
actually planted.
</P>
<P>
   One policewoman, who had unwittingly herded people toward the
bomb, has not been able to work since and is being counseled for
grief and guilt. One of the seriously wounded was Elaine O'Donnell,
the daughter of a police constable, Jackie O'Donnell. Ms.
O'Donnell's legs were broken in the blast, forcing her to postpone
her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Superintendent, Baxter, said he and his wife had
``walked through Market Street'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite traumatic,'' he said. ``It reminds us of the fear
that there could be another bomb, and certainly the feeling of all
the pain and anguish. It seems a sacrilege to walk through Market
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   When Market Street reopened to the public recently and the town
Christmas tree was lighted, several thousand people attended. But
after that, relatively few shoppers were on the street.
</P>
<P>
   They are avoiding the site of the killing, afraid, they say, of
another bomb and unable to look at the place were their husbands,
wives, children and friends were killed and maimed. They are doing
most of their Christmas shopping in towns an hour or more away by
car _ in Londonderry or Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone in this town, where about 60 percent of the
people are Catholic, says that relations between Catholics and
Protestants have always been cordial, if not friendly, and that the
bomb has pushed them closer together.
</P>
<P>
   Many people were shocked by the bomb because it came just as the
peace effort in Belfast seemed to be making progress. Now they
realize that the guerrillas were trying to disrupt the political
effort, and that if there had been no peace agreement in the
spring, there might not have been any Omagh bomb in August.
</P>
<P>
   The police have questioned more than 40 people but have charged
no one. They say they are getting close to identifying the killers
but still need the help of informers.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA is considered particularly vicious. Its members
consider themselves the vanguard of the anti-British rebellion by
the Catholic minority in the province. But they killed and wounded
mostly Catholics in the attack in August.
</P>
<P>
   They did so, by most accounts, by tricking the police into
directing people closer to the bomb. The police and other officials
involved with the peace effort say the bombers were especially
nasty in their choice of a way to identify themselves as they
warned the police that a bomb had been planted on Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   They used the name Martha Pope, an important assistant to former
Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, chairman of the talks that produced
the peace agreement that was approved in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago she was the center of Belfast gossip after a
tabloid newspaper reported she was having an affair with a Sinn
Fein official who had served prison time as an IRA terrorist. They
both denied the report, and she later received a six-figure
settlement from the paper. But to the bombers her name as code was
a good inside joke.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the blast, the Real IRA said that it was sorry _ that
the attack had been a bad mistake _ and announced a cease-fire.
Members of the IRA had apparently visited the splinter group
members and told them that they were hurting the Republican
movement's strategy, which at present is to support the peace
effort and the participation of Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing,
and its leader, Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 12 hoax bomb warnings since August, which keeps
people edgy and focuses some attention on the peace effort, which
has become stalled over other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Irwin, 17, a Protestant who has attended several victims'
funerals, said in an interview, ``It would be better for the
politicians to fight out these disputes than to have the people
fighting and bombing each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes said he was more numb than outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any anger,'' he said. ``I have no picture of who
would do that. If they had a picture of them, then you'd have
someone to hit. I do have bad periods. I think it would be better
if I could weep.''

IRAQ BARS U.N. INSPECTORS FROM RULING PARTY HEADQUARTERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Barely two days into a crucial round of
surprise arms inspections in Iraq, the government of Saddam Hussein
barred inspectors Wednesday from the Baghdad city headquarters of
his ruling Baath party.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen inspections have taken place over the past two
days but the one at the party headquarters was the first to have
created a major standoff.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday night, a senior Iraqi minister
accused the inspectors of breaking an agreement on access to
certain places deemed sensitive by the Iraqis, usually buildings or
compounds used by the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Amir Mohammed Rasheed, the oil minister, said at a
news conference later that the inspectors had violated Iraqi
``sovereignty'' by trying to enter the party building. But he and
other officials gave varying accounts of what had actually
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Charles Duelfer, deputy chief inspector, said
Wednesday that the leader of the team had been presented with
conditions for inspecting the site which he rejected and then the
team left.
</P>
<P>
   When a team arrived at the party office Wednesday, officials
here and in Baghdad said, the inspectors were turned away, either
because the Iraqis said there were too many of them or because they
had not brought information on what they wanted to see and why.
</P>
<P>
   They refused, and were locked out for 45 minutes before leaving
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Another Iraqi official complained that the inspectors had tried
to enter the building ``in a provocative way and with no notice.''
U.N. officials said that ``no notice'' is the essence of surprise
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, which has been in charge of disarming Iraq since 1991,
was restrained in reacting Wednesday, although he called the
incident at the party office ``very serious.'' He was not asked to
report to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is planning to make a weekly report on general progress
or lack of it to the Council on Thursday, and is expected to
elaborate on Wednesday's standoff then, along with continuing
problems over Iraqi refusals to turn over documents.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors of the Special Commission, known as Unscom, have
been back in Iraq for less than three weeks after Saddam revoked
his Oct. 31 ban on cooperation. The inspectors did not begin
surprise searches of new sites until this Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats said the Iraqis may be poised to damage
themselves by contravening Security Council resolutions, making it
hard for even their friends to defend them, just as they seemed to
be within reach of a comprehensive sanctions review.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, David Leavy, a spokesman for the National
Security Council, said that the Clinton administration expected the
Iraqis to cooperate across a full spectrum of activities if they
want to have the sanctions reviewed by the Security Council _ and
to avoid another threat of military action.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said in an interview that the United States wanted to hear
from Butler before making a judgment on the level of Iraqi
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as the president said, if Iraq cannot live up to its
obligations, if Butler determines that Unscom can't do its job
effectively, we have the forces in the region to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   In Abu Dhabi Wednesday, Iraq's Persian Gulf neighbors urged
Saddam to respect Security Council resolutions, including
disarmament measures as well as demands for the return of Kuwaiti
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from a summit meeting of the Gulf Cooperation
Council said that compliance ``will lead to an easing of the
sufferings of the Iraqi people, for which the Iraqi government is
entirely responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever cornered in recent years, Iraq has fallen back on
complaints that the behavior of inspectors is an affront to Iraqi
dignity and sovereignty. Since June 1996, when Butler's
predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, said he would take Iraq's ``legitimate
security concerns'' into account when conducting searches, Iraq has
tried to protect a range of sites _ the list changes _ by demanding
special treatment for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus wrote a directive to inspectors then explaining how they
should conduct investigations at places the Iraqis called
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   But there was never an agreement to exclude any site from the
purview of the Special Commission. There was agreement only to
limit the number of inspectors and to allow a high-level Iraqi
official to accompany them through the building to be inspected,
which would not be identified before the spot check.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors say that giving advance notice and a list of material
to be examined only gives the Iraqis time to clear buildings and
other sites of damaging evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis refer frequently to the agreement signed in February with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which they interpret as endorsing
their view that special categories of sites deserve special
handling. That agreement allowed inspectors, accompanied by
diplomats, to enter barred presidential properties, but only for
perfunctory walk-throughs. Inspectors have not tried to reenter
those buildings since.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's thwarted inspection, officials said here, was
described by the Iraqis as ``a facility for the leadership of the
Baath Party'' and the ``Baghdad organization's main office.'' It
was not the main national and international headquarters of the
party, a sprawling new collection of buildings bristling with
electronic devices in a Baghdad suburb.

COMMENTARY: WILLIE MAYS TALKS ABOUT JOE DIMAGGIO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willie Mays was on the phone, telling a story about himself and
Joe DiMaggio that went back nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were playing the Yankees in the World Series in 1951.
Mays, a precocious 20-year-old rookie, was in center field for the
Giants. His hero, the graceful and already legendary DiMaggio, was
36 and playing his final games in center for the Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had just pulled off a miracle, coming from far behind
the Dodgers in mid-August to tie them at the end of the regular
season and then beat them in the playoffs, the final devastating
blow being the most famous home run in history, Bobby Thomson's
ninth-inning, pennant-winning blast into the lower left-field
stands of the Polo Grounds off the Dodger reliever Ralph Branca.
</P>
<P>
   So now Mays was in the World Series with his idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were kids growing up in the South we would always pick
one guy to emulate,'' said Mays during a conversation on Tuesday.
``Ted Williams was the best hitter, but I picked Joe to pattern
myself after because he was such a great all-around player. I felt
if you could hit and play good defense, like he did, and if you
could run and throw _ if you could do all those things, then you
could be in baseball a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   I had called Mays, my favorite player when I was a kid, to
congratulate him on a lifetime achievement award he is to receive
from New York magazine on Monday. One of the first things he
mentioned was that his thoughts were with DiMaggio, who is 84 now
and fighting for his life in a hospital in Hollywood, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told this to anybody,'' said Mays, ``but Joe hit a
home run at the Polo Grounds in that series, and I knew that was
his last year, so I was happy for him even though I was playing
against him. So what I did was, I started clapping. And you just
didn't do that in New York. But there I was standing in the
outfield for the Giants clapping for Joe as he's rounding the
bases.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked it up. DiMaggio had been struggling in the series. Age
and injuries had chipped away at his magnificent skills. He was
hitless in the first three games. The home run, a two-run shot,
came in game 4, which the Yankees won, 6-2. They won the series as
well, 4 games to 2.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to imagine what it would have been like if that World
Series had been covered the way big-time sports events are covered
now. At least some of the cameras would have been locked on the
Giants' rookie in center field. Over the years we would have seen,
again and again, the Say Hey Kid applauding as the Yankee Clipper
trotted out his last home run.
</P>
<P>
   Mays and DiMaggio. There is not a sane fan anywhere who will
dispute that they were two of the greatest ballplayers ever to lace
up a pair of cleats.
</P>
<P>
   Mays is 67 now, and admits that a few ailments have slowed him
some. He has a lifetime contract with the Giants but he doesn't
travel as much as he used to. He's had a cataract operation and
some problems with an ear, but he says he feels fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take care of all those things,'' he said. ``The
older you get, sometimes they get out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember as a child walking with my parents into the enormous
horseshoe-shaped structure that was the Polo Grounds, and feeling
as if I had stepped into the Emerald City. All I wanted in that
glorious expanse of green was a glimpse of Willie. And there he
was, all afternoon, and on many an afternoon to come, drifting
easily under a long fly ball and putting it away with a basket
catch. And there he was, stealing second base and brushing the dirt
from the bright white uniform, and then promptly stealing third.
And there he was, with that beautiful swing, sending the ball high
and deep, deep to left, and over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   How good was he? New York magazine notes that Mays hit 124 more
home runs than Mickey Mantle, drove in 366 more runs than DiMaggio
and stole 155 more bases than the two of them combined. The
sportswriter Jim Murray once wrote that ``he should play in
handcuffs to even things out a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The afternoons moved more slowly in those days, and the summers
seemed to last a little longer. It seemed as if all the men wore
hats. And life could not be better if Willie went 4 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mays was laughing on the other end of the phone. He
seemed to agree. ``Those were good times, man,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   When the holiday of Chanukah comes around I think of the
children of all religions who are extremely busy looking for the
latest toys and gadgets. They hope for holiday gifts that their
parents and friends will buy.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish children anxiously wait for Sunday, December 13, the
night Chanukah begins. As soon as the menorah lights are lit, the
presents will miraculously appear.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I wonder if they understand the holiday message of
freedom. Lighting the menorah has not always been easy. Let me
share a story I heard from friends who were World War II Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Daily the death-train cattle cars full of starving, frightened
Jews arrived in Auschwitz. From the platform one could see the
tall, smoking chimneys. The main furnaces were filled with burning
bodies of gassed victims.
</P>
<P>
   One day a new group of victims arrived at the camp. Standing by
the main entrance they read the inscription:Arbeit Macht Frei --
Work is Freedom. A feeling of dread filled their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The chief guard, a sadistic man, infamous for his unbridled
cruelty, greeted the victims. ``Jews, it is Chanukah,'' he said.
``The great Satan told me that you want to brighten your life with
a Chanukah light. So today, instead of killing you, I send you to
the nearby cabin. There you can rest.''With that, the Jews were
herded into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   A young man stood up, pointing out the window to the burning
ovens. ``We will soon be the Holy Chanukah lights,'' he said. A
great wailing broke out.
</P>
<P>
   A yeshiva student said what good was there in Chanukah if they
had no menorah and oil and wicks to light. The children began to
cry and were soon joined by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the group was an old rabbi, Reb Yossef. Strangely, he was
very much in control of himself, ignoring the pandemonium all
around him. He began to speak in a sweet, holy voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs candles, oil and wicks. In every Jew there is a
Godly fire. Our holy books state that the soul of man is the light
of God. In time the world will realize that we have an ever-burning
light. No nation in the world can extinguish our flame.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the chief guard entered the room. ``Filthy Jews, I'm
going to give you a treat. In this Arbeit Lagar (work camp) we give
a 20-gram slice of bread to each of you. Today I'll play a game. I
will soon put one loaf of bread down and you, my Jewish animals,
will have to divide it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you will fight each other trying to get a piece.
That will make great Chanukah entertainment. Right now I will give
each of you two grams of fat. And to you, old man, I give a double
portion.''
</P>
<P>
   The wicked guard, looking like the devil himself, threw the fat
on the floor and ordered the old rabbi to lick it up. Reb Yossef
fell to the floor and carefully put the fat into the fold of his
coat.
</P>
<P>
   The guard laughed, thinking that he had degraded the rabbi and
the Jews. When the guard had finished his fun he went out of the
cabin to summon his fellow henchmen. They would watch the Jews
fight over the bread that he would soon hand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brothers and sisters,'' said Reb Yossef, ``Today we have
witnessed a miracle. I now have the oil for lighting a menorah. My
coat has plenty of threads -- so now we have wicks. Come join me
for the lighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The people gave their portion of fat and soon there was enough
fuel for the wicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a small silver cup I have hidden in my clothes. You
can use it for a container,'' said a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Another person gave the cover from an old pocket watch. A mother
of small children ripped off the buttons from her coat. Removing
the cloth from the buttons, they now became little containers. In a
few minutes there was a home-made menorah ready for lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brethren,'' the rabbi began, ``Let us show our tormentors
that they may be able to extinguish our bodies but never our
spirit. As I light the menorah for this last Chanukah, let us all
pray that our sacrifice is not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Jews have witnessed many miracles. I am sure that our
people will in the end triumph over evil and cruelty. Come sing
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The people were now calm. What had been a frightened people now
turned into a composed and calm group. They were no longer
frightened of death. The Chanukah spirit had put them into a
peaceful trance.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, seeing the flickering light in the cabin window, was
beside himself. He couldn't understand how the Jews did it. How in
the world could a starving, beaten, frightened people celebrate
Chanukah in Auschwitz!
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully speaking, you need a soul to understand a miracle and
that was something the guard had lost to Satan. Very few survived
the camp. But the one who did told the story.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night I will light the menorah and tell my children
about the menorah in Auschwitz. How the spirit of people can never
be broken. I hope to impress them with a message of Chanukah that
is more than toys and games.
</P>

BRITISH-SWEDISH MERGER CREATES PHARMACEUTICAL GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In one of Europe's biggest mergers, the Zeneca Group
PLC of Britain announced a stock deal valued around $35 billion
Wednesday to buy Astra AB of Sweden, creating a pharmaceutical
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which had been expected, was the latest in a series of
cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the European
pharmaceutical industry. These deals reflect a quest for size to
pursue costly research into new drugs and to compete in a market
dominated by U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called AstraZeneca, will be the world's
fourth-largest pharmaceutical concern, with a market value of $67
billion. It will also represent the 10th-largest merger or
acquisition ever.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Zeneca will offer 0.5045 share for every Astra
A-series or B-series share. Zeneca stockholders will control 53.5
percent of the combined company, which will have corporate
headquarters in London and research headquarters in Sweden.
AstraZeneca plans to cut 6,000 jobs, or about one-ninth of the work
force, to save $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astra and Zeneca are a perfect fit,'' said Thomas McKillop,
head of pharmaceutical business at Zeneca _ which was spun off from
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC in 1993 and has since increased
its market value to seven times that of its onetime parent.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will combine the manufacturers of two well-known
medications _ Astra's ulcer drug Prilosec and the Zeneca cancer
treatment Nolvadex, or tamoxifen generically _ and will, according
to McKillop, represent a great leap in global sales and marketing
power. The companies had combined sales in 1997 of $15.9 billion
and combined drug sales of $11.5 billion. Their combined pre-tax
profit was $3.5 billion, and the combined research and development
budget was $1.9 billion, the world's third largest.
</P>
<P>
   McKillop was named chief executive of the combined company
Wednesday. Contrary to analysts' expectations, the chairman of new
company will not be Astra's chairman, Haaken Mogren, but Percy
Barnevik, one of Sweden's best-known industrialists. Barnevik is
chairman of Investor AB, a holding company that is the investment
arm of the Wallenberg family, which owns about 12 percent of
Astra's stock. Mogren, who will be one of two deputy chairmen, had
reportedly been under pressure from the Wallenbergs to improve the
company's return. The other deputy chairman will be Sir David
Barnes, the chief executive of Zeneca.
</P>
<P>
   Barnevik is also chairman of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's
largest electrical engineering company, and has a reputation as a
no-frills manager with a history of fusing corporate cultures, a
matter that is particularly relevant to the drug business. Only
this year a planned merger between Britain's two biggest
pharmaceutical companies, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham,
fell apart largely because the companies could not agree on who
would run the merged businesses.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said that in discussions lasting
several months, a central issue had been selecting the lineup of
top management to try to avoid the divisions that torpedoed other
drug industry deals after they were announced. ``This was gone
through thoroughly to avoid that happening,'' one person said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal prompted speculation about a counter-bid from
other companies, perhaps Glaxo Wellcome. But McKillop said in a
conference call with reporters: ``We have had overtures from quite
a number of parties on a number of occasions. We did not feel they
would be the right combination.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts were divided, with some arguing that sharp increases
Wednesday in the share prices of both companies were driven by the
possibility of a counter-bid. In London, shares of Zeneca rose 6.9
percent while Astra's A shares climbed 10.6 percent in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The deal closely followed an agreement by Hoechst of Germany and
Rhone-Poulenc of France to merge their drug- and
agricultural-products operations and a $10.4 billion stock swap
between Sanofi and Synthelabo, two French drug companies. The
proposed AstraZeneca deal would be the largest drug merger,
surpassing the $28 billion combination of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz,
two Swiss producers, to create Novartis in 1996, according to
Securities Data Co. Under British accounting rules, the newest deal
is classified as a merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   It also coincided with expectations among some American
investment bankers that Europe's move toward mergers of equals
would increase as the single European currency, to be introduced on
Jan. 1, spurs cross-border deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is massive potential for this kind of deal, especially
in Continental Europe,'' said Paul Gibbs, head of analytical policy
in the European advisory department at J.P. Morgan. He spoke on
Tuesday at a year-end briefing _ before details of the Zeneca-Astra
deal became known _ and underlined a European trend toward mergers
of equals that avoid paying a premium to the shareholders of
companies being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures he presented, European mergers and
acquisitions so far this year _ before the Zeneca-Astra deal _
totaled $643 billion, $214 billion of that in deals between
companies of similar size. That represented a marked increase from
$490 billion in 1997, with $51 billion in mergers of equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year for me was the year of mergers of equals,'' said
Klaus Diederichs, co-head of Global Advisory business at J.P.
Morgan, saying at the same briefing that the wave of deals had been
driven both by corporate revamping and by increasing pressure on
executives and directors to create shareholder value. ``We believe
there's much more to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within Europe, the merger frenzy has been led by British
companies, with 39 percent of the business, Gibbs said. But, with
11 countries joining in the euro next month, many analysts say that
Continental European companies _ with their shares denominated in
euros _ will find themselves pressed toward cross-border deals free
of currency-exchange problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers were bound to be explored in the European pharmaceutical
industry anyway, some analysts said, because of the escalating cost
of research as patents on existing drugs expire. For example, the
patent on Astra's Prilosec ulcer medication _ sold outside the
United States as Losec _ expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astra has not felt strong enough to go it alone in this fierce
competition,'' said Sigfrid Leijonhufvud, economic columnist at the
newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in Stockholm. ``They need to put a lot
of money into future research.''

   A Dutch court Wednesday banned all publications that cast doubt
on the authenticity of Anne Frank's diary. Declaring that such
questions insulted and offended Jews, the court ruled in a case
arising from the unsolicited distribution to Dutch libraries in
1992 of a book that alleged that Anne's father, Otto, was the true
author of her journal chronicling her family's years of hiding from
the Nazis. In the case, brought by the Anne Frank Foundation of
Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fund of Basel, Switzerland, the court
barred the publishers and authors of ``Anne Frank: A Critical
Approach,'' from distributing it on pain of a $12,500 fine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ This town was once the steel capital of the
East, its namesake company turning out girders for the Golden Gate
Bridge, Rockefeller Center and the Supreme Court building. But
today Bethlehem is best known as a charming tourist spot of
historic churches and ubiquitous Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence most visitors see of Bethlehem Steel's
existence is the miniature wooden replicas of the old steel mill
and of the company's former headquarters that are sold in gift
shops around town. The shuttered mill may turn into a
retail-and-restaurant complex, and the only vestige of steel is the
office tower where Curtis Barnette, the company's chief executive,
is leading a campaign to save the domestic steel industry _ and, he
says, America.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to see the steel industry itself turn miniature,
Barnette and industry leaders are fighting back. With appearances
before Congress, arm-twisting of the administration, a
sophisticated publicity campaign and a barrage of anti-dumping
lawsuits, Barnette heads the Stand Up for Steel coalition. This
union-industry effort is aimed at protecting the domestic industry
from the low prices and cutthroat competition brought on by the
global financial crisis and a flood of imports from Asia, Latin
America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But in taking up this fight, Barnette and the industry are
coming up against some harsh realities: that many buyers of
domestic steel, like the auto industry, welcome falling prices and
that a main road to recovery for struggling countries is to export
more goods to the United States. As a result, the industry's cry
for relief may have a lot less impact than similar pleas have over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   By every measure, the domestic industry is suffering. Market
prices for its mainstay product, hot-rolled steel, have fallen by
$50 a ton, or 18 percent, this year to reach a new low of $200 a
ton this month. Lower-priced imports are gobbling up total market
share, rising from 23 percent to an all-time high of 35 percent.
And with mills nationwide cutting production runs, spot layoffs
have begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American consumer would not benefit from the extinction of
the American steel industry,'' Barnette said in an interview in his
office here. ``I'm unaware of any U.S. customers saying that they
wish to purchase illegally traded and dumped steel. We shouldn't
say, `Let's help Russia, let's sacrifice the steel industry.' Japan
should solve its own problems and not export them to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the message the industry has been sending for decades
and the one still being sent, over and over, by Barnette, a lawyer
by training and, since 1992, chief executive of the nation's
second-largest steel company, which traces its roots to 1905. The
company, whose employment has fallen from a peak of 130,000 in the
1960s to 16,400 today, makes most of its steel in Indiana and
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem Steel and the country's No. 1 steel producer USX,
along with 10 other steel companies and the United Steelworkers of
America, have backed up Barnette's tough talk with a series of
trade cases, filed in September, accusing Japan, Brazil and Russia
of dumping their steel here _ selling it below cost _ and asking
that import duties be imposed. These cases, in which the industry
seeks new tariffs by February, are speeding through the Commerce
Department and will then go to the International Trade Commission,
an independent government agency.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and the union have also been flexing their muscle
in Washington, especially at a White House grateful for the union's
mobilization of Democratic voters in the November elections. An
all-star line-up _ President Clinton, Vice President Gore,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin and other Cabinet officials _ met with Barnette and his group
in November, and since then Clinton has lectured the Japanese on
this issue and promised faster action in enforcing trade laws.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a nonbinding resolution calling for a one-year ban on
steel imports passed the House in October with a resounding 340
votes. The industry was also able to get a resolution put into the
huge spending bill enacted in the last days of the 105th Congress
requiring the administration to come up with a plan by Jan. 5 to
fight steel imports. Last month, after another visit by Barnette to
Congress, a number of senators who belong to the Senate Steel
Caucus called on the administration to take swift action to curb
imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for the heartland of America,'' said George
Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, which is
sharing the cost of the $3 million ``Stand Up for Steel'' campaign.
``All the blood is gone from our industry; we can't bleed anymore.
We don't have enough steelworker jobs to give away to keep the
economies of Japan, Russia and Brazil going. I feel the president's
top priority is to stand for America and to stand up for workers.''
</P>
<P>
   To insure that steelworkers' jobs are saved, the industry and
the union have been keeping the Washington doors open with generous
campaign contributions and get-out-the-vote efforts in steel towns.
In the 1997-98 election cycle, the union and industry donated $1.2
million to candidates and parties, mostly from the union. The bulk
of it, $985,802, went to Democratic candidates and committees.
Moreover, Democrats do not want to enter the 2000 presidential
election with several thousand unemployed steelworkers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Stand Up for Steel campaign continues, the industry
faces some tough crosscurrents. Moves to limit the flow of low-cost
imports risk undercutting some of the nations hardest hit by the
global financial crisis, ones that may have to rely on exports to
help them bounce back. And while falling prices hurt steel
companies, they help auto makers, construction companies and other
manufacturers, which are under pressure to make their goods more
competitive at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some say the industry must, in part, bear the blame
for its predicament. Nearly a dozen steel producers, over customer
objections, pushed through price increases in the spring, just as
weakness in the yen and other currencies began eroding the price of
imported steel. Moreover, even as the strikes at General Motors
Corp., which lasted nearly eight weeks, reduced the demand for
steel, domestic steel companies did not cut back on production,
creating a market glut when the seven-week strike ended in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steel industry deserves a Nobel Prize in
lack-of-understanding-in-economics for raising prices when the
dollar was appreciating and the world economy was slowing,'' said
John C. Tumazos, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``The
steel companies raised prices when market economics did not support
it. A lot of these steel senior officers should hand in their
resignations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two of the industry's biggest customers, GM and Caterpillar
Inc., have issued statements opposing the anti-dumping suits. ``We
strongly object to suggestions that steel trade should be subject
to `special' protections,'' Caterpillar said. ``The quotas used to
protect the steel industry in each of the last four decades hurt
American industries that use steel and rewarded foreign steel
traders with a guaranteed share of a restricted U.S. market.''
</P>
<P>
   GM, in a statement, said: ``The dumping actions filed against
Japan, Brazil and Russia will have a negative effect on prices U.S.
consumers pay for finished products with high steel content.''
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``Worldwide economic upheaval and fluctuating
currencies are the real issues. Indeed, the filing of these
complaints could make the situation worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crandall, an antitrust expert at the Brookings
Institution, said: ``In every trade complaint there are some who
benefit, and that is all of us who use consumer products made from
steel. In fact, most of the pitch made to protect steelworkers'
jobs and companies are from companies who lost their
competitiveness a long time ago. It's an argument they've made for
25 years. They continue to blame their predicament on imports.
There's no doubt the current low prices of imports exacerbate their
problems. But the roots of them have nothing to do with imports.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette counters that his industry has invested $50 billion in
modernization and cut 300,000 workers from payrolls in the last
decade to better match supply and demand. While the industry pushed
through a price increase last spring, it did so not knowing what
the future held. And the industry kept up production during the GM
strikes not knowing that it would last so long. Besides, each
domestic producer wanted to have steel products ready for when the
strike ended.
</P>
<P>
   And while Barnette acknowledges that falling currencies and
collapsing economies have a lot to do with the low prices of steel
imports, the drop in prices, he said, is so severe that it goes
beyond those factors and into dumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to remind the public of the very significant
competitiveness of our industry,'' Barnette said. ``We're sometimes
viewed as protectionist and rust belt in our thinking when we are a
high-tech, low-cost, world-class industry. We believe in open
markets. But when the rules are breached, they should be enforced,
and that is what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers, even those critical of some industry decisions,
acknowledge that the current situation is particularly difficult.
The danger, though, is that the building of protectionist walls
could make it hard for troubled countries to raise money through
exports, slowing a global recovery. And that, in turn, would make
the steel industry's problems drag on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steel, to a degree, has a legitimate beef,'' said Kimberly
Elliott, a research fellow at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington. ``But if other countries retaliate or if
closing the market for steel from these crisis countries causes
them to further spiral downward, that will affect all U.S. export
industries. The broad macro effects of that can be staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Morrison, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
says that sadly, the domestic steel industry may be a sitting duck
in the churning world economic waters. ``Even if the industry wins
some concessions in their trade suits, will it save the industry?
My thought is no,'' he said. ``It's very difficult in this
environment of a global downturn to block out a couple of countries
and expect to get better prices. As long as there is global
oversupply, our prices won't be able to diverge much from global
prices. Until the global economy turns up, it will be difficult to
see the steel industry in much better straits than now.''

2 BIG FORCES CONVERGING TO CHANGE THE SALE OF MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This winter is quickly shaping up as one that will
affect the music business and market for years to come. Two
enormous changes have been taking place, utterly separate yet
inextricably interlinked.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that on Thursday, Seagram is expected to close its
deal to buy Polygram Records from Philips. Over the next month,
beginning with a meeting Friday morning with Polygram employees at
the Hudson Guild Theater in midtown Manhattan, the beverage and
entertainment corporation will begin merging Polygram with the
Universal Music Group, which it already owns.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the country's biggest record company, reducing the
number of major labels from six to five and accounting for nearly a
quarter of the music market. As a side effect, over the next month
as many as 3,000 employees are expected to lose their jobs,
important record labels will disappear and executives at the labels
estimate that anywhere from dozens to 200 bands will be released
from their labels.
</P>
<P>
   The second change is that a war of sorts has been taking place
between online entrepreneurs and the music establishment. The
battlefield is the Internet, where in the last year some 150,000
songs, according to the research company Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., have become available as computer files in a
format called MP3, which compresses songs into easy-to-transfer
bundles of CD-quality information.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these songs are on the Internet legally, with the
permission of the band or record label that holds the copyright;
others are bootlegged. Producers and consumers of MP3 music have
accused the record industry of trying to suppress the spread of the
format under the guise of stamping out piracy. But already there
have been an estimated 5 million downloads of Winamp, which is just
one of many software packages created to play MP3 files. And
Internet sites like www.MP3.com, a gateway to thousands of free and
cheap songs and albums, reports some 150,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy became the first
mainstream musician to take an adversarial stand on the matter,
striking out against his label, Polygram-owned Def Jam, after he
uploaded a new song, ``Bring the Noise 2000,'' onto his Web site
for fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Polygram/Universal or whatever they're now called forced
us to remove the MP3 version of `Bring The Noise 2000,''' he
complained on the Web site. ``The execs, lawyers and accountants
who lately have made most of the money in the music biz are now
running scared from the technology that evens out the creative
field.'' Executives at Def Jam and Polygram declined to comment on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly what is happening on the Internet is diametrically
opposed to what is happening at record companies: as major labels
are consolidating and tightening, the music world on the Internet
is expanding and opening. In the process, Seagram is finding an
artist rebelling; other record labels are finding that some acts
want to make deals only if they are allowed to distribute or even
sell some of their own music on the Internet, and still other acts,
like the Beastie Boys, are uploading live songs on the Internet as
MP3 files instead of giving them to their record company to use for
their own promotional purposes. And the band Less Than Jake found
itself in trouble when it posted songs owned by its label, Capitol,
without permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you become very big, it becomes very hard to turn
around,'' said Dave Turin, a producer who runs People Tree, an
Internet label and music store for releasing less commercial side
projects by well-known musicians, including members of Porno for
Pyros and the Dust Brothers. ``I see major labels as a huge
Michelin man made of cement, trying to turn around to see what's
behind him but crumbling into pieces in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some major labels agree with Turin's assessment. ``Labels
are going to wait to see what happens and then plug into it,'' said
the top executive at one label, speaking on condition of anonymity
about his label's lack of a plan for distributing music on the
Internet. ``They have to deal in the here and now. The economics
and expectations of corporate owners is to make short-term
financial results, not to be pioneers of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a perfect David and Goliath Internet story is the
controversy over Diamond Multimedia's Rio device, the first
portable MP3 player (able to store songs from the computer on a
flash card, or memory chip, in a Walkman-like device the size of a
deck of cards). Instead of trying to reissue records, create
compilations and release live recordings on flash cards for the
Rio, critics say, record labels have been trying to wipe it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devices like the Rio are troubling because they encourage
consumers to download illegal copies of our recordings,'' explained
Kevin Conroy, the senior vice president for world-wide marketing at
BMG Entertainment. He added that ``the proliferation of illegal MP3
recording devices will undermine and possibly destroy the
legitimate commercial market for digitally delivered music before
it even has a chance to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America
obtained a temporary restraining order to keep Diamond from
shipping its Rio player. But the order was overturned by a federal
judge, and the Rio is now available for $199. The RIAA appealed the
decision, and last week Diamond Rio countersued, accusing the
association of engaging in anti-competitive business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Wirt, Diamond's vice president for corporate marketing, said
the Rio was not intended to encourage piracy, which, he said, could
be found and stamped out much more easily on the Internet then in
the flea markets and street stalls where bootlegged CDs are
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right of major labels to encrypt their music,'' he
said, referring to the ability to make Internet music files
difficult to copy. ``But it's not their right to tell the thousands
and thousands of independent musicians who use the MP3 market as
their lifeline _ to distribute and sell their music _ that they
can't do anything until the major labels get their voice in there.
The RIAA wants to delay everything as long as possible,
discouraging the production of MP3 among their members and
discouraging the market for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   RIAA president Hillary Rosen disputed Diamond's claims. Rather
than suppressing technology, she said, the association is concerned
about upholding copyright law. It cannot support devices like the
Rio until there are effective security measures in place, she said.
A record-business policy on the subject could emerge as early as
next month, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a lot of frustration with the slow pace of the
majors in approaching these issues,'' Ms. Rosen said. ``But there's
a lot at stake. When there's a major release,'' costing ``2 or 3
million in the making, the idea of putting it up for free in an MP3
format is not your first priority, by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   For many keeping tabs on the battle, the issue seems like a
rerun of the music industry's offensive against the spread of
cassette decks, which saw the rise of skull-and-crossbone stickers
that read ``Home Taping is Killing Music.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Already, technology may be moving beyond MP3 (short for MPEG-1,
layer 3) and into MPEG-4, which compresses the data even more and
is more adaptable to multimedia files. Companies like Sony and
Creative Labs are working on portable devices that will play these
files and prevent them from being easily copied.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Intertrust Technologies Corp. in Sunnyvale, Calif.,
announced that beginning next year it would offer an advanced
system for MPEG-4 files called the Intellectual Property and
Management Protection interface, which will secure files, mete out
royalties to appropriate parties and allow copyright holders to
decide who gets their music, for how much money and how many times
they can listen to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next year the whole Web-based music business is going
to morph,'' said Joe Jennings, a senior vice president at
Intertrust. ``You're going to see within a reasonable amount of
time new types of devices in your car to buy music as you drive,
new devices at plane terminals where you can download a set of
songs for the flight, where your computer can be on a `dist' list
of all the music a band is putting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Geiger, a co-founder of Artist Direct, which sells music
merchandise through its Ultimate Band List on the Internet,
envision a system in which record companies could increase profits
by letting consumers subscribe to unlimited music on the Internet,
for a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   But as dreamers dream and inventors invent, the consolidating
record business seems reluctant to change. ``They're fooling
themselves,'' Stan Goman, the chief operating officer of Tower
Records, responded when told about Intertrust's solution. ``These
kids can break into the Pentagon on their computers, so they're
going to figure out a way to crack this system. There's no way out
of it. If the record companies thought home-taping was a drag on
their sales, wait until MP3 gets going.''

FEWER WOMEN, MINORITIES SEEK EDUCATION AS DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in a decade, the number of women and
minorities applying to medical school has dropped over the last two
years, prompting concerns that medicine is unlikely to mirror the
diversity of the US population anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is part of an overall decrease in applications to
medical schools the last couple of years, which may reflect a
general disaffection with the profession or the greater appeal of
other career choices, say medical school officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-year drop in women and minority applicants raises
worries that decades of efforts to boost their presence in medicine
to levels representative of the general population, have not been
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an equity issue. They represent the viewpoints
of so many patients,'' said Dr. Sharyn Lenhart, immediate past
president for the American Medical Women's Association and an
associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School. ``If those voices get lost, it has implications for
everyone's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Edelin, an associate dean at Boston University
School of Medicine, said, ``This is really a vicious cycle. If we
aren't training folks from the neighborhoods and communities with
the highest morbidity and mortality rates, who's going to go back.
. .and begin to address the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   While women represent half of the population, they have
accounted for a little over 40 percent of the medical school
applicants and admissions in recent years, according to the
Association of American Medical Colleges. But the number of women
applying in 1997 dropped by 8.8 percent over the year before, and
by 2.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And while certain minorities, considered underrepresented in
medicine, constitute about 20 percent of the population, they have
made up only about 11 percent of the medical school applicants and
admissions. The number of underrepresented minorities applying in
1997 dropped by 11.3 percent over the year before, and by just
under 1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Of all medical school applicants, less than half get in, with
only about 17,000 out of the 41,000 being accepted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The situation for minorities is particularly worrisome as a
result of the attacks on affirmative action, and has prompted a new
focus on diversifying medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Pew Health Professions Commission, led by former
US Senator George Mitchell, urged health care professional schools
to defy the backlash against affirmative action in some states, and
to reverse the slide already evident in the number of minorities
entering medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Harvard medical and dental schools are holding a panel on
the future of diversity in medicine, as part of a year-long
celebration of three decades of affirmative action at the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts medical schools have not had to face quite
the same level of attack on affirmative action as those in other
states have, they have also seen a drop in applicants.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University medical school, the number of
underrepresented minority applicants dropped from 850 to 671
between 1995 and 1998, while women dropped from 5,010 to 4,321. At
Tufts medical school, minority applicants dropped from 338 to 269
in those same years, while women went from 2,491 to 2,341.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1998 at Harvard, minority applicants went from
459 to 366, and women, from 1,610 to 1,467. At University of
Massachusetts during those same years, women applicants went from
514 to 427. UMass minority numbers were not available.
</P>
<P>
   For Massachusetts medical students who are women or minorities,
like Ana Lopes of Tufts and Erica Bial of BU, the trend is
worrisome, reflecting poorly on the future of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minorities are more likely to go back and work in underserved
areas,'' said Lopes, a black woman who speaks Portuguese, Creole,
Spanish and English. She has a National Health Service Corps
scholarship and will work in a medically underserved area when she
finishes her training.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall decline in applications may indicate a general
dissatisfaction with medicine, as a result of managed care and
other forces, it has wider implications, said Bial, who has had
doctors she knows tell her not to go into the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will tell you the future was not what it once was. All
those forces affect women and minorities equally,'' she said. But
there are also other social forces and biases that ``dissuade
minorities and women from going into medicine, which is very
old-boy network, very male-dominated.''

CLINTON FAVORS PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, ADVISER
SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To keep Social Security solvent in the next
century, President Clinton supports some form of private market
investment for the retirement fund, a key adviser said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear that he favored using a more aggressive
investment strategy in comments to a bipartisan group of lawmakers
who caucused privately on the final day of a White House summit on
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, director of the president's National Economic
Council, said that Clinton told lawmakers that ``we should be
looking for ways to get higher rate of return into Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said Clinton believed that of all the options, which
include raising taxes or lowering benefits, increasing the rate of
return on Social Security contributions was the least painful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sperling said, the president has not endorsed any
specific investment plan. One option would allow the government to
invest Social Security monies, including more than $700 billion in
reserves, in higher yielding funds than the government securities
where the money is now placed.
</P>
<P>
   The other more controversial option would allow individuals to
take some of the taxes they now pay to Social Security and invest
that money in the private market.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to support this plan he would enrage some of his
Democratic base, including organized labor, which has vowed to
oppose such investments as too risky and inequitable.
</P>
<P>
   While the president has not spelled out specific legislation for
Social Security reform, he told members of Congress gathered for
the morning session that he would be willing to submit a plan first
if they believed that was the best way to advance the process.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the preferred route of Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who attended the
session and has repeatedly said that Social Security reform will
not happen unless Clinton takes the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Archer praised the meeting, where various options were
discussed, for its ``wonderful spirit of bipartisanship.'' But he
warned that those involved have to get beyond the talk and come up
with something concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Others also said that they came away with the belief that
Clinton was willing to tackle the politically touchy subject next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a staunch conservative who rarely
praises Clinton, said ``I believe the president is committed to
dealing with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has proposed a plan that would allow individuals to invest
a portion of their Social Security contributions in the private
markets.
</P>
<P>
   All of Wednesday's sessions were held behind closed doors to
allow lawmakers to ``let their guard down and avoid
grandstanding,'' as one participant said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton's first term health care initiative got off to
a rocky start because the plan was devised by a task force that met
privately and did not solicit enough public input.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee
want to impeach the president, Archer said he could still work with
Clinton on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he will decide how to vote on impeachment after the
Judiciary Committee makes its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he had ``stayed out of the loop'' on the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my cup of tea,'' he said. ``I like substance.''

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have acquired some old Model T parts from my grandfather's
estate. How can I find out if anyone wants them? _ L.N., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: A place to start is a local chapter of the Model T Ford Club
of America. ``There are lots of people who want Model T parts,''
said Harry Wistrand, president of the group's Dallas chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas chapter meets the first Sunday of each month at
Central Congregational Church in Dallas. The next gathering is Jan.
3.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter, which has about 125 members and 150 Model Ts, costs
$12 a year to join. Membership in the national club costs an
additional $22 and includes a subscription to its magazine.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, write to Ted Dumas, 13409 Spring Grove
Ave., Dallas 75240.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I ask people what the saying ``feet of clay'' means,
they all give different answers. What is the meaning and origin of
this expression? _ C.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The term ``feet of clay'' was inspired by Daniel 2:42 in the
Bible. King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream about a statue made of
several materials, including toes of iron and clay, ``so the
kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Hartman writes that the expression ``is used in reference
to someone who is untrustworthy; someone who might disappear when
the going gets tough.''

SWEENEY BACK BOLSTERING BRUINS' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON _ He missed 23 games last season with a fractured
shoulder blade _ a rare injury, to be sure _ suffered March 1
against the New York Islanders. For Don Sweeney, one of the Bruins'
true iron men, it was a frustrating injury that required a long
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   It took two surgical procedures to resolve the vexing problem,
and it wasn't until late October that the 32-year-old defenseman
felt like himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back off the (West Coast) road trip not feeling great,
not feeling as aggressive as I like to be and tentative,'' said
Sweeney. ``Not necessarily hittingwise but in all facets of the
game. We went into Montreal (Oct. 28), and obviously, everybody had
a great game (in a 9-2 Bruins rout). Then we played them at home
(the next night), and I felt like I was much more back on my toes.
I was jumping to things and not sitting back and maybe waiting for
plays to develop and then reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   What was happening was exactly what coach Pat Burns had told
Sweeney would happen. After holding Sweeney out of the exhibition
games to make sure the shoulder blade was healed, Burns told him
his game wouldn't come back immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It may take you 10 regular-season games to get
back,' '' said Sweeney. ``I was laughing. I said, `It took eight.'
He was pretty damn close.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has always played a fearless, physical style, which he
feels is necessary for him at the NHL level. It wasn't the contact
that gave him pause, it was the other necessary components of his
game _ namely, aggressiveness and stepping up on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't apprehensive about getting hit,'' said Sweeney. ``I
didn't have a fear about it. It's more or less a game situation
where you're sitting back, you're not dictating a lot of times. As
a defenseman, you want to read the play but you can make people
make bad plays by forcing them in areas. I felt like I was sitting
back and giving them time and space. That's a big part of my game.
I have to eliminate time and space especially, because guys are
getting bigger and bigger. I have to use that quickness and smarts
and physical attributes to the best of my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who has one goal and five assists in 24 games, is best
appreciated by his teammates. To a defensive defenseman, the best
compliment is not to be noticed. To others in the dressing room
such as Ray Bourque, Sweeney's contribution is huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been playing great,'' said Bourque, who frequently the
last few years has been asked to carry too heavy a load. ``It
probably took him about three weeks to a month to really get back
to where he was, and he's been playing great for over a month now.
It gives us so much depth. We've got six guys _ actually, seven _
we've been using, and we've really got a good rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has terrific speed, and though he's not nearly as big as
some blue-liners (5 feet 10 inches, 185 pounds), he has shown
throughout his 11-year pro career that he's among the most
dependable and durable in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got as good a `D' as any team in the league,''
said Bourque. ``We have guys with experience. Our youngest guy has
more than three years' experience (Kyle McLaren). It's allowed us
to go out and use three solid combinations, which has been good for
everybody.''

PARENTS CAN'T HELP MAKING COMPARISONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thousands of Massachusetts parents spent Wednesday
doing exactly what the state asked them not to do with the MCAS
test results: They immediately compared individual schools and
districts to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding the state Department of Education's Internet site with
more than 10,000 hits by midday, then sharing the information at
bus stops and through telephone trees, parents descended on the
most detailed test data ever released on their community's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is information every parent dreams about,'' said Abby
Doherty, a Natick parent of a sixth-grader. ``It's silly to say
we're not comparing the Brown with the Memorial School, or
whatever. It's natural . . . Later we're going to take a hard look
at exactly where our kids stand. Some of us will realize they need
more of our help. It's not just the schools that may need to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   While superintendents and principals declared publicly that they
are not using the data to rank classrooms or schools, some
acknowledged privately Wednesday that that is exactly what they are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Superintendent of Schools Mihran Keoseian _ whose
district scored highest in the state among those that offer K-12,
according to a Globe computer analysis _ said, ``They are telling
us not to do it, but who isn't going to do it?''
</P>
<P>
   But many parents said they won't view the scores as the sole
determination of a good school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a parent is unhappy with a school, they will use this as a
tool to move on,'' said Hannah Stokes, a Newbury parent of a
fifth-grader who took the test last year. ``Those who like their
schools will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials have insisted repeatedly that the MCAS data for
grades 4, 8 and 10 is only a baseline by which to measure future
improvement _ not a good indicator of which schools are doing the
best job.
</P>
<P>
   In Stokes's Newbury district, English scores were low and other
scores fairly high: only about 17 percent of elementary school
students scored in the proficient category in English, and none
scored in the advanced category. But in math, 30 percent scored in
the top two categories, and 70 percent scored that high in science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scores show me that we have to get back to the basics of
reading and writing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others said it is simply too early to tell exactly what
the test scores show _ and it will be several weeks or months
before schools determine why some schools did better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, people have been overreacting,'' said Irwin
Silverstein, a high school parent and vice chairman of the Needham
School Committee. ``You have to spend time digesting the
information and not go right off and say this is awful or this is
terrific. It is going to take us a while to know what the numbers
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Deanne Peterson is a mother of two in the Agassiz Elementary
School in Cambridge, which had not a single student scoring
``advanced'' in English. However, 51 percent of its students scored
proficient or advanced in science, and 29 percent in those
categories for math.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said that while she is unsure how she'll feel after she
pores over the data on her school, she's optimistic because,
``Education is now out in front of the public like it never has
been before.''

MIDWEST GRAIN FINDS NEW USES FOR GLUTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: A Kansas company is doing wonders with wheat these
days. It has learned how to turn the state's biggest crop into tent
pegs and cosmetic agents, dog chews and golf tees, meat extenders
and disposable forks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As varied as these items seem, each began with protein extracted
from wheat. The protein, called gluten, is in every slice of bread
you eat. Gluten is what gives bread the strength to form a loaf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Midwest Grain Products Inc. in Atchison have found
ways to modify the gluten for new uses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modified one way, gluten takes on a fibrous, soft, stringy
structure that looks and feels like cooked chicken. But it doesn't
taste like much at all, which makes it an easily flavored meat
substitute or extender. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modified another way, gluten becomes like plastic. In this form,
it can be injected into molds, just like petroleum-based plastics.
But the gluten-based products are biodegradable and can be made
edible under one formulation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company also has made a strengthener for seasoned pastas,
and foaming agents and proteins for hair- and skin-care products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers cooked up all these wonders with the ultimate aim of
modifying the nature of Midwest Grain itself, which historically
has sold basic commodities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These are different products than we have rolled out before,''
said Ladd Seaberg, Midwest Grain's president and chief executive
officer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Seaberg expects that in three years, these specialty
gluten products will generate about $30 million in revenue, about
equal to its sales of wheat gluten. That's no small goal, given
that Midwest Grain has been selling gluten since 1953. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Polytriticum is the company's newest modified gluten product. It
is essentially plasticized gluten resin. It melts. It flows. It
cools and hardens. Just like plastic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showing off the stuff, Seaberg produces plastic cutlery, golf
tees, saucers and a tent peg, all made from modified gluten.
Essentially, anything made by injecting plastic into molds can be
made from Polytriticum, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bury the items in soil and they break down. Depending on the
formula Midwest Grain uses, the material will degrade in three to
six months or even longer, Seaberg said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we can fine-tune,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Grain doesn't make the forks and golf tees. It makes
pellets that it hopes to sell to companies that make
injection-molded products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seaberg says Polytriticum costs about 20 percent more than
regular plastic, a common problem for biodegradable alternatives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Polytriticum comes in two varieties. Polytriticum 200 is edible,
though it's too hard for human jaws. Polytriticum 2000 is not
edible, but it lasts longer and stands up to heat better. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City, Mo., company already uses Polytriticum 200 to
make dog chews. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judy and Joe Roetheli make Greenies from the material, adding
breath fresheners. Joe Roetheli says that most dog chews are made
from starch but that the gluten-based Polytriticum makes Greenies a
source of protein for the dog. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have in Greenies is human-grade edible
material,'' said Roetheli, whose Kansas City company is S&AMP;M NuTec
LLC. ``I frankly chew on the resin myself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Grain doesn't recommend people eat its Polytriticum 200,
but only because it is so hard. However, the company sells Wheatex,
fully intending it for humans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wheatex is the company's brand name for a texturized wheat
gluten. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry, it looks like frozen noodles, but in lumps rather than
strips. Wet, it looks like cooked chicken. It can be made to look
like beef, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With this kind of structure, you can add it to virtually any
kind of meat product,'' Seaberg said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The product is a potential rival for other gluten- and
soybean-based meat extenders or substitutes. Consumers already buy
seitan, which is made from gluten but isn't texturized. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Seitan is primarily a washed dough,'' said John Moore, who
does research and development work at Gardenburger Inc. in
Portland, Ore. ``They found a way to make fiber out of it,'' Moore
said of Midwest Grain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wheatex has another trait that could put it in competition with
soybean-based meat substitutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wheatex is much blander,'' Moore said. ``Soy has a taste that
a lot of people find objectionable, and it's very hard to cover
that taste.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardenburger uses Wheatex in its Garden Vegan Veggie Patties.
It's listed as texturized wheat gluten in the ingredients. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pasta Power is another edible modified gluten product from
Midwest Grain. John Brewer has been using it in seasoned pastas at
Heartland Pasta Factory in the City Market since testing it three
years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says the product increases the protein in his pasta,
which he mostly sells to restaurant chefs. He uses Pasta Power in
place of egg whites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also adds Pasta Power to seasoned pastas for strength. Brewer
says anything, such as spinach or tomatoes, that is added to the
semolina weakens the resulting pasta. Pasta Power makes up the lost
ground and allows Brewer to turn up the flavor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our spinach (pasta) looks and tastes like spinach instead of
just having the color,'' Brewer said. &QL; 
Seaberg expects the line of modified gluten products to modify
Midwest Grain's profit-and-loss statement.
</P>
<P>
   Since forming in 1941, Midwest Grain has made and sold basic
commodities, starting with alcohol, then adding gluten and wheat
starch. Each is a basic commodity, and that makes the company
susceptible to price cuts by rivals that sell the same basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, gluten prices have fallen sharply largely
because of heavy imports from the European Union. In June, the U.S.
government placed a quota that limits gluten imports from European
Union nations for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Seaberg plans to use those three years of protection to invest
about $30 million to establish Midwest Grain's line of modified
products. The idea is that Midwest Grain ends up with a higher
profit and steadier business when the gluten quotas end and the
commodity market reopens to full imports.

NOW HISTORIANS MAKE HISTORY, NOT JUST RECORD IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Tuesday marked a most visible descent of historians
from their ivory towers.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Wilentz, history professor at Princeton University,
appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to argue that
President Clinton's offenses, however serious, did not amount to
impeachable ones.
</P>
<P>
   This followed the October release of an open letter, signed by
Wilentz and about 400 fellow historians, that argued much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Both events have sparked debate among historians as to the
propriety of taking sides in a partisan battle. Some critics wonder
whether historians are trying to make history instead of write it.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American Historians, the country's largest
group of professional historians, has issued no official response
to the controversy. But that hasn't stopped individual academics
from debating the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Their opinions, however, have not always reflected their
political interests.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Parmet, a New York author of recent biographies of George
Bush and Richard Nixon, believes Wilentz's appearance, as well as
his message, to be entirely proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historians have responsibilities as citizens, too,'' said
Parmet. ``They should express their points on view of history, just
as lawyers express their views on points of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Smist, chairman of the political science department at
Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Mo., is a longtime Democrat who
voted for Clinton. But he feels differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historians should be there as resources,'' said Smist. ``But
to take the lead, as these historians did, suggests a hubris that
is unwarranted and unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed to think that historians would choose to get
involved in a very partisan debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Smist argues that when historians enter the fray as Wilentz has
done, they damage the efforts of those who want to portray the
social sciences _ such as history _ to be as neutral as the
physical sciences, such as biology and chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When historians take positions like the ones they are taking
here, they are getting away from that ideal,'' Smist said.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians, in recent years, have not been shy about taking
sides in controversies. In 1994, Truman biographer David McCullough
led an ad hoc group of historians, preservationists and
environmentalists in protesting a proposed 3,000-acre Disney
history theme park slated to be built near a Civil War battlefield
site in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Disney later backed down.
</P>
<P>
   That case focused, however, on preservation of a historical
resource.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Arthur Schlesinger, one of the 400 who signed
Wilentz's letter, worked in the Kennedy White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hechler, a former special assistant to Harry S. Truman, has
West Virginia's secretary of state for the past 14 years. He was a
U.S. representative for 18 years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that didn't stop him from writing ``Working With Truman,'' a
memoir that was reprinted in 1996 by the University of Missouri
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historians not only have a right but an obligation to speak
out on issues that concern them,'' Hechler said. ``They ought to
offer their superior perspective and knowledge on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hechler, for the record, agrees with Wilentz that Clinton's
offenses are not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   Even a century ago, historians fit the description of
propagandists.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most spectacular local example was John Newman
Edwards, a former Confederate soldier who later went on to write
for The Kansas City Times and serve as a vivid historian of that
cause. Edwards' 1867 book, ``Shelby and His Men,'' described the
exploits of Confederate Gen. Joseph Shelby, who took his soldiers
to Mexico at the end of the Civil War rather than surrender.
</P>
<P>
   And Edwards' editorial on the April 1882 murder of outlaw and
former rebel guerrilla fighter Jesse James was the 19th-century
equivalent of scorched-earth rhetoric. Edwards was incensed that
the Missouri governor played a role James' assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tear the bears from the flag of Missouri,'' Edwards wrote in a
Sedalia newspaper. ``Put thereon in place of them as more
appropriate, a thief blowing out the brains of an unarmed victim,
and a brazen harlot, naked to the waist and splashed to the brows
in blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, those following the Clinton impeachment proceedings can
consider the testimony of Sean Wilentz as only one more opinion,
said Hechler.
</P>
<P>
   But for Washington not to allow historians the chance to offer
their wisdom to the world is short-sighted, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Harry Truman said, the only thing new in the world is the
history that you haven't read,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Election Commission decided Wednesday
that President Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole won't
have to repay millions of tax dollars for breaking the spending
limits in their 1996 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting advice from its staff auditors and attorneys, the FEC
decided against ordering Dole to repay nearly $18 million and
Clinton about $7 million of the taxpayer funds they used in 1996.
Instead, commissioners began a series of votes that will reduce the
maximum repayment figures to less than $4 million for Dole and less
than $100,000 for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Claus came early for Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,''
grumbled Russell Verney, national chairman of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gross, attorney for the Dole campaign, retorted, ``I think
what happened is that Scrooge came in early with the staff report,
and now they're rejecting him.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said that as a practical matter, Wednesday's FEC action
``means there is no longer any regulatory limit on spending by
political parties to influence a presidential election prior to the
day that the candidate is actually nominated at a convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The FEC staff had charged that each candidate broke the spending
limit he agreed to as a condition of getting the federal funds. The
staff said the candidates evaded the limit by having his party's
national committee pay for millions of dollars' worth of extra
campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   However, in two key votes Wednesday by the six political
appointees on the commission:
</P>
<P>
   All six voted for a technical motion that reduced the maximum
repayment order that could be imposed against Dole to about $7
million _ the same level as Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Only two commissioners _ Democrats Scott Thomas and Danny
McDonald _ supported the staff's finding that the commission has
authority to order a candidate involved in ``excessive spending''
to repay part of his federal funds. That is short of the four votes
required for the FEC to issue any repayment order.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing them were Republicans David Mason, Darryl Wold and Lee
Ann Elliott, who voted to deny that the commission has such
authority. Democrat Karl Sandstrom, who said he thinks the
commission has the authority but should not exercise it, abstained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, from now on, there won't be four votes for any
repayments related to alleged excess spending,'' said Lyn Utrecht,
attorney for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Formal votes at which the commission can eliminate the rest of
that type of repayment order were set for Thursday. Preliminary
estimates indicated that would cut the $7 million maximum liability
at least in half for Dole and to less than $100,000 for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will consider reducing those figures further when
reviewing its auditors' recommendations on matters other than
excess spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission moved in the right direction,'' said Dole
attorney Gross. ``But I'm not counting my chickens before they
hatch.''

HERE'S TO A STATE SENATOR WHO UNDERSTANDS HONESTY IN PUBLIC
POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: _ It's a bit early for year-end awards ceremonies, but
a Missouri state senator is a cinch to win 1998's Diogenes Award.
</P>
<P>
   Diogenes, legend has it, plied the streets of Athens with a
lighted lamp in daylight looking for an honest person.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Diogenes, meet David Klarich, who wants Missouri voters to
decide whether the state's share of the tobacco extortion windfall
should be rebated to taxpayers or entrusted to government.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri stands to receive $6.7 billion over 25 years as a
result of the tobacco industry's $206 billion settlement with state
governments. Klarich, a Republican from Ballwin, believes the money
would be subject to the Hancock Amendment, which limits state
revenue growth. Klarich says he's pursuing a vote on the issue to
prevent a court battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too important for the big spenders of the state to
decide,'' Klarich said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Hear, hear!
</P>
<P>
   If the state is allowed control of the windfall, it probably
will evolve into a source of patronage and vote-buying to promote
politically correct vogue causes as they come to the fore. These
will no doubt change because a quarter of a century is a long, long
time.
</P>
<P>
   The current administration is indicating a spending preference
for anti-smoking initiatives. This is predictable, because the
rationale for mugging the tobacco industry was to recoup public
money spent remedying health problems suffered by smokers.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded plausible, except for overlooking the considerable
research showing that tobacco users more than pay their way. Not
only do they live shorter than average lives, and thus consume less
government resources, but they also pay humongous taxes on their
tobacco purchases while alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, big tobacco decided to cut the best deal it could
rather than fight forever. The tobacco business is, after all, a
money machine. Besides, most of the tab probably will be picked up
by those who can't get along without the product because their
dedication to their habit is nothing short of fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way smokers have taken the recent per-pack price
increase of four bits or so in stride, there doesn't seem to be any
limit to how much committed puffers will pay for their smokes.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Klarich's proposal so attractive is its bedrock
honesty. When governments decided to extort money from a highly
unpopular business, it was essentially committing theft in the name
of the citizenry. If the people were willing to be complicit in
this taking of another's property because it was politically
possible, then the money should be returned to those in whose name
the money was taken.
</P>
<P>
   There once was a quaint idea abroad in this fair land that
nothing, absolutely nothing, justified taking something that didn't
belong to you. Government's legitimization of greed, however, has
since superseded moral, ethical and religious admonitions against
such behavior and made it not only legal, but also respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Given public attitudes, it's impossible to believe Missourians
would vote to allow state government to keep the money. This is how
it should be. What distinguishes Klarich is that he's honest enough
to acknowledge the taxpayer's right to a first claim on the loot.

LIBERAL STATE ELECTION LAWS THWART FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under federal election law, a corporation cannot
make a direct contribution to Sen. John Ashcroft, and even through
a political action committee, it could kick in no more than
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are Virginia's election laws.
</P>
<P>
   Using that state's vastly different legal thresholds, the House
of Lloyd, a Grandview, Mo.-based direct sales gift company concern,
was able to give the Missouri Republican $400,000 last summer.
</P>
<P>
   That check helped pay for an advertising blitz to promote
Ashcroft's $1.7 trillion tax cut program in Iowa and New Hampshire,
two early presidential states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mind-boggling amount compared to the (federal) legal
limit,'' said Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign,
a public interest group concerned about campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly ethical,'' said Tony Trimble, the attorney for
Ashcroft's Virginia PAC, American Values, which accepted the
contribution. ``It's clearly in accordance with the law and with
the legal and permissible uses of contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft _ like several other would-be presidential contenders _
had found a way to legally step around federal financial limits on
campaigning: Incorporate a political action committee in a state
where campaign rules are extremely lax compared to Washington's.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, individuals are allowed to contribute up to
$2,000 to a candidate and up to $10,000 to political action
committees for a two-year election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The $400,000 House of Lloyd check may be the largest single
donation that any individual or corporation made to a political
action committee associated with one politician during the 1997-98
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Saul Kass, vice president and senior adviser at House of Lloyd,
confirmed that the company made the $400,000 contribution to
Ashcroft's American Values political action committee, as Virginia
records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Kass was quoted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as characterizing
Ashcroft as a ``man who has religious principles and fights for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the man,'' Kass said. ``We think he'd make an
excellent president.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said the senator and the Lloyd family have been friendly
for many years, and the Lloyds have been supportive of his focus on
traditional values as a political message. The firm was founded by
Harry Lloyd, who died last year after building his company into a
leader in the field of direct-sales marketing. Lloyd also created
the Loch Lloyd Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   He said the liberal nature of state laws enables potential
presidential candidates to more freely spend money to help other
candidates and bring about political change.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows large contributions if the money collected is
used for ``issue advocacy'' as opposed to ads saying vote for a
specific candidate, Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go into a state like Iowa, like North Carolina, South
Carolina, like New Hampshire,'' Trimble said, ``and you can impact
the future of policy-making extensively by being there early, by
using that money to energize volunteers, assisting candidates who
are running for state office, and really having a massive effect on
the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans considering a White House bid, including
former Vice President Dan Quayle and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, have incorporated similar PACs in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has been traveling the country for more than a year,
gauging the extent of support for a campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination. He plans to announce his intentions Jan.
5, but several people close to his camp have indicated that he
probably will run. He also intends to run for re-election in 2000
to his Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Ashcroft will need a lot of money, particularly if
he is running two campaigns, at least for a while. State law allows
him to run for both seats until he wins or loses the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Most estimates put the cost of a presidential primary campaign
at a minimum of $20 million. A competitive Senate race, as his
re-election battle promises to be _ he will likely face Democratic
Gov. Mel Carnahan _ could cost upward of $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has another political action committee, the Spirit of
America PAC, which he has used to finance his travel on behalf of
other candidates. As of mid-October, that PAC had raised nearly $2
million this year. His American Values PAC has raised $508,150,
according to Virginia records.
</P>
<P>
   Financial disclosure advocates argue that liberal state laws
like Virginia's thwart the intent of the federal controls and turn
campaign financing into a shell game.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having this sort of secret method of moving money from
committee to committee, it's a great way to avoid scrutiny and
disclosure and keep voters and the public in the dark,'' said
Charles Lewis, director of the Center for Public Integrity. ``I
think that's antithetical to democracy.''

THE MUSE OF SHAKESPEARE IMAGINED AS A BLONDE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many things about William Shakespeare's life and work are
shrouded in mystery, but the mystery of what scholars call his lost
years is one of the most intriguing of all. What did Shakespeare do
between 1585, when he is known to have left his home in
Stratford-on-Avon, and 1592, when he re-emerged in London,
described as an ``upstart crow'' in the account of a rival
playwright?
</P>
<P>
   And how did he make the enormous artistic leap between his early
plays, flawed works like the bloody ``Titus Andronicus,'' and his
romantic masterpiece, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' first performed in
1594?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure, and ``Shakespeare in Love'' provides a
fanciful explanation by imagining the young Shakespeare (Joseph
Fiennes) as a nearly unknown actor and playwright who finds his
poetic voice through a passionate love affair with one Viola De
Lesseps, a woman as clever as she is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   That Viola never actually existed, and that she is played by the
certifiably American Gwyneth Paltrow (albeit with a plausible
English accent), didn't matter to the filmmakers. The movie, which
opened on Friday, is meant to be a high-entertainment mix of fact
and fiction, combining a modern sensibility with Shakespearean
language and period flourishes, full of the double meanings and sly
jokes that characterize the work of Tom Stoppard, its co-writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's glorious is that so little is known about this period
that you're not trapped by any kind of historical circumstance,''
said John Madden, the director, who is accustomed to reading
between the lines of English history, his most recent film having
been ``Mrs. Brown,'' which explored the relationship between Queen
Victoria and one of her equerries.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Shakespeare was seen as some sort of hack; his
genius was just being recognized,'' Madden said. ``One of the great
things is to catch him at this moment, when he wasn't the Bard,
when he was just a jobbing actor trying to make his way while
suffering from the kind of pressures that we all suffer from. At
the same time, he has this genius that he could just turn on like a
tap.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it like to play a man whose myth now looms so large in
our literary consciousness? Fiennes said he soon got over any
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare is often portrayed as a boring, iconic, almost
mythical person,'' said Fiennes, 28. ``But I embraced Tom's script
because it gives him a warmer, more generous human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a darker side to Shakespeare, one that is touched
on in the film as the playwright freely lifts plot and character
ideas from other people and mines his experiences for his art.
</P>
<P>
   ``His love affair is real and profound, and he's lost in the
chaos,'' Fiennes said, ``but at the same time he's almost a leech,
constantly looking for copy and almost making things happen in
order to get a story.''
</P>
<P>
   The formidable cast also includes Ms. Paltrow's boyfriend, Ben
Affleck, as Ned Alleyn, the actor playing Mercutio in the
play-within-the-film version of ``Romeo and Juliet''; Geoffrey Rush
as Philip Henslowe, the theatrical producer; Rupert Everett as the
playwright Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare's archrival, and a
roll-call of British character actors: Imelda Staunton as Viola's
nurse and confidante; the hunky Colin Firth as Viola's unpleasant
fiance, the Earl of Wessex, and Judi Dench as a haughty but
feminist Queen Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens to a theatrical crisis. The wolves are at the
door: Henslowe, who runs the Rose Theater, is trying to beat back
competition from its rival, the Curtain, but he is heavily in debt
and desperately in need of a hit. He hopes that Shakespeare, his
current playwright-for-hire, will come through with a play that
gives the public what it seems to want: a romance, a shipwreck and
some slapstick humor involving an unruly dog.
</P>
<P>
   But Shakespeare's play, tentatively titled ``Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter,'' is not being written. Bereft of
inspiration, Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block, sitting
in his garret in London, throwing page after page of his work into
the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not until he meets Viola and falls instantly, heavily, in
love that he finds the muse he has longed for. As the two enter
into a steamy, illicit affair _ she is rich and has a fiance; he is
poor and has a wife back home _ he finds that words of love and
longing and poetry are flowing, as if by magic, from his quill. And
the play he ends up writing, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' is different
from anything he, or anyone else, has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare was doing something radical for his time,'' said
Marc Norman, the Hollywood screenwriter who conceived the plot some
years ago (one of his sons gave him the idea), wrote the initial
script and is credited as co-writer with Stoppard. ``Playwrights
writing in that period all adhered to the notion that comedies were
comedies and tragedies were tragedies, that a comedy is a story
about love that ends in marriage, and that a tragedy ends in death.
But in `Romeo and Juliet,' Shakespeare was starting with a comedy
and ending with a tragedy, and nobody had ever done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   To Norman, the most interesting question surrounding the play
was how Shakespeare was able to leave his more immature work behind
and create a piece of such grace and power. ``I started to wonder
what caused him to do that, what caused him to make that choice,''
Norman said. ``I thought, `What if he had a love affair with a
woman who inspired him in the course of writing the play?'''
</P>
<P>
   After Norman's initial script, in the early 1990s, Tom Stoppard,
the witty and erudite playwright who has supplemented
intellectually challenging plays like ``Arcadia'' and ``The
Invention of Love'' with a succession of screenplays (``Empire of
the Sun'' and ``Brazil,'' among others) was brought in for rewrites
(the project then languished in Hollywood limbo for some years,
moving from Universal to Miramax).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The resulting film is unmistakably Stoppardian, existing on
several levels at once, made for a 20th-century audience but full
of Elizabethan-era in-jokes and allusions to Shakespeare's and
others' works.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Stoppard has Shakespeare speaking lines from his own
plays as dialogue in his daily life, and at times he interjects
very modern witticisms about the plight of writers (Shakespeare is
forever being mistaken for the far more famous and successful
Marlowe) and the absurd vanity that pervades the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also forms a loose parallel to a Shakespearean play
itself, lacing its comic elements with semitragedy, cross-dressing
(Viola defies Elizabethan convention and fools even Shakespeare by
auditioning for ``Romeo and Juliet'' dressed as a boy), and even
the odd sword fight or two. A number of details are also thrown in
for the benefit of those familiar with Elizabethan cultural
history.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a scene in which Shakespeare practices
writing his name and then settles on the now-much-reproduced form
of his signature, and there is the emergence of a minor character,
a boy named John Roberts who plays with rats and enjoys the theater
only for its blood and gore. The joke is that he's the same John
Roberts who will go on to write works like ``The Duchess of
Malfi,'' the Jacobean horror play.
</P>
<P>
   But Madden, the director, is at pains to make it clear that
knowing about Shakespeare and his time are not necessary to
enjoying the film. ``The screenplay has been carefully crafted so
that everyone can catch up and understand it and follow it,'' he
said. ``For anyone who wants to spot the references, they're all
there, but that absolutely must not be a requirement for seeing the
film. They're a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that the need to tone down the erudition to widen
the film's appeal might have sat heavily with the clever Stoppard.
But he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, he said.
``Broadly speaking, in theater the director is there to do his best
to serve the writer, and in movies the writer is there to serve the
director,'' he said. ``I wear a very different writing hat in
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It's an interesting medium, popular film,
because it's not a homogeneous audience. They get quite schizoid,
and they don't know whether they're making the film for the critic
of The New Yorker or someone who's had a busy day in Newark and
wants to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Stoppard enjoyed not having to worry about
historical accuracy. Among other things, he was free to make up
characters that didn't exist, invent scenes that never happened
(between Marlowe and Shakespeare, for instance), and play around
with the essence of his real-life characters in his own
imagination, something he has done in many of his plays (he has
also fooled around with Shakespeare before, in ``Rosencranz And
Guildenstern Are Dead'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a special take on historical accuracy, which is that
all supposed historical truths are temporary, meaning they're
always there to be modified in the light of subsequent
discoveries,'' Stoppard said. ``But this film is entertainment,
which doesn't require it to be justified in the light of historical
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who love the theater, the film also provides ample
opportunity to laugh at the vanity and puffery that surround the
acting world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has lived his life in the theater and been around that
breed,'' Madden said of Stoppard. ``He has a wonderfully accurate
eye and ear for the kind of little fabrications that actors tell
each other. It was very nice to have the opportunity to send all of
that up from a historical perspective, where you see the beginnings
of modern show business developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people involved in the film also found another of
its premises _ that a passionate love affair stirs writerly
creativity, rather than so exhausting the writer that he spends his
days sleeping off his long nights _ very seductive. Stoppard, for
one, has always found that to be true. ``I think it happily works
both ways,'' he said. ``A successful good day's work is a good
aphrodisiac, and a successful night's lovemaking is quite an
inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' closes with a neat premise, that
Shakespeare continues to draw inspiration from his romance,
immortalizing her in ``The Tempest.'' ``That's a very romantic
thought,'' Stoppard said, ``that she never grows old and never
dies.''

JUDGES URGE BAR TO PRESS FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (EDS: DUPLICATION WARNING _ A similar version of this story moved
over the weekend.) 
(nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Judges feel under attack these days, and there is
ample evidence that they are: threats of impeachment over unpopular
rulings, negative campaigns that mischaracterize the records of
state judges who need voter approval to stay in office, and
legislative struggles over budgets and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Constrained by tradition, ethical rules and a lack of political
leverage from doing much to defend themselves, judges have looked
for allies, and they are beginning to find powerful ones. The
American Bar Association has started a project intended to increase
public understanding and support for judicial independence, a
concept that ``recedes into the background like the wallpaper in
your living room, but at times of conflict and stress leaps into
the foreground,'' as Colin Diver, dean of the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, told a group that met here the other day
to begin the project.
</P>
<P>
   Two Supreme Court justices joined 120 other judges, bar leaders
and legal scholars here for the first of three conferences to take
place over the next five months. Thirty state court chief justices
attended or sent other judges or representatives of their courts to
this first meeting, co-sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in judicial independence, you believe in
freedom,'' U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy told the
group. ``The bar must support the judiciary in its cause when it is
under attack,'' he said, adding: ``Judges do not have political
clout. They need the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not everyone at the invitation-only conference agreed on
the dimensions of the problem, there was widespread agreement with
a definition offered by Justice Adolpho A. Birch Jr., a member and
former chief justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court: ``Judicial
independence is the judge's right to do the right thing or,
believing it to be the right thing, to do the wrong thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the gathering were undoubtedly Kennedy and his
Supreme Court colleague, Justice Stephen G. Breyer. Their decision
to travel here both underscored and validated the concerns of the
other judges, particularly those who ``are only an election cycle,
at most, away from unemployment,'' as Judge Wendell L. Griffen of
the Arkansas Court of Appeals described the vulnerability felt by
state judges who must face the voters either for election or for
retention in office.
</P>
<P>
   Most state judges are elected, and there was considerable
discussion about the threats to the image of an independent
judiciary posed by negative campaigns and by the judicial
candidates' need to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   One judge who described her own experience was Kate Ford Elliott
of the Pennsylvania Superior Court, who lost a race for the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court last year after her opponent ran an
advertisement in the last four days of the campaign accusing her of
having ``let criminals loose on technicalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott remained on the Superior Court, an intermediate
appellate court. ``I don't decide Microsoft versus Netscape,'' she
said at a panel discussion of judicial elections. ``I decide
whether Joe Smith gets to have his child for the weekend,'' and
similar cases ``very important for people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're allowed to do that because people trust us,'' she
continued, asking how a judge ``can ever maintain that covenant of
trust'' after enduring a reputation-damaging political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Harold F. See of the Alabama Supreme Court held the
group spellbound with a videotape of the attack advertisements that
his opponent ran against him in a 1996 race. Over the image of a
skunk nosing through the underbrush, the narration called See ``a
slick Chicago lawyer'' who never passed the Alabama bar exam. In
fact, he had taught for 20 years at the University of Alabama Law
School and was admitted to the Alabama bar without having to take
the exam. See spent $2.4 million and won the election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of such experiences, state judges rarely express much
sympathy for federal judges, protected as they are by life tenure.
Yet several scholars at the conference observed that life tenure, a
very rare arrangement among the world's judicial systems, was
itself a source of political vulnerability for judges who are
easily portrayed as arrogant in their insularity and
unaccountability.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there was one incident that galvanized the current
concern over judicial independence, it was the bipartisan attack,
early in the 1996 election year, on a federal district judge in New
York, Harold Baer Jr. In a decision questioning the credibility of
New York City police offices, Baer had ruled that police lacked an
adequate basis to pull over and search a car and that the 80 pounds
of cocaine and heroin the officers found could not be used as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After Republicans, including the party's eventual presidential
nominee, Bob Dole, denounced Baer, who was a recent Clinton
appointee, Clinton's spokesman suggested that the president might
seek the judge's resignation. Within a few weeks, Baer reconsidered
the case and reversed his own ruling.
</P>
<P>
   That episode, as well as subsequent calls by several Republicans
in Congress for the impeachment of federal judges on the basis of
their rulings, led a number of organizations, including the
American Judicature Society and the Century Foundation, formerly
the Twentieth Century Fund, to organize projects on judicial
independence. The Century Foundation's bipartisan group, Citizens
for Independent Courts, plans to issue a report in June on several
related issues, including how to define the line between legitimate
criticism and intimidation of judges.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks to the group here, Breyer stressed his view
that judicial independence exists not for the benefit of judges,
but of the people. ``Judicial independence is in part a state of
mind,'' he said, ``a matter of expectation, habit and belief among
not just judges, lawyers and legislators, but millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I don't think judges can help'' in their own
cause because judges' views are easily dismissed as ``institutional
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes up to others to do the explaining,'' Breyer told
the bar leaders and law professors, adding, ``That's why you're
here.''

COMMENTARY: TRUST THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the House sent the charges against President
Clinton to the Senate for trial, said White House counsel Charles
Ruff, it would be ``putting the country through the horror that we
all know would follow.'' Trying the president on such charges would
be ``a nightmare for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what has become the essence of Clinton's case against
impeachment: horror. Nightmare. And how long would the unbearable
senatorial torture have to be endured? Four months, say some; other
Clintonites direly warn that the country would be ``paralyzed''
most of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, say the scaremongers; because the chief justice
of the United States would preside at the trial, the Supreme Court
would be out of business, too.
</P>
<P>
   This drumbeat of alarm is noisy malarkey. When asked when the
Senate would take up an impeachment if one came over from the
House, Majority Leader Trent Lott answered, ``Jan. 6.'' How long
would the trial take? ``Three days to three weeks,'' was his
estimate. They'd have to work Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be in the Senate's interest to drag out the proceeding?
Hardly; its members know the majority of the public wants to turn
away from the tawdry business of what Rep. Barney Frank calls ``who
touched what.'' Lott speaks for the Republican desire for dispatch,
and surely Democratic leader Tom Daschle _ who has more than the
needed 34 votes for acquittal _ would not filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's greatest deliberative body'' would deliberate
intelligently. Ruff, a confirmed stonewaller but an eloquent
advocate, would be heard out in defense of legalism. Henry Hyde or
some other manager from the House would educate the public about
the sanctity of the oath.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Senate, unwilling to either remove or exonerate the
president, would work out a resolution of censure. The House would
agree and send it to the president for his signature. That would be
his confession and his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   That would not be a horrific nightmare. It could be over in time
for the State of the Union address. The Supreme Court would not
miss a beat. Why, then, the phony scare campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Because Democrats do not want the historic black mark of House
impeachment placed against a Democratic president. They want only
censure of sin _ and we're all sinners, ``everybody does it'' _ not
of the crime of perjury connected to the higher crime of abuse of
power, which not everybody does.
</P>
<P>
   Why are most Republicans willing to take a public-relations
beating to insist on bringing the president to a limited form of
constitutional account? Because this would not be Censure Lite;
impeachment in the knowledge of no Senate removal is censure most
serious.
</P>
<P>
   And what drives the impeachers? Not blind Clinton-hatred or pure
partisanship or blood-lusting bluenose-ism. There's a context to
this that Ken Starr failed to summon: This specific, demonstrable
crime is emblematic of a five-year series of abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr failed to file thorough and timely reports on Filegate and
Travelgate and will let Clinton get away with hushing up Web
Hubbell in Whitewater. Janet Reno, defying FBI and Justice
professionals, is letting Clinton off scot-free in his conspiracy
to break the election law and solicit Asian money. His success in
slipping away from judgment is, in his lawyer's word,
``maddening,'' and he remains in a state of mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   This rankles. Poetic justice is not genuine justice, and rough
justice is not as smooth as a gifted line of perjury, but escaped
chickens have a way of coming home to roost. The narrow but
definable set of crimes the House is now dealing with is a
synecdoche for all the abuses he has been and is getting away with,
as well as his sustained contempt of Congress and the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the people who have been following this Houdini-like
performance want the Censure Serious: House impeachment without
Senate removal.
</P>
<P>
   We should not let Clinton put a scare into us about national
paralysis. Trust the Senate; it won't happen. The House should put
a scare into him that will deter future presidents from playing
fast and loose with the truth.

SOUTH AFRICAN SCIENTISTS FIND WELL-PRESERVED EARLY HUMAN FOSSIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a discovery that may answer some of the ``missing link''
questions of human evolution, scientists in South Africa have found
what they describe as the best preserved and most nearly complete
skull and skeleton yet seen of any very early member of the human
family tree.
</P>
<P>
   The head-to-toe fossil remains of a four-foot-tall being who
lived sometime between 3.2 million and 3.6 million years ago were
uncovered in the depths of a limestone cave near Johannesburg, the
discoverers announced Wednesday. The specimen is older and much
more complete than the famous ``Lucy'' skeleton found in Ethiopia
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists will not be able to identify the species of this
hominid, or human forerunner, until all the bones are removed from
the rock layers where they are embedded in the Sterkfontein cave,
the site of many discoveries of early-human remains. But the
scientists already know enough, they say, to be excited about what
the fossils may tell them concerning the anatomy and evolution of
early human ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of many missing links from ape to man,'' Dr. Ronald
J. Clarke, a paleontologist at the University of Witwatersrand in
Johnannesburg, said at a news conference there. A brief
announcement about the skeleton is appearing in the Thursday issue
of the journal Nature. A detailed description of the find was
published in the South African Journal of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke made the original discovery, of foot bones from the
skeleton, in 1994 and came upon more pieces in a university
storeroom. Then he led excavations at the cave that uncovered the
long limbs, the torso and the almost complete skull, including both
jaws with full sets of teeth in place.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, his mentor, Dr. Phillip V. Tobias,
also a Witwatersrand paleontologist, said: ``It really is a
magnificent specimen. It's the first time we have a virtually
complete skeleton of an australopithecine, or ape man. It's the
most important find in paleontology in Africa since the Taung
child.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the Taung child's skull in South Africa in 1925
led to the classification of small-brain protohumans in the genus
Australopithecus and set in motion this century's explorations of
human origins in Africa. Several other paleontologists, though
impressed by the new find, were not yet ready to agree on so lofty
an assessment of its significance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps of greatest potential importance, paleontologists said,
the new Sterkfontein skeleton should yield insights into a time of
transition in hominid locomotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ample evidence has shown that australopithecines were walking
upright by this time, but the first traces of this skeleton _ the
four bones of an instep and beginning of the big toe _ suggested
that this species was also capable of grasping and climbing like a
chimpanzee. These upright walkers on the ground might have fled
back into the trees for safety or foraging.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is the same chap we called `little foot' in 1995,''
Tobias said, and Clarke added, ``It's important that for the first
time, we will be able to relate locomotion inferred from limb bones
with a skull.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found evidence of upright walking, or
bipedality, in hominid fossils as much as 4 million years old,
which is about 1 million to 3 million years after the hominid line
split from the ancestors of the chimpanzees and gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   Once the newly discovered bones are removed for closer
examination, one of the first things paleontologists will study are
the hip and leg structures, to see if they bear out the
tree-climbing theory, advanced by Dr. Jack T. Stern and Dr. Randall
L. Susman, anatomists at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Susman said the skeleton discovery was ``very,
very fascinating and extremely important'' because it seemed to
``hammer home the idea that these early hominids had small body
sizes and were climbing trees if they got in a jam and wanted to
escape.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susman, who recently returned from a visit to the
Witwatersrand paleontologists, said he suspected that Clarke, in an
earlier interpretation, had overemphasized the Sterkfontein
individual's strong chimplike anatomy and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Susman said he doubted that the specimen would turn out to be
much more primitive than Lucy, a representative of the
Australopithecus afarensis species that seems to have spanned a
period of almost a million years, up until about 3 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. F. Clark Howell, a paleontologist at the University of
California at Berkeley, lauded Clarke for his determination in
tracking down almost all the skeleton. ``The fact that the whole
skeleton seems to be there is little short of incredible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   From what the discoverers could determine, the individual _
whether it is male or female has not been determined _ probably was
walking or running when it fell into a 45-foot shaft leading to the
floor of the cave. The victim either died in the fall or was
injured and unable to get out of the cave, eventually dying there
of starvation and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the anatomy, working out details of stature,
estimated body mass and other characteristics, Howell said that
scientists should be able to gain ``a much better appreciation of
the life history and behavior of an early hominid, compared to
chimps.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South African journal article, Clarke wrote, ``I prefer
to reserve judgment on the fossil's exact taxonomic affinities,
although it does appear to be a form of Australopithecus.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said it is more than likely an A. afarensis like the
3.2 million-year-old Lucy. If so, this would be the first evidence
that these so-called early ape-men extended far beyond East Africa
to the southern reaches of the continent, suggesting a possibly
wider role of afarensis at a pivotal time in human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Or the skeleton could be more directly related to
Australopithecus africanus, a southern African species. But the new
fossils are considerably older than any known africanus specimens,
usually dated between 2.5 million and 3 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If africanus turned out to be that old, it would mean that it
could not be a descendant of Lucy's afarensis kin, which are
considered by many paleontologists to be the common ancestor of all
subsequent australopithecines and eventually all Homo species.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucy skeleton, discovered by Dr. Donald Johanson, now with
the Institute of Human Origins in Tempe, Ariz., is only 40 percent
complete, with mere fragments of the skull remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest complete skeleton before this discovery is a tall,
young Homo erectus that lived 1.6 million years ago and was
discovered in Kenya by Richard E. Leakey, of the famous
fossil-hunting family, and Dr. Alan Walker, who is now at
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterkfontein skeleton may even turn out to be an entirely
new species. Clarke said it would take at least another year of
painstaking excavations to extract all the bones for a more
searching analysis.

ECONOMIC SCENE: NO DANGER SEEN IN EXXON-MOBIL MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposed $80 billion merger between Exxon and Mobil raises a
question: At what point does a company get so big that its size
alone becomes a nightmare for consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal have called it ``Rockefeller's Revenge,''
contending that this and other oil mergers threaten to stitch back
together the pieces of Standard Oil Co., broken up in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   But the historical analogy is vapid. Exxon-Mobil would control
only about 13 percent of the U.S. market. Besides, it is the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, not private oil
companies, that controls 40 percent of the world oil market and
sets price and output targets. As a group, the private companies
help keep OPEC in line, but none controls much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   It is for those reasons that Morris Adelman, an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, regards the expected
antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission ``as an
exercise in trivial pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelman no doubt exaggerates. But the FTC would hard pressed to
persuade a court to block the merger. For starters, bigness is
irrelevant to the antitrust law. Only competition matters. And
while companies have grown bigger over the decades, markets have
not grown significantly less competitive. In effect, there are more
big companies competing against one another.
</P>
<P>
   F. Michael Scherer of Harvard University provides unpublished
estimates of the trends in concentration. In 1947, he calculates,
around 25 percent of the nation's manufacturing output came from
highly concentrated industries. By 1992, the number had risen to
only about 28 percent. Measured differently, the four largest
manufacturing companies in an industry typically controlled about
35 percent of sales in 1947. By 1972, the percentage had risen to
39 percent and did not budge through 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of oil, there is also evidence that bigness helps
consumers. Matthew Simmons, an energy investment banker, says that
data from company reports show that the largest oil companies spend
less on exploration and production for every barrel of oil than do
smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, an
economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass, argues that mergers,
by cutting exploration and production costs, ultimately will lead
to lower prices for consumers. He also argues oil companies have to
become huge, undertaking many projects, in order to spread the risk
of putting up the vast sums of money that are now required to
explore for oil reserves. Laying pipeline from the Caspian Sea
through Turkey, or drilling more than a thousand feet down in the
Gulf of Mexico require investments measured in the billions.
Indeed, it takes massive investment just to stay alive in the oil
business. The Simmons data show that 10 large oil companies have
spent over $26 billion a year over the last 10 years to boost
output by a mere one percent a year, a process Simmons describes as
``running just to stay in place.
</P>
<P>
   But do the large companies achieve low production costs because
they are large, or are these companies large because they knew how
to find and drill oil cheaply? And there are also reasons to be
skeptical about some of the industry's claims. Companies the size
of Mobil that contend that they cannot find the money to make risky
investment make little sense, Adelman says. Oil companies have been
allowed to create joint ventures, free of antitrust challenge, to
explore for oil in specific locations. They do not need to merge
their entire operations.
</P>
<P>
   With the Exxon-Mobil merger, there are uncontroversial antitrust
issues that the FTC will handle with relative ease. There are
regions, like the Northeast, where a combination of the two
companies would monopolize the retail gas market. Their refineries
dominate parts of the South. But the FTC has a successful record
forcing oil companies that merge to divest enough gas stations,
refineries and terminals to preserve competition. Exxon and Mobil
expect such orders.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue at the exploration and production end of the
industry cannot be so easily resolved. Perhaps the easiest way to
think about the FTC's deliberations is to imagine the world oil
market after Asia rebounds and oil prices begin to recover from
their recent 40 percent nose dive. At that point, would OPEC have a
harder time imposing its will on the market if it faced competition
from eight major private oil companies, as would be true today, or
if the number of competitors shrank by two, if British Petroleum is
allowed to merge with Amoco and Exxon to merge with Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   Said another way, would OPEC plus six be substantially worse for
consumers than OPEC plus eight? The problem gets more complicated
still, given that Saudi Arabia has recently hinted that it might be
prepared to invite the major companies back into their domestic oil
operations. Adelman loses no sleep over the prospect of OPEC plus
six. Other economists are less sure.
</P>
<P>
   If the economics of the Exxon-Mobil merger poses no grave
threat, there is a danger nonetheless. The threat to consumers of
huge companies can be offset by the presence of rivals, big or
small. But there is no similar offset in the political sphere.
Given the nation's porous campaign finance laws, huge companies
exert oversized influence. That is not a problem the antitrust can
or should solve. But it goes a long way to explain why megamergers
make Americans cringe even if, as Adelman says, the economic threat
is trivial. &QL;

PERJURY ISSUE POSES TANTALIZING DEAL FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It seems like a tantalizing deal for the White
House. Some potential swing-vote Republicans say that if President
Clinton would admit he committed perjury when he said he had no
sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, they would vote
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of the nation, I ask you to come forward, admit
that you lied under oath and indicate that you are prepared to face
the consequences of your actions,'' Representative Bob Franks, a
New Jersey Republican, wrote Clinton recently, suggesting such a
move would lead him to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton aides fear a trap. If Clinton makes such a
statement, they fear, then other Republicans might seize on it as a
rationale for impeachment, and a prosecutor might use it to indict
Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   All of this raises two key questions: Did Clinton commit
perjury? And if he did, is that an impeachable act? The answers may
well determine the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans say it is obvious that Clinton committed
perjury, noting that he flatly denied any sexual relationship with
Lewinsky. But the president's lawyers respond that Clinton's sworn
statement in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit was far short
of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff Wednesday once again refused to
say that Clinton lied, saying instead that ``the president engaged
in an exercise, a hallmark of which was a desire to be as little
help to people on the other side of the Jones case as he could.''
Ruff said that while Clinton may have walked ``up to the line'' of
lying, he was being truthful ``in his mind'' and ``that is the
heart and soul of perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   That is significant because perjury is known as a crime of
intent. Perjury can only be proven if a prosecutor can show the
defendant intended to lie. But while White House aides believed
Ruff's argument against perjury was stellar, it may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that House members can vote for impeachment even
if they don't think Clinton committed perjury in the legal sense,
just as they can vote against impeachment even if they think
Clinton did commit perjury. That is because impeachment is a
political act, not a court case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides of that coin are at work here,'' said former
federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova, a Republican who believes there
is ``no question'' Clinton committed perjury. ``You don't have to
prove a crime to impeach. And even if you believe it is not
technically perjury, you can vote to impeach anyway. This is the
question for the House.''
</P>
<P>
   While Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr has suggested there
are several instances of possible perjury, the main question is
whether Clinton lied under oath when he said he did not have sex
with Lewinsky. Clinton has said that his statement was ``legally
accurate'' because the definition of sexual relations used in the
Jones case was limited. While Clinton has never directly said that
his statement was accurate because he had oral sex with Lewinsky,
that is the rationale put forward by Clinton's lawyers. Oral sex
was not included in the definition of sexual relations used in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans who believe that Clinton committed perjury noted
that Clinton did engage in sexual activities with Lewinsky that
were included in the definition. For example, sexual relations was
defined in the Jones case as including ``contact with the
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any
person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report says Clinton did have such contact with
Lewinsky and lied about it. ``According to Ms. Lewinsky, the
president touched her breasts and genitalia, which means that his
conduct met the Jones definition of sexual relations,'' the Starr
report said.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that would fall within the definition of sexual
relations in the Jones case. The president has not directly
addressed this assertion by Lewinsky. Instead, Clinton's lawyers
have said that Clinton can't be charged with perjury based on the
testimony of a single contradictory witness. Since only Lewinsky
and Clinton witnessed their encounters, there is no way for a third
party to corroborate the extent of their contact.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some Democrats have said the perjury case against
the president comes down to whether Clinton touched Lewinsky in a
certain manner. Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat, has mockingly noted the difference between the famous
Watergate-era question _ What did the president know and when did
he know it? _ and the current question of ``What did the president
touch and when did he touch it?''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Frank said that he believed the president lied when
he said in the deposition that he couldn't remember being alone
with Lewinsky. But if Clinton did lie, Frank said, then he was
alone with Lewinsky. And if he was alone with her, Frank continued,
then no one else could corroborate ``who touched what'' and thus no
one else could say whether Clinton committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans disagreed. Representative Bill McCollum, a
Florida Republican, said Lewinsky talked to seven other people
about her contact with Clinton. ``No matter what anyone else says,
to me that is corroboration,'' McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton did lie in the deposition, Democratic
Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts said, that does not
necessarily mean he committed perjury. Meehan said that because
Clinton did not believe he was lying, and because the statements
were immaterial to the Jones case, the legal standard of perjury
was not met.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Meehan said in an interview that Clinton should
reconsider his refusal to say that he lied. Meehan said that in
addition to Representative Bob Franks of New Jersey, a crucial
number of swing-vote Republicans might oppose impeachment if
Clinton were to admit he lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are enough Republicans who feel that way'' and could
swing the vote against impeachment, ``then Clinton in all
likelihood will have to address it,'' Meehan said. ``The vote is
very, very close.''

CIBA SPECIALTY AND CLARIANT END $7 BILLION MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A month to the day after they announced they would join forces,
Ciba Specialty Chemicals AG and Clariant AG, the two Swiss chemical
companies, said their merger talks had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   If the $7 billion deal had gone through, the merger would have
created the world's largest maker of dyes, additives and other
so-called specialty chemicals, with $13 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would elaborate on the reasons for the broken
engagement. ``There were no catastrophic problems with either
company,'' said Rolf Meyer, Ciba's chairman. ``But putting them
together seemed to change the balance between risks and benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The vagueness contributed to speculation throughout the industry
on the possible reasons. Several analysts suggested the companies
had realized that monopoly commissions overseas might have forced
them to divest themselves of too many assets. And a few suggested
ego clashes at the top of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed deal, Meyer would have become chief executive
of the merged company, while Rolf Schweizer, Clariant's chairman,
would have been chairman. Meyer said that he and Schweizer never
argued over the suggested balance of power, and remain on good
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the media blitz is over we're going to go out and have a
beer,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the merger's collapse may not be confined to Ciba
and Clariant. As long as the two Swiss behemoths were occupied with
integrating their staffs and operations, they would have been
sidelined from the acquisition game. Now analysts expect that each
will be looking for other companies to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have aggressive objectives for top line growth and
returns above the cost of capital, and acquisitions will be the
best way to achieve those,'' said Bardia Mesbah, a chemical
industry consultant at Kline &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts cite Cytec, Morton International, Great Lakes
Chemical and Crompton &AMP; Knowles as potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   The collapsed talks come against a backdrop of depressed stock
prices among chemical companies. The Salomon Smith Barney Specialty
Chemical Index, composed of 61 specialty chemical companies in the
United States, is trading at 14.2 times estimated 1999 earnings;
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is trading at 25 times 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a 43 percent discount to the market, so these stocks
could use an element of merger speculation,'' said Timothy
Gerdemon, Salomon's specialty chemical analyst.
</P>

   Clariant shares fell 11 Swiss francs, to 613, or about $452,

&HT;        SANTORUM OPTIMISTIC FOLLOWING SOCIAL SECURITY CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec 9. -- An unlikely pair emerged together
Wednesday, whispering to each other, at the conclusion of a two-day
White House conference on the future of Social Security: President
Clinton and Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic president might not be ready to jump aboard the
staunchly conservative senator's plan to save Social Security by
investing the funds privately. But the duo were at least listening
to each other's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I had a very good discussion'' Santorum,
R-Pa., said. ``He didn't rule privatization out. He did not close
the door to it. I think it is very beneficial to have developed
this bipartisan working relationship with the president on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he felt the conference was able to advance the
idea of privatization with Clinton and even liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started out going in different directions,'' Santorum
said. ``But they found themselves a lot closer to where I am than I
ever thought possible. It's like a mudslide that throws you back
down together.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference focused on how to prevent the program from going
bankrupt, which officials say will happen in 2032 unless it is
reformed. As early as 2013, the system will be paying out more in
benefits to retirees than it is takes in from taxes on workers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of privatization, Clinton would only remark
publicly at the conference that a system should be created that was
not vulnerable to the volatility of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said reforming Social Security is especially important
to a state like Pennsylvania. ``In Pennsylvania we have one of the
highest concentration of seniors in the country,'' Santorum said.
``It is of course crucial to us at home.''
</P>
<P>
   While 12.6 percent of the nation is 65 years of age or older,
Pennsylvania has 15.9 percent, the third highest percentage of
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Census data, which includes Cambria and Somerset counties in the
Johnstown regional count, said last year 18.7 of the population
here is at least 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he and the president agreed that it is imperative
to increase the rate of return on money coming into Social
Security, other than by the 6.2 percent of each worker's paycheck
that is withheld. Employers kick in an additional matching 6.2
percent for Social Security taxes. All sides represented at the
conference agreed that those taxes should not be increased to meet
the growing demand of Social Security benefits as the baby boomers
retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do it by investing funds, or personal savings
accounts,'' Santorum said. ``He didn't rule anything out. He
referred to my comments about growing wealth among the poor during
the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said that he and the president also agreed reform
should happen sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to propose next month a plan that would allow a worker
to make investments in the stock market, by putting a portion of
their withholding tax in a personal account.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to privatize Social Security is one that has been
typically backed by conservative economists, and shunned by labor
unions and liberal economists.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, who did not attend the
conference, said in a prepared statement that he thought people
would be concerned about the stability and sureness of payments and
opposed to the idea of gambling in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Everett, did not return repeated calls on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the resistance to Santorum's plan, he said he hopes
the president's open-mindedness will influence other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his leadership, a lot of Democrats who were not receptive
to the idea might become so.''

 By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I never invite people over _ it's so
anxiety-producing,'' Ross Bleckner said, contemplating the imminent
arrival of 120 guests, many of them uptown swells who had paid
$1,000 for the privilege of climbing six flights of stairs for
cocktails and dinner with the celebrated artist.
</P>
<P>
   An avowed recluse who resists forays north of 14th Street,
Bleckner was the host of a benefit last week for Community Research
Initiative on AIDS in the minimalist Xanadu that is his home, a
former loft building that he owns in TriBeCa. Pausing for a moment
in his vast fifth-floor kitchen, Bleckner seemed momentarily
transfixed by the play of light and color as caterers laid out 840
bright green asparagus spears on pristine white plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, a dinner downtown for AIDS research is not at the
top of everyone's list,'' said Bleckner, who is the president of
the organization's board. ``It's tough getting all those rich
uptown people down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such implausible expressions of modesty aside, Bleckner, 49, is
not oblivious to his formidable drawing power for many prosperous
New Yorkers: talent, well-connected friends, fame and riches
(though not necessarily in that order). ``I want everyone to feel
like they're getting value, you know _ dinner, a house tour, a
workout,'' said the Long Island-bred artist, whose conversation is
merrily peppered with expletives and who adds the rhetorical
``youknowwhatImean?'' to most sentences.
</P>
<P>
   By ``workout,'' he seemed to refer not to his private gym, but
to the hefty climb required of his guests to reach his penthouse
living room. Fortunately, distractions along the way were
plentiful. Many were captivated by a sofa made of Manhattan
telephone books created by the artist Tom Sachs. ``I guess it's
art, so we better not sit,'' said Richard Mishaan, a guest, who
stared wistfully at the sculpture as he paused for breath.
</P>
<P>
   As others, including Calvin Klein, Diane Von Furstenberg,
Claudia Cohen, the cosmetics entrepreneur Gale Hayman and relatives
of the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli exchanged handshakes
and air kisses, the nervous Bleckner confessed his social strategy.
``The trick is to say as little to as few people as possible, and
to keep moving,'' he said. ``That way, it looks like you're
circulating, when you're actually just walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the madcap mix of uptown, downtown and European chic,
the evening abounded with improbabilities. Dinner was catered by
Mortimer's at Home, a new outfit run by Mortimer's former maitre
d'hotel, Robert Caravaggi, and its former chef, Stephen Attoe,
which has sprung Phoenix-like from the recently shuttered uptown
society restaurant, where Bleckner confessed he rarely dined. ``I
only went when good friends of friends invited me,'' he said,
referring to Bob Colacello, a Vanity Fair contributor, and Reinaldo
and Carolina Herrera, all of whom are on the charity's board and
were among the co-hosts for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of some, the event was underwritten by
Traditional Home, the shelter magazine that is based in Des Moines
and is associated in many minds with cozy New England clapboard
cottages and English Tudors. Asked whether she agreed that
Traditional Home seemed an unlikely participant at a benefit in a
TriBeCa loft, the editor in chief, Karol DeWulf Nickell, replied:
``Not at all. For us, it's a natural fit.'' She clutched three
strings of pearls around her neck and adjusted her immaculate bob
of chestnut hair. The magazine's publisher, Wilkie Bushby, chimed
in that they were pursuing ``a hipper audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bleckner's Des Moines visitors were not the only ones curious to
meet some of his groovier downtown guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Chi Chi Valenti?'' Judith Peabody, the Fifth Avenue
philanthropist, asked of her dinner partner, Reinaldo Herrera,
examining place cards. ``Sounds like some marvelous tango dancer,''
he replied.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the blonde Ms. Valenti is a veteran of the downtown
demimonde, an editor of the niche magazine Verbal Abuse, and is
known as a spirited emcee on the fetish circuit. She and her
husband, the deejay Johnny Dynell, revealed that they had met in
Bleckner's building nearly two decades ago, when the lower floors
were occupied by the Mudd Club, the infamous nightspot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place holds special memories,'' Dynell said, wearing a
cutaway black leather vest that showed off his tattoos. ``Chi Chi
and I met here 18 years ago, and we consummated our love right here
in Ross' studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Bleckner insisted, his studio is a haven of
tranquillity. A few days before the benefit, he led a visitor on a
private tour of the six-story former warehouse, which is on the
cusp of Chinatown and has served as his home and studio for the
last 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Success in the art world is not the only source of Bleckner's
good fortune. He was raised in prosperous Hewlett Harbor on Long
Island, and in 1974 he purchased the building with a loan from his
father, a manufacturer of precision parts. Ten years ago, the
artist commissioned the firm 1100 Architects to carry out extensive
renovations, which included demolishing the third-floor ceiling to
create two soaring, side-by-side painting studios, where last
week's dinner was held.
</P>
<P>
   During the last year, he has redesigned his spare, airy living
space on the sixth floor with the assistance of Jaime Rojo, a
Mexican-born interior designer at Jed Johnson &AMP; Associates. ``Ross'
command was that his bedroom should be serene and romantic,'' said
Rojo, who replaced the pine bed with a roomier mahogany model. He
also added a small chair designed by Jean-Michel Frank with a
matching ottoman, as well as a rug designed by Rojo that was
hand-woven in Guatemala, and a Scandinavian ceiling light fixture
with a soothing, inviting glow.
</P>
<P>
   The room overlooks a leafy, glassed-in terrace and beyond it,
Bleckner's elegantly appointed living room, which he claims he
never uses, with a giant television set whose controls he is
certain he will never master. ``I was horrified when he bought
it,'' Rojo confessed. ``So I'm encouraged that he's thinking of
getting rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth floor of his house, whose interior looks as though
it may have been devised by his close friend Calvin Klein as an
advertisement for the idealized life of an artist, he showed off
his private gym and flexed a bicep.
</P>
<P>
   Bleckner works out every morning before hitting his studio. His
domain is immaculately ordered, like his new paintings currently on
view uptown at the Mary Boone Gallery and downtown at Lehmann
Maupin (which ``features some of the best paintings he has made in
years, maybe ever,'' Roberta Smith, an art critic at The New York
Times, wrote of the Maupin show while expressing reservations about
the Boone show).
</P>
<P>
   Neatly stacked on shelves are dozens of saucepans stained in
myriad hues, which Bleckner uses to mix his own pigments. ``I see
my studio like a laboratory, where I work like an investigator _
it's almost forensic,'' he said. ``I love the discovery process in
painting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a shelf amid the saucepans sits a neat stack of music CDs.
``I look at them, but I never play them,'' Bleckner said. ``I gave
away my stereo, because even having to choose what kind of music to
listen to makes me anxious. I like my surroundings to be pretty
spare and severe,'' he added with a grin. ``It helps me to
concentrate on my work.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``All I ever do here is go from my studio to my
bedroom. Everything else is extraneous. I never entertain, because
to me, New York is about meeting people in public spaces, absorbing
a little bit of their energy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the dinner in his studio, which had been transformed into
an oasis of glowing candles and virgin, white canvases, Bleckner
introduced the performance artist John Kelly, who serenaded guests
with compelling renditions of songs by Joni Mitchell. For the
occasion, Kelly donned vintage platform shoes, a becoming long
black dress and a blond wig that seduced some in the audience into
believing that they were in the presence of the moody songstress
herself. Was his choice of ``Shadows and Light,'' with its lyrics
about ``the perils of benefactors, blessings of parasites,'' a
response to the roomful of well-heeled guests?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a song about the contrast of rich and poor, and people's
differing experiences of life,'' Kelly said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Warmly regarded by many young artists for fostering their
talents, Bleckner invited Tommy Payne, an independent curator, to
assemble a small collection of works by emerging artists. Those who
found yellow Post-Its under their chairs, placed randomly by
waiters before dinner, got to take a piece of artwork home.
</P>
<P>
   One sculpture, a notably ghoulish twin-pronged candelabrum by
Sachs, with a lighted torch on one side that illuminated a pig's
foot on the other, attracted the most attention. ``Change hoof
weekly, or as desired,'' the helpful tag said, in Gothic script.
</P>
<P>
   Informed that the sculpture was now hers, Kate Hampton, a
daughter of the late society decorator Mark Hampton, seemed taken
aback. ``No kidding, really?'' exclaimed Ms. Hampton, an actress.
``Well, I don't have one of those,'' she said, perhaps unconvinced
of her good fortune. Someone assured her that duct tape holding the
torch in place was one of the artist's signature materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, it's a real pig's foot,'' Ms. Hampton said, turning to
her date.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is it kosher?'' he replied, warily.
</P>
<P>
   Colacello looked dubious. ``If it is,'' he said, ``it's very
Reformed.'' &QL;

ARCHIE MOORE BOXING LEGEND DEAD AT 84 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A shorter version, OBIT-MOORE-ABRIDGED, is also being
moved.) 
(jt) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archie Moore, the fighter whose legendary career spanned almost
three decades and who won the light-heavyweight championship when
he was well into his 30s, died Wednesday at a hospice in San Diego.
His age, always the subject of speculation, which he helped fuel,
was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had entered the San Diego Hospice about a week ago, said a
family spokesman, John Stump.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Moore invented himself in many ways, from his age, to the
dieting secrets he claimed to have learned from an Australian
aborigine in his world travels, to his various careers. But what
was undeniable was his remarkable career as a fighter, one that
lasted from the mid-1930s to 1963 and took him around the world. He
held the light-heavyweight title nine years, longer than any other
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   When Moore did not like the way he was treated by the boxing
community, he would campaign to right the wrongs he perceived.
Thus, when a sanctioning body threatened to take away his title
because he refused to defend it, he appealed to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   And when he felt that the heavyweight champion, Rocky Marciano,
was ducking him, Moore spent $50,000 on a letter-writing and
advertising campaign _ including a ``wanted'' poster of the
champion _ to embarrass Marciano into a title defense. When Moore
finally got his chance in 1955, Marciano knocked him out.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his career, Moore fought an average of almost once a
month, with more than 200 bouts, most for small paydays. He had a
record of 194-26-8, and his 141 knockouts are believed to be the
most by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, he did not become a nationally known (and then
worldwide) figure until he was well into his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying,'' he once said, ``that good things come to
those who wait _ providing you have the ability to wait long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   His professional career, by some accounts, began in 1935 with a
second-round knockout of one Piano Mover Jones. Other accounts have
his career beginning in 1936 with a knockout of the Poco Kid. In
any event, he fought as a middleweight in his early years.
</P>
<P>
   But a perforated ulcer in 1940, he claimed later, caused his
weight to drop from 160 pounds to 100. That was also the year of
his Australian travels and the secret diet that he contended
allowed him to balloon in weight and then, miraculously, shed the
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he liked to say, was chewing meat and extracting the
juices but not the fiber. He spit that out. He claimed that he saw
the aborigine eating beef jerky that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen a fat Australian?'' Moore asked
rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   There was another component to his diet. In the morning he drank
sauerkraut juice flavored with lemon juice. But these ``secrets''
came out only once he had written an autobiography. Before then he
would eat behind a screen at his training camp when reporters were
present.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery always surrounded him. He claimed to have been born on
Dec. 13, 1916, in Collinsville, Ill., but his mother, and at least
one boxing record book, fixed his birthdate as Dec. 13, 1913, in
Benoit, Miss., a date his family confirms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my mother should know, since she was there,'' he
conceded. ``But I have given it a lot of thought and have decided
that I must have been 3 when I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   It was known that he was born Archie Lee Wright, and that his
parents separated after he was born. He was brought up in St. Louis
by an uncle and aunt, and he took their surname.
</P>
<P>
   By 1952, fighting as a light-heavyweight, he was still searching
for a title bout. He had beaten the former heavyweight champion,
Ezzard Charles, and had defeated the highly regarded Harold
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Joey Maxim, the light-heavyweight king, declined to face
Moore. So Moore began a letter-writing campaign. He started to
correspond with well-known journalists like Red Smith, demanding to
meet Maxim, a cautious, cagey fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Maxim agreed _ but only if Moore guaranteed Maxim a
$100,000 cut of the purse. Moore's manager, Doc Kearns (who had
been Jack Dempsey's manager as well), cut the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was 39 years old (or 36, by his account) when he finally
met Maxim on Dec. 17, 1952. Moore won the title in a 15-round
unanimous decision and then enhanced his legend with his gift of
gab and, perhaps, fanciful recollections.
</P>
<P>
   He did not make any money on the fight, however. After the purse
was divided, Moore came out with $800.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least we'll be able to get some credit at a bank
now,'' he told his manager.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His whimsical nature contrasted with his persona in the ring.
True, weighing 175 pounds he had a belly. But he had little tricks
that eventually found their way into the repertory of Muhammad Ali
and are found in many of today's fighters _ an ability to hit with
one hand while his other dangled at his side, and then backpedal.
That lashing style, along with his ring savvy, earned him the
nickname The Mongoose.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moore defended his title four times in the next two and
a half years, it was Marciano he angled for. The pressure by
Moore's sportswriter friends finally forced Marciano, who was
considered indestructible, to meet Moore. If Moore's mother was
right, her son was almost 42 years old, 10 years older than the
undefeated champion.
</P>
<P>
   Moore achieved one of his finer moments by knocking down
Marciano in the second round of their bout on Sept. 21, 1955. But
Marciano got up and surged back. At the end of the eighth round,
the referee went over to Moore's corner and told him he wanted to
stop the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to go out in a championship fight is on your
back,'' protested the old challenger. In the ninth round, Marciano
flattened him.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Moore again fought for the heavyweight title,
which was vacated when Marciano quit after stopping him. This time,
Moore met 21-year-old Floyd Patterson. Moore was bloated at 196
pounds and was knocked out in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Moore still fought as the light-heavyweight ruler. In 1958 he
survived four knockdowns and knocked out a brawling Canadian
fisherman, Yvon Durelle, in the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   He remained champion until Feb. 10, 1962, when sanctioning
bodies withdrew recognition because of his failure to defend the
title. His last fight was a three-round knockout of Mike DiBiase on
March 15, 1963, nine months before what the record book says was
his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   With his celebrity status, Moore spoke out on important issues.
After his last title defense at Madison Square Garden, in 1961, he
took the ring microphone and announced he was donating part of his
purse to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, the Freedom Riders and the B'nai B'rith.
</P>
<P>
   He also played the role of Jim in the 1960 film version of ``The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.'' He studied books on slavery and
attempted to avoid stereotyping in playing the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have time to read when I was a kid,'' he said, ``so I
didn't know anything about Huck Finn and those cats. I read the
book before playing the part. Now that I've found books, I'm really
living.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his fame in the mid-1950s, he married Joan
Hardy, a sister-in-law of the actor Sidney Poitier. She was his
fifth wife. Moore is survived by his wife, Joan Hardy Moore, of San
Diego; three daughters, Rena and JMarie of San Diego and Elizabeth
Stump of City Heights, Calif.; and four sons, Archie Jr., Billy,
Anthony and D'Angelo of San Diego, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His entourage at various times included Ali and Redd Foxx. After
his final bout, he moved in and out of boxing as a trainer and
adviser. He was assistant coach of the Nigerian boxing team at the
1976 Olympics in Montreal. He worked most recently with George
Foreman when the former champion began a comeback in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me his secrets of escapology and breathology,''
Foreman said.

JUDGE ORDERS GYMNASTS'S FATHER TO STAY AWAY FOR A YEAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Moved in ``a'' and ``s'' categories) 
 
By STEFANIE ASIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A judge Wednesday ordered the father of Olympic
gymnast Dominique Moceanu to stay away from his teen-age daughter
and have no communication with her for a year.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge John Montgomery, in issuing the protective
order against Dumitru Moceanu, said evidence showed there was a
history of domestic violence in the Moceanu home and there was a
likely chance of it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is a lot of love, deep down,'' the judge
said. &UR;  &LR; ``Humpty Dumpty has fallen off the wall. We need to put him
back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the order, Dumitru &UR;  &LR; Moceanu cannot come within 500 feet of
his daughter's residence, school or her training facility. He is
forbidden from communicating with his daughter except in writing.
The judge also told Moceanu that her father is in violation of the
order if she initiates communication or a meeting. If her father
violates the order, he will be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Camelia Moceanu, is not included in the order. The
parent's attorney, Katherine Scardino, is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old gymnast wept as she described her relationship
with her father to the judge. She said that at times, his actions
scared her. On one occasion, she said her father ordered her onto
the scales and slapped her in the face when he saw that she had
gained some weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scares me. He intimidates me. You don't hit your child for
gaining weight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither father nor daughter made eye contact with each other
during Wednesday's hearing. Occasionally, Moceanu rolled her eyes
incredulously during her father's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After Montgomery's ruling, Moceanu cried and embraced her lawyer
and her high school friends. This was not a victory, however, that
she was celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is very sad,'' she said. ``It's been extremely
tough on me. But now I can move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu was optimistic that the ruling might lead to happier
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, my family might get back together. Maybe it has
taught him a lesson,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu had gone to court Nov. 30 to get a temporary protective
order, &UR;  &LR; which prohibited her father from contacting her and being
around her. She sought the court's protection after Houston police
homicide detectives went to her apartment and told her about an
alleged plot by her father to have friend Brian Huggins, 32, and
her coach Luminita Miscenco, 26, killed. Although allegations of
Dumitru Moceanu's involvement in a murder-for-hire scheme are still
under investigation, no criminal charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins also was successful in getting a protection order
against Dumitru Moceanu on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnast's attorney tried to introduce into evidence tape
recordings allegedly between Dumitru Moceanu and a private
investigator in which the father tried to hire someone to kill
Huggins and Miscenco. Montgomery reviewed the tapes in his chambers
but did not admit them into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But a source who has heard the tapes said that Dumitru Moceanu
met with a private investigator to find out where his daughter
lived. He then met again to allegedly solicit his help to ``get rid
of '' Huggins and the coach. The investigator taped these alleged
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The source said on the tape that the investigator asked Dumitru
Moceanu what he wanted him to do with the bodies. Also, the father
allegedly said on the tape that he wanted it to look like an
accident, and then wondered if Huggins could be drugged.
</P>
<P>
   The source said that the tape featured two men specifically
talking about ``getting rid'' of Huggins, and doing it after Nov.
20. The cost was to be $10,000, but the investigator told the
father that he could get the plan rolling for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand, Moceanu's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, asked the
father about the alleged murder-for hire scheme. He did not answer
the questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not
incriminate himself.
</P>
<P>
   But, Moceanu talked in detail about what Houston homicide
detectives told her about the investigation. Although her father
denies those allegations, Moceanu said she thought her father was
capable of doing that, that she was scared of him and even feared
she was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   She told the judge that she saw him waiting for her outside her
school and had followed her once.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination by Scardino, Moceanu said she went on
an extended vacation with Huggins, a married man and father, after
police detectives told her about the murder plot. She denied there
is a romantic relationship with Huggins.
</P>
<P>
   From the witness stand, Dumitru Moceanu said he would never hurt
his daughter and was only concerned about her, like any parent.
</P>
<P>
   He said he waited to see her at school to see how she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing wrong with that. I am her father. We are her
parents. Nobody is concerned as much as us.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he asked a private investigator to find her
address for him, but denied that he had the investigator follow
her. Testimony showed that to prove to Huggins that he knew where
she lived, he signed a $5 bill and sent it with flowers to her
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu said all along he has feared that the people
around her, like Huggins, were influencing her to take these court
actions.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, the father appeared stunned, not saying much
to his wife or those around him. Scardino said that he and his wife
were devastated by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said she is convinced there was no domestic violence in
the home, and that the judge made the wrong decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dumitru cannot believe that his daughter has turned her
back,'' she said. ``She wouldn't even talk to them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu took her first court action against her father Oct. 28
when she legally was declared an adult, freeing her to take over
her own business interest. The gymnast said she took the action to
protect her finances from her father, whom she accused of
squandering millions she earned in the past few years. &QL;

ARCHIE MOORE, BOXING LEGEND, DEAD AT 84 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A long version, OBIT-MOORE, is also being moved. JMarie is
CQ.) 
(jt) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archie Moore, the fighter whose legendary career spanned almost
three decades and who won the light-heavyweight championship when
he was well into his 30s, died Wednesday at a hospice in San Diego.
His age, always the subject of speculation, which he helped fuel,
was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had entered the San Diego Hospice about a week ago, said a
family spokesman, John Stump.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Moore invented himself in many ways, from his age, to the
dieting secrets he claimed to have learned from an Australian
aborigine in his world travels, to his various careers. But what
was undeniable was his remarkable career as a fighter, one that
lasted from the mid-1930s to 1963 and took him around the world. He
held the light-heavyweight title nine years, longer than any other
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his career, Moore fought an average of almost once a
month, with more than 200 bouts, most for small paydays. He had a
record of 194-26-8, and his 141 knockouts are believed to be the
most by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   By 1952, fighting as a light-heavyweight, he was still searching
for a title bout. He had beaten the former heavyweight champion,
Ezzard Charles, and had defeated the highly regarded Harold
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Joey Maxim, the light-heavyweight king, declined to face
Moore. So Moore began a letter-writing campaign. He started to
correspond with well-known journalists like Red Smith, demanding to
meet Maxim, a cautious, cagey fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Maxim agreed _ but only if Moore guaranteed Maxim a
$100,000 cut of the purse. Moore's manager, Doc Kearns (who had
been Jack Dempsey's manager as well), cut the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was 39 years old (or 36, by his account) when he finally
met Maxim on Dec. 17, 1952. Moore won the title in a 15-round
unanimous decision and then enhanced his legend with his gift of
gab and, perhaps, fanciful recollections.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moore defended his title four times in the next two and
a half years, it was heavyweight champ Rocky Marciano he angled
for. The pressure by Moore's sportswriter friends finally forced
Marciano, who was considered indestructible, to meet Moore. If
Moore's mother was right, her son was almost 42 years old, 10 years
older than the undefeated champion.
</P>
<P>
   Moore achieved one of his finer moments by knocking down
Marciano in the second round of their bout on Sept. 21, 1955. But
Marciano got up and surged back. At the end of the eighth round,
the referee went over to Moore's corner and told him he wanted to
stop the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to go out in a championship fight is on your
back,'' protested the old challenger. In the ninth round, Marciano
flattened him.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Moore again fought for the heavyweight title,
which was vacated when Marciano quit after stopping him. This time,
Moore met 21-year-old Floyd Patterson. Moore was bloated at 196
pounds and was knocked out in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Moore still fought as the light-heavyweight ruler. In 1958 he
survived four knockdowns and knocked out a brawling Canadian
fisherman, Yvon Durelle, in the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   He remained champion until Feb. 10, 1962, when sanctioning
bodies withdrew recognition because of his failure to defend the
title. His last fight was a three-round knockout of Mike DiBiase on
March 15, 1963, nine months before what the record book says was
his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   With his celebrity status, Moore spoke out on important issues.
After his last title defense at Madison Square Garden, in 1961, he
took the ring microphone and announced he was donating part of his
purse to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, the Freedom Riders and the B'nai B'rith.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his fame in the mid-1950s, he married Joan
Hardy, a sister-in-law of the actor Sidney Poitier. She was his
fifth wife. Moore is survived by his wife, Joan Hardy Moore, of San
Diego; three daughters, Rena and JMarie of San Diego, and Elizabeth
Stump of City Heights, Calif.; and four sons, Archie Jr., Billy,
Anthony and D'Angelo of San Diego, and two grandchildren.

CHICAGO DEFENDS ANTI-LOITERING LAW BEFORE SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JUDICIAL-INDEPENDENCE) 
(nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a spirited Supreme Court argument Wednesday, the
city of Chicago defended an anti-loitering law that permits arrests
not only of suspected gang members but of anyone else who, standing
with ``no apparent purpose'' on a public street near a gang member,
defies a police order to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not protect the right to stand next to a
gang member,'' Lawrence Rosenthal, Chicago's deputy corporation
counsel, told the justices in what appeared to be an uphill battle
to resurrect a 1992 city ordinance that has drawn widespread
attention from around the country as a potential model for a new
approach to gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people were arrested under the law during
the three years it was in effect before an Illinois appellate court
declared it unconstitutional in 1995. Rosenthal said the law
imposed ``at most a minimal inconvenience'' when compared to the
``enormous evils'' visited by gangs on terrified Chicago
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Citing U.S. Supreme Court precedents, the Illinois Supreme Court
ruled last year that the law was unconstitutionally vague, in
failing to give ``fair notice'' of what conduct was prohibited. The
state court also said the law violated a number of other
constitutional rights, including due process, the right to
associate with others, and the ``personal liberty of being able to
freely walk the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's appeal is one of the most important civil liberties
cases of the Supreme Court term, questioning at least implicitly
whether several Supreme Court decisions from the 1970s, which sent
into eclipse the vagrancy and loitering laws that were once common
in American cities, are still good laws. While there was little
direct discussion of those precedents in the courtroom Wednesday,
several justices expressed serious doubts about Chicago's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bothered by the seemingly open-ended possibilities of what
is and is not an `apparent purpose,''' Justice David H. Souter told
Rosenthal. ``Some people with nothing better to do like to sit and
watch the cars go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the high constitutional and practical stakes in this
case, City of Chicago vs. Morales, No. 97-1121, the Clinton
administration and 31 states filed briefs supporting Chicago, while
a broad coalition of civil liberties and criminal defense groups
are supporting the challengers.
</P>
<P>
   The law is ``inherently vague and overbroad,'' Harvey Grossman,
an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer from Chicago, told the
justices Wednesday. ``At its core it defines no conduct,'' he said
of the law, adding that it ``requires a police officer to engage in
a surreal exercise of determining whether someone has a purpose''
that justifies being allowed to remain on a public street.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizes a police officer who ``observes a person whom
he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member
loitering in any public place with one or more other persons'' to
order the entire group to move on and to arrest anyone who remains.
Loitering is defined as ``to remain in any one place with no
apparent purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the justices' questions for Rosenthal, Chicago's lawyer,
dealt with how the police are supposed to identify the purposeless
loiterers to whom the law should be applied. Rosenthal insisted
that any concern for the law's vagueness was misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   All people have to know is to obey an order to disperse, he
said. ``A law that says one cannot stand still in the city of
Chicago when ordered to move is not vague,'' Rosenthal explained,
adding that there was little potential for innocent people to be
swept up along with gang members. In gang-ridden neighborhoods,
people are afraid to use the streets and are not likely to be on
them in any event, he said.

   But some justices still had questions. ``There is a concern here
with the potential for arbitrariness in the way the police enforce
it,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Rosenthal whether the city
council could decide that ``we've had some problems with gangs, so
no one can stand on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   There was ``nothing vague'' about such a law, Rosenthal said,
adding that it was ``certainly rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer was not satisfied. ``Is that all it takes?'' he asked.
``My house isn't very big, it's unpleasant and it's hot. I want to
go stand on the street and the city council says you can't?''
</P>
<P>
   Because no ``fundamental right'' was involved, Rosenthal said,
such a law should be upheld under the lowest level of
constitutional scrutiny, mere rationality.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted a friendly intervention from Justice Antonin
Scalia, who made his support for Chicago's argument quite clear.
``Do you know anyone who would rather smoke in a bar than stand on
the street?'' he asked Rosenthal, and then went on to answer his
own question: ``I know several, and they're disabled from doing it,
and no one thinks it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, Grossman, the civil liberties lawyer, said
the city's argument that the law was not vague because it clearly
obliged people to move when ordered was nothing more than ``a high
level of sophistry.'' The essence of the law, he said, was being
found on the street with no apparent purpose. He told the justices
that of the 66 defendants on whose behalf he challenged the law, 34
had been charged only with being in the presence of a gang member
and were not themselves identified as members of gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer asked Grossman to propose an approach that would, in his
view, be a constitutional way to attack the problem. The lawyer
replied that other cities had laws that ``make distinctions between
criminal loitering and innocent loitering,'' for example, making it
a crime to loiter with intent to sell drugs or engage in
prostitution. The laws make it clear that what is prohibited is
``wrongful conduct,'' he said.

WELD OFFERS PLAN TO CENSURE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ William F. Weld has a plan.
</P>
<P>
   The former Massachusetts governor Wednesday appeared before the
House Judiciary Committee, surprising his fellow Republicans and
the White House with a four-point proposal to punish President
Clinton, but not impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it would entertain the idea, which some
House Republicans found entertaining _ but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   And while Weld said he was not carrying Clinton's water,
administration officials plainly hoped his testimony would help
persuade a small band of undecided Republican moderates not to vote
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Weld proposed a censure that would include a written report of
the president's wrongdoing, a written acknowledgment by Clinton
that he did wrong, a large fine that could not be paid from his
legal defense fund and the possibility of criminal prosecution once
he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining this censure-plus remedy, Weld said, ``Personally,
the dignity of Congress and the dignity of the country demands
something more than merely censure here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in remarks that seemed directed at undecided members of his
party, Weld, who was an associate minority counsel for the
Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation, called
impeachment a ``prophylactic remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not punitive. If any of you are thinking, we've got to
vote yes on impeachment to tarnish the president, he's already been
tarnished,'' Weld said. ``Nobody's going to forget this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate indications that his comments started a
stampede against impeachment among moderate Republicans. ``I don't
think any one person is going to persuade these guys,'' said one
senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Edward Porter, a Republican of Illinois, who
had expressed reservations about impeachment because of the
potential negative consequences of a long Senate trial, said
Wednesday that he was still open to impeaching Clinton, though he
had made no final decision.
</P>
<P>
   With political pressure building on moderate Republican members,
whose declarations before a vote could swing the momentum either
way, Chairman Henry Hyde warned House members to hold back on
making statements about how they would vote until the committee
sends up any articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Several moderates contacted Wednesday passed up the chance to
say whether Weld's testimony had influenced them either way.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona and a moderate
who supported Weld's nomination last year to become ambassador to
Mexico, may not have been persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing Bill Weld had to say ... that seemed to
dovetail with what the congressman has said privately,'' said
Kolbe's spokesman, Ron Foreman. ``I don't think they share the same
interpretation of what ought to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld, who headed the Justice Department's Criminal Division
under President Reagan, sprung his censure-plus plan on the White
House when he walked into the Judiciary Committee hearing room and
spotted Gregory Craig, Clinton's special counsel, and told him what
he was going to say.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said they had not seen the proposal beforehand
nor did they know he was going to offer one. ``The reality is that
he is an accomplished former elected official who is known for his
independence and known to speak his mind and that's why he is also
credible and today was another example of that,'' said the White
House official.
</P>
<P>
   Of the substance of Weld's offer, White House press secretary
Joseph Lockhart said: ``We think that people who come forward in
good faith with proposals to deal with this matter, we will look at
and we will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld was questioned by committee Republicans about statements he
made in a September interview suggesting Clinton should resign if
he loses the public's confidence. Weld said that the president had
not lost his ability to lead. ``I will confess that I was somewhat
surprised at the alacrity with which all seemed to be forgiven and
forgotten in terms of people saddling up and doing business with
the president and taking him seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican from Texas, read from a
column that appeared in The Boston Gobe. It was written by a
headmaster who had asked his students, aged 12 to 18, to accept the
president's apology for lying about an affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky. The students would have none of it because the
president's relationship with a former White House intern was not a
one-time lapse in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't those students right in their assessment?'' Smith
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Mr. Congressman, I don't think anybody's saying this is
a day at the beach or a walk in the park,'' Weld answered. ``I find
those statements as depressing as you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative George Gekas, a Pennsylvania Republican who
serves on the Judiciary Committee, said afterward that Weld's
conflicting responses to the Lewinsky scandal may have made his
censure proposal less persuasive to some GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the governor has called for resignation,'' Gekas
said. ``He comes to the table now with a changed perspective and
testifies against impeachment. ... Overall, I think his testimony
does not sway many opinions, at least not among committee
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld, who was contacted about testifying on Monday by Susan
Brophy, a Quincy, Mass. native and former White House legislative
affairs deputy who has been called back to help out with the
impeachment inquiry, was unfazed by the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've testified before Congress so often that it's like
brushing my teeth,'' he said. Weld said he had not talked to any
moderate Republicans in the House about the impeachment issue and
has no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that his committee appearance may not help him
politically. ``It's probably not a plus for the political future.
But I thought it was important to try to contribute to a
resolution, conceivably even a lowering of voices. People seem
pretty hot around here. That's usually not a good thing when it's
decision time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weld said he doesn't plan to enter the Senate race in 2000,
specifically with regard to challenging Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
``I'm going to be a good boy for the next five years and stay out
of the public eye.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All the labors of high-priced lawyering that have
marked the struggle to impeach and defend President Clinton seemed
to converge before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday in a
clash that, at a minimum, showed no lack of combative lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr was suddenly seething at the latest panel of
distinguished lawyers to testify at the impeachment inquiry _
thoroughly disgusted, he announced, with all the lawyers who have
been wielding all the ``evasive and crafty answers'' in defense of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have gone, Mr. Chairman, today from the technical to
the absurd,'' growled the Georgia Republican, a lawyer and former
federal prosecutor himself who fervidly proposed the impeachment of
Clinton months before Kenneth Starr urged Congress to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, lawyers and legalisms were on the mat as Barr and
other Republican lawmakers, most of them lawyers, fumed about
``legal hairsplitting'' from evasive ``wordsmiths'' of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on you!'' Barr boomed at Gregory Craig, the president's
special counsel who shepherded the panel of five experienced
federal prosecutors before the committee to argue that the perjury
case against the president would never be brought against an
ordinary American by any self-respecting criminal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't get in the door,'' said Thomas Sullivan, a former
federal prosecutor whom Barr dressed down as particularly talented
in the ``technicalities and legalities'' of criminal defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan had to sit mute since Barr afforded him no opportunity
to defend himself. But he showed professional resilience as soon as
a friendly Democrat invited him to speak. ``Persons who make such
statements,'' Sullivan said of Barr, are the first to hire a lawyer
and ``get the mantle of the Constitution wrapped around them'' when
they are the subjects of criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear that kind of speech from them anymore when they
hire me to defend them, I can guarantee you that,'' Sullivan
declared evenly, leaning into the microphone as it was Barr's turn
to glare back in silence.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing day was largely devoted to lawyers having it out in
public even as backroom legal specialists of the Republican
majority were busy writing draft articles of impeachment against
Clinton. ``Works in progress,'' the committee chairman, Rep. Henry
Hyde, noted rather lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans chafed repeatedly at all the nuanced warnings
against impeachment from the president's defenders, although one,
Rep. Christopher Cannon of Utah, did gently concede, ``The essence
of the rule of law lies in its technicalities.''
</P>
<P>
   A note of lawyerly mischief came from Rep. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., when the charges against the president were criticized as
``silly.'' ``The day that people stop doing silly stuff is the day
all of us lawyers go out of business,'' said Graham to bipartisan
laughter. ``I think it's silly to fool around with an intern while
you're being sued. But these things happen. And they happen to
smart people like Bill Clinton. And if we impeach people for being
silly and doing inappropriate things we'll wipe the Congress out.''
</P>
<P>
   No apologies for legal niceties were offered by Charles Ruff,
the White House counsel, as he fenced with Republicans. He firmly
preferred the word ``misleading'' to ``lying'' in describing the
president's misbehavior. The president did not commit perjury, Ruff
insisted, when he ``succeeded in misleading the opposing counsel''
in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit.
</P>
<P>
   Frowning at the president's admitted evasions, Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., complained: ``I think it's sick that the president does
this.'' But Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., offered a fast riposte to
all queasy Republicans: ``Just because they're sickened by his
actions does not mean they're impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff openly wondered about ``legalisms.'' ``Whatever they are,
they have caused a great deal of pain to those of us engaged in
trying to represent the president over the last many months,'' he
conceded while insisting legalisms are also the basic stuff of
defending a client's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried here not about whether lawyers will ultimately
recover from these attacks,'' Ruff told the lawyers on the
committee amid all the clashing over lawyering. ``I am worried that
our sometimes irresistible urge to practice our profession will
stand in the way of securing a just result in this very grave
proceeding for this very special client.''

 &HT;    Net firm rewriting online retail
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The personal computer may go down in retailing history
as the cultural _ and economic _ equivalent of the 19th century
department store, without the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   In its cover story, Business Week (Dec. 14) says Amazon.com, the
Internet company, has come close to perfecting online shopping, or
``e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever, Amazon.com is jolting the titans of retail
into rethinking whether their traditional advantages _ physical
size, mass-media branding and even the sensory appeal of shopping
in stores _ will be enough to thrive in the New Economy,'' the
magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   As for Amazon.com stock, Business Week says it and other
Internet companies will have a tough job producing the kind of
earnings growth that investors are looking for, based on the prices
they are paying for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Count on the Fed
</P>
<P>
   An old Wall Street saying _ ``don't fight the Fed'' _ is good
advice considering what has happened to the stock market any time
the Federal Reserve has made two successive cuts in its discount
rate _ the rate it charges banks for loans.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Funds (January) says the Fed has made successive pairs of
discount rate cuts 19 times since the central bank was founded in
1913. On average, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 7
percent within three months of the second cut, and 18 percent after
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has already risen 8 percent since the Fed's most recent
discount rate cut on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping fast company
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company (December) spotlights people who ``make a
difference'' out of the limelight, the ``unsung heroes and rising
stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine profiles 16 men and women it regards as ``fast''
because of ``how they dream, how they think, how they lead, how
they contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Philharmonic conductor Ben Zander, author Ron Chernow and
Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist come closest to having a public
identity. Among the others are a hotel general manager, a vice
president of an executive search firm, a consumer lobbyist in
Washington and a university vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   _ Respectable tax professionals and corporate clients are using
modern corporate finance techniques to indulge in extravagant
tax-dodging schemes, Forbes (Dec. 14) says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Trend (December) profiles a ``small band of economic
developers'' on a mission to bring a better economic future to
communities along U.S. Route 441. The interstate highways took
business away from the once primary north-south route the runs from
the Georgia mountains to the Okefenokee.

 &HT;    Overseas anxiety hurts Coke shares
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of Coca-Cola sagged Wednesday on concerns that
economic turmoil abroad will slow sales growth through the first
half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed at $67.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange,
down $1.50 after earlier falling as low as $65.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The dip was triggered by a report from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
analyst Emanuel Goldman, who predicts below-average growth in the
fourth quarter and into next year because of currency fluctuations
and economic instability in Russia, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns, coupled with tough comparisons to last year's 10
percent sales increase in the fourth quarter, have been blamed for
Coca-Cola's 18 percent stock slide in the past 3 1/2 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, the stock is sort of taking a pause, but on a
long-term basis this is a knock-your-socks-off company,'' said
Goldman, who is maintaining his ``near-term neutral'' rating on
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is maintaining his earnings estimates of 30 cents a
share for the fourth quarter, $1.45 a share for 1998 and $1.60 a
share for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to release its fourth-quarter volume
update as early as next week, spokesman Rob Baskin said. Investors
and analysts use the update, which comes about a month before
earnings, to fine-tune expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who register expectations and ratings with the First
Call service have given Coca-Cola an overall below-average
recommendation, compared with other blue chips, since the company's
September warning that fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts aren't in love with the stock,'' said First Call's
Chuck Hill. ``They have gotten a little disillusioned.

 &HT;    Land acquired near Coca-Cola
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A mystery buyer continues to acquire property in the
area south of the Coca-Cola Co.'s North Avenue headquarters. In the
latest transaction, the buyer paid $2.3 million for two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Financial Group, an Arlington, Texas -based firm that
has spent $5.5 million since June buying properties in a half dozen
transactions, bought nearly two acres one block north of Centennial
Olympic Park, according to Fulton County deed records.
</P>
<P>
   The seller was Maxwell &AMP; Hitchcock Construction Co. The company,
which was located at 191 Simpson St., recently moved to
Chattahoochee industrial district. The property, bounded by
Simpson, Lovejoy, Alexander and Fowler streets, had been on the
market at $44 a square foot, but sold for $33 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Financial, which buys property and leases it to
corporations, says it is buying downtown land for a corporate
client who does not want to be identified. Coca-Cola has repeatedly
declined to comment on whether it is that client.
</P>
<P>
   The company spent $8 million buying land for its Olympic City
festival adjacent to the park and is a major player in the
city-business community efforts to redevelop the area around
Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Coca-Cola made a $4 million loan to assist Downtown
Atlanta Revitalization, a nonprofit redevelopment group, in
assembling land for a business park across Marietta Street from
Coca-Cola's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the soft drink giant has been considering
several options for adding office space to accommodate its growing
workforce that has spilled over from its North Avenue headquarters
complex into several facilities in Midtown, downtown and the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Coca-Cola planned to buy Inforum, an office
building adjacent to Centennial Park, but the deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, the company considered construction
of an office tower as high as 48 stories as well as a smaller
building.
</P>
<P>
   The company won't say if it still plans another building or what
it will do with the property it is known to own near its
headquarters.

 &HT;    Delta decentralizing international operations
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hoping to fortify its multibillion-dollar global
business, Delta Air Lines Inc. is creating three international
units to closely run its Asian, Latin American and European
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The move gives autonomy and direct decision-making power to the
top executives who will manage the new operations. Other airlines
such as American Airlines have adopted similar strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``By moving accountability to the field, we expect faster
decision-making and even better execution,'' marketing chief
Frederick Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions for international markets, which bring in $2.8
billion, or about 20 percent, of the airline's operating revenue,
previously were made from Delta's Atlanta headquarters. The new
units now will have full operational responsibility for such issues
as service, sales, marketing, human resources and corporate
representation within their regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's decentralization. It's a good move,'' said Julius
Maldutis, aviation analyst for CIBC Oppenheimer in New York.
``History has shown that a vast international route network such as
Delta's cannot be effectively managed from a headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the change:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stephan J. Egli will be vice president of the Atlantic region
and the airline's top person in Europe. A native of Switzerland,
Egli has been vice president of Delta's Atlantic/Pacific Business
since joining the company in July 1997. He is based in London.
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Daniel Burrus becomes director of Delta's Tokyo-based
Pacific region and will oversee the airlines' Asian market. Burrus
has been with Delta since 1976 in several management jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rudi Forster, managing director, will serve as acting head of
the Latin American region. Forster has been with Delta since 1978,
serving as station manager in Stuttgart, Germany, and Moscow and
St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its international strategy, Delta and Austrian
Airlines agreed to expand their co-marketing pact. Starting Friday,
Austrian Air will put its code on Delta's daily flights between
Atlanta and Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's stock closed down $2.50 Wednesday at $52.

STARR CHALLENGES CLINTON REBUTTAL AS `MISLEADING'

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr on Wednesday
challenged several assertions in the White House's 184-page defense
brief, complaining that President Clinton's rebuttal contains ``a
series of misrepresentations regarding this office's referral.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharply defensive two-page statement from Starr's office was
unusual because it was made public at a critical moment in the
impeachment debate. Before Wednesday, the Office of the Independent
Counsel had refrained from responding to two previous White House
rebuttals of its 445-page impeachment report, which was sent on
Sept. 9 to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, Congress should be guided by the facts and the
evidence,'' Starr's statement said. ``That is why we submitted to
Congress not only the referral, which organizes and summaries that
evidence, but several thousand pages of raw evidence itself.
Indeed, every item of evidence in the White House's submission came
from our office.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, of the White House Counsel's Office, shot back
Wednesday evening: ``The so-called independent counsel, in a
partisan effort to help Republicans who want to impeach the
president, has actually highlighted the shallowness of his referral
by finding so little fault with our 184-page submission. The
independent counsel has done nothing to challenge our showing that
he omitted reams of exculpatory evidence from his referral and
misled the Congress about the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Starr's office were stung by what they said were
mischaracterizations of fact in the White House's point-by-point
defense brief, which was sent to the House Judiciary Committee on
Tuesday night. Wednesday night prosecutors were preparing
additional public statements to refute other statements they said
were ``misleading'' in the White House rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House spent three months analyzing, dissecting and
attacking the referral and all the attachments,'' said Charles G.
Bakaly III, Starr's spokesman. ``When they testify before Congress
and we believe they are not being accurate or complete or they
mischaracterize the referral, we will protect the integrity of the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House lawyers and the Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee angrily objected to the statement, saying that
prosecutors had improperly injected their view of the evidence into
the middle of the committee's impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is stunningly inappropriate, if not professionally
unethical, for Mr. Starr to meddle in the president's defense
before the committee,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for the
Democrats on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Dash resigned as Starr's ethics adviser last month
because he objected to Starr's decision to testify on Nov. 19
before the committee and his appearing to be ``an aggressive
advocate'' for the impeachment of Clinton. In his resignation
letter, Dash said Starr had rejected his ``strong advice'' to
decline the invitation to testify. Wednesday night, Dash declined
to comment about the latest statement by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   When Dash quit, Starr said that if he had declined the
invitation to testify it would have suggested to the public that
``we are unwilling to defend and stand by the referral.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Wednesday, Starr's office challenged what it
said were several ``misleading statements'' in the White House
rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   First, it disputed the White House argument that Clinton did not
lie when he denied having any memory of being alone with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the president did not deny that he had been alone
with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the White House lawyers wrote in their
rebuttal. ``For example, the president answered `yes' to the
question, `Your testimony is that it was possible, then, that you
were alone with her. ...?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's office said the White House omitted ``a significant
part of the quotation in which the president said that he had no
`specific recollection' about being alone with her, and even
limited that theoretical possibility to when Ms. Lewinsky worked in
the White House and brought him papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors also noted that Clinton had been alone with
Ms. Lewinsky only three weeks before he made that statement.
</P>
<P>
   The second rebuttal disputed the White House contention that
there was ``no foundation in the record,'' other than Ms.
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, to indicate that Clinton's gifts
to Ms. Lewinsky were retrieved on Dec. 28, 1997, the same day as
her last meeting at the White House with the President.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is false,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors say that the White House ignored this piece
of corroborative evidence: Cell-phone records from Betty Currie,
Clinton's personal secretary, show that Ms. Currie called Ms.
Lewinsky on Dec. 28 at 3:32 p.m, the statement says. ``Without
knowledge of these phone records,'' the prosecutors say, ``Ms.
Lewinsky stated that Ms. Currie called her on December 28, and she
thought Ms. Currie may have been calling from her cell-phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Starr's prosecutors said that the White House ``falsely
contends'' that Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky ``discussed'' what should
be done with the gifts. The White House rebuttal cites Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony that the president ``didn't really discuss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Starr's prosecutors said, ``Ms. Lewinsky's words
`he didn't really discuss it' came in response to a second, more
specific question, after Ms. Lewinsky had spent several hundred
words recounting her conversation with the president about the
gifts.''

AFFLUENT DISTRICTS' STUDENTS DO BETTER ON ASSESSMENT EXAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With failure rates on the state's tough new
standardized exams disappointingly high across Massachusetts, the
wealthiest school districts _ places like Harvard, Newton, Acton,
Needham, Sudbury, and Concord _ performed best, according to scores
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But even though higher per-pupil spending generally meant higher
test scores, some of the higher-spending districts faced unsettling
results.
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 percent of Newton sophomores failed the math test; 32
percent of Sudbury 8th-graders failed or need improvement in math.
More than half of Acton 4th-graders scored in the ``needs
improvement'' category in English/language arts.
</P>
<P>
   But state Board of Education Chairman John Silber said it would
be wrong to congratulate or criticize any district based on
first-time scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, this is where we find the information to
improve our schools, not evaluate them,'' Silber told a crowd of
reporters at the Morse Elementary School in Cambridge, where the
report was released. ``This is a standard against which to measure
things. I believe we will see great progress in the next five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most of the lowest-performing students are from
city schools showed that they clearly face the greatest challenges
as state officials now begin their push for improved scores within
two years. State officials are asking low-performing districts to
show significant improvement within five years or face being taken
over by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is particularly intense for this year's 8th-graders,
who are the first class that will to have to pass the Massachusetts
Comprehensive Assessment System test in 10th grade to get their
high school diploma. Special-education and bilingual students also
will have to pass to graduate, unless they are given an exemption
from taking the test. Most special-education students this year
took the test.
</P>
<P>
   Silber and other education leaders said they found the most
promise in 4th-graders' scores, and that their generally superior
performance may reflect the fact that their entire school career
has been affected by the higher standards demanded by the 1993
Education Reform Act.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the particularly high failure rates among
10th-graders, Silber said, ``We have failed our older students.
They have been the products of lowered expectations. This is not
only a failure of schools, but of a culture that talks about how
school should be fun . . . not how much work it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Silber said, 75 percent of students in each grade, and
each subject, should fall in either the ``advanced'' or
``proficient'' test categories. But the majority of last year's
209,000 4th-, 8th- and 10th-graders landed in the ``needs
improvement'' or ``failing'' areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not good enough for the 21st century and it
isn't good enough for these kids,'' said state Education
Commissioner David Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   While it had been expected that large urban areas would post the
lowest scores, the relatively low scores of ``average'' towns, like
Milford, show how far the state remains from Silber's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 208 K-12 districts ranked in a computer analysis by The
Boston Globe, Milford was representative: it ranked exactly in the
middle, at number 104.
</P>
<P>
   Its scores were not good: 80 percent of 4th-graders failed or
needed improvement in English; 67 percent of that class failed or
needed improvement in science, and 66 percent failed or needed
improvement in math, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, anxiously calling their schools and the education
department, and swarming the department's web site, said it is hard
to avoid judging, given the unprecedented level of detail in the
scores. Districts begin mailing scores out to families Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is the first test, but it is natural to want to
judge the schools,'' said Alan Donati, a software engineer from
Whitinsville in Northbridge, a town about an hour west of Boston.
Donati was anxious to see his district's results, even though his
two daughters, a kindergartner and 2nd-grader, are not even close
to test-taking time. ``As parents, we are looking for
accountability and the ability to evaluate our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I think how much (parents) invest their time
and interest in their child's education'' is at least as important
as a teacher's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Provocative results abounded in the myriad statistics, showing
the need for a much more in-depth look at the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts, for instance, followed the national trend in
standardized testing of students doing progressively worse the
higher the grade tested. But Marblehead showed the opposite results
in English and math, with 10th-graders outperforming 4th-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Marblehead Superintendent of Schools Philip Devaux speculated
that his town's students may be learning material at different
points than students in other elementary and middle school
districts. But by 10th grade in Marblehead, most are well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Of Marblehead 10th-graders, 75 percent scored in the proficient
or advanced categories in English. In 4th grade, no students scored
in the advanced category in English, and only 37 percent scored in
the proficient category.
</P>
<P>
   Other interesting results came out of Medfield. According to a
Globe computer analysis, it scored much better than many other
districts that outspend its $5,565-per-pupil each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an anomaly,'' said Medfield Superintendent of Schools
Chris Martes. ``We've had a long history of that. We don't spend a
lot. Yet, we have always done quite well on tests. I look at the
staff and families of the town as the reason why. We have terrific
families with great kids. They come prepared every day to learn. We
have a caring and dedicated staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookline, which ranked below Medfield, spends more than $8,000
per student each year, according to state figures, while Harvard
spends more than $6,415 per student.
</P>
<P>
   Many superintendents said they expect they will have to explain
their ``failing'' and ``needs improvement'' scores to outraged
parents who have not heard the state's warnings about taking the
first year's scores too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do expect a reaction from parents. Our real challenge is
trying to educate people who have not been paying attention to
this,'' said Sudbury Superintendent of Schools William Hurley. ``We
have to share with them that this is an indicator and not the
descriptor of their child.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the cities, however, that the failure rates in all
three subjects were the most overwhelming. In one Boston elementary
school, every 4th-grader failed science &AMP; technology, and 70
percent failed math.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our parents, I say, remember, this is the beginning of the
journey and not the destination,'' said Cambridge School
Superintendent Bobbie D'Alessandro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential for misuse of the data, the millions of
scores from 1,800 schools and more than 350 districts will be
valuable, educators say, for illuminating the state's education
gems, tucked away where no one expects them _ high-performing
schools and districts that can offer ideas to others who are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind these numbers are great stories,'' said Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the Morse School in Cambridge as an example. With
40 percent of its students living in poverty _ well above the state
average of 26 percent _ 67 percent of the school's 4th-graders were
proficient and 8 percent advanced in science &AMP; technology; 17
percent were advanced and 33 percent proficient in math, well above
many of the well-heeled suburban elementary schools. Morse
8th-graders scored less impressively, although 41 percent were
proficient or advanced in math, the data show.
</P>
<P>
   Morse math teacher George Baccus, seated Wednesday with two of
his 8th-graders, Sharoda Das and Joseph Morpeau, said he teaches
the same students from grades 6 through 8, giving him a three-year
planning cycle that allows him to get to know his students.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they believe they are doing right, other
superintendents in the high-scoring districts were quick to say
that their education battle is already partly won based on the
families who walk through their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Superintendent of Schools Mihran Keoseian, whose
1,175-student district ranked number one in the Globe's computer
ranking, said, ``Our kids come in (to kindergarten) at the
2nd-grade reading level, which is only a slight exaggeration.'' And
he gave kudos to his teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   But Keoseian also noted what he considered shortfalls, such as
more than half of his 4th-graders only reaching the ``needs
improvement'' category in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not emphasize analysis in writing to the degree that the
MCAS test is pushing,'' he said. ``I might look into changing that,
but the way I will look at it is more K-12 as a whole rather than
react to one class.''
</P>
<P>
   Other suburban school superintendents Wednesday were generally
hesitant to explain their good or bad scores, saying they needed
more time to determine what the numbers really mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it with any satisfaction or disappointment
because the information is in a vacuum,'' said Sudbury's
Hurley.``The only thing you can compare them to are the state
scores. We did better than the state average and we would expect
to. But what does it mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll Wednesday said that while districts have begun applying
for $20 million in remedial funds for such things as after-school
tutoring programs, there is not enough money to go around for all
the lower performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be able to reach all the kids,'' he said Wednesday.
``But if we can show results and success, we won't have trouble
getting extra money from the Legislature.

JUDICIARY'S INVESTIGATOR HOPED TO AVOID CLINTON'S SEX LIFE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief Republican investigative counsel for the
House Judiciary Committee had one heartfelt wish this summer: If an
impeachment report landed at his feet _ ``God forbid,'' he said at
the time _ he hoped President Clinton's sex life and its
accompanying lies would play only a minor role in his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But, to his disillusionment, when David Schippers lays out the
Republican case against Clinton on Thursday, his presentation will
revolve almost exclusively around Clinton's sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to keep the liaison a secret.
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite what Schippers, a former Chicago prosecutor,
foresaw when he took on the management of the impeachment inquiry,
Republican and Democratic members and officials say. He wanted to
chew on seemingly meatier issues, like Whitewater and the influence
of Chinese money on the 1996 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schippers is a guy who voted for this president and feels very
unhappy at the way he has used this office,'' said Rep. Christopher
Cannon, R-Utah, a Judiciary Committee member. ``And like any good
investigator, he sees the problems and wants to go after them. He
wants to nail them down. He's a crusader.''
</P>
<P>
   An old friend of Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, Schippers has been a major, sometimes
controversial force in shaping the course of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, his decisions have made it seem that the
Republicans were bungling the investigation, lurching from one
scandal to the next, Republican and Democratic members and
officials say. Some even wonder why Hyde delegated as much
authority to Schippers as he did.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers led the committee's most recent move to expand the
inquiry into the alleged campaign fund-raising irregularities in
1996, despite Hyde's end-of-the-year deadline and the failures of
other congressional committees to find anything definitive, say
aides and members.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several weeks ago, when it seemed clear that Hyde's
Dec. 31 deadline might not accommodate Schippers' investigatory
agenda, he lost his temper at a closed-door meeting with staff and
members. ``He became enraged,'' one Republican official said. ``He
genuinely believes something is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican election losses, which spelled a quick end to the
impeachment inquiry, only worsened Schippers's frustration. In
fact, only one witness was ever deposed and no witnesses to actual
events were ever questioned before the committee as Republicans
rushed to finish the inquiry. But the investigator was able to
proceed with some of his plans, anyway, in part because Hyde did
not want the panel to ignore any potentially fruitful leads.
</P>
<P>
   It was Schippers's idea to subpoena the major figures in the
case of Kathleen Willey, who has accused Clinton of making a sexual
advance toward her.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers also led the quest for the memorandums written by
Louis Freeh, the FBI director, and a Justice Department prosecutor,
Charles La Bella. Hyde and the Republicans on the committee backed
him. The memorandums called on Attorney General Janet Reno to
appoint an independent counsel to look into alleged fund-raising
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   But the memorandums did nothing to bolster the inquiry; some
moderate Republicans argued that the move served to annoy a weary
public and to paint committee Republicans as modern-day ``Keystone
Kops,'' as one Republican put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was misguided,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers asserted his independence early in the inquiry,
remaining reclusive and camera-shy, indifferent to the politics of
impeachment. In fact, he often boasts about his political tin ear.
Democrats rarely saw him. He has remained distant from the
committee's political staff, working in a separate building and
rarely venturing to Hyde's Rayburn building offices, although
Thomas Mooney, Hyde's chief counsel, said the two, Mooney and
Schippers, ``have not had a cross word the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the lifelong Democrat managed to rile
committee Democrats. In his first appearance before the panel,
Schippers told the members that there were ``15 generations of
Americans'' who ``are looking down and judging what you do.'' The
remarks were immediately stricken from the record after Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., the committee's senior Democrat, objected.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Schippers announced he would add several charges
of potentially impeachable offenses to Kenneth Starr's original
counts. The move created instant confusion, and left Republicans in
the lurch as they backpedaled and tried to explain the political
rationale.
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers appears to have made up ground, and, by some
accounts, stole the show when Starr, the independent counsel,
appeared before the committee. Asking concise questions designed to
make the independent counsel look good, Schippers roused the
audience to a standing ovation for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he plans to show excerpts of Clinton's deposition
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, the genesis of the
current scandal, another move likely to outrage Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a member of the committee and a
former U.S. attorney in his home state, said Schippers is simply
doing what investigators do. He just doesn't give his actions a
political gloss. ``It is his role,'' Hutchinson said, ``to look
down every avenue.''

 &HT;    Atlanta businessman has gentle wake-up call
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patrick Herold believes his invention is going to make
the world a more pleasant place to wake up, ``one morning at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Herold, an Atlanta businessman, was recently issued U.S. patent
No. 5832067 for a ``method and apparatus for integrating telephone
signals with an alarm clock.'' He calls it a ``new clock radio.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than a clock radio, however. It's a telecommunications
device that delivers predetermined messages in the morning when you
awake _ more pleasant messages than commercial radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like any other clock radio, except it has both a
phone line and power line,'' said Herold, who operates a billing
and collection service for telecommunications and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hook it up, then call an 800 number and arrange with the
provider what you want to hear when you awake,'' he said. ``It
could be your favorite song, an inspirational message, a reminder
of your mother's birthday, whatever.'' The service could also
operate via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, when homes become more automated, Herold envisions
the system could be used to trigger other electronic or
computerized devices that would permit people to wake up not only
to desired messages, but to pleasant surroundings of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, you could arrange to be awakened by classical
music and, if it's sunny outside, your blinds could be opened
electronically,'' he said. ``If it's raining, the coffee pot could
be switched on, along with a slow turning on of dim lights.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast way up
</P>
<P>
   A woman struggling to change a flat tire on her car alongside
the expressway sparked an idea for Ricky Vann. ``Gee whiz,'' he
thought, ``wouldn't it be nice if she could just push a button to
lift the car?''
</P>
<P>
   The thought _ and Vann's subsequent efforts to make it reality _
recently led to Vann being issued U.S. patent No. 5813661.
</P>
<P>
   The patent protects an ``electromagnetic jack system'' for
lifting portions or all of a vehicle. ``It could be installed on
new vehicles when they are built, and added to older vehicles,''
said Vann, a Loganville resident.
</P>
<P>
   The system consists of four electromagnetically operated jacks
attached to the bottom of the vehicle at each corner, and a
dashboard-mounted console to control current flow to the
electromagnets. The jacks can be used individually to lift one
tire, or all together to lift the entire vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Vann said each jack consists of two electromagnets placed within
a shaft with a flat base that lowers to the ground when needed.
When activated from the control panel, the two electromagnets are
charged with like polarity, which _ as science students will know _
causes a repelling effect that pushes the two electromagnets apart.
This provides the lift to jack up the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When the tire is replaced, the control panel changes the current
flow to cause unlike polarity between the two electromagnets.
Unlike polarity attracts, which permits the two electromagnets to
come together, retracting the jack and lowering the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a push-button world in many ways,'' said Vann. ``Why
not this?

 &HT;    Georgia Tech to take lead in microchip development
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech President Wayne Clough, who has set a
course to bolster the research power of his school, takes a large
step in that direction with an agreement this week to help lead
microchip development over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Tech will take charge of one of the lead elements in a new
national research network created by the national semiconductor
industry, the U.S. government and 16 top universities. Called the
Focus Center Research Program, the program, when it hits its
stride, will sustain some $60 million a year in development of chip
technology, the consortium said in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is the most ambitious research project that the
U.S. chip industry has undertaken since 1987, when the
Semiconductor Industry Association companies agreed to form
SEMATECH,'' said Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive of
Intel Corp. and chairman of the SIA's technology strategy
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Focus Center program is the centerpiece of our new
long-range plan to maintain the industry's growth by making sure we
address the technological challenges that surface during the next
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Contracts for the first round of research work have been awarded
to schools in six states, organized into two teams headed by
Georgia Tech and the University of California at Berkeley. Tech
heads a team that will try to advance knowledge about
``interconnect'' technology as it applies to microchips. The
Berkeley group, including 10 universities, will focus on ``design
and test'' issues in chip development.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech team, directed by Professor James Meindl, will
address the wiring that connects the millions of transistors on a
microchip. The team will include Stanford, Rennselaer Polytechnic
Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell and the
State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Some $12.5 million is already committed to the Tech team
research, and an additional $7 million could be awarded if work
progresses satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overarching goal is to discover and invent new solutions
that enable the U.S. chip industry to transcend the known limits on
interconnections that would otherwise slow the progress of
semiconductor technology,'' Meindl said.
</P>
<P>
   The Microelectronics Research Center on the downtown campus will
house most of Tech's work.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the initial focus centers, headed by Tech and Berkeley,
will be funded through 2001. They will be guided by the technology
challenges outline in the National Technology Roadmap for
Semiconductors. It projects industry needs over the next 15 years
and identifies critical issues that need solutions, such as the
connectivity problems that will get attention at Georgia Tech.

THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT WAGE GRASS-ROOTS BATTLES OVER IMPEACHMENT

<P>
   HOUSTON _ On one level, the battle over the impeachment of
William Jefferson Clinton is being played out in the House
Judiciary Committee hearing room and in other Washington power
alleys. But it is also being fought at a grass-roots level all over
the country, with both those who fervently want the president
impeached and those who just as fervently want him left alone
trying to find ways to give weight to their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these people are egged on by conservative and liberal
lobbying groups, but a great deal of the outcry is arising
unbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Hunter, 34, a freelance Web-page designer in California's
Silicon Valley, started her own anti-impeachment Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a lot of Web advertising,'' said Ms. Hunter. ``I'm
saying, start harassing your representatives. I'm saying, let your
guy know. Basically, we're just trying to be loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter said she knows of 30 other anti-impeachment Web
sites. But the other side can roll out the numbers, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since December of 1997 we've placed 187,000 phone calls, and
we're still calling at the rate of 500 a day,'' said Howard
Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus. ``We're spending
most of our time, every day, on this. Since this thing began, we've
sent out 812,000 letters urging action in various forms. Our
message is that this is a vote about crime, that Clinton has
committed crimes and if members of Congress are anti-crime they
must vote to impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the political spectrum, People for the
American Way and other groups opposed to impeachment are working to
get hundreds of thousands of voters to call their representatives
and demand that they ``censure and move on,'' as one Internet group
put it on a petition that has drawn more than 350,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really more of a grass-roots phenomenon than it is a
Beltway phenomenon,'' said Mike Lux, People for the American Way's
political director. ``Most lobbying groups, whichever side they
come down on, don't want to tick off Congresspeople who are then
going to vote against them in another way on another issue. But our
sense is that among the grass-roots groups, the neighborhood
groups, there is real vitality and interest in this out there in
the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Most congressional offices have received a relatively heavy _
and steady _ flow of faxes, phone calls and e-mails all year on the
impeachment issue. In recent weeks, members of Congress who have
taken strong positions _ like Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who told
reporters last week that he would oppose impeachment _ say they
have become targets for angry messages from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Move On, the group circulating the Internet petition, has also
arranged with another company for three days of toll-free calls
that began early Wednesday morning. So it is contacting all the
signatories and asking them to use the free phone time to be
connected to their representatives. As of late Wednesday afternoon,
a spokesperson for the group said, 17,000 people had already used
the service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wes Boyd, a software designer in Berkeley, Calif., said he
founded Move On in late September, when he became concerned that
the impeachment saga would play out into the new year. He said he
was astonished when the Web site received about 100,000 signatures
on its petition in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Boyd has stopped his other work to devote his
time to the anti-impeachment fight. He was also active in getting
out the vote on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, it seemed like it was over,'' he said. ``But we knew it
wasn't really over, so we kind of laid low for a while. Until this
week, really. You can't get people excited until they're feeling
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the toll-free calls, Boyd said, Move On forwarded 80,000
e-mails to members of Congress between Tuesday and Wednesday
afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Caucus is far from being the only group rousing
support for impeachment. The Family Research Council, Human Events
magazine, American Renewal and other organizations are also
cheering anti-Clintonites on. One of the busiest pro-impeachment
Web sites belongs to a group called Free Republic, whose
self-described ``Freepers'' keep in touch about planned forums,
protests and letter-writing campaigns attacking the president.
</P>
<P>
   The most conservative talk radio programs have also beaten the
drums for impeachment more loudly as the vote has drawn nearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an intensification and doggedness on the part
of those right-wing Republican hosts to hang in there and continue
to criticize the process,' said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers
magazine, which focuses on the talk radio industry. ``They
criticize the president and they criticize the American public for
not caring. I call it the `you people' approach, as in `you people
don't realize.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems anti-impeachment organizers have
faced is that many people assumed, after the Nov. 3 elections and
the fall of Newt Gingrich, that the push for impeachment was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have commented that there seems to be a lot of silence
out there,'' said Nancy Coleman, the spokeswoman for People for the
American Way. ``I think there's a lot of disbelief out there about
this. But with these hearings on again, I think it's beginning to
sink in to people that it's really happening.''

EDITORIAL: CENSURE FITS THE OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   At long last, the House Judiciary Committee has before it two
resolutions _ one for censure and one for impeachment _ that define
the choices before Congress and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The censure resolution, drafted by four Democrats, needs more
direct language about President Clinton's lies under oath. But it
represents a vehicle for Democrats and moderate Republicans to
deliver what the public properly wants, which is to condemn Clinton
strongly and then allow him to finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the censure resolution out of the committee and to
the House floor as an alternative to the impeachment indictment
will be difficult. The dueling resolutions emerged in late
afternoon, bringing a hectic end to a day when the committee's
usual raucousness was replaced by a somber sense of history in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy presentation by White House counsel Charles Ruff
brought into clear focus the overriding question. Do Clinton's
offenses rise to the level of requiring impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   We reject Ruff's argument that the president ``believed that
what he was doing was being evasive but truthful'' under oath. The
evidence of Clinton's statements and conduct supports the view that
he planned to lie, knew he was lying and took actions to cover up
his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ruff framed the constitutional issue well. Even if
all the charges are true regarding lying about a certain definition
of sex or where hands were placed, he argued, the scale of the
offenses does not warrant overturning an election. We believe that
these offenses warrant censure, the sterner the better.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' four-count impeachment resolution argues,
in contrast, that Clinton should be tried in the Senate on charges
of lying to the grand jury, lying in the Paula Jones case,
obstructing justice and abusing his power to disrupt the legal
process.
</P>
<P>
   The grand-jury count is the most dangerous to Clinton. Moderate
Republicans might vote for it in the absence of a chance to vote
for censure. For that reason, GOP hard-liners will do their best to
kill the censure resolution in committee and impose rules that
prevent it from being brought later to the House floor. That would
be a disservice to the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and the designated House speaker, Bob Livingston, are
ever going to exert leadership in this historic confrontation, they
need to use all their influence to keep censure alive as an
alternative for a House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although we favor censure, we do not share the view that all
pro-impeachment Republicans are zealots. Certainly some Judiciary
Committee Republicans are driven by political antipathy, just as
pro-Clinton Democrats have prejudged the case. But as many
committee members suggested in their thoughtful questions, it is
not easy to overlook Clinton's conduct and his decision to contort
the law rather than uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ruff pointed out, impeachment should be used when a
president's offenses against the state are so grave as to allow no
response other than removal. The obvious alternative of censuring
Clinton and making him acknowledge the condemnation with his
signature must be made available to the House members.
</P>
<P>
   History will judge a bipartisan vote for censure to have been a
rebuke far more stinging than a partisan vote for impeachment that
hits a dead end in the Senate and is heedless to a sense of
constitutional proportion.

BCS SYSTEM PROVES, WELL, NOTHING MUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Those Bowl Championship Series rankings were
supposedly brought in to eliminate the feelings that college
football was too tongue-tied and indecisive about crowning its
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   There was a school of thought that too many loose ends existed
when a pair of top 25 polls subjectively picked that nation's No. 1
team.
</P>
<P>
   So, did the BCS system work? Yes. And it proved absolutely
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   All the decimal points, computer rankings and strength of
schedule evaluations deemed Tennessee and Florida State the top two
teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Congrats to the BCS for picking the two most deserving teams,
but if it had not existed, nothing would have changed, because the
Volunteers and Seminoles were 1-2 in both top 25 polls anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl would have been the same with or without the
BCS. It will just make everybody feel better Jan. 5 when the winner
of the Fiesta Bowl is unanimously crowned national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the BCS didn't provide some interesting moments Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Was anything scarier than the revelation that computer expert
Jeff Sagarin had Kansas State No. 1 in his power ratings, despite
its loss to Texas A&AMP;M? Thanks a lot, BCS folks, you've really put
our minds at ease with this system.
</P>
<P>
   A guy living in Indiana and working out of his basement can pick
a team No. 1 following a loss, and gets to be one of three power
ranking formats used by the BCS to pick its No. 1 team. Maybe
college basketball needs to re-evaluate those power rankings they
use so often for their NCAA Tournament selections.
</P>
<P>
   It may be complex, but the BCS is not completely worthless. It
brought unprecedented fan interest and media coverage to college
football's race for No. 1. The NFL has been dwarfed this season by
the heightened awareness the BCS brought to college football.
</P>
<P>
   This was the one thing sports fans were talking about in the
late fall, not the Denver Broncos' chances of going undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, teams like Kansas State would never have received
so much scrutiny over their schedule. And BYU would have never won
its championship if the BCS existed 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, there is one redeeming quality of the BCS
rankings. Athletic directors all over the country will be forced to
schedule better teams if they harbor any hopes of capturing a
national title.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, by the time ADs start scheduling tough games,
college football will probably have ditched the BCS in favor of a
national playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, as usual: It sure looked like something fishy was
going on when the Pac-10 just happened to pick UCLA's Cade McNown
and Oregon's Akili Smith as co-offensive players of the year, and
both received first-team all-conference honors.
</P>
<P>
   The only way that could actually happen is if the 10 coaches
voted 5-5 on both honors. And that certainly did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   What did happen?
</P>
<P>
   The coaches chose one player (McNown) as the offensive player of
the year, and another (Smith) as the first-team quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it dawned on them that it didn't look too cool to have
your offensive player of the year as second-team quarterback,
especially when he was still a Heisman Trophy candidate. So a
compromise was struck, and two quarterbacks were named to the first
team.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial first-team pick was Arizona State center
Grey Ruegamer. He was criticized by coaches from USC, Oregon and
California this season for dirty play.
</P>
<P>
   Top freshman: Last year at this time, UCLA and USC both coveted
linebacker Jashon Sykes of Serra High School in Gardena. It's easy
to see why today because he's easily one of the best young
linebackers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, who signed with Colorado, had 13 tackles in the
Buffaloes' loss to Nebraska, and was named player of the game by
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played incredible . . . like a madman,'' Colorado senior
linebacker Brandon Southward said.
</P>
<P>
   With USC losing Chris Claiborne and UCLA losing Brendon
Ayanbadejo, Sykes' defection to Boulder will hurt even more next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the wings: Former El Toro High coach Bob Johnson, the
father of former UCLA quarterback Bret Johnson and former USC
quarterback Rob Johnson, will become UNLV's offensive coordinator
if Notre Dame assistant Mike Sanford turns down the job.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Johnson has been a tutor for USC quarterback
Carson Palmer. &QL;

 &HT;    Judge forbids Moceanu's father from contact for 1 year
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As gymnast Dominique Moceanu cried on the witness
stand Wednesday, her parents didn't move a muscle in their seats 20
feet away. The judge handed her a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Judge John D. Montgomery, citing evidence of family
violence, granted Dominique's request that Dumitru Moceanu stay at
least 500 feet away from his daughter for one year. The protective
order does not apply to Camelia Moceanu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Dominique, 17, said of her father, who was in
the same courtroom fighting his daughter's suit for emancipation
six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a legal adult, Dominique refused to tell her parents where
she lived, which she said led to Dumitru stalking her, hiring a
private investigator to follow her and allegedly trying to arrange
the murder of her coach, Luminita Miscenco and Brian Huggins, a
32-year-old male friend.
</P>
<P>
   In a soft voice, her father _ who appears less domineering since
shaving off his mustache _ denied everything or took the Fifth
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're her parents; we're concerned about her,'' Dumitru said.
``Nobody is as concerned as us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark blue sweater with light blue and yellow stripes,
blue pants and platform shoes, Dominique looked like a normal
teen-ager, not like the diminutive gymnast who won a gold medal at
the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like my life was interrogated,'' she said. ``I couldn't
do any move without him knowing what I did, calling me, harassing
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't lead my life. I was trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   She dissolved into tears when Dumitru's lawyer, Katherine
Scardino, pressed her for the exact dates that her father was in
the school parking lot waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been scarred basically for life,'' Dominique said, ``with
verbal assaults he used in scaring me and intimidating me.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said her father slapped her in the face. The last time
was late 1997, when she had gained weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you understand that's a discipline?'' asked Scardino.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hit me in the face?'' retorted Moceanu.
</P>
<P>
   She said her autobiography, the best seller, ``Dominique
Moceanu: An American Champion,'' which was written with a co-writer
before the Olympics was ``the fantasy story'' that her parents
wanted to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, who testified for 95 minutes in the 4-hour hearing,
said she was ``relieved'' by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since detectives came to my house, my life has been upside
down,'' she said, referring to Nov. 13, the day three Houston
homicide detectives told her of the murder-for-hire plot that sent
her into hiding. Police are still investigating the scheme, which
Dominique has heard likened to the famous Texas Cheerleader Mom
case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he did not have to listen to three cassette tapes
which allegedly detail the plot to make his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not unlike a lot of families, just a higher profile,''
said Montgomery, a no-nonsense Texan. ``I don't think anyone was
intending deliberately to cause harm, but there has been a lot of
unnecessary harm.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Humpty Dumpty has fallen off the wall, let's try to
put him back together, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   However, money remains a divisive issue and the family tragedy
has played out in the media, with some portraying Dominique as an
ungrateful child, others charging that her parents exploited her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are very high right now,'' said Dominique, who has
a 9-year-old sister and was the primary family bread-winner with
her gymnastics success. She says that her father squandered her
earnings on a multimillion dollar suburban gym which is regarded as
the best in the world, but is not being used at capacity and is
losing students. There is a ``Coaches Needed, Happy Holidays'' sign
out front.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu has not been in any gym in two months. Her competition
has been in courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've just been really tough through this whole
thing,'' Moceanu said by telephone the day before the hearing,
sounding like she did after winning the Goodwill Games in July.
``It's been really hard and really stressful, but I've become
really strong. I'm gonna make it through it.''
</P>
<P>
   She could understand that Dumitru's afraid of losing his
daughter, ``but that's no reason to go and commit (the) murder of
two people. Parents lose their children all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said Moceanu's parents are ``devastated'' by the
ruling. ``Dumitru can't believe that his daughter has turned her
back on him. She wouldn't speak to him today.''
</P>
<P>
   During breaks as Dominique chatted with friends, her mother sat
on the opposite side of the room, casting sad, sometimes stern
glances at her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique is receiving emotional support from a woman she has
known only three weeks, her new agent, Janey Miller, who has been
staying with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see her stare out the window at one in the morning, crying,
saying 'I'm losing my family,''' said Miller. ``Despite all of it,
he's still her father.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Moceanu put up her Christmas tree Monday, she was
joined by Miller, friend Brian Huggins and Jeff Pudlo, another
coach whom Dumitru Moceanu believes is influencing his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, who has a wife and child, was one of the targets of the
alleged murder plot, and he and Dominique hid in Las Vegas,
Colorado and the Cayman Islands. Scardino tells anyone who will
listen that she believes they had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't pass the smell test with me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu and her friends say that's ridiculous. ``I would put my
life on it,'' said her best friend, Adriana Montero, 18, who has
known her nine years. She said Dumitru doesn't want Dominique to
have friends of her own age, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought I was a bad influence,'' she said, ``because we
would talk about something else other than gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All she ever saw was four walls around her.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Moceanu roared off at the wheel of her
Mustang convertible with her agent and two friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully my family might get back together,'' Dominique said.
``Who knows, in two years we might be back together. It might have
taught him a lesson.''

CLINTON IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE RESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House completed its defense against
impeachment before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday with
an admission by its top lawyer that ``reasonable people'' might
conclude President Clinton had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a methodical, somber assault on the accusations against
the president, the White House's top lawyer and its last round of
witnesses argued that no prosecutor would try Clinton on the
evidence gathered by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, no
jury would convict him and no responsible Congress would remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   As presidential aides encouraged an alternative punishment like
censure, Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, tried to raise the
perceived stakes of impeachment, grimly urging the House not to
treat it as ``an indictment, or some formalistic slap on the
wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each member _ and I need not tell you this _ must bear the
weightiest burden that our Constitution contemplates,'' Ruff said,
``the burden of making an individual determination that the
president has committed such grave offenses against our polity that
he is no longer fit to serve, that the will of the people should be
overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, a Watergate special prosecutor and a seldom-seen architect
of Clinton's defense for the last 10 months, appeared Wednesday
afternoon before the committee in hope of rescuing Clinton from
becoming the only president since Andrew Johnson to be impeached by
the House.
</P>
<P>
   He rounded out two days of relayed regrets and legal and
historical argument by saying that Clinton believes he could
eventually be prosecuted for concealing his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. ``Absolutely,'' Ruff said, when asked if he could assure
the committee that Clinton would not pardon himself or accept a
pardon from a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Ruff said that ``reasonable people'' might
determine that the president lied in a civil deposition in the
Paula Corbin Jones case in grand jury testimony about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. They might conclude, he said,
``that he crossed over that line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in his mind _ and that's the heart and soul of perjury _
he thought and he believed that what he was doing was being evasive
but truthful,'' Ruff added, capping a 10-hour session.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff mixed his acknowledgments of wrongdoing and reasonable
disagreements with a bare-knuckle attack on Starr's impeachment
referral to Congress. While Gregory Craig, White House special
counsel, tried on Tuesday to defer questions about specifics in the
case, Ruff embraced them, eagerly taking up Republicans' challenge
to debate the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff followed a panel of former prosecutors who spent the
morning piling derision on Starr's referral. ``This case would
simply not be given serious consideration for prosecution,'' said
Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S. attorney for the northern district
of Illinois. ``It wouldn't get in the door. It would be declined
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House considers it inevitable that the committee will
vote this weekend along party lines to approve up to four articles
of impeachment, which were released Wednesday. Over the last two
days _ in a strategy it intends to pursue until the House votes _
it pitched its arguments past the committee to the moderate House
Republicans that it fears might support impeaching Clinton in the
belief that the Senate will not remove him.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion remained respectful Wednesday, even as panelists
expressed contempt for some evidence and Republicans complained of
semantic games. ``This is good wordsmanship,'' Rep. Ed Bryant of
Tennessee drily complimented the panel of lawyers this morning.
</P>
<P>
   But no one gave any evidence of a changed mind. Wednesday
evening, Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina conservative who has
adopted a more moderate tone, surprised Ruff with an argument that
Clinton had led a White House strategy to smear Ms. Lewinsky by
portraying her as a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   He advanced the theory that Clinton met with his secretary,
Betty Currie, the day after he was questioned regarding Ms.
Lewinsky in his Jones deposition, in order to lead her through
questions that would support such a strategy. Starr reported that
the president said to Mrs. Currie, ``Monica came on to me, and I
never touched, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff made repeated statements of remorse on the president's
behalf. Indeed, following an example set by the White House on
Tuesday, he beat up on his boss Wednesday, while stating that
impeachment was not a reasonable punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He misled his family, his friends, his colleagues and the
public,'' Ruff said. ``And in doing so, he betrayed the trust
placed in him not only by his loved ones but by the American
people.'' The president met with Ruff for about an hour on Tuesday
to review his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His voice lowered in mock, dramatic tones, Ruff _ an experienced
criminal defense lawyer as well as a prosecutor _ read at several
points from Starr's referral during his hour-long opening remarks.
Then, as he turned to evidence that he said exculpated Clinton, he
would shift to a conversational manner: ``Well, you might want to
know,'' he started at one point, after falling silent for a
well-timed sip of water.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday morning's panel, William Weld, the former
governor of Massachusetts and a Republican, lent a bipartisan cast
to Clinton's defense. He was harshly critical of Clinton's conduct,
saying that the president was ``already tarnished.'' Saying that
impeachment was not warranted and censure was not enough, he
recommended a five-part package that included censure, a fine, and
the possibility of eventual prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Like other panelists, Weld has a connection to the White House.
Clinton appointed him to be ambassador to Mexico, though the Senate
refused to act on the nomination. Weld did not tell the White House
in advance of his five-part censure proposal, said Joe Lockhart,
the press secretary. Officials refused either to endorse or disavow
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no public mention of the proceedings against him
Wednesday. He met for 90 minutes Wednesday afternoon with 48
members of Congress for a closed discussion of ways to fix the
Social Security system. Wednesday evening, he presided at the
annual ``Pageant of Peace'' _ the lighting of the Christmas tree _
and held a holiday party for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton said that they were weighing whether he should
make another public statement of contrition, perhaps by seizing on
a reporter's question. Some of the president's outside advisers are
urging that he should soon begin speaking one-on-one to wavering
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and the panel Wednesday morning returned repeatedly to the
substance of the evidence against Clinton. As a result, the
committee plunged into its most detailed discussion of some of the
most graphic issues before it.
</P>
<P>
   One of Starr's accusations is that Clinton lied in denying that
he reciprocated Ms. Lewinsky's ``intimate touching.'' That is the
basis for a claim that Clinton has committed perjury, and the
committee has struggled to confront it on live television.
</P>
<P>
   After some panelists dismissed the dispute as a he-said-she-said
matter that could not be prosecuted, Rep. Bill McCollum, a Florida
Republican, noted that witnesses interviewed by Starr's prosecutors
said that Ms. Lewinsky had confided her intimate relations with the
president to them. ``A jury would be hard pressed not to convict
under those circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Davis, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New York
and a former Watergate prosecutor, disagreed. Ms. Lewinsky had an
incentive to lie even to her friends, he said, because ``otherwise
she would be acknowledging an unreciprocated sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., then observed, ``telling the truth
was not the most noticeable characteristic of this set of
interrelationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continued to complain Wednesday that the White House
was presenting no new facts. ``Five groups have come before us, no
one yet has addressed evidentiary matters,'' Bob Inglis of South
Carolina complained to Ruff, who vehemently disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks, Ruff said that Republican complaints
about the lack of new facts ``turn the world I know on its head,''
since the burden of examining the evidence rested with the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   But he proceeded to give a detailed review of Starr's evidence
of perjury, obstruction of justice, and abuse of power. He argued
that Starr had ignored some facts, twisted others and interpreted
innocent exchanges in a sinister light.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, Ruff presented a dramatic, televised
presentation of the arguments laid out in a 184-page legal brief
released by the White House Tuesday night. Along the way, he
challenged the frequent criticism that Clinton's legal team _ and
lawyers generally _ resorted to hairsplitting and legalisms.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff worried, he said, that ``our sometimes irresistible urge to
practice our profession'' could ``stand in the way of securing a
just result.'' But, he continued: ``It is not legalistic to point
out that the president did not say what some accuse him of saying.
It is not legalistic to point out that a witness did not say what
some rely on her testimony to establish. It is not legalistic to
point out that a witness was asked poorly framed or ambiguous
questions.''

TEXAS MOVES TO PUT EXECUTIONS BACK ON TRACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State's attorneys scrambled late Wednesday to
try to convince an appeals court to put the execution of Canadian
Joseph Stanley Faulder back on track for Thursday night after a
federal judge earlier in the day put his lethal injection on hold.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin also stayed the
execution of Danny Barber less than an hour before Barber was to be
taken to the death chamber in Huntsville for the 1979 beating death
of a Balch Springs woman.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks stayed Faulder's execution and ordered an evidentiary
hearing Dec. 21 on whether the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
had violated Faulder's due process rights in denying the condemned
man's clemency requests. A Dec. 22 hearing on the same issue was
set for Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Tisdale, spokesman for Attorney General Dan Morales, said
lawyers immediately filed a request with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in New Orleans to vacate both stays.
</P>
<P>
   If the 5th Circuit overrules Sparks, Faulder could be executed
on schedule, but Barber's date would have to be set off at least 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday the 18 parole board members _ casting their
ballots, as usual, in secret and without explaining their reasoning
_ rejected the 61-year-old Faulder's pleas to commute his sentence
to life imprisonment or delay the execution 90 days. The vote was
17-0, with board member Bennie Elmore of Huntsville abstaining, as
is his customary practice.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was convicted of the 1974 robbery and murder of
75-year-old Inez Phillips, the matriarch of a wealthy oil family in
Gladewater, 110 miles east of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   On a 15-0 vote with one abstention the board also rejected
Barber's requests for commutation or a 30-day reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Barber was condemned for the 1979 attack on Janice Louise Ingram
at her home in Balch Springs, a suburb southeast of Dallas. He
described it as a burglary that went wrong. He also confessed to
three other slayings and received life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's case has see-sawed in various courts this week,
primarily on the issue of the parole board's practice of not
convening public meetings and not voting publicly on death row
prisoners' clemency requests.
</P>
<P>
   In granting Faulder's stay, Sparks noted: ``The court cannot
tell whether the Texas clemency procedure comports with the minimal
due process standard required (in an earlier U.S. Supreme Court
case from Ohio). It is unclear how the board can document that its
procedures are not arbitrary if it does not document its procedures
at all. Nevertheless, the court will hold an evidentiary hearing to
determine whether the Texas clemency procedure satisfies the
minimal due process requirements as identified (in the Ohio
case).''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times joined a growing chorus of individuals and
organizations calling for a halt to Faulder's execution. In an
editorial Wednesday, the paper urged Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a
potential presidential candidate in 2000, to commute Faulder's
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder has become an international cause celebre, with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, high-ranking Canadian
government officials and a host of anti-death penalty organizations
contending that Faulder's rights under the 1969 Vienna Convention
on Consular Rights were violated because authorities never informed
him of his right to contact his embassy after he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Texas authorities have insisted that they did not know Faulder
was a Canadian because he was carrying a U.S. driver's license and
he never told them of his nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder is one of 18 foreign nationals awaiting death by
injection in Texas, according to Texas Department of Criminal
Justice figures. He is the only Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Should the courts clear the path for Faulder's execution _ along
with Barber, the fourth slated this week _ the parole board's
denial of clemency leaves the governor with only one option:
granting a 30-day postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wouldn't make that decision until all court appeals
have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol news conference, he defended the death penalty as
he calmly fielded numerous pointed questions from Canadian
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a Canadian and you come to our state, don't murder
anybody,'' he told one Canadian reporter who asked if Texas ``is
running kind of a wild west show down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wanted to assure Canadians that ``this man
(Faulder) will be afforded all the due process of our court
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in swift and sure punishment, and Texans support
the death penalty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his two primary concerns in any death penalty case
were whether there was any doubt of the defendant's guilt and
whether he had been afforded due process.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that, in his review of Faulder's case, he had seen
``no new evidence that questions the jury's verdict that he is
guilty of this crime. In fact, his request for commutation was not
based on any claim of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Wednesday, several Canadians who met
briefly with parole board Chairman Victor Rodriguez complained to
Texas journalists that Rodriguez had an ``extremely belligerent
attitude,'' treated them rudely and ordered them escorted out of a
state building under threat of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put across the point of view of Canadians,'' said
Patrick ``Sid'' Ryan, a labor leader from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we pointed out to him we felt he was being belligerent
and ignorant, he tossed one of us out of the room. The rest of the
delegation was invited to leave. We were then threatened with
criminal offenses if we didn't leave the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, however, said the Canadians were ``pretty
aggressive'' in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to set the agenda, say how the meeting would take
place,'' he said. ``It was an effort on their part to dictate what
would be heard and whom by. I made it very clear we wanted to hear
exactly what they wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez added that the meeting turned sour when one of the
Canadians accused him of executing somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're administering a process here, but I am not personally
executing anybody, and I take offense to that,'' Rodriguez said he
told the visitors. ``He wouldn't withdraw that statement, so I
asked him to leave and then (another individual) got profane and
said ... `If he's got to leave, so do we.' They chose to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they forsaked an opportunity for all of them to
express what they wanted to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan, the Toronto labor leader, added, ``If we can't even
get a fair hearing from this gentleman, how the hell is Stanley
Faulder going to get some due process and fair process?''

   WASHINGTON _ Following are the texts of a working draft of the
House Judiciary Committee's resolution to impeach President Clinton
and a resolution to censure Clinton, as provided by the judiciary
committee:
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment Resolution
</P>
<P>
   Resolved that William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United
States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and that the
following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United States
Senate:
</P>
<P>
   Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of
Representatives of the United States of America in the name of
itself and of the people of the United States of America, against
William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States of
America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him
for high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE I
</P>
<P>
   In his conduct while President of the United States, William
Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath
faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States
and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial
process of the United States for his personal gain and exoneration,
impeding the administration of justice, in that:
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before a Federal
grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William
Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and
misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning: (1) the nature
and details of his relationship with a subordinate government
employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he
gave in a Federal civil rights action brought against him; (3)
prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to
make to a Federal judge in that civil rights action; and (4) his
corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to
impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.
</P>
<P>
   In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency,
has betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants
impeachment and trial and removal from office and disqualification
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE II
</P>
<P>
   In his conduct while President of the United States, William
Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath
faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States
and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial
process of the United States for his personal gain and exoneration,
impeding the administration of justice, in that:
</P>
<P>
   (1) On Dec. 23, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton, in sworn
answers to written questions asked as part of a Federal civil
rights action brought against him, willfully provided perjurious,
false and misleading testimony in response to questions deemed
relevant by a Federal judge concerning conduct and proposed conduct
with subordinate employees.
</P>
<P>
   (2) On Jan. 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore under oath
to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth in a
deposition given as part of a Federal civil rights action brought
against him. Contrary to that oath, William Jefferson Clinton
willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony in
response to questions deemed relevant by a Federal judge concerning
the nature and details of his relationship with a subordinate
government employee and his corrupt efforts to influence the
testimony of that employee.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency,
has betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE III
</P>
<P>
   In his conduct while President of the United States, William
Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath
faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States
and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed, has prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration
of justice, and has to that end engaged personally and through his
subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed
to delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence
and testimony related to a Federal civil rights action brought
against him in a duly instituted judicial proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme
included one or more of the following acts:
</P>
<P>
   (1) On or about Dec. 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton
corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil rights action
brought against him to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding
that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading.
</P>
<P>
   (2) On or about Dec. 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton
corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil rights action
brought against him to give perjurious, false and misleading
testimony if and when called to testify personally in that
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   (3) On or about Dec. 28, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton
corruptly engaged in, encouraged or supported a scheme to conceal
evidence that had been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights action
brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   (4) Beginning on or about Dec. 7, 1997, and continuing through
and including Jan. 14, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton intensified
and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in
a Federal civil rights action brought against him in order to
corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that
proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that witness
would have been harmful to him.
</P>
<P>
   (5) On Jan. 17, 1998, at his deposition in a Federal civil
rights action brought against him, William Jefferson Clinton
corruptly allowed his attorney to make false and misleading
statements to a Federal judge characterizing an affidavit, in order
to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the judge. Such false and
misleading statements were subsequently acknowledged by his
attorney in a communication to that judge.
</P>
<P>
   (6) On or about Jan. 18 and Jan. 20-21, 1998, William Jefferson
Clinton related a false and misleading account of events relevant
to a Federal civil rights action brought against him to a potential
witness in that proceeding, in order to corruptly influence the
testimony of that witness.
</P>
<P>
   (7) On or about Jan. 21, 23 and 26, 1998, William Jefferson
Clinton made false and misleading statements to potential witnesses
in a Federal grand jury proceeding in order to corruptly influence
the testimony of those witnesses. The false and misleading
statements made by William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the
witnesses to the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive
false and misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency,
has betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE IV
</P>
<P>
   Using the powers and influence of the office of President of the
United States, William Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President
of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in
disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be
faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct that
resulted in misuse and abuse of his high office, impaired the due
and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful
inquiries, and contravened the laws governing the integrity of the
judicial and legislative branches and the truth-seeking purpose of
coordinate investigative proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   This misuse and abuse of office has included one or more of the
following:
</P>
<P>
   (1) As President, using the attributes of office, William
Jefferson Clinton willfully made false and misleading public
statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United
States in order to continue concealing his misconduct and to escape
accountability for such misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   (2) As President, using the attributes of office, William
Jefferson Clinton willfully made false and misleading statements to
members of his Cabinet, and White House aides, so that these
Federal employees would repeat such false and misleading statements
publicly, thereby utilizing public resources for the purpose of
deceiving the people of the United States, in order to continue
concealing his misconduct and to escape accountability for such
misconduct. The false and misleading statements made by William
Jefferson Clinton to members of his Cabinet and White House aides
were repeated by those members and aides, causing the people of the
United States to receive false and misleading information from high
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   (3) As President, using the office of White House counsel,
William Jefferson Clinton frivolously and corruptly asserted
executive privilege, which is intended to protect from disclosure
communications regarding the constitutional functions of the
executive, and which may be exercised only by the President, with
respect to communications other than those regarding the
constitutional functions of the executive, for the purpose of
delaying and obstructing a Federal criminal investigation and the
proceedings of a Federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   (4) As President, William Jefferson Clinton refused and failed
to respond to certain written requests for admission and willfully
made perjurious, false and misleading sworn statements in response
to certain written requests for admission propounded to him as part
of the impeachment inquiry authorized by the House of
Representatives of the Congress of the United States. William
Jefferson Clinton, in refusing and failing to respond and in making
perjurious, false and misleading statements, assumed to himself
functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power
of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of
Representatives and exhibited contempt for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency,
has betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants
impeachment and trial and removal from office and disqualification
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Censure Resolution
</P>
<P>
   It is the Sense of the Congress that _
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, 1993, William Jefferson Clinton took the oath,
prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, faithfully to
execute the Office of President; implicit in that oath is the
obligation that the President set an example of high moral
standards and conduct himself in a manner that fosters respect for
the truth; and William Jefferson Clinton has egregiously failed in
this obligation, and through his actions has violated the trust of
the American people, lessened their esteem for the office of
President and dishonored the office which they have entrusted to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Be it resolved that:
</P>
<P>
   1. The President made false statements concerning his
reprehensible conduct with a subordinate;
</P>
<P>
   2. The President wrongly took steps to delay discovery of the
truth;
</P>
<P>
   3. No person is above the law, and the President remains subject
to criminal and civil penalties for this conduct;
</P>
<P>
   4. William Jefferson Clinton, the President of the United
States, by his conduct has brought upon himself and fully deserves
the censure and condemnation of the American people and the
Congress; and by his signature on this joint resolution, the
President acknowledges this censure.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles Ruff, the last of President Clinton's
lawyers to appear before the Judiciary Committee and ``obviously,
the president's clean-up hitter,'' in the words of one Republican
on the committee, somehow managed to serve up an often sarcastic
defense of Clinton so respectfully that the Republicans whose
position he was savaging hardly took offense.
</P>
<P>
   He began with great humility, referring to ``the man whose
conduct has brought all of us to this moment.'' And unlike another
of the president's lawyers, David Kendall, he was not talking about
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, the White House counsel, went much further than either
Kendall or Gregory Craig, who testified Tuesday, in addressing the
specific charges against the president. (Why, he asked, would the
president conspire to get his secretary to pick up gifts from
Monica Lewinsky on the same day he gave her more gifts?)
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike them, he acknowledged that reasonable people might
differ about whether the president had committed perjury, even as
he insisted that, in his view, Clinton had not crossed that line.
He even said that the argument that the president's actions were
not impeachable because they involved a personal matter was
``misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also the first to embrace the legalisms for which Clinton
has been widely criticized. He said such arguments were ``not just
dreamed up by scheming lawyers'' but represented vital protections
built into the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   His characterization of his client's behavior as ``wrongful,''
and ``morally reprehensible'' seemed to put the committee in the
mood to listen. His understanding, philosophical nod to their
position _ ``No one can claim to be free from doubt,'' he told them
_ appeared to soothe even the president's most ardent critics. Rep.
Bob Barr of Georgia, perhaps the most pugnacious Republican on the
committee, told him, ``I respect your arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff did not, of course, budge from the assertion that the
president's behavior was bad but not impeachable. Over and over, he
said that even if, for the sake of argument, Clinton had lied and
that the lie amounted to perjury, the offense would not be
impeachable because the president had not acted to ``subvert our
system of government,'' or been rendered unable to govern.
</P>
<P>
   And as his presentation went on, he took many opportunities to
belittle Starr, his witnesses and his case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Contemptuously, he said Ms. Lewinsky had started her job search
long before she was subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
suit, after ``she was told by her friend _ ahem _ Linda Tripp that
she wasn't going to get a job in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He also mocked Starr's belief in a conspiracy and suggested that
Starr had accepted everything his witnesses said, without applying
any of the skepticism, any of ``that healthy tension'' that he had
seen at work in the proceedings of the Judiciary Committee, he
said, flattering the committee while demeaning their hero.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, who worked with Ruff at the White House, referred
to the magical properties of what he called Ruff's ``cordial
toughness.'' He said Wednesday's performance reminded him of a time
when a Senate committee looking into potential campaign
fund-raising improprieties learned that videotapes of White House
fund-raising coffees had turned up six months after it had been
told they did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anger of the Senate committee counsel was palpable, and
Ruff's explanation was, `We made an innocent mistake,''' Davis
said. ``No one could have pulled that off other than Chuck Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He consistently defangs his adversaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, who grew up in New York and graduated from Swarthmore
College and Columbia Law School, has used a wheelchair since he
contracted a virus that left his legs paralyzed while teaching law
in Liberia as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last Watergate special prosecutor, and afterward
served as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Later, he was
a partner at the law firm of Covington &AMP; Burling from 1982 until
1995, defending clients like Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, in the
``Keating Five'' savings and loan investigation and Sen. Charles
Robb, D-Va., who was acquitted of playing a role in the illegal
taping of a political opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ruff left to take a job as the District of Columbia's
corporation counsel, a relatively low-profile, public-service job.
And last year, when he became Clinton's counsel, some colleagues
were initially put off by his reserve but were eventually won over,
they said, by his probity, his propriety in the best sense of the
word.
</P>
<P>
   These days, White House Deputy Chief of Staff John Podesta calls
Ruff the solid oak tree of the whole operation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., is to preside next week in
the speaker's chair when the full House debates articles of
impeachment against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood was picked by the outgoing speaker, Newt Gingrich, whose
aides asked LaHood on Monday whether he wanted the job. Republican
aides said Gingrich did not want to end his four-year tenure by
presiding over what is expected to be a highly divisive debate, and
that the incoming speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., did not want
his tenure to begin on that note.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood, 53, a former high school teacher and counselor to
delinquent teen-agers, has a reputation for fairness that
Republican leaders hope will translate into a calming influence on
the proceedings and will help give the party an aura of
even-handedness. He has not indicated how he would vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was elected to the House only four years ago with
the Republican rebel class of 1994, LaHood has not been associated
with the rebels. He was one of three of the new freshmen who did
not sign Gingrich's Contract With America. He also helped organize
a bipartisan House retreat in Hershey, Pa., last year to help
members get to know each other better and treat each other with
more civility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, LaHood has presided in the speaker's chair perhaps
more often than any other Republican in recognition of his
knowledge on procedure, said his spokesman, Tim Butler. He accepts
the assignments willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He views it as a high honor,'' Butler said. ``This will be one
of the most momentous votes taken in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   LaHood is in a seat once held by Everett McKinley Dirksen and
Bob Michel, both former Republican leaders. He is the grandson of
an immigrant from Lebanon and the son of a restaurant manager.
After teaching in Catholic schools for six years and working as a
counselor, he served as Michel's chief of staff in Washington.

 GUNS BLAMED FOR RISE IN HOMICIDES BY YOUTHS IN  ' 80 s 
(js) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As homicide rates have dropped the past few years,
criminal-justice experts have warned that they could soon rise
again as a generation of superpredator juveniles came of age.
</P>
<P>
   But that fear is being called into question by new studies that
show that virtually all the increase in homicides by juveniles in
the late 1980s was attributable to crimes committed with handguns,
not to a change in the nature of teen-agers. While the rate of
killings by juveniles tripled from 1986 to 1993 and has fallen
since, the rate of homicides by juveniles with other weapons has
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The new research on juvenile violence also suggests that much of
the increase in arrests of juveniles in aggravated assaults in the
late 1980s was not because teen-agers were more violent, but the
result of increased police activity, as officers arrested young
people in altercations that would have been ignored earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening is that the juvenile justice system is
getting more kids into it, but the kids aren't any different than
they were a generation ago,'' said Howard Snyder, director for
research at the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh,
the research arm of the National Association of Juvenile and Family
Court Judges. ``The kids' DNA has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder wrote one of the new research studies , which he will
present on Thursday in Washington to the annual conference of the
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, a branch of
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Franklin Zimring, who wrote another of the studies,
presented at a news conference in Washington Wednesday, said that
the reclassification by the police of juvenile fights into
aggravated assaults ``created a completely artificial crime wave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that all during the late '80s and early '90s,
while we worried about superpredators, the average case of juvenile
violence was becoming less serious every year,'' Zimring said.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravated assaults account for by far the largest number of
violent crimes in the major crime index maintained by the FBI. The
other violent crimes are rape, robbery and homicide. Zimring is
director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of
California at Berkeley and author of a new book, ``American Youth
Violence'' (Oxford University Press, December 1998), funded by the
MacArthur Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring found that arrests of juveniles in robbery and rape in
1997 fell below the level for 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he said, ``Youth in 1998 are no more prone to violence
than were teens 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon
University, cautioned that this ignored the fact that homicides by
juveniles remained higher than they were in the early 1980s, before
the advent of crack cocaine, semiautomatic handguns and gangs
sparked the surge in killings by teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of homicide by juveniles 14 to 17 years old jumped from
8.5 per 100,000 in 1984 to 30.2 per 100,000 in 1993, then declined
to 16.5 per 100,000 in 1997, said Prof. James Alan Fox, dean of the
College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Zimring said most people failed to realize that the
increase, and more recently, decrease, really involved the role of
handguns, and not evidence of a ``violent new breed'' of
teen-agers. Since the police in many big cities have begun
aggressive programs to take guns away from juveniles, the juvenile
homicide rate has dropped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Zimring said, the public and politicians have
been misled by their fears into passing tough laws enabling states
to try more juveniles as adults, and these laws are likely to
remain on the books despite research showing the juvenile crime
wave was misunderstood or exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring criticized some politicians, including Rep. Bill
McCollum, R.-Fla., the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime,
and some of his fellow criminologists, for predicting a ``coming
crime storm'' as the teen-age population increases in the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has warned for several years that despite the recent drop in
juvenile crime the worst may not be over because the number of
people ages 14 to 24, the most crime-prone age group, after
reaching a low of 40 million in 1992, will rise to 50 million in
2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can call me an alarmist,'' Fox said. ``I was trying to send
a message to get people's attention. Whether they responded as I
wanted is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we still have a problem, because of the same chronic
problems, from easy access to guns, to lack of parental supervision
to television violence,'' he said. ``If we start putting our heads
in the sand and say there was no crime wave, it will come back.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A panel of former federal criminal justice
officials on Wednesday offered a new approach in defense of
President Clinton against impeachment: No ``responsible''
prosecutor would bring a perjury case against Clinton, they said,
because the evidence presented by the special prosecutor was
insufficient to win a conviction in court.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the officials testified, the House should not vote
to impeach the president because that would force a trial in the
Senate, and that would be the equivalent of taking a case to trial
that cannot be won.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of the former federal officials before the House
Judiciary Committee raised the complex and highly ambiguous issue
of prosecutorial discretion, the legal triage that occurs when
prosecutors select which cases are worthy of pursuing and decide
which ones are better dropped. The witnesses' approach likened the
role of the House in the impeachment proceedings to that of a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five witnesses on the panel was chosen by the White
House as part of its defense. While the witnesses offered different
views, each was consistent in arguing that the case against Clinton
was so flawed it would not be brought to trial by any responsible
prosecutor in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Thomas Sullivan, a Chicago lawyer and a former U.S.
attorney, said: ``The ultimate issue for a prosecutor deciding
whether or not to seek an indictment is whether he or she is
convinced that the evidence is sufficient to obtain a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my opinion that the case set out in the Starr report
would not be prosecuted as a criminal case by a responsible federal
prosecutor,'' Sullivan testified. ``The evidence simply does not
support the conclusion that the president knowingly committed
perjury, and the case is so doubtful and weak that a responsible
prosecutor would not present it to the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., a Philadelphia
lawyer, also a former U.S. attorney who once headed the Justice
Department's Criminal Division. He said: ``I think it's fairly
clear that if a poll were taken of U.S. attorneys from any
administration, you'd probably find the overwhelming number of them
would agree with the assessment that this case is a loser and just
would not be sustained in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said it would be difficult to show criminal intent on the
part of the president when he insisted to both a grand jury and to
lawyers in the Paula Jones lawsuit that he had not engaged in
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton has asserted that
his answers reflected a belief that sexual relations must include
sexual intercourse, and while he and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in other
sexual acts those did not include intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of perjury has been the most troublesome for Clinton's
defenders. Not only did Clinton deny having had sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky, he also testified under oath that he had no
specific recollection of having been alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, acknowledged in
Wednesday's hearing that while ``reasonable people'' might conclude
that the president lied about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
Clinton himself did not believe he had lied.
</P>
<P>
   Proving the crime of perjury requires a showing that a person
knowingly lied. The White House defense provides one reason why
Clinton has not accepted advice from some in Congress to simply
confess to lying: to do so would strip away his claim to such a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's witnesses said that the perjury case also suffered
from the fact that there were only two witnesses to the sexual
acts, Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky and it was inherently impossible for
a jury to determine who was telling the truth. Clinton has also
said that he did not engage in sexual relations because he never
touched her intimately, although she said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., countered that there were 10
people named in the Starr report who said that Ms. Lewinsky had
told them before there was any investigation that the two had had
intimate physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing that prosecutors would not take a case like Clinton's
to court, Dennis also said, ``I believe that a jury would be
sympathetic to any person charged with perjury for dancing around
questions put to them that demanded an admission of marital
infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis was chosen by the White House, in part, because he served
as a criminal justice official in Republican administrations,
although he has represented Maggie Williams, the former chief of
staff to Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican witnesses on Wednesday have ties to the Clinton
White House, notably William Weld, the former governor of
Massachusetts who also testified that there was insufficient
evidence for a perjury case and impeachment. Weld was nominated by
Clinton to be ambassador to Mexico, but was never confirmed because
of the opposition of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who heads the
Foreign Relations Committee.

CHICAGO DEFENDS ANTI-LOITERING LAW BEFORE SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JUDICIAL-INDEPENDENCE) 
(nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a spirited Supreme Court argument Wednesday, the
city of Chicago defended an anti-loitering law that permits arrests
not only of suspected gang members but of anyone else who, standing
with ``no apparent purpose'' on a public street near a gang member,
defies a police order to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not protect the right to stand next to a
gang member,'' Lawrence Rosenthal, Chicago's deputy corporation
counsel, told the justices in what appeared to be an uphill battle
to resurrect a 1992 city ordinance that has drawn widespread
attention from around the country as a potential model for a new
approach to gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people were arrested under the law during
the three years it was in effect before an Illinois appellate court
declared it unconstitutional in 1995. Rosenthal said the law
imposed ``at most a minimal inconvenience'' when compared to the
``enormous evils'' visited by gangs on terrified Chicago
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Citing U.S. Supreme Court precedents, the Illinois Supreme Court
ruled last year that the law was unconstitutionally vague, in
failing to give ``fair notice'' of what conduct was prohibited. The
state court also said the law violated a number of other
constitutional rights, including due process, the right to
associate with others, and the ``personal liberty of being able to
freely walk the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's appeal is one of the most important civil liberties
cases of the Supreme Court term, questioning at least implicitly
whether several Supreme Court decisions from the 1970s, which sent
into eclipse the vagrancy and loitering laws that were once common
in American cities, are still good laws. While there was little
direct discussion of those precedents in the courtroom Wednesday,
several justices expressed serious doubts about Chicago's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bothered by the seemingly open-ended possibilities of what
is and is not an `apparent purpose,''' Justice David H. Souter told
Rosenthal. ``Some people with nothing better to do like to sit and
watch the cars go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the high constitutional and practical stakes in this
case, City of Chicago vs. Morales, No. 97-1121, the Clinton
administration and 31 states filed briefs supporting Chicago, while
a broad coalition of civil liberties and criminal defense groups
are supporting the challengers.
</P>
<P>
   The law is ``inherently vague and overbroad,'' Harvey Grossman,
an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer from Chicago, told the
justices Wednesday. ``At its core it defines no conduct,'' he said
of the law, adding that it ``requires a police officer to engage in
a surreal exercise of determining whether someone has a purpose''
that justifies being allowed to remain on a public street.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizes a police officer who ``observes a person whom
he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member
loitering in any public place with one or more other persons'' to
order the entire group to move on and to arrest anyone who remains.
Loitering is defined as ``to remain in any one place with no
apparent purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the justices' questions for Rosenthal, Chicago's lawyer,
dealt with how the police are supposed to identify the purposeless
loiterers to whom the law should be applied. Rosenthal insisted
that any concern for the law's vagueness was misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   All people have to know is to obey an order to disperse, he
said. ``A law that says one cannot stand still in the city of
Chicago when ordered to move is not vague,'' Rosenthal explained,
adding that there was little potential for innocent people to be
swept up along with gang members. In gang-ridden neighborhoods,
people are afraid to use the streets and are not likely to be on
them in any event, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some justices still had questions. ``There is a concern here
with the potential for arbitrariness in the way the police enforce
it,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Rosenthal whether the city
council could decide that ``we've had some problems with gangs, so
no one can stand on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   There was ``nothing vague'' about such a law, Rosenthal said,
adding that it was ``certainly rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer was not satisfied. ``Is that all it takes?'' he asked.
``My house isn't very big, it's unpleasant and it's hot. I want to
go stand on the street and the city council says you can't?''
</P>
<P>
   Because no ``fundamental right'' was involved, Rosenthal said,
such a law should be upheld under the lowest level of
constitutional scrutiny, mere rationality.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted a friendly intervention from Justice Antonin
Scalia, who made his support for Chicago's argument quite clear.
``Do you know anyone who would rather smoke in a bar than stand on
the street?'' he asked Rosenthal, and then went on to answer his
own question: ``I know several, and they're disabled from doing it,
and no one thinks it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, Grossman, the civil liberties lawyer, said
the city's argument that the law was not vague because it clearly
obliged people to move when ordered was nothing more than ``a high
level of sophistry.'' The essence of the law, he said, was being
found on the street with no apparent purpose. He told the justices
that of the 66 defendants on whose behalf he challenged the law, 34
had been charged only with being in the presence of a gang member
and were not themselves identified as members of gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer asked Grossman to propose an approach that would, in his
view, be a constitutional way to attack the problem. The lawyer
replied that other cities had laws that ``make distinctions between
criminal loitering and innocent loitering,'' for example, making it
a crime to loiter with intent to sell drugs or engage in
prostitution. The laws make it clear that what is prohibited is
``wrongful conduct,'' he said.

JUDGE ORDERS GYMNASTS'S FATHER TO STAY AWAY FOR A YEAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Moved in ``a'' and ``s'' categories) 
 
By STEFANIE ASIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A judge Wednesday ordered the father of Olympic
gymnast Dominique Moceanu to stay away from his teen-age daughter
and have no communication with her for a year.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge John Montgomery, in issuing the protective
order against Dumitru Moceanu, said evidence showed there was a
history of domestic violence in the Moceanu home and there was a
likely chance of it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is a lot of love, deep down,'' the judge
said. &UR;  &LR; ``Humpty Dumpty has fallen off the wall. We need to put him
back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the order, Dumitru &UR;  &LR; Moceanu cannot come within 500 feet of
his daughter's residence, school or her training facility. He is
forbidden from communicating with his daughter except in writing.
The judge also told Moceanu that her father is in violation of the
order if she initiates communication or a meeting. If her father
violates the order, he will be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Camelia Moceanu, is not included in the order. The
parent's attorney, Katherine Scardino, is appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old gymnast wept as she described her relationship
with her father to the judge. She said that at times, his actions
scared her. On one occasion, she said her father ordered her onto
the scales and slapped her in the face when he saw that she had
gained some weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scares me. He intimidates me. You don't hit your child for
gaining weight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither father nor daughter made eye contact with each other
during Wednesday's hearing. Occasionally, Moceanu rolled her eyes
incredulously during her father's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After Montgomery's ruling, Moceanu cried and embraced her lawyer
and her high school friends. This was not a victory, however, that
she was celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is very sad,'' she said. ``It's been extremely
tough on me. But now I can move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu was optimistic that the ruling might lead to happier
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, my family might get back together. Maybe it has
taught him a lesson,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu had gone to court Nov. 30 to get a temporary protective
order, &UR;  &LR; which prohibited her father from contacting her and being
around her. She sought the court's protection after Houston police
homicide detectives went to her apartment and told her about an
alleged plot by her father to have friend Brian Huggins, 32, and
her coach Luminita Miscenco, 26, killed. Although allegations of
Dumitru Moceanu's involvement in a murder-for-hire scheme are still
under investigation, no criminal charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins also was successful in getting a protection order
against Dumitru Moceanu on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnast's attorney tried to introduce into evidence tape
recordings allegedly between Dumitru Moceanu and a private
investigator in which the father tried to hire someone to kill
Huggins and Miscenco. Montgomery reviewed the tapes in his chambers
but did not admit them into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But a source who has heard the tapes said that Dumitru Moceanu
met with a private investigator to find out where his daughter
lived. He then met again to allegedly solicit his help to ``get rid
of '' Huggins and the coach. The investigator taped these alleged
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The source said on the tape that the investigator asked Dumitru
Moceanu what he wanted him to do with the bodies. Also, the father
allegedly said on the tape that he wanted it to look like an
accident, and then wondered if Huggins could be drugged.
</P>
<P>
   The source said that the tape featured two men specifically
talking about ``getting rid'' of Huggins, and doing it after Nov.
20. The cost was to be $10,000, but the investigator told the
father that he could get the plan rolling for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand, Moceanu's attorney, Ellen Yarrell, asked the
father about the alleged murder-for hire scheme. He did not answer
the questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not
incriminate himself.
</P>
<P>
   But, Moceanu talked in detail about what Houston homicide
detectives told her about the investigation. Although her father
denies those allegations, Moceanu said she thought her father was
capable of doing that, that she was scared of him and even feared
she was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   She told the judge that she saw him waiting for her outside her
school and had followed her once.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination by Scardino, Moceanu said she went on
an extended vacation with Huggins, a married man and father, after
police detectives told her about the murder plot. She denied there
is a romantic relationship with Huggins.
</P>
<P>
   From the witness stand, Dumitru Moceanu said he would never hurt
his daughter and was only concerned about her, like any parent.
</P>
<P>
   He said he waited to see her at school to see how she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing wrong with that. I am her father. We are her
parents. Nobody is concerned as much as us.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he asked a private investigator to find her
address for him, but denied that he had the investigator follow
her. Testimony showed that to prove to Huggins that he knew where
she lived, he signed a $5 bill and sent it with flowers to her
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu said all along he has feared that the people
around her, like Huggins, were influencing her to take these court
actions.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, the father appeared stunned, not saying much
to his wife or those around him. Scardino said that he and his wife
were devastated by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said she is convinced there was no domestic violence in
the home, and that the judge made the wrong decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dumitru cannot believe that his daughter has turned her
back,'' she said. ``She wouldn't even talk to them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu took her first court action against her father Oct. 28
when she legally was declared an adult, freeing her to take over
her own business interest. The gymnast said she took the action to
protect her finances from her father, whom she accused of
squandering millions she earned in the past few years. &QL;

SPANISH JUDGE DRAWS UP HIS INDICTMENT OF PINOCHET

<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The Spanish judge who issued the arrest warrant
for Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile will complete the criminal
indictment against him this week and immediately send it to London,
a Madrid court official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indictment will support the accusation against Pinochet
and it's logical that it be sent as soon as possible to show the
charges against him,'' said the official, who spoke on condition
that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment could come as early as Thursday and is the next
legal step after the formal extradition request, which the Spanish
judge, Baltasar Garzon, sent to Britain last month. It listed more
than 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared under Pinochet's
17-year military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, an investigating magistrate at Spain's National Court,
requested permission in October to interview Pinochet in London,
but British officials are unlikely to allow it while the
extradition hearing is pending, the court official said.

KILLER GETS DEATH SENTENCE FOR TORTURE SLAYING

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Over the past nine months, Robert Neville
Jr. has sought fame for murder, boasting about killing a
19-year-old Arlington woman whom many loved.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Neville got one last moment under the bright lights
of the TV cameras when jurors decided in four hours that he should
die for killing Amy Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   When the verdict was read and the interviews were done, Neville
shuffled back into the holding cell with his legs shackled and his
moments in the limelight fading.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old with the trademark smirk knew that a death
sentence was likely, his attorneys said, and has time to prepare
for death.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson didn't have that luxury, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Neville and his friend, Michael Hall, 19, offered
Robinson a ride when they saw her peddaling her bike to work Feb.
15 in Arlington, a Fort Worth suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who cherished her grocery sacking job and tried to
arrive at work early, climbed into the car ``not knowing that
within an hour, she would die in a painful, brutal, ugly way,''
Assistant District Attorney Christy Jack told jurors during her
closing argument. ``She never knows she's surrounded by death.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the two men shot at her with a pellet gun and a
pistol-grip crossbow. Then, as Robinson begged for her life,
Neville shot Robinson in the chest with a rifle ``and drops her to
the ground right behind a hill of garbage,'' said Jack, who
prosecuted the case with Alfie Owens and Alan Levy. ``And when he's
done amusing himself, he shoots her in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Neville and Hall were arrested March 3 in Eagle Pass, Texas.
Neville horrified the community by boasting about the murder, and
then telling several investigators, as well as TV and newspaper
reporters, that he laughed as Robinson lay gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys Tim Moore and Sam Smith tried to use Neville's
irrational behavior as a defense, contending that he is a manic
depressive, an illness brought on by lupus, a disease in which the
immune system attacks internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that Neville's life span will be shortened because
of the illness, and they asked the jury to let him die in prison
without the death penalty. Had Neville not been sentenced to death,
he would have automatically received life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments, Moore walked jurors through the
execution, explaining to them how the poison would seep through
Neville's veins until he died.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... He'll still have that same silly grin,'' Moore told
jurors. ``Let him meet his maker on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors sided with the prosecution, but as the verdict was read,
three of them cried. None wanted to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said they are disappointed that Neville's life
was not spared. ``You do the best you can with what you have to
work with,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Neville's demeanor was a factor in the verdict, and it was a
factor that the defense attorneys had to tolerate. ``I'm not sure I
would say working with Robert was easy,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   To prosecutors, the verdict hardly called for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be more satisfied if we didn't have the case in the first
place,'' Levy said after the verdict was announced. ``It's not a
win-win proposition by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Neville's mother, Cathey Hill, the verdict meant saying
goodbye to her son.
</P>
<P>
   As visiting District Judge Harry Hopkins read the verdict, Hill
ran out of the courtroom, sobbing. When TV cameras focused on her
tears, she pushed a cameraman, shouting, ``Get out of my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's relatives said they empathize with Hill and Neville's
other kin. They said that although justice was done, they
sympathize with a family that will also have to deal with the death
of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's father, Ben Grogan, was allowed to confront Neville
after the verdict was read in what is called victim allocution.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan looked Neville in the eye and told him he will pay for
his crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had your 15 minutes in front of God and everybody for
your fame,'' Grogan said. ``But you're going to be forgotten.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ More than five years of severe food shortages and a
near-total breakdown in the public health system have led to
devastating malnutrition in North Korea and probably left an entire
generation of children physically and mentally impaired, a new
study by international aid groups has found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North
Korea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid
workers, who over the past year have gained increasing access to
the population of this highly isolated and secretive country.
</P>
<P>
   Among other shocking findings, researchers from the World Food
Program, Unicef and the European Union found that, because of
long-term food shortages, a staggering 62 percent of children under
7 years old suffer from stunted growth.
</P>
<P>
   They have discovered that, despite a huge international food aid
program over the past three years, severe malnutrition is
widespread among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development,
suggesting that this generation's physical and mental abilities
will not develop normally and that the losses can never be
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, international medical workers from groups like the
Red Cross, have begun to document how the effects of food shortages
are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health
services. Even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack
of essential ingredients like chlorine, Red Cross workers say,
leaving vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they
are unable to absorb completely what little food they have.
</P>
<P>
   As the North Korean dictatorship has slowly, often grudgingly,
granted increased access to international aid groups in the last
six months, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the
hunger haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and
informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies. Past
assessments of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23
million are considered flawed because they were based on interviews
with a small number of North Korean refugees who had fled into
China.
</P>
<P>
   And while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in North
Korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children
dying by the roadside _ descriptions that have surfaced in the more
lurid refugee reports _ what they did find was in many ways equally
disturbing: A population withering after nearly a decade of chronic
hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition that colds and stomach
flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation irretrievably
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at last we have hard facts _ the situation is very
grave,'' said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for Asia of
the World Food Program, which has taken part in the research. ``To
me this is a famine in slow motion. People cope year after year,
and probably a lot drop off. But the totality is very hard to
gauge.''
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this fall, crews led by foreign scientists were
finally permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the
first random sample nutritional survey of children, providing by
far the most solid data on the crisis. They found that 62 percent
of children under 7 had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term
malnutrition. Thirty percent of 1-year-olds suffered from moderate
to severe malnutrition. This means a high likelihood of impaired
mental and physical development, because the nervous system matures
dramatically during this essential first year.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that available scientific data suggest that
10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to
the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw,''
said Judit Katona-Apte, a senior program adviser for the World Food
Program. ``People will be small and not as well developed as
otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when Red Cross representatives this year tested the
water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate,
they found that not one had water that was suitable for human
consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head of the Red Cross delegation
in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course they drink it _ they have no choice,'' he said
during a recent trip to Beijing. ``There is a very close
relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a
health sector that's in very bad shape.'' Virtually all the
children under 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of
hunger-related deaths, and the North Koreans have not released
relevant figures, although most experts agree that probably more
than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died
prematurely since the food shortages began. But public health
experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to
tally in any case, because most deaths were probably not from quick
starvation, but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger, so
that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an
ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some disturbing clues: In one limited study
conducted by the World Food Program and other groups last year on
4,000 children hand-picked by the government, 10 percent had a
parent who was dead.
</P>
<P>
   In this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams of
experts sent to eight of North Korea's nine provinces looked at
1,800 rural and urban children under seven. In addition to finding
that 62 percent of children had stunted growth, the teams found
that about 16 percent of children were suffering from acute
malnutrition and were underweight for their height, a sign that
they were severely underfed at the time of the study.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and puts
North Korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of
malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as
that of India and Bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18
percent malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number in
some ways understates the problem. In India and Bangladesh, pockets
of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while
in North Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in war-torn countries, famine is more in pockets,'' Dr.
Katona-Apte said. ``It's hard to think of another country that's
been affected in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey results are especially sobering since the researchers
studied only children under 7, the group that received nearly all
the food donated from abroad. After three years of food donations,
many foreign aid workers in the country have remarked that children
in nurseries and kindergartens are looking better _ but that their
older siblings are failing. So a month ago, the World Food Program
began providing elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for
children aged 7 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe that many people are suffering and
that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting
weaker and weaker,'' Swedlund said.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 100 Westerners living in Pyongyang, the
capital city, and many say the long-term hunger is readily apparent
there. ``If you walk down the street in Pyongyang and ask a child
how old she is, you are usually off by three years,'' Swedlund
said. ``She may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh
and the Sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited a North
Korean kindergarten last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were these two children sitting at a desk who were
obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin and they had
patchy hair,'' she said. ``And they were just sitting there
working. This is accepted as normal! They are in school, and they
should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional
rehabilitation. If you saw them in a refugee camp, you would
recommend immediate intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   But with a severely depleted public health and hospital system,
that option does not exist, she and others said. Many Korean
doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had
seen it before this decade. And, in any case, the hospitals lack
the food and proper nutritional supplements. Swedlund said most
hospitals lacked medicines, had no glass to replace broken windows
and were ``colder inside than out,'' having received no coal since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even in hospitals, sanitation and water
purification systems were virtually nonexistent, because the
country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run water
pumps. He said that next year, the Red Cross would start to address
those problems, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patients and $1
million on water treatment.
</P>
<P>
   With few other options, vast numbers of North Koreans have
resorted to eating ``substitute food,'' hard cakes and noodles made
from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans and sweet potatoes,
combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalks and straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake,'' Swedlund
said. ``It's becoming a regular part of the food basket.'' Doctors
in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after
eating this partly indigestible material, he said, but added, ``If
you're very hungry, it fills your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the North Koreans date their food problems to a series
of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, the foreign researchers
who have worked in North Korea say medical records and childhood
growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before
that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had
long been North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is a mountainous country, with less than 20 percent
arable land. It has been a food importer for decades, mostly from
the former Soviet Union, but also from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has to come to grips with the fact that this is
part of a structural problem and can't just be blamed on the
weather anymore,'' Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive
government for slowly loosening its restrictions. Swedlund said
that after three years in the country, the international Red Cross,
which collaborates with the North Korean Red Cross, had found
officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share
medical records and bring up problems.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is still restricted. There are more than 100 counties,
home to 30 percent of the population, to which aid groups have no
access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or
medical supplies. Still, the number of counties open to the workers
has increased steadily, and freedom to move about has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections were
now unannounced, and she noted that the researchers in the
nutritional survey were allowed to select villages to visit and
enter homes at random.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program said they
had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation
and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen acute starvation like I have seen in
Bangladesh,'' Dr. Katona-Apte said. ``But that doesn't mean it
can't exist. We're still really limited in what we can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedlund said it was unlikely that the counties still closed to
foreigners were markedly different from the open ones. And while
some have surmised that the closed counties might harbor pockets of
death and devastation, he said he accepted North Korea's
explanation that they had been excluded from some areas for
national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned is how important national security
issues are to the North Koreans,'' said Swedlund, a retired admiral
in the Swedish Navy. ``And I really think these areas are important
from that standpoint,'' he added, going through a map of closed
areas and describing what Western intelligence experts know about
military installations there.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected the notion that the North Korean military is
stealing donated food, a charge leveled by the organization Doctors
Without Borders, when it angrily pulled out of North Korea last
summer to protest the many restrictions on groups working there.
</P>
<P>
   Now that aid groups say they are starting to get somewhat better
cooperation from the North Koreans, they hope to repeat their
nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months. And they are still analyzing
some tantalizing findings: Boys were twice as likely to suffer from
stunted growth as girls, and every child whose mother was dead was
malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``A generation of North Korean children is already scarred for
life,'' said Astrid Heiberg, president of the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in an interview
in Beijing after a trip to North Korea. ``We need to continue to
mobilize resources to prevent an even greater catastrophe.''

 &HT;    Heisman Trophy not my best work, sculptor says
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sculptor Frank Eliscu once said of the Heisman
Trophy, ``It was not one of my best works of art, but it turned out
to be like the Statue of Liberty: not beautiful, but it's dear to
people's hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliscu, who died two years ago, created a wide variety of works,
including the Cascade of Books outside the Library of Congress and
a Presidential Eagle for the Oval Office. Yet, his most coveted
work, the one every college football player would love to own, was
his first commission. And, yes, a real, live, football-playing
model posed for Eliscu, although he would not find out his role in
creating the Heisman Trophy until decades later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 the four-year-old Downtown Athletic Club of New York
City began planning to honor a college football player, originally
the best one east of the Mississippi. The award seemed a natural
because the DAC's first athletic director, John Heisman, had been
one of the biggest and most respected names in the college game,
winning 185 games in a 36-year coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman was on the DAC's Club Trophy Committee with DAC chairman
Willard B. Prince, Fordham coach Jim Crowley and Columbia's Lou
Little. They wanted to create something more impressive than just
another cup or bowl for an award. But, although the country was in
the midst of the Depression, the $500 the DAC offered for a
sculpture wasn't enough to attract big-name artists.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the DAC settled on a 22-year-old graduate of the Pratt
Institute in New York. Although Eliscu's work had been shown at the
National Academy of Design in New York, he made ends meet by
working in a mannequin factory and by making Easter bunnies in a
chocolate factory.
</P>
<P>
   Eliscu had been a sprinter at George Washington High School in
Manhattan. His school friend Ed Smith was a star football player
who had moved on to New York University. There, the 6-foot-2,
210-pound Smith was a bruising triple-threat tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Eliscu asked Smith to pose in football uniform, which in those
days included high-top shoes, high-riding canvas pants and a simple
leather helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never told me what it was for, and I never asked,'' Smith
told Sports Illustrated a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   After his session with Smith, Eliscu produced a clay figure.
Crowley, who had been one of the Four Horsemen at Notre Dame, took
the figure to Fordham's field and had one of his players strike the
pose to see if it looked authentic. Eliscu made some minor changes
and then made a plaster cast.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Nov. 16, at a banquet at the McAlpin Hotel in New York,
the 1935 Notre Dame team viewed the cast and agreed that it looked
fine. That Fighting Irish squad was coached by another of the Four
Horsemen, Elmer Layden, and they had played Army to a 6-6 tie in
Yankee Stadium that day.
</P>
<P>
   After that final approval, Eliscu cast a bronze statue. It was
14 inches long and 13 1/2 inches high and it weighed 25 pounds. The
original is mounted on a black onyx base and displayed on an
Italian marble pedestal in the DAC lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The first winner of the statue was Chicago's Jay Berwanger. The
next year, the coverage area for the award was expanded to include
the entire country. Heisman would not live to see it happen. He
died of bronchial pneumonia on Oct. 3 that year. The DAC Trophy was
renamed the Heisman in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1982 that Smith learned he was the model for the
statue. That year, filmmaker Bud Greenspan was doing the television
coverage of the award ceremony and wanted to find the original
model. After some legwork, Smith was found.
</P>
<P>
   The DAC gave Smith a Heisman of his own in 1985. The DAC also
planned to give Eliscu one that year, but he told them he already
had one, the original plaster cast. It costs $3,000 to make the
Heisman Trophy today.

   The first winner of the statue was Chicago's Jay Berwanger. The
next year, the coverage area for the award was expanded to include
the entire country. Heisman would not live to see it happen. He
died of bronchial pneumonia on Oct. 3 that year. The DAC Trophy was
renamed the Heisman in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1982 that Smith learned he was the model for the
statue. That year, filmmaker Bud Greenspan was doing the television
coverage of the award ceremony and wanted to find the original
model. After some legwork, Smith was found.
</P>
<P>
   The DAC gave Smith a Heisman of his own in 1985. The DAC also
planned to give Eliscu one that year, but he told them he already
had one, the original plaster cast. It costs $3,000 to make the
Heisman Trophy today.

 &HT;    How the Heisman Trophy winner is selected

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Downtown Athletic Club of New York presents
the Heisman Trophy. By its own rules, it ``has no voice in
selecting the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   That voice belongs mainly to the media. At one time, there were
1,050 voters from newspapers, radio and television stations. A
decade ago, the DAC streamlined the process.
</P>
<P>
   This year there are 870 media voters _ 145 in each of six
regions: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Far West, Southwest and
South.
</P>
<P>
   Past Heisman winners also vote. Last year, 51 former winners
were eligible, for a total of 921 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Each voter casts a ballot with three names, ranked in order.
Players get three points for a first-place vote, two for second and
one for third.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner, University of Michigan defensive back
Charles Woodson, received 433 first-place votes and 1,815 points.
Runner-up Peyton Manning, Tennessee quarterback, had 281
first-place votes and 1,543 points. Williams finished fifth last
year with four first-place votes and 135 points.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to do a lot better in the voting this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Extreme summer heat and humidity of the kind most threatening to
health have become more frequent in the United States over the last
half century, two federal researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   According to their study, in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature, the frequency of extremely hot, humid days and of heat
waves lasting several days increased substantially from 1949 to
1995. In terms of the threat to health, however, another finding
was especially significant: The trend was stronger at night than in
the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that extremely high temperature and humidity
over successive nights is a crucial factor in heat-related deaths.
When nearly 600 people died in a heat wave in Chicago in 1995, for
example, many of the deaths were attributed to an unremitting
combination of record high nighttime heat and humidity that allowed
no respite from daytime heat stress.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have shown that extreme summer heat has more impact
on the health of Americans than any other kind of severe weather,
and that the elderly are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these climate trends continue, they may pose a public
health problem, particularly as there are increasing numbers of
elderly people,'' wrote the authors of the study, Dr. Dian Gaffen
and Rebecca Ross, research meteorologists at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory in Silver
Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent trend toward more extreme heat generally coincides
with a warming of the Earth's surface in recent decades, both
globally and in the United States. The dominant view among
scientists is that at least some of this warming has been caused by
emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, which is
emitted by the burning of coal, oil, natural gas and wood. The
Earth's temperature is projected to rise substantially over the
next century, further increasing humidity and making heat waves
more frequent and intense.
</P>
<P>
   While the increasing frequency of extreme heat and humidity
cannot be directly linked to the warming trend, Dr. Gaffen said it
was ``consistent with what is predicted in the global warming
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center,
agreed. ``I think these are the types of conditions that will
become more frequent and more intense when they do occur'' if the
climate warms as projected, Karl said. ``We've already seen
examples of that this past year,'' he added, referring to last
summer's heat wave in Texas. The projected increases in global
temperatures, he said, ``would make this rather commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, Karl said, the Gaffen-Ross findings ``seem to be
consistent with what we know from other analyses.'' He said that if
data through 1998 were included in the study, ``I'm sure they would
find even stronger trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the last two years have been the two warmest on
record.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross had for some time been studying global
distributions of temperature and water vapor, and they found an
increasing trend of rising humidity accompanying rising
temperatures. So, Dr. Gaffen said, they decided to see whether this
meant that extremes of heat and humidity were also increasing.
</P>
<P>
   They defined ``extreme'' as the highest 15 percent of
temperature and humidity measurements, as recorded every three
hours around the clock in July and August from 1961 through 1990.
This threshold, they report, is ``closely correlated'' with levels
above which, according to other researchers, human mortality
increases sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross analyzed records at 113 government
weather stations around the country, mainly at airports, in search
of information on two variables: the combination of temperature and
humidity that meteorologists call ``apparent temperature,'' and
temperature alone.
</P>
<P>
   Apparent temperature is a measure of the combined impact of heat
and humidity on people and the sensation they experience as a
result. It is increasing faster than temperature alone, the
researchers said, because humidity is increasing faster. This would
be expected in a warmer climate, since more water evaporates and
the atmosphere can hold more.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers computed their thresholds of extremity for the
average daily temperature, the daily maximum temperature and the
daily minimum temperature for July and August at each weather
station. They found that from 1949 to 1995, the annual frequency of
days on which the thresholds were surpassed increased at all but 16
of the 113 stations. The increases were largest for the minimum
``apparent temperature,'' which basically translates to a measure
of combined nighttime heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   At some stations, Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross found that over the
half century, the number of nights with extremely high apparent
temperatures doubled, to about 18 days a year from about 9 days a
year in some places. The largest and statistically most significant
trends were found to occur in some of the nation's most populated
areas, especially from the Middle Atlantic States south to Florida,
as well as along the West Coast and in big cities in the Southwest.
Eight of the 15 cities in which the trend was most pronounced were
in the Southeast _ including Miami, which headed the list
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Daytime increases were found to be not nearly as dramatic. In
fact, the upward trend was statistically significant only west of
the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   East of the Rockies, the apparent temperature increased more
than temperature alone. West of the Rockies, where summertime
humidity increases are less marked, the trends of the two variables
were similar.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators defined heat waves as periods of three or four
days in which the average daily apparent temperature exceeded the
top 15 percent threshold. On average, they found, each weather
station experiences 1.7 three-day heat waves and one four-day heat
wave a year. In the contiguous United States, the number of heat
waves increased by 88 percent from 1949 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Two caveats have been attached to the study. To some extent,
said Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross, the rising heat probably reflects
increased urbanization; the concrete and asphalt in urban areas
absorb and retain more heat than rural areas. But Ms. Gaffen said
that most of the trend cannot be explained this way.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she said, not all the weather stations in the
study were in urban areas. For another, the researchers looked for
but did not find a correlation between population growth _ a
measure of urbanization _ and trends in extreme weather.
</P>
<P>
   The other caveat was offered by Dr. Laurence Kalkstein of the
University of Delaware, who has long studied heat and health. The
threshold of extreme heat adopted by the researchers was not really
selected on the basis of the relationship between health and
extreme heat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies by Kalkstein have found that the threshold at
which heat begins to kill people varies from one city to another.
``That's my only disagreement'' with the study, he said.

 &HT;    Downtown athletic club falls on hard times
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On Saturday, University of Texas running back
Ricky Williams could become the 64th recipient of the prestigious
Heisman Trophy, presented annually by the Downtown Athletic Club of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the last,'' said Jim Spitzer, a lawyer representing
a group that holds the mortgage on the Manhattan building the club
has called home for more than a half-century. ``He ought not to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy, given to the player judged to be the best in
college football, is synonymous with success. But the grand old
club that awards the Heisman, and which has one decorating its
lobby, has fallen on troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   The DAC owes $3 million in back taxes, has filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy and is in conflict with the investment group that holds
the $9.5 million mortgage on the building.
</P>
<P>
   Even as DAC members are making final preparations for Saturday
evening's nationally televised Heisman announcement, the company,
B&AMP;D Management, could be in bankruptcy court presenting a
reorganization plan for the club.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what club members sought to avoid when they filed
for bankruptcy. But their ranks aren't exactly full. Membership has
dwindled from an estimated 4,000 two decades ago to about 1,250
today.
</P>
<P>
   And ``a lot of those are promotional members, they pay less than
you would at a typical health club,'' said Spitzer, who represents
B&AMP;D Management and claims that the club's membership is pumped up
with new members getting a cut-rate deal. ``If you just looked at
the regular members, you'd be hard-pressed to get a basketball game
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a private place for 200, 300 or 400 members. They're the
ones that have run up the debt. The place needs a ton of money, but
they don't want to change. We've said we'll fix it up and make it
first-rate with a first-class hotel. But at the end of the day,
they like what they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Members dispute that claim, saying the club is healthy and has a
lot of options for its considerable assets, including perhaps
creating a Heisman restaurant or hotel on what many consider a
highly desirable piece of the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the Statue of Liberty right now,'' member Rudy
Riska said during a recent telephone interview. ``We're at the tip
of Manhattan. Our 35-story building is the tallest athletic club in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The DAC is located in a 68-year-old Art Deco building. The 35
floors include 137 hotel rooms, one of which will be occupied by
Ricky Williams this weekend. The DAC also has seven banquet rooms,
pool tables, a dining room and a 70-foot bar on the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time it was the longest in New York. It may still be,''
said Riska, executive director of the Heisman Memorial Trophy
Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel rooms are used by members who want to stay over in the
city rather than commute, or by members of other athletic clubs
around the country who are visiting New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make arrangements through the clubs,'' Riska said. ``If
you're in the athletic club at Los Angeles or Dallas, you get a
letter of introduction. It's not open to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Room, where the trophy will be presented in a TV
special, sports dark wood paneling and portraits of past winners.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic facilities for DAC members include Stairmasters and
other trappings of modern health clubs, an indoor pool, squash,
racquetball, handball, basketball and volleyball courts, and an
18th-floor boxing ring where heavyweight Gerry Cooney sometimes
gives lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The members, Riska said, are typically Ivy League-educated Wall
Street types. Squash is their game of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be handball,'' said Riska. ``But it has gotten so
we're dinosaurs. It's a lost art. It's hard to learn the four-wall
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Early years
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the grand club was conceived in the Roaring '20s,
but it opened in 1930, shortly after the stock market crashed and
as the Depression tightened its grip. In those days, the club was
in something of a no-man's land after dark as, in the interest of
saving money, lights were turned off from Borough Hall to Battery
Place. The first athletic director, John Heisman, had to promote
the club during those years. Heisman was one of the biggest names
in college football, having won as a coach at a number of schools,
including Rice University in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At the DAC, Heisman had some success mixing banquets and
football, and the club came up with the idea of honoring the best
college football player in 1935. The first recipient of the DAC
Trophy was Jay Berwanger of the University of Chicago. Berwanger
still attends some of the club's functons.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman, however, died of bronchial pneumonia on Oct. 3, 1936,
before the second trophy was awarded. It was renamed in his honor.
Since then, the award has only increased in prestige.
</P>
<P>
   As for the club, it struggled for survival until after World War
II. That's when the U.S. shipping industry boom, and much of the
aid to rebuild Europe, passed through thriving New York harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the shipping companies had their headquarters here,''
Riska said. ``At one time, that was probably 95 percent of our
members. The shipping companies had unlimited expense accounts and
would use the club to entertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Those heady days lasted until around 1965, when changes took
place in the industry. Bustling, crowded and expensive New York
City didn't have the kind of dock space conducive for storing and
loading the huge containers. Shipping companies were moving to New
Jersey and other locations.
</P>
<P>
   Change in clientele
</P>
<P>
   As the shipping people left, the DAC became more Wall
Street-oriented. It admitted women in the late 1970s. Today, about
10 percent of the members are women.
</P>
<P>
   Newer members typically haven't been as free-spending as the old
shipping clientele. And downtown clubs around the country took a
hit in the 1990s when Congress eliminated tax deductions for club
dues.
</P>
<P>
   Like other old-style athletic clubs, the DAC also lost potential
young members to trendier, sleeker clubs downtown or in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said that while some small downtown athletic clubs closed
around the country, many are being revitalized and shifting
emphasis. That appeared to be the case at the DAC, but the one
thing the club hasn't overcome was $3 million in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Club members decided that a way to get out of the debt was to
sell its main asset, the building, pay off the debts and lease back
part of the building.
</P>
<P>
   In a hot hotel market, the DAC attracted a number of offers. The
club picked one by B&AMP;D Management, a real estate company with four
partners. B&AMP;D offered a $15.5 million deal, with $1.5 million
earmarked for renovation. But when the deal was put to a vote, the
members chose not to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the club's lawyer, Hal Hirsch, said that a
study done by Deloitte &AMP; Touche showed that under that proposed
arrangement, the club would once again be in financial trouble
after five years.
</P>
<P>
   B&AMP;D sued for breach of contract. Then, the company negotiated
with the holder of the club's mortgage, the Bank of New York, and
in February made a deal to acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   The DAC, fearful that B&AMP;D would foreclose even if payments were
current, filed for bankruptcy. Now B&AMP;D, as the holder of the
mortgage, is readying to file its own plans for reorganization with
the court. That's happening right at the biggest moment of the year
for the DAC, when football fans nationwide are watching to see who
wins the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the club. The Heisman gave it great identification,''
Riska said. As part of the ceremonies this year, the late Doak
Walker, who won the trophy 50 years ago, will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of sad,'' Spitzer said of the club's current
financial straits. ``It's a great institution. We'd like to see it
continue.''

 &HT;    Supporters of middle ground gain small victory
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House Judiciary Committee virtually
certain to approve articles of impeachment against President
Clinton this week, Democrats are pinning their remaining hopes on a
strongly worded motion of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the committee won a small, but significant victory
Wednesday when Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said he would allow
them to offer a censure resolution in committee after a vote on
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to have a vote on a resolution of censure,
and we will have one,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Censure also received a boost from former Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld, a Republican moderate, who urged the committee to
devise a tough punishment for the president that stopped short of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic censure resolution, released Wednesday and
carefully crafted to appeal to undecided Republican moderates,
rebukes Clinton for failing in his obligation to ``set an example
of high moral standards and ... respect for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying Clinton violated the trust of the American people and
dishonored the presidency, the resolution states that Clinton made
false statements concerning his ``reprehensible conduct with a
subordinate'' and took steps to delay discovery of the truth. The
resolution would also bind Clinton to the proposition, stated in
the text, that he is still subject to ``criminal and civil
penalties for his conduct'' by requiring him to sign the document.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution does not accuse Clinton of perjury. It also does
not require that he stand on the floor of the House to hear it or
pay any kind of financial penalty _ although Democrats indicated
that such provisions could be negotiated voluntarily with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the White House declined to comment on the specifics
of the Democratic resolution. ``While we are certainly willing to
listen to what people propose, this is a matter for the House to
decide,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy. ``I'm not in a
position to rule in or rule out any of the particulars.''
</P>
<P>
   But a vote in committee, even if unsuccessful, would create the
justification for advancing a censure alternative if the full House
votes on articles of impeachment next week, said Rep. William
Delahunt (D-Mass.), who worked to draft the censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the Republican leadership would understand
that for many this is a vote of conscience,'' said Delahunt. ``For
many moderate Republicans, it does give them an opportunity to vote
their conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt and other Democrats appealed to Speaker-designate Bob
Livingston (R-La.) to permit the censure resolution to come to the
floor for a vote, even if it is defeated in committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unseemly ... if the resolution favored by the
majority of Americans would be walled off from consideration,''
said Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.). Livingston had no comment, said his
spokesman Mark Corallo.
</P>
<P>
   Getting some sort of censure motion on the House floor is
critical to heading off impeachment. With no possibility of
censure, Democrats and Republicans alike are faced with either
voting to impeach the president or doing nothing. The president
will have a difficult time convincing moderate Republicans not to
vote for impeachment if they lack an alternative that expresses
their condemnation of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an awful lot of people, in their heart of hearts,
would like to have another option to just up or down impeachment,''
said Rep. Amo Houghton (R-N.Y.), who Wednesday became at least the
fifth Republican to say he will vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Many hard-line Republicans are opposed to censure precisely
because they don't want members to have a third way out.
</P>
<P>
   Others have signaled that they would not support a censure
resolution, either because they believe it is unconstitutional for
Congress to censure the president or because they don't think that
it would be a strong enough punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is wholly and entirely inappropriate,'' said Rep. Bob
Barr (R-Ga.). ``It is inappropriate to consider censure as a
substitute for impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also face opposition to censure from the liberal wing
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said he could not support a censure
resolution that stated as facts allegations that the president
hasn't admitted or that have not been proven.
</P>
<P>
   But Nadler said he could swallow some of his qualms if push came
to shove.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was necessary to vote for censure to head off
impeachment, I'd do it despite my reservations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not even sure they will have unanimous Democratic
support for censure in committee, Delahunt said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As President Clinton prepares to fly into the
diplomatic sandstorm of the Middle East, it is not just land
borders but political boundaries that have shifted, creating a
whole new landscape for the three-sided relationship.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is Yasser Arafat who is riding high. The strong,
unbudgeable Palestinian leader knows that unrest in the West Bank
and dissent in Gaza present no serious challenge to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   This is his moment of glory, the terrorist-turned-elder
statesman welcoming the U.S. president _ ``our new partner,'' the
official Palestinian newspaper said _ to his very own, eponymous
airport, gateway to his future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, on the
other hand, both face the possibility of eviction from office, far
more seriously in the Israeli's case. The U.S. president flies out
as the Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives decides
whether to approve articles of impeachment, and Netanyahu is living
on borrowed time until Parliament holds a vote of no confidence in
his government within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Only for Arafat will peace be the central and indispensable
preoccupation. For Netanyahu, who won but a short-lived reprieve
from a Parliament ready to topple him on Monday, the peace plan is
the devil that tore asunder his right-wing coalition. He is not
about to embrace it, much less carry it out, during the two weeks
he fights for his political survival, U.S. presidential visit, or
no.
</P>
<P>
   And for Clinton, if he can concentrate, the land-for-security
peace plan signed with such great ceremony in the White House in
late October, is in danger of becoming a tainted foreign policy
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, his visit from Saturday to Tuesday, like his
efforts at the Wye Plantation in Maryland, could once more distract
attention from the scandal that won't go away. If the trip is
blemished by the unforgiving political realities of the region,
though, the great mediator could end up seeming doubly beleaguered
by forces beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Gaza is being scrubbed and Bethlehem repaved in anticipation of
Clinton's visit. Palestinian poster makers are churning out glossy
likenesses of the president, rather than the ubiquitous mugs of the
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the prime minister's wife, Sarah, taste-tests
appetizers at the Jerusalem Hilton, Israel is playing the reluctant
host. ``Feh,'' the Cabinet says to the trip. Netanyahu said,
shrugging: ``If he wants to come, he should come. If he does not
want to come, he should not come.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was Netanyahu's idea, according to the Americans, but
it has backfired on the prime minister. He wanted to make sure the
Palestinians lived up to their commitment to amend their charter,
eliminating clauses calling for Israel's destruction. Clinton would
preside over a vote of the Palestinian National Council in Gaza,
and all the world would hear the Palestinians renounce their former
war on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip has turned into something that bears the trappings
of an official state visit by Israel's top ally to the Palestinian
National Authority. And this signals a profound change in the
dynamic between the Americans, the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Most alarming to Netanyahu and his Cabinet is the sense that Israel
risks losing its special relationship with the United States, and,
even worse, that the PLO could someday be on a diplomatic par with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this visit as a not terribly positive moment for
Israeli-American relations, just as it is a very positive sign for
U.S.-Palestinian relations,'' said Joseph Alpher, director of the
American Jewish Committee in Israel. ``We're at the point where the
degree and extent of the American coordination over the peace
process is as extensive with the PLO as it is with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis see this as a complicated dynamic that reflects
poorly on Netanyahu's diplomatic skills, at a cost to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not that Clinton and Arafat are developing
mutual trust, but that the Americans are getting closer to the
Palestinians while they are moving further away from Israel,''
Akiva Eldar, a columnist, said in the newspaper Haaretz Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The peace negotiations at the Wye Plantation in Maryland in
October took place against the backdrop of domestic politics as
well. At that time, both Clinton and Netanyahu were seen to be
assisting each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis gave the president the chance to play an important
role on the world stage while the transcripts of Monica Lewinsky's
grand jury testimony were being released. And Clinton, by
proclaiming Netanyahu a man of courage taking a great political
risk, helped force the Labor Party opposition to back him when he
returned; to oppose Netanyahu was to oppose peace.
</P>
<P>
   But now the American president and the Israeli prime minister
are no longer allies but mutual threats. Netanyahu cannot cozy up
to Clinton because the right wing, which he has two weeks to woo
back, will tar him, the initiator, as the inadvertent godfather of
the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton, who had hoped he would be presiding over
festivities, is arriving at a new low in Israeli-Palestinian
relations, which, if Netanyahu feels provoked, could end up
ballooning into a genuine crisis during his time here.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Council may not end up taking what the
Israelis consider to be a genuine vote on Monday, the day Clinton
attends its meeting. In a worst case scenario, this could do more
than freeze the agreement; it could sever it. Almost inevitably,
Clinton will be dragged back into the role of mediating an
agreement that is already signed.
</P>
<P>
   For Netanyahu, the dance of distancing himself from the peace
plan will be a tricky one during this visit that is now so
inopportunely timed to collide with his battle for survival. But
many Israelis see his woes as selfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the issue is less whether Netanyahu will survive
politically, but rather the price that the country will pay,''
David Makovsky, the diplomatic correspondent for Haaretz, wrote.
``And unless a drastic change is made, the price will likely be to
halt the Wye agreement and to hurt U.S.-Israeli relations.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, then, there will be a cost for Arafat, too, but
in the meantime he and his aides are barreling forward, acre by
acre.

   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee on
Wednesday formally called for President Clinton's removal from
office in four draft articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed charges were disclosed even before the White House
had completed presenting its two-day defense of the president to
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the White House, top Democrats and a handful
of Republicans intensified their push to let the full House vote
next week on censuring the president as an alternative to
impeachment. But Republican leaders are resisting such a vote,
fearing it would siphon some moderate Republicans from voting for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In harsh language, the proposed articles expand a bit beyond the
grounds for impeachment outlined in the Starr report sent to
Congress three months ago, which accused the president of lying
under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Republicans folded the many allegations into
four counts: two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of
justice and one count of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury count was divided into two parts, one on the
president's testimony to the federal grand jury and one for his
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case. The split was
devised to address the concerns of some Republicans who are
reluctant to support a charge of perjury in the civil case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of this,'' the eight-page draft of the articles
concluded, ``William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the integrity
of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, has
betrayed his trust as president, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed articles will form the basis for the committee's
deliberations, which are to begin Friday, and the 37-member panel
is almost certain to vote along party lines for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which had for weeks demanded to know the
specific charges the Judiciary Committee was considering in order
to prepare its defense, immediately dismissed them as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the articles, there's nothing in the
allegations, there's nothing in the record, there's nothing in the
Constitution that brings anything here up to the standard of an
impeachable offense,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary.

CLINTON AND CONGRESSMEN DISCUSS FUTURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Ariz., N.H., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton met with 48 members of Congress
from both parties Wednesday to discuss how to shore up Social
Security, and participants said they had come away optimistic, with
some idea about how to edge toward full negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the second and final day of a conference he called
on Social Security's future, reiterated his belief that the higher
investment returns historically available on Wall Street should be
part of the solution to the system's long-term financing problems,
aides said. But he remained silent over the most contentious
element of the debate: whether the investing should be done by the
government or through accounts established by individual workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong meeting, the first at which the president has
discussed Social Security in detail with key members of Congress
from both parties, the participants reviewed a broad array of
options for assuring that the system can weather the retirement of
the baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking higher investment returns, the options
include raising the retirement age, increasing the level of wages
subjected to the Social Security payroll tax, reducing
cost-of-living increases paid to beneficiaries, or some other
combination of benefit cuts and tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The participants also discussed how to move from a general
discussion to the nuts and bolts of drafting a bill that could win
bipartisan support. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said that
eventually a small group of congressional leaders and
administration officials would have to negotiate the details,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also general agreement that for now both parties
should try to get as many members of Congress as possible to study
the details of the various plans, and the trade-offs they would
require. Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser,
said administration officials would work with congressional aides
to assemble briefing materials that could be distributed to all
members of Congress and that would make clear how each proposal
would affect beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a productive discussion that creates some momentum for
us to move ahead,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the session, though, was the fear that progress on
Social Security would be derailed if the House voted to impeach
Clinton and the Senate spent the first several months of next year
preparing for and conducting a trial. Asked about impeachment's
effect on the likelihood of a Social Security deal, Sen. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H., said that ``it reduces it significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg said the discussion Wednesday was ``constructive and
congenial'' and that there was ``no heel-digging, and a desire to
discuss the subject openly and positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were no negotiations or formal proposals,
administration officials and members of Congress from both parties
said they had come away convinced that they could attack the issue
with a minimum of the rancor and the political opportunism that
have long prevented Congress from making the painful choices
inherent in strengthening Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the exchanges at the meeting showed that there
could be ``discussion and disagreements without some of the
harshness and politics that have too often characterized the Social
Security debate in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at a forum on Social Security last summer that if
there was a way to take advantage of the returns offered by the
stock and bond markets without putting undue risk on beneficiaries,
``we ought to go for it.'' He repeated that message Wednesday,
leaving some participants at the meeting hopeful that a compromise
could be worked out between those who advocate individual
investment accounts and those who want the government to do the
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats in the House favor collective government
investment. Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House Democratic leader,
said he could also support voluntary individual accounts that would
be added on top of the current guaranteed benefit program. But he
said he would have ``grave concerns'' about individual accounts
paid for out of the payroll taxes that now go to pay current
retirees.

SMALL CAR DEALERS FACING TOUGH COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; AGOURA HILLS, Calif. -- Mom-and-pop car dealers face an
uncertain future, according to a study released Wednesday by J.D.
Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The market research firm's 1998 Dealer Attitude Study indicates
that increasingly size matters in auto retailing, with smaller
dealerships losing both market share and support from some
manufacturers over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that the top 5 percent of dealers account for
31 percent of all new-vehicle sales, with such consolidation likely
to continue going forward. National megachains and dominant local
players in particular are expanding, J.D. Power officials say.
</P>
<P>
   With more of their cars being sold through these outlets, some
car makers have in turn started shifting resources to the larger
players. In particular, some domestic manufacturers are eliminating
field staff representatives who traditionally support small
dealers, according to the study. The study found relations between
dealers and manufacturers overall declined last year, and have
fallen steadily since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   To survive in an era of consolidation, dealers must establish
retail personalities that distinguish them from one another,
according to Chris Denove, director of consulting operations at
J.D. Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the goal is for the retailer to establish its own
brand so when it comes time to buy a new car the customer first
thinks about what retailer to go to, and then narrows down choices
on the make (of car),'' Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   While smaller dealerships may promote themselves as offering
more personal service to the customer, increasingly it is
dealership chains with economies of scale and large advertising
budgets that draw in the most customers. Even midsize dealerships
are not immune, Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   But the smaller dealers are not throwing in the towel yet.
Pointing to relatively new entities such as the national CarMax
chain, John Woodward III at family-owned Westoaks Chrysler Dodge in
Thousand Oaks, Calif., said many smaller dealers have been in
business for decades, weathering economic feast and famine. CarMax,
meanwhile has only existed during the nation's recent boom years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never seen an economic downturn,'' said Woodward, the
vice president of operations. ``It may be the little guy who
ultimately wins.''

MARKET PLACE: DOES FLATTER YIELD CURVE AUGUR ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN?
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the yield on the 30-year bond below 5 percent again,
investors seem to be signaling that they are even happier about the
outlook for inflation than they were. But, at the same time, they
may be worried anew that the Federal Reserve has not done enough to
protect the U.S. economy from being tripped up by the global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity prices have begun to tumble again, pulling the major
commodity indexes to 20-year lows Wednesday. Coupled with slowing
global growth, investors have every reason to expect inflation,
which is under 2 percent at the consumer level, to fall further.
This means that the 30-year bond's most recent move below 5 percent
could be longer lasting than the plunge in September. That drop
resulted when investors sought a safe haven during the worst of
this year's stock market selloff.
</P>
<P>
   But while inflation expectations are improving, the performance
of short-term rates, which have been rising recently, indicate that
some investors now think that the Fed is not likely to make another
cut in its interest rate target for some time. Put another way,
investors are expecting the economy to slow down significantly from
its nearly 4 percent pace. But they are not worried that they face
the drop _ or even the recession _ that some had predicted in
August and September.
</P>
<P>
   These tea leaf readings come from what is called the yield
curve, which is the difference between the yields offered on the
range of Treasury securities from the three-month bill to the
30-year bond.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in these spreads have been good, but not infallible,
predictors of the future performance of the economy and the path of
interest rates. When short-term interest rates rise above the
yields on the 30-year bond, an economic slowdown is considered
likely because the higher short rates will curb lending and,
therefore, economic growth. That is called an inverted yield curve.
</P>
<P>
   The stage just before that is a flat yield curve, when the
spreads narrow toward zero. That is the direction the curve has
been moving since November. ``Historically, a flatter yield curve
is tied to a market view of a slowdown,'' said Tim Wilhide, a
fixed-income portfolio manager at the Hartford Investment
Management Co.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 4.98
percent, as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose
4/32, to 104 5/32. . At the same time the yield on the two-year
note slipped to 4.41 percent. The spread between the two was 57
basis points, or hundredths of a percent, about half of what it was
just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Ryebrook,
N.Y., said the bond market has gone through a wild swing of
expectations since this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July and the beginning of August, just after the
U.S. stock market began its decline and the global financial crisis
was worsening, the yield curve was even flatter than it is now,
with the difference between the yield on the two-year note and the
30-year bond around 20 basis points. Barbera said this indicated
that many investors thought that the U.S. economy was headed to a
sharp slowdown without a Fed interest rate cut. When the Fed rate
cuts began, short-term rates fell and the spread widened sharply as
the yield curve steepened. By the end of October the spread between
the two-year note and the 30-year note was up to 110 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hoenig said, the yield curve has begun to flatten again as
short-term rates rose after the Fed indicated that its November
rate cut would be the last for some time. ``We are not as worried,
but we are worried again,'' he said, about a slowdown.

AS TROOPS FACE PROTESTERS, SUHARTO IS QUERIED ABOUT WEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As hundreds of soldiers and several small
tanks blocked off streets to prevent student protests, state
prosecutors questioned former President Suharto for four hours
Wednesday morning about his wealth and financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is above the law,'' the former president said, smiling
and enigmatic as always, as he emerged from a government office
where six investigators had asked him 43 questions.
</P>
<P>
   The questions focused primarily on the possible misuse of funds
held by several of Suharto's tax-free charitable foundations and on
multimillion-dollar tax breaks he decreed three years ago for a
``national car'' to be manufactured by his youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   In November the government said Suharto had handed over seven
charitable foundations worth $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have answered all the questions, and I am prepared to give
further explanations if the attorney general's office wishes,'' the
former president said, as security men wrestled to hold back a
shouting throng of Indonesian reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One of his team of eight lawyers, Jafar Assegaf, said Suharto
responded to the questions ``in a straightforward and relaxed
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the mood on the streets later Wednesday, when
student demonstrators shouted for Suharto to be put on trial or,
more expeditiously, simply hanged.
</P>
<P>
   As the street protests have continued almost daily over the last
two weeks _ often at three or four places simultaneously _ the
discontent they express has come to focus more and more keenly on
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators have tried repeatedly to storm his heavily
guarded house and they had hoped to shout their anger Wednesday
outside the building where he was being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto has been driven from power, but his shadow still darkens
the country. People continue to hold him in fear and awe, and there
are some who cannot help seeing his hand behind the killings and
disorders that continue to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation under pressure on May 21 amounted to an
unfinished revolution. Though he is gone, his government and many
of his retainers remain in place and Suharto, 77, has simply
settled into a quiet retirement at his home in a well-to-do
residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   His successor as president, B.J. Habibie, and many other top
officials grew wealthy along with Suharto and owe their positions
to him. Even the attorney general who is investigating him, Andi
Mohamad Ghalib, has long-term ties to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, most people outside government, including the
demonstrators and much of the press, are skeptical that an official
in-house investigation will get very far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy they're investigating him, but I don't think this is
going to be the investigation that I dream of,'' said Aca, 22, who
took part in one of three student protests Wednesday and gave only
his first name. ``I believe a lot of people in government,
including the attorney general, have a lot of respect for Suharto
and are even still afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, The Jakarta Post called for a serious
investigation that would make a clean break with the past. ``A
solid future cannot be built on decayed foundations,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Suharto's legal adviser, Yohanes Yacob, made clear the
problems with this approach. His words could also be read as a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbent and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wednesday's questioning seemed to skirt the toughest
questions of illegal or hidden wealth. Although independent
estimates of Suharto's wealth have run into the tens of billions of
dollars, the former president has admitted to having only about $3
million in three Indonesian bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a local magazine Friday, he said this money
had been saved from his income as president and supplemented by
rent from two houses in Jakarta he has leased to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The public accusations against Suharto are broad. He is believed
to have masterminded a huge network of graft in which his friends
and six children profited by kickbacks or ownership of most of the
country's major enterprises, from banks to toll roads to timber
export.
</P>
<P>
   A problem here is that many of these holdings may have been
technically legal within the system Suharto created, even though,
as The Jakarta Post said, ``they clearly must have been accumulated
through improper means.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview Friday with the monthly magazine Dharmais,
Suharto said he was an innocent target. The students who want to
storm his house should take their complaints to Parliament instead,
he said. ``I am nothing now,'' he told his interviewers. ``I have
resigned.''

MORGAN SEES FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid continuing uncertainty about how easily big
banks will rebound from the losses inflicted by economic turmoil
overseas, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter
earnings would fall far short of analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fourth-largest bank blamed the weak results in
trading it does for its own account for the downturn and said that
profit in the quarter would be less than the 58 cents a share
posted in the third quarter. Analysts had been expecting
fourth-quarter earnings of $1.03 a share, according to consensus
estimates set by First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
In 1997, Morgan posted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.33 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Citigroup, the banking giant recently created by the
merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., said it was
considering the sale of its Phibro Inc. commodity trading unit.
Citigroup, which has been scaling back riskier trading activities,
said that federal banking regulations required it to dispose of
businesses that traded commodities for Citigroup's own account.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Morgan's shares fell
$2.375, or 2.2 percent, to $104.1875. Citigroup rose 75 cents, or
1.55 percent, to $49.25, also in trading on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's continuing problems improving profitability _ its
earnings peaked in the second quarter of 1996 and profits have
declined in each of the last two years _ is certain to invite
renewed speculation about how easy it will be for the bank to
remain independent in a world of new, global banking behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Morgan has repeatedly stated its intention to determine
its own fate. The bank has been laying off employees to cut costs
and said it would incur a $100 million pretax charge in the fourth
quarter as part of that campaign. And the bank has posted a sharp
upturn in businesses such as advising on big mergers, like the
Exxon Corp.'s recent agreement to acquire the Mobil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is strong going into the New Year as markets
recover,'' said Joseph Evangelisti, a Morgan spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Morgan's disclosure will have analysts and
investors scanning Wall Street for signs of other firms that are
having difficulty recovering from the financial upheaval that began
when Russia effectively devalued the ruble and declared a debt
moratorium in August.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of Morgan's earnings shortfall surprised many
analysts. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s banking analyst, Judah Kraushaar,
who estimated that Morgan would post fourth-quarter earnings of 43
cents a share well before Wednesday's announcement, was the only
Wall Street analyst to correctly predict the magnitude of the
shortfall, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be surprised if they had modest trading losses,
but they probably were not huge,'' said Kraushaar, who added that
Morgan offered him few details on its trading problems.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, according to analysts and people close to
Morgan's trading operations, stemmed from missteps the bank made
when it used derivatives and other financial devices to protect
itself from economic volatility in the fourth quarter. That was a
reasonable enough position to take given the brutal trading swings
of the third quarter, but markets have unexpectedly stabilized, and
Morgan's conservative moves went against the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The trading portfolio will also not benefit from some of the
handsome equity gains Morgan racked up recently, such as $157
million in the third quarter and $164 million in the fourth quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually was surprised by the size of the losses,'' said
Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc., who said
he expected Morgan to post healthier returns in 1999, but largely
because of cost-cutting rather than robust revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they going to generate top-tier returns anytime soon?''
asked Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
``I think the answer is no. But they've clearly stated that they're
in this for the long term and intend to remain independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as proof of its financial wherewithal, Morgan also
announced an increase in its quarterly dividend, to 99 cents a
share from 95 cents, effective Dec. 31. The bank also said it might
buy back as much as $750 million of its stock in 1999 or later.

BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU SAYS NUCLEAR GROUP RAN FALSE ADS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Better Business Bureau told the nuclear
industry Wednesday to change ads the bureau said falsely claimed
that nuclear reactors make power without polluting the air and
water or damaging the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, which the nuclear industry said it would take into
account in planning its next campaign, contradicts the central
argument the industry has used in the last few years to justify its
existence. It also inserts the Better Business Bureau, a voluntary
agency that mediates commercial disputes, into a new field: the
electricity marketing battle in California and parts of New York
and Pennsylvania, among other states, that offers consumers a
choice among suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge had been brought by a coalition of environmental
groups and a small electric supplier that markets power from
windmills.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division,
which is based in New York, said in a decision announced Wednesday
that the nuclear industry should stop calling itself
``environmentally clean'' and should stop saying it makes power
``without polluting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Levine, the director of the division, said such claims
were ``unsupportable.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau agreed with environmentalists that nuclear fuel is
made using electricity produced by coal plants; that reactors kill
fish by sucking them in with cooling water and dumping scalding
water back into lakes and rivers, and that nuclear waste poses a
health threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers can reasonably interpret the claim to mean that
electricity generated by nuclear power is produced without any
negative impact on the environment,'' the decision read in part.
``The record, however, does not support this interpretation of the
claim.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's National Advertising Division, which is known as
the NAD, was formed 25 years ago by the ad industry to head off the
threat of government regulation and has no punitive or enforcement
powers. It issues about 100 decisions a year, but the vast majority
are for disparagement of a product. This is its first concerning
the energy field.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision was a new experience for the nuclear
industry, Ms. Levine said it was a harbinger of the energy sector's
transition to deregulated electricity, in which consumers will
choose suppliers much as they pick a long-distance phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' Ms. Levine said of utility companies,
``they have to deal with what everybody else who sells stuff to the
public has had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which also claimed benefits for food irradiation and
medical uses of radioactive materials, were produced by Smith &AMP;
Harroff Inc., an advertising and public relations company in
Arlington, Va., that represents many big utilities and trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
   No ads from the $2 million campaign are now being used. But the
campaign ran print ads for two weeks in April, three weeks in June
and two weeks in November, in The New York Times, The Washington
Post and a variety of magazines, including Baron's, National
Review, The New Republic and The Atlantic, according to Scott
Peterson of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the trade association
that placed them. In addition, a radio spot ran on a Washington
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said that the ads were not intended to sell
electricity. ``We geared this advertising campaign toward policy
makers and opinion leaders, who are now considering not only energy
issues but environmental issues as they go hand and hand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out there looking for market share,'' he said.
``This organization is solely an organization that works on policy
issues. We have no consumer issues at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the bureau's decision read in part, ``Simple economics
dictates that any energy providers who want to be successful in
this deregulated environment must make every attempt to influence
the new direct-to-consumer market as it emerges.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Natural Resources Defense Council, which led the groups
bringing the complaint, Ralph Cavanagh, an electricity expert,
said, ``If this kind of thing was OK, it would effectively mean
there were no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is a ``low-margin, uninteresting commodity,'' he
said. ``Environmental characteristics is the single feature that's
going to matter most in marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAD said that the industry had agreed to modify its claims.
But a spokesman for the nuclear trade group said it had not
explicitly promised to change the campaign and referred to the
group's statement at the end of the decision _ which was that it
had ``benefited from the insight'' the review had provided, and
that ``we intend to take NAD's concerns regarding potential
misconceptions that our advertising might create into consideration
in future advertising campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine said that such statements were typical for
advertisers that lost rulings, and that the industry's failure to
appeal was a sign that it accepted the decision.
</P>
<P>
   At Public Citizen, a consumer group that had also sought a
ruling, a spokesman said that the group had already drafted a
complaint to file with the Federal Trade Commission if the
offending ads ran again.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear reactors are far cleaner than the major source of
electricity in this country, plants that burn coal, but the
industry's trade group has never made the comparison. One key
reason is that almost all the group's members also own coal plants.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group argued that the industry was being held to an
unreasonable standard if pollution in the entire ``life cycle'' of
nuclear power, including fuel preparation, was included. And it
noted that no form of energy was completely harmless; windmills in
Alameda County, Calif., killed more than 1,000 birds between 1992
and 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The points the ads made have been used by the nuclear industry
for years, first to promote reactor construction and, more
recently, to keep operating surviving plants, of which there are
more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, two TV networks pulled an ad placed by a predecessor
agency of the trade group, the U.S. Committee for Energy Awareness.
That ad argued that reactors reduced oil imports by using native
fuel. An antinuclear group, the Safe Energy Communication Council,
complained then that half the uranium was imported and that
utilities did not use much imported oil anyway. The council was
also a complainant in this case.

   Until the latter half of the 19th century, Christmas was no big

<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>

   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

   Gold mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples can be grouped
on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly to mark each
guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening, your guests
can carry them away.

 (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE)
 ADAPTED FROM ``DECORATING FOR THE HOLIDAYS: CHRISTMAS WITH MARTHA
STEWART LIVING, VOLUME 2''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>
<P>
   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.
</P>

SCRAPBOOKS: HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT WILL BE FAMILY TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
 (For purchase information and to obtain photos, call New York Times
Syndicate sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or
(212) 499-3333.) &HT;    
 By KATHY SENA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No doubt there's a shoebox or two up in your closet just
overflowing with snapshots dating back to your child's first
birthday, your wedding ... maybe your own childhood. How do I know
all this? Just take a look in my closets!
 &HT;    You can turn those treasured photos into albums that will become
great holiday gifts _ and family heirlooms.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking, the popular craft of creating ``memory books,''
has been sweeping the western and southern parts of the United
States for the past few years. It is quickly becoming the '90s
version of the quilting bee. Its popularity has even spread to
England, Australia and Japan.
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is simple. But the list of products _ and the
terminology _ can sound intimidating to the beginner. Acid-free?
Polyurethane? Archival quality?
 &HT;    Not to worry. Just follow these simple instructions and you'll
finish your first scrapbook page in no time. And trust me _ you'll
be hooked.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that photos preserved in this fashion should
still be in good shape at least 200 years from now. I can't say the
same for my high school photo album, a magnetic album that has
turned my photos gummy and brown around the edges _ and I'm not
that old! What better treasure to pass on to your children _ and
your great-great-grandchildren.
 WHAT IS SCRAPBOOKING?  
 &HT;    Scrapbooking is a way to preserve photographs and other
memorabilia in a safe, acid-free environment. Acid can weaken and
discolor paper. As long as you choose acid-free, archival-quality
(meaning material that can be safely used for preservation
purposes) paper, pens, adhesive and sheet-protectors, you really
can't go wrong. The only thing you add is photos, love and a little
imagination.
 &HT;    Here's how to get started:
 &HT;    1. Get organized. Group your photos by year or by subject. Most
experts recommend starting with your most recent photographs and
working back in time. Because magnetic-page photo albums are quite
harmful to photos, consider removing photos from old albums and
storing them by date in a heavy-duty, acid-free photo-storage box
(which can be purchased inexpensively at most camera stores and
photo shops) until you have time to add them to your scrapbook.
 &HT;    2. Buy supplies. There is an overwhelming array of scrapbooking
products available at craft stores, stationery stores and rubber
stamp stores and by mail order. There are even stores devoted just
to scrapbooking. But all you really need to get started is the
following:
 &HT;    + Photos. Order double prints.
 &HT;    + Acid-free mounting paper, polyurethane archival-quality page
protectors and a three-ring binder. Some people prefer to use 8 1/2
x 11-inch sheets stored in sheet protectors in binders. Others use
albums of different sizes that are pre-filled with acid-free paper.
 &HT;    + Regular household scissors.
 &HT;    + Acid-free adhesive _ glue stick, photo corners or
peel-and-stick squares.
 &HT;    + Acid-free pen for ``journaling'' _ adding names, dates and
comments to the page.
 &HT;    Starter kits containing most of the above can be purchased at
many craft stores for about $25. To further enhance your pages, you
may wish to buy such items as paper punches, stickers, circle
cutters, colored paper and pens, templates for cutting shapes,
fancy-edged scissors.
 &HT;    3. Pick a theme. Christmas? Your child's birthday party? The
school picnic? Whatever your theme, play with groupings of photos.
Be choosy. Use only your best photos, whether it's one special
photo alone on a page or a grouping of four or five.
 &HT;    4. Crop and mat. You may want to crop your photos to sharpen
their focus. Trim around the most important part of the photo,
removing excess background or unnecessary elements. If you are
using old family photos or other irreplaceable photos, make color
copies and work from those.
 &HT;    You can use plain or patterned paper to create a mat. Just glue
your photo to the paper and trim around the edges, leaving a border
showing. Double- or triple-matted photos look great, too.
 &HT;    5. Add the finishing touches. After you've chosen a layout, it's
time to glue down your photos and to add stickers, stamps and _
most important _ journaling.
 &HT;    Add dates and names, of course. But don't stop there. Add
details that will make the photos come alive for future
generations. Tell a funny story about how your dog ate the
Thanksgiving turkey. List your child's five favorite songs next to
a photo showing her singing. Describe where and how far your son
hiked on the Boy Scout camping trip. It's those details that make
your scrapbook a real family treasure.
 &HT;    6. Pass it around. One of the most rewarding parts of
scrapbooking is sharing the finished book with your family. Kids
can learn a lot from looking at scrapbooks. Older kids enjoy
looking back on family activities and sharing the book with
friends. Toddlers and preschoolers learn names of family members,
pick up lots of new words and enjoy looking at themselves when they
were ``just babies.''
 &HT;    And all kids feel like VIPs as they turn the pages. After all,
they're the stars of their very own book.

AMERICA'S FIRST CHRISTMAS CARD

or (212) 499-3333.
 &HT;    
 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Once a year, Christmas cards flood America's mailboxes. Once a
year, countless fingers go numb from signing and addressing stacks
of them.
 &HT;    How did this tradition come to be?
 &HT;    The first Christmas card can be traced to a long-forgotten
businessman named Richard H. Pease. History records little of Pease
except that he was a skilled lithographer and printer who set up
shop in Albany in 1850. In 1851, whether in a fit of Yuletide
whimsy or in a savvy burst of self-promotion, he put bold black ink
to stiff, pristine white paper and crafted an intricate design.
 &HT;    On 4 1/2-by-6-inch cards, the holiday entrepreneur fashioned
images that later generations might have deemed too ``busy'' in
such a limited space, but that Americans of the 1850s found
perfectly fitting, given the mid-19th century affinity for
Victorian vistas and Currier &AMP; Ives prints.
 &HT;    A gracefully curved line of holly adorned the bottom of the
card, and prominently above the inked leaves ran the creator's
advertisement _ ``Pease's Great Variety Store in the Temple of
Fancy.''
 &HT;    ``Temple of Fancy'' perfectly described the images crowding the
card, Pease having turned his imagination and his drawing hand
loose in a burst of Christmas creativity. Featured in his holiday
motifs was, of course, Santa Claus.
 &HT;    Pease's Santa, however, bore only a passing resemblance to the
rotund St. Nick that famed 19th-century caricaturist Thomas Nast
later stamped upon the nation's collective imagination. The
businessman's Santa appeared on the card as a small, rather elflike
Santa Claus with a fur-trimmed cap.
 &HT;    Pease's card also featured scenes of how middle- and upper-class
Americans of the day celebrated Christmas. Arrayed around the
card's four corners were Christmas presents, Christmas dishes and
Christmas drinks, all hinting of mouthwatering holiday repasts and
heartfelt toasts.
 &HT;    In the card's center, a young, handsome couple, faces redolent
of holiday cheer and financial comfort, enjoyed the Yuletide
exuberance of their three children. Behind the beaming family, a
servant was setting an elaborate holiday dinner, a familiar scene
in affluent and middle-class households throughout the United
States. Reflecting an equally familiar but more disturbing reality
of 1850s American life was the black servant bustling about the
table.
 &HT;    Whether they knew it or not, friends and customers peering at
Pease's landmark cards, with their vivid black and white tones and
their boldly inked message, ``A Merry Christmas and A Happy New
Year,'' literally held the future theme of the Christmas card in
their hands.
 &HT;    Pease's card also contained the stuff of printers' nightmares.
To his friends' and customers' probable amusement and to his
certain chagrin, the engraver's cards included a misspelled word:
``Pease's Great Varety Store.''
 &HT;    In 1874, 24 years after Pease's flight of holiday fancy
materialized, Massachusetts lithographer Louis Prang unveiled a
line of beautiful commercial Christmas cards that spawned a
lucrative industry and earned him the sobriquet ``Father of the
American Christmas Card.''
 &HT;    For generations to come, Prang, whose pleasant, white-whiskered
features resembled those of the Santas in his popular cards, was
hailed as the first American to craft Christmas cards. Pease's
milestone card slipped into historical obscurity, eclipsed by the
commercial and artistic feat of Prang, who would long receive
mistaken acclaim as the creator of the very first American
Christmas card.
 &HT;    In 1954, greeting card authority Gyorgy Buday completed his
detailed book ``The History of the Christmas Card,'' which credited
Prang as the creator of the Christmas card. His publisher was at
the page-proof stage, when the author had a surprise for his
editors.
 &HT;    Buday had just received a letter from E.D. Chase, who had
enclosed a copy of ``the first American Christmas card'' -- Richard
Pease's card.
 &HT;    Buday went on to anoint Pease's card as the first: ``No date
appears on the lithograph itself, but as a result of some
considerable research, Mr. Chase satisfactorily established that it
must be either 1850, 1 or 2, since it was only these three years
that Mr. Pease occupied the building which is pictured prominently
on the card.''
 &HT;    Other scholars of Americana followed Buday's attempt to assign
Pease's card its proper place in the greeting card firmament. That
Prang had created the first commercially successful cards remains
clear. But Pease's creation stands as the nation's first bonafide
Christmas card.
 &HT;    We will never know if Pease's marriage of Christmas and commerce
bloomed ahead of its time, or if he, unlike Prang in the 1870s,
simply failed to parlay his idea into a holiday fortune.

 Hanukkah Bushes? Bah, Humbug!  
 To publish this article, it must be purchased. For purchase
information and to obtain photos, call New York Times Syndicate
sales representative Nirdi Relis at (800) 972-3550 or (212) By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I come from humbug beginnings. Raised as a Jew, I sat on Santa's
lap once at a department store, but it wasn't encouraged. My mother
likely gave in because I was too young to understand the cosmic
implications.
 &HT;    Today, I consider it treason when Jews create ``Hanukkah
bushes'' or exchange gifts on Christmas. I, who don't belong to a
synagogue or light sabbath candles, still feel my roots erupt when
assaulted by Christmas.
 &HT;    The unbidden feelings come from years of singing Yuletide carols
in elementary school and being asked too many times what I did for
``The Holiday.'' When I answer indifferently that I worked, went to
a movie or grabbed a bite in Chinatown, people are suddenly quiet.
 &HT;    There's nothing like Christmas to make a Jew feel like a
minority. I know someone in Harleysville, Pa., who looked high and
low for Hanukkah candles. After painfully trying to describe to
clueless salespeople what menorah candles looked like, a clerk
suggested he use birthday candles _ a ludicrous concept to anyone
who knows the difference. The same person complained to a local
Wal-Mart manager when he couldn't find a Jewish New Year's card in
stock at Rosh Hashanah.
 &HT;    Most of the holiday cards I receive are bald-faced Christmas
cards, usually from people who 1) know I am Jewish, and 2) do not
know that Hanukkah began two weeks before Christmas.
 &HT;    While some feature neutral winter landscapes, others are
foil-embossed nativity scenes or living rooms steeped in candy
canes and boughs of holly. Sure, it's the thought that counts, but
a little more thinking could have gone a long way.
 &HT;    One year I happened upon a great series of cards called ``Mixed
Blessings.'' These cards use playful interdenominational pictures,
such as Santa skating a Star of David on ice or a reindeer with
antlers shaped like a menorah. Perfect to send anyone in the spirit
of unity.
 &HT;    Still, if you want to get technical, Hanukkah does not draw top
billing in the rank of Jewish holidays. When you care enough to
send the very best, send a card for the Jewish New Year, usually in
September.
 &HT;    Really, I'm not a grinch. I think the holiday season is a great
nudge for keeping tabs on faraway friends. Bragging family form
letters aside, I enjoy receiving their cards with news of a new
baby or a career switch. Likewise, I too have been known to think
about the people in my life each December who deserve a note from
the heart, seasonal or otherwise.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For kids with computers, there's no better gift this holiday
season than new software. The children's software market has
exploded this year, with more exciting and innovative programs than
ever before. Kids can raise their own virtual dragon, play a
scavenger hunt game with the cast of Blue's Clues and even learn
about physics as they build their own pinball machines.
 &HT;    There's a new crop of gizmos and gadgets, too, that extend
computer technology beyond the PC. Lego Mindstorms, for instance,
lets your children construct and program real, moving robots out of
Legos. This is a great time to be a kid!
 &HT;    Here's the scoop on the hottest children's software of the year,
along with some shopping and installation tips.
 TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS  
 &HT;    Reader Rabbit's Toddler 2.0
 &HT;    A perfect introduction to the computer, this program offers nine
playful activities that even the youngest techies can master. The
program's thoughtful design insures success _ any movement of the
mouse or press of a key causes something exciting to happen on the
screen. Runs on: Win/Mac. The Learning Company, 800-716-8506, ages
1 1/2-3, $29.95.
 &HT;    JumpStart Preschool '99

skills. From counting to colors and shapes to sequencing, the
activities both teach and entertain. Runs on: Win/Mac. Knowledge
Adventure, 800-542-4240, ages 2-4, $30.
 &HT;    Tonka Workshop CD-ROM Playset
 &HT;    One of those new-fangled gadgets mentioned above, this is a
plastic tool bench that easily straps onto the keyboard of your PC.
Once the accompanying software is installed, children can
manipulate the tools to build all kinds of onscreen projects. Kids
loved sawing and hammering to make houses, robots and more. Runs
on: Windows. Hasbro Interactive, 800-683-5847, ages 3 and up,
$39.95.
 &HT;    Blue's Birthday Adventure

 &HT;    Dr. Seuss Kindergarten
 &HT;    There's a new zoo in Seussville. Of course, you won't see the
usual zoo fare. Instead you'll find exotic creatures like
Barbaloots and Birthday Pets, just to name a few. Children help
find the zoo's animals by playing eight reading and math games. In
addition to providing skills practice, this CD offers a rich
Seussian language experience, complete with original songs. Runs on
Win/Mac. Broderbund Software, 800-521-6263, ages 4-6, $19.95.
 ELEMENTARY-AGE CHILDREN  
 &HT;    Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening
 &HT;    We first met Pajama Sam in a CD-ROM adventure in which he
valiantly overcame his fear of darkness. Now he's conquering his
nervousness about stormy weather. Children help out by exploring
the World Wide Weather headquarters, finding helpful items and
solving problems by using their logic and memory skills. A favorite
of our child-testers. Runs on: Win/Mac. Humongous Entertainment,
800-499-8386, ages 3-8, $39.95.
 &HT;    Quest for Camelot
 &HT;    Although there are a total of seven engaging activities in this
movie-based program, the best is a great ``dragon-rearing'' game in
which kids must raise a cute little dragon from birth through
adolescence. They must feed the critter, entertain him, teach him
to walk and keep him from developing bad habits. Kids just loved
it. Runs on: Win/Mac. Knowledge Adventure, 800-542-4240, ages 5-10,
$20.
 &HT;    Backyard Soccer
 &HT;    Ideal for young soccer players, this simulation stars 30

members, and then uses the mouse to control the action. The
play-by-play is called by two kid commentators and stats are kept.
Runs on: Win/Mac. Humongous Entertainment, 800-499-8386, ages 5-10,
$19.99.
 &HT;    Make a Masterpiece
 &HT;    If you're looking for a program that children will return to
time and time again, invest in a high-quality draw and paint

 SIDEBAR: SHOPPING AND INSTALLATION HINTS  
 &HT;    + Avoid impulse buys. Don't be fooled by fancy packaging. Do
your homework first by reading reviews and talking to friends.
 &HT;    + Check system requirements. Make sure you are buying something
your computer can handle. Minimum system requirements are always
listed on the boxes.
 &HT;    + Try before you buy. Many companies will let you play limited
versions of their programs on their websites or will send you a
demo CD. Call the company's 800 number for details.
 &HT;    + Install the software prior to the gift-giving. If at all
possible, install the software on your computer beforehand, make
sure it runs then rewrap the gift. Potential Christmas morning
disaster averted!

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nearly 300,000 acres of privately owned forests,
tumbling wild rivers, lakes and wetlands in New York's Adirondack
region, Vermont, and New Hampshire will be opened to public use in
a $76.2 million land deal announced on Wednesday, with about
one-third of that acreage set aside forever as preserves.
</P>
<P>
   The land was put up for sale last year by Champion International
Co., one of the world's largest paper companies, as part of a broad
effort to cut costs and sell off unneeded assets.
</P>
<P>
   For the paper company, which owns or manages more than 11
million acres of forest in North and South America and has more
than $5 billion in annual sales, the all-cash agreement is a minor
accounting maneuver. For hikers, canoeists, bird watchers, hunters,
and other outdoor enthusiasts, it is nothing short of spectacular,
a variety of state officials and private environmental groups said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups had feared that the Champion lands would be
subdivided for housing or intensively logged. But now the land will
be bought by the Conservation Fund, a private group in Virginia
that acts as a middleman in transactions that preserve land with
significant environmental or historic values.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of New York and Vermont said that the
land-preservation deal was the largest in their states' histories.
And the Conservation Fund says that it did not know of a larger
pricetag for a preservation effort involving governments and
private investors in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   At a complicated closing, expected to be held in the spring, the
title for various tracts would immediately be transferred to a
variety of purchasers ranging from the state governments to private
investors, said Jack Lynn, a spokesman for the Conservation Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the three states would buy fragile river
corridors and woodlands brimming with threatened wildlife, while
private investors would buy the remaining forested land for
logging.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, Gov. George Pataki of New York said
the deal was an ideal meshing of public and private interests, with
thousands of acres preserved and other land opened to the public
for recreation while still generating logging jobs and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody comes out ahead,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The twin threats of intensive logging and development have
imperiled a broad swath of woodlands from northern New York to
Maine in recent years, according to a variety of private and
government studies. Champion said that this spring, it had more
than 40 potential bidders for the parcel, including companies that
would have subdivided the land.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Noonan, chairman of the Conservation Fund, said that the
unorthodox deal, involving state governments, private investors,
and foundations, was needed to raise enough money to compete in the
intensifying market for forest lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, under pressure from shareholders, paper
and timber companies have been selling off enormous tracts, with
905,000 acres of forest land in central Maine sold for $180 million
by a South African company in October. Altogether, Maine has seen
more than 2 million acres of land sold this year, with less than
2,000 acres targeted for preservation, Noonan said.

TWEETER LOOKS NATIONWIDE WITH PURCHASE OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing to expand outside its New England home base, Tweeter
Home Entertainment Group said Wednesday it plans to acquire Home
Entertainment Inc., a Houston-based chain of seven consumer
electronics stores, for about $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is Tweeter's third in two years, its first since
becoming a publicly traded company this summer, and part of a
strategy to transform Tweeter into a national retailer focused on
mid- to high-end audio and video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the demise of Lechmere and the recent invasion of
its home turf by Best Buy Co., Tweeter has nearly quadrupled
revenues in the last few years, largely by acquisition. In 1996,
Tweeter bought Bryn Mawr Stereo &AMP; Video in suburban Philadelphia,
and last year it added HiFi Buys in Atlanta. Sales now total $232.3
million, up from about $60 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to become a national specialty chain,'' said
Jeffrey Stone, president of the Canton, Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter, whose local stores do business under the Tweeter etc.
nameplate, keeps the names of the chains it buys. The president of
Home Entertainment will join Tweeter. The Texas chain has annual
sales of $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giants such as Circuit City and Best Buy may battle each other
for the customer who wants the lowest prices for TVs and audio
equipment, but Tweeter claims there's a profitable niche for a
chain that caters to customers who want better service and the
superior quality of mid- and high-range product lines.
</P>
<P>
   And with new digital technology coming onto the scene, Tweeter
believes its well-trained staff has an edge over larger rivals as
consumers begin to buy digital-video-disk players, digital
camcorders, and high-definition televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stone: ``When there's confusion about new products, who do
consumers go to? The store with the best reputation for service.
Confusion benefits us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter claims to own the early adapter _ the affluent customer
who has to be the first on the block to buy a satellite dish or
big-screen TV. Tweeter also claims to attract customers who buy
gear bit by bit _ a subwoofer one year, a DVD player the next _ as
they gradually assemble a home-theater system.
</P>
<P>
   New products and a booming economy finally seem to be lifting an
industry that struggled in the mid 1990s. With no new products to
spur sales, prices for items such as TVs and VCRs plummeted, and
one result was a shakeout in the consumer electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst George F. Sutton,
more than a thousand stores closed between 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But with chains such as Lechmere, the Incredible Universe, and
Nobody Beats the Wiz either shutting down or retrenching, survivors
now see opportunities in a $22 billion industry for audio and video
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy means many pricey new homes now include media
rooms for home-theater systems, and that plays ``directly into
Tweeter's strengths,'' Sutton noted in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   And while Best Buy and Circuit City may dominate the low end of
the market, Tweeter is ``the only known consolidator of the
high-end consumer electronics channel,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, founder Sandy Bloomberg opened the first
Tweeter in 1972 because ``it was a good way to meet girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg was not alone in launching a regional chain. With the
advent of stereo sound, a heyday in rock-and-roll, and then-young
baby boomers eager to buy Beatles records and fancy stereos to play
them on, the 1960s and early 1970s saw a host of small
entrepreneurs go into the consumer electronics business.
</P>
<P>
   As the founders of these chains approach their 60th birthday,
many are looking for an exit strategy, and an acquisition offer
from Tweeter is a good way to cash out their investment, said
Joseph McGuire, Tweeter's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg and Stone hit upon this strategy in the mid-1990s
after they concluded there wasn't much room to expand in New
England, a mature market with little population growth.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the pair turned to venture capitalists to finance
acquisitions in areas of the country growing more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   To retire debt from these acquisitions, Tweeter became a public
company this summer. A $30 million credit facility from BankBoston
adds to Tweeter's warchest for future acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why PaineWebber analyst Aram Rubinson has a ``buy''
rating on Tweeter is that its concept of competing against giants
has been battle-tested.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter has been able to ``duplicate its niche in three distinct
markets,'' said Rubinson, referring to Boston, Philadelphia, and
Atlanta. ``Tweeter's niche has stood the test of time and
geography.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it's a good bet that Tweeter can achieve its goal
of becoming a national retailer by piecing together regional chains
that sell mid- to high-end merchandise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And because it focuses on the higher-end, profit margins are
less likely to suffer in the price wars that sometimes flare up
between discount chains, Rubinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter claims to have another strength: It focuses only on
audio and video equipment. Though Best Buy and Circuit City dwarfed
Tweeter with annual sales of about $8 billion each last year, the
two giants sell a far broader range of products, including personal
computers, appliances, and music CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In Best Buy's case, there's only about a 20 percent overlap in
products, and because Tweeter buys merchandise through a
cooperative of regional chains, its prices are competitive when all
three chains stock the same item, Stone claims.
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter is opening only about two stores a year in New England,
but its acquisition plans are more ambitious. In Texas, Tweeter
thinks Home Entertainment can quickly grow into a 25-store chain
with locations in Houston, Dallas, and Austin. Each new store
represents an $850,000 investment and looks to generate sales of $3
million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole strategy of site selection is to be between a
Circuit City and a Best Buy,'' Stone said. ``We want to be right in
the path of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   On purchases of big-ticket items such as DVD players, consumers
carefully check prices and the levels of service that retailers
offer, he said. Tweeter thrives when it locates stores near rivals,
and customers shuttle back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, many chains selling consumer electronics seem to
be thriving, thanks to the economy and new products. Both Best Buy
and Circuit City have recently reported sales gains.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Tweeter said revenue rose 22.3
percent to $53.5 million. Sales at stores open at least a year rose
15.3 percent. Profits before charges were $1.08 million, compared
with a loss of $459,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Tweeter went public in July, the opening price of its stock
was 17 a share. On Nasdaq Wednesday, shares rose 1 3/8 to close at
24. Tweeter's transaction was announced after US markets closed.

TITANS AND SCHOLARS OF THE COLLEGE GAME GATHER AND SWAP TALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The room at the Waldorf-Astoria was divided into two
symbolic parts: age and experience.
</P>
<P>
   On one side sat 17 current college football players, recipients
of the National Football Foundation's Scholar-Athlete award. On the
other side sat the 12 newest inductees into the College Football
Hall Fame. All had not been scholars, but each represented a
snippet of the scholar-athlete ideal: a balance between the student
and the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The college players represented the diverse tapestry of
intercollegiate athletics, from superpowers like Nebraska to a
Division III non-scholarship program like SUNY-Brockport. The older
players ran the gamut from Alex Sarkisian, who played offense and
defense for Northwestern from 1946 to 1948 at Northwestern, to Bo
Jackson, who played for Auburn from 1982 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For an hour the athletes and inductees engaged in a call and
response of experiences: the younger men mostly expressed
aspirations and spoke of the reality of their experiences to this
point.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Sierk, the Princeton field goal kicker, spoke of discipline
and the thrills of playing football; Corby Jones, the Missouri
quarterback, spoke of pushing forward despite adversity; Tom
Massey, a defensive back from SUNY-Brockport, said he played not
for the cheering hoards or for rooms and books and tuition, but
simply for love of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The older men, aided by time, put their colleges days in broader
perspective. Mel Long, an all-America defensive lineman at Toledo
from 1969 to 1971, spoke modestly about going to Toledo as an older
freshman and going out for the team on a dare. What Long did not
tell was the story of his life before football. After finishing
Macomber High in Toledo, Ohio, Long joined the Marines and went to
Vietnam where he became a squadron leader and was decorated for
heroism.
</P>
<P>
   After the brunch, I asked Long how he earned the honor. ``I
killed six men,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He elaborated: his squad was ambushed, pinned down by
machine-gun fire. He went into a nest to see if anyone was there.
There were six North Vietnamese in the nest. ``They turned around,
the look on their face was complete surprise,'' Long said. He shot
each of them three times.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Jackson spoke of overcoming a speech impediment, making
himself into a good student and becoming the first in his family to
attend a large university and earn a degree. ``You can say I ran my
way into college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McMahon stood and told a different story. He attended
Brigham Young University. His love was baseball, not football. For
all the lofty academic awards of the day, McMahon said, ``I
basically went to school to play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Johnson, a member of the foundation's board, said that he
was somewhat stunned by McMahon's comments. ``Most of the people
who have been honored, if they talk about just being an athlete,
they talk about it in a different light,'' said Johnson, who was
inducted in 1972. ``They talk about how they wish they would have
seen the light; that there's another side of it. I can't remember
anybody celebrating the fact that they just went to school to play
football. If they're happy about that, that's their loss.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, in his own way, was humble, and acknowledged that he
came around a bit in high school when his parents made him stop
playing until he put effort into his schoolwork. ``My folks said
sports was not promised to anyone, you have to earn the right to
play athletics. So I had to earn the right by getting good enough
grades to be able to play. I did that and suffered through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is going through the same thing with his oldest son.
McMahon told of having to go to school for a conference with his
oldest son. ``I had to go talk to his teacher and principal about
his grades,'' McMahon said. ``It was kind of tough. He's just like
I was. I'm explaining to him: `Look, you have to at least be
eligible. You can almost be brain dead, it doesn't take that much
to keep yourself eligible to play sports.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Osborne, the retired Nebraska coach, spoke of some great
times, and some bad times, with the Cornhuskers. He spoke of awards
and championships. But they had not defined his career. Osborne
recalled something that Bob Devaney, who preceded him as the
Nebraska coach, said many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `The thing you want to remember is that when you die,
the size of your funeral will be primarily determined by the
weather.' What means the most have been the relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the old wisdom of adults, a college player crystallized
the essence of the college experience and brought home the point
about the fragility of relationships and life itself. Jeff Zurcher,
a defensive back from Kentucky, recalled the Wildcats' great
season. He recalled the absolute high of winning a game against
Vanderbilt that gave Kentucky its most successful season in years.
That game was the high point of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he said that he learned that his teammate, Arthur
Steinmetz, had been killed in a car accident. ``He had his life
ahead of him,'' Zurcher said, choking back tears. ``He was so
talented, he could have played in the NFL. But I learned about the
importance of relationships. I learned that football, that life,
can be taken away just like that.''

LANGUAGE PARSING AND MORE ON JAVA AT MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft trial focused Wednesday on an
esoteric issue that is crucial to the outcome of the antitrust
case: What is a computer operating system?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is important because the government contends that
Microsoft Corp. illegally tied its software for browsing the World
Wide Web to its industry-standard Windows operating system to
stifle competition in the Internet software market. Microsoft says
its browser is not a separate product unfairly tied to Windows but
merely a feature of its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, Steven Holley, a Microsoft lawyer, battered away at
the government's expert witness, David Farber, a computer science
professor at the University of Pennsylvania, asking him arcane
questions about fine distinctions in programming files.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the questioning was intended to try to get Farber to
concede that drawing a neat, sharp line separating the operating
system _ which controls a computer's basic operations _ from other
software was tricky, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Farber held his own, batting away the
challenges to the central tenet of his testimony, which was that
there is no obvious technical or user benefit to integrating the
operating system and the browser as Microsoft did.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft apparently has had its own difficulties in defining
just what an operating system is. The government offered into
evidence a dictionary of computer terminology published last year
by Microsoft. The entry for operating systems makes no mention of
Internet software or anything related to it. And the definition for
a Web browser seems squarely at odds with Microsoft's courtroom
contention that its Internet Explorer browser is an inextricable
element of Windows rather than a separate software product, or
application.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft dictionary states that a Web browser is an
``application that allows users'' to navigate the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft, it seems, had some trouble finding a
distinguished expert witness to agree entirely with its view of the
operating system and the browser. In September, when Microsoft
initially named its 12 witnesses, the list included Michael
Dertouzos, director of the computer-science laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was listed as Microsoft's
technical expert.
</P>
<P>
   But Dertouzos was soon dropped from the Microsoft witness list
after giving a deposition in the case, part of which was entered
into evidence Wednesday. When asked, ``Is a browser an
application?'' Dertouzos responded, ``Historically and today, it is
the case that browsers are treated as applications.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, James Gosling, an executive for Sun
Microsystems Inc., whose cross-examination began last week, took
the stand again. With sharp questions and the introduction of
e-mail evidence, the Microsoft legal team attacked the government's
allegation that Microsoft unfairly tried to ``pollute'' Java, an
Internet programming language developed by Sun, because Microsoft
viewed the new technology as a threat to its dominance of the
personal computer software market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Microsoft tried to portray its own work with Java,
which it licensed from Sun in 1996, as an effort to make the new
Internet programming language work smoothly with Microsoft's
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft introduced an e-mail sent on Aug. 31, 1995, by
Gosling, one of Java's creators, to Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman,
sketching out a number of options on how to exploit Java as a
business. One option, he wrote, was to use Java to ``go after
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   But later he wrote: ``I wouldn't `go after' Microsoft. I'd want
to work with them, but beat them at their own game ... or at least
give them the illusion of working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Sun of dealing with its rival in bad faith, Thomas
Burt, a Microsoft lawyer, asked, ``Isn't that exactly what you
did?''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also introduced e-mail from Sun to its closely aligned
Java partners, led by Netscape Communications Corp. and IBM, which
are also archrivals of Microsoft, to establish industry working
groups to develop Java software. Microsoft, Burt noted pointedly,
was left off those groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust case and in a private suit in California,
Microsoft is accused of deliberately making its version of Java
incompatible with Sun's standard Java. Burt insisted that the split
was Sun's fault. ``Isn't it true that Sun had no interest in making
Java work especially well with Windows?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gosling replied that any lack of cooperation on Sun's part was a
result of Microsoft's stance that its version of Java would work
smoothly only on Windows and would not include the Sun software to
make it work on several operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we drew the line was when Microsoft's work blocked out
other software platforms,'' Gosling said.

 ALBANY, N.Y.: Noonan said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Another 500,000 acres in Alabama just went on the market _ all
cash, no contingency bids,'' he said. ``We don't have that kind of
money in the conservation world.'' With the Champion lands, he
said, ``we had to try to make a stand, to find a new way, to cobble
together the various interest groups in three states.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of conservation and recreation groups said the
deal represented the future of land preservation efforts, by
creating a blend of state-held preserves in the most fragile,
unspoiled areas, surrounded by private lands with easements
guaranteeing public access and environmentally sound tree
harvesting methods.
</P>
<P>
   In New York's Adirondack Park, the deal would add 29,000 acres _
about the area of the island of Manhattan _ to protected
state-owned forest preserves. Another 110,000 acres of land would
be bought by a private investing group for timber harvesting, but
opened to the public for recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, New York state has committed to paying $24.9 million
for the 29,000 acres and for an easement controlling the uses of
the private land, Pataki said. The money will come from the 1996
Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale is complete, Vermont will see 133,000 acres
preserved, with somewhere between 39,000 and 48,000 acres of that
land eventually protected as publicly owned preserves, depending on
final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont said of the deal, ``We've done
30,000 acres, 33 miles along the Connecticut River, but this by far
dwarfs all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the national land conservation group to link the
interests of the states, the project could not have succeeded, he
said. ``If the Conservation Fund hadn't stepped in,'' he said,
``all this land would've been subdivided and turned into game farms
and things of that sort and the public would have lost access.''
</P>
<P>
   The land, in the state's northeast corner, includes the complete
shorelines of 15 lakes and ponds and 33 miles of frontage on the
Nulhegan River, a major headwater of the Connecticut River, said
Nancy Bell, the Vermont representative of the Conservation Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Vermont land would be sold by the Conservation
Fund to private investors who agree not to develop housing and
conduct only environmentally sensitive logging, more so than what
had been done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The sale also includes 18,000 acres in New Hampshire, including
28 miles of land along more than a half dozen woodland streams.
Specific details of this deal are still being ironed out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An essential element of the deal was the involvement of The
Forestland Group, a private investing group that specializes in
buying and managing forest stands for the long term, only
harvesting as much timber as is being replaced by new growth.
</P>
<P>
   It has agreed to buy the 110,000 acres of Champion's commercial
timber land inside the boundaries of the Adirondack Park, along
with some nearby acreage, with the understanding that New York
state will hold an easement that guarantees public access and
restricts logging to methods that preserve the forest.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 acres in conservation easements are already in
place in New York, but those are focused mainly on preventing the
subdivision for building homes, said Timothy Burke, the executive
director of the Adirondack Council, a private group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sets a precedent by dealing with forest management,'' he
said. ``There will be no clearcutting.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who was previously a commissioner of environmental
protection for Vermont, said that residents of the Adirondacks and
Vermont shared a deep suspicion of sales of land or land rights to
the state. But by keeping most of the property in private hands, he
said, this agreement would help allay concerns.
</P>
<P>
   When the patchwork of Champion-owned lands went on the market as
a single block last year, environmental groups and state
environmental officials found themselves scrambling to compete with
foreign investors and large paper and logging companies.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was complicated by the fact that the parcels were in
three states, while Champion preferred to sell all the land to a
single buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, the Conservation Fund pulled together
a combination of state commitments of money, private investors, and
grants from philanthropic foundations that was big enough to cover
most of the $76.2 million cost.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, in an interview, said that the deal shared qualities
with some of the complicated transactions in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a three-way trade in baseball, where you need a
third baseman and the team that wants your player has a pitcher,''
he said. ``It's much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, sometimes the results are much more rewarding.
``I can't wait to get up there,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of private recreation and conservation groups in the
Adirondacks said the deal would open rivers to the public that had
been in private hands for more than 100 years.

RED SOX GM SAYS `CHICKEN LITTLES' NEED NOT WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette used the occasion
of introducing his newest acquisition, 36-year-old pitcher Mark
Portugal, to decry the ``Chicken Littles who say the sky is
falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, who has endured harsh criticism for letting Mo Vaughn
depart without replacing him, insisted that the team can still
thrive without the slugging first baseman, who took his 40 home
runs, 115 RBIs, and .337 batting average to the Anaheim Angels. The
Red Sox attempted to sign free agent Bernie Williams but were
rebuffed when he elected to return to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we are returning the core of our team with
the exception of Vaughn,'' Duquette said Wednesday at Fenway Park's
600 Club, where Portugal waited patiently to answer questions while
the GM was surrounded by TV cameras and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our good defense back, we have a good pitching staff,
and now it's a matter of replacing Vaughn's power,'' Duquette
added. ``That is substantial, but we're confident we can put
somebody out there who is professional and can do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said the Red Sox already have replaced Vaughn's on-base
capacity with free agent Jose Offerman, whom he continues to
describe as one of the best offensive players in the American
League. ``Our fans are going to like this kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a matter of locating another power source, and though
40-homer hitters are not in abundant supply, Duquette did not sound
terribly concerned. He said clubs that cannot afford to have a high
payroll may be willing to part with a proven hitter for prospects.
The bottom-of-the-economic-barrel Montreal Expos would seem to fit
that profile, but Duquette said he doesn't expect outfielder
Rondell White to be available and insists he has never had
discussions with Montreal regarding White.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the suggestion that the Red Sox would rescind their
decision to raise ticket prices 15 percent because they haven't
signed a high-profile player to replace Vaughn. ``It's an exciting
team,'' he said. ``You can't go anywhere else and see Nomar
Garciaparra play every day. You can't go anywhere else and see
Pedro Martinez or the Rolaids man (Tom Gordon, who was the league's
top reliever under a ratings system sponsored by the antacid
maker).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of Chicken Littles who say the sky is falling,
but we've got the core of our team back. You're going to see a
competitive team.''
</P>
<P>
   With the winter meetings opening this weekend in Nashville,
Duquette said pitching remains a priority, even after the addition
of veteran righthander Portugal, who last season went 10-5 with a
4.44 ERA for the Phillies after missing six weeks with a knee
injury and figures to be the No. 4 starter behind Martinez, Bret
Saberhagen, and Tim Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he would like to add both starters and relievers.
But he said the club would not pursue free agent prize Kevin Brown
because it refuses to offer the 34-year-old pitcher the six-year
deal his agent, Scott Boras, said he is seeking. The club made an
offer last week to Toronto for Roger Clemens, Duquette said, but
``we're not encouraged by what we've heard back from Toronto. We
think they'll go in another direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks with Toronto never progressed to the point where the Blue
Jays asked the Sox to improve their offer, Duquette said, and it's
highly doubtful Clemens would have consented to return here,
especially in the wake of Vaughn's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said if the team makes a trade in Nashville, he
probably will deal prospects, not big leaguers. ``I'm not putting
all these guys on the market,'' he said. ``I'm not putting all
these guys out there. We're not looking to take away two to add
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette had high praise for Double A outfielder Dernell Stenson
and acknowledged the club might look at him at first base next
spring. Wilton Veras, who played third base at Trenton last season,
may also get a look at first, though Duquette acknowledged both
players probably require more seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   While saying the Red Sox were ``very aggressive'' in their
pursuit of Williams, Duquette said that was not the case with other
free agent hitters. He never made an offer to Albert Belle, he
said, though he would not say whether that was because Belle was
seeking no-trade protection, which the Red Sox do not offer. He
made an offer to first baseman Rafael Palmeiro but dropped out when
other teams offered five-year deals, including the Rangers, who
signed him. No offer was made to Will Clark, who signed with the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's departure, Duquette reiterated, is not insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still talking about some excellent offensive players,''
he said. ``You need a number of good hitters in the lineup. One
hitter is not going to make or break your lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is contrary to the opinion voiced by numerous Sox
players _ Garciaparra, Mike Stanley, John Valentin, Martinez _ that
Vaughn was an indispensable part of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't open until April 1 (actually 5),'' Duquette said. ``I
wouldn't be too concerned right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who lives in Barrington, R.I., is a big Providence
College fan, and brought sons Derek and Jacob with him to the press
conference, agreed to a one-year deal for $2.7 million. The club
holds a $3.3 million option for 2000, with a $300,000 buyout that
guarantees Portugal $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal missed nearly all of the 1997 season after undergoing
surgery to reattach the flexor muscles to his right elbow and made
just one start in 1998 before missing six weeks because of
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. He also had surgery on his
left knee in '97, and the Phillies thought him too much of a health
risk to exercise a $2.75 million club option for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging he was disappointed the Phillies cut him
loose, Portugal insisted he's not worried about his physical
condition. He went 7-3 with a 3.69 ERA after the All-Star break
last season and pitched at least seven innings in eight of his last
16 starts, including two complete games. He also beat the Red Sox,
3-2, last June in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I don't have the little things
piling up. My arm feels good. My legs feel good. I'm looking
forward to getting back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has been on the DL 10 times in a big league career that
began in 1985 with the Twins and has continued with the Astros,
Giants, Reds, and Phillies. ``I've broken everything,'' he said
with a laugh. ``There's nothing left to fix.''

 &HT;    Clinton's best hope in House vote is GOP moderates
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Impeachment proceedings against President Clinton
entered a dramatic new phase Wednesday as Republicans, unmoved by
the White House defense of the president, unveiled a strongly
worded draft of four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, pushed a resolution of censure, a less
harsh alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The competing proposals to punish Clinton overshadowed two
carefully choreographed days of testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee from administration lawyers and a dozen
scholars, lawyers and politicians who oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But the target audience of both sides in the historic debate is
not the committee, where an impeachment vote is considered a
foregone conclusion, but the 20 to 30 undecided, mainly moderate
Republicans in the House whose votes could tip the balance either
for or against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic proposals dwelt exclusively on
Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four proposed articles of impeachment charge Clinton
with perjury, one in his grand jury testimony in August and the
other in his January deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A third count accuses the president of obstructing justice by
encouraging Lewinsky to submit a false affidavit and testify
untruthfully, among other actions.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article claims the president abused his powers when
he ``frivolously asserted executive privilege'' to fight
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Judiciary panel hammered away at Clinton's
defenders throughout the day Wednesday, repeatedly citing as lies
the president's denials of a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and
his inability to recall being alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe when the president gave those answers, he was
lying,'' said Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.).
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the committee were not much kinder in their call
for Clinton's censure by Congress. Their proposal accuses the
president of violating Americans' trust and dishonoring his office
in his affair with Lewinsky, ``a subordinate,'' and in the
subsequent cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' resolution would not impose a fine, but it would
require Clinton's signature. It also points out that Clinton could
be subject to criminal prosecution when he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to approve at least one of
the perjury articles of impeachment. Votes could come by week's
end, said committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, the full House would convene next week for only
the second time in U.S. history to consider impeaching a president.
Andrew Johnson is the only president to be impeached, and he
survived an 1868 trial in the Senate by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in August 1974 after the
Judiciary Committee adopted three articles of impeachment against
him.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich would be the leader to summon the
435 members of the House to Washington, but neither Gingrich nor
his presumptive successor, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, is
expected to preside.
</P>
<P>
   That chore would be handled by Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.), a
second-term member with a reputation for fairness and experience in
presiding over controversial debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Hyde cautioned members to withhold judgment. ``The
committee deserves the respect of the House, and the House should
see the committee's work before rushing to judgment,'' Gingrich
told reporters outside the committee's hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, however, said he would most likely be voting with
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the proposed bill of particulars against Clinton
diverted attention from White House counsel Charles Ruff, who
wrapped up the White House's presentation to the committee by
calling Clinton's actions ``morally reprehensible,'' but not
impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, the last Watergate special prosecutor a generation ago,
came closest of any administration official to conceding that the
president may have lied, not merely misled, in the Jones
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people ... could determine that he crossed over
that line and that what for him was truthful but misleading or
nonresponsive and misleading or evasive was, in fact, false,'' Ruff
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney stuck to the White House insistence that
Clinton did not commit perjury since he believed he was telling the
truth, and intent is an element of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   With presidential friend and counselor Bruce Lindsey and Clinton
lawyer David Kendall in the row behind him, Ruff acknowledged that
Clinton would be subject to possible prosecution, promising the
president would not accept a pardon from his successor.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the administration's bid to derail impeachment, Ruff
said, ``We are open to any reasonable suggestion from any side as a
way of finding an end to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats believe that some Republicans in the House would
vote against impeachment if they are given the opportunity to
rebuke Clinton through a resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of witnesses that preceded Ruff's testimony included a
moderate Republican, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who
made it clear that he thinks the case against Clinton is ``thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld, a former Justice Department official himself, echoed the
other former prosecutors on his panel when he said he did not
believe adultery or making a false statement about adultery or
fornication constituted a ``high crime or misdemeanor'' as defined
by the framers of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Weld added a novel approach to sanctioning Clinton, combining
censure with a written report of Clinton's wrongdoing and a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Wednesday he would allow committee Democrats to offer
such a censure resolution. But the House leadership has as yet
given no indication of what it will do.
</P>
<P>
   Most committee Republicans reject censure as an indecisive, if
not unconstitutional, way out. ``At this point, I think the
appropriate action is to impeach him or not to impeach him,'' said
Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats said they were pleased by the two days of
testimony, Florida Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler called Wednesday
``the saddest day in my life'' following the release of the
Republicans' draft impeachment articles.

 &HT;    Davis flap: Mac 1, Sampras 0
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Sampras should just say he doesn't want to play
Davis Cup and leave it at that. Instead, he made a couple of
unforced errors last week trying to justify his decision not to
play this year or to commit to the U.S. team for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' most persistent critic has been John McEnroe, whose 9-1
singles record in Davis Cup finals is the U.S. record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for McEnroe to criticize,'' Sampras said, ``because
he was only playing 13, 14 events (per year). I'm playing 22
events, so it's a different ballgame. I think these guys should get
their facts straight before they pop off.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review, it's Sampras who didn't do his homework. In
McEnroe's best six-year run (1979-84), he played 518 singles
matches, 19 more than Sampras has played during his current streak
of six consecutive years at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's six-year singles record (456-62, .880) is superior to
Sampras' (415-84, .832). McEnroe was ranked No. 1 in four of those
years and captured seven Grand Slam singles titles while playing
for three winning U.S. Davis Cup teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has won 10 Grand Slam singles titles the past six years
but has played for just one U.S. team that won a Davis Cup (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Also worth noting is that McEnroe added to his workload by
winning seven Grand Slam doubles titles from 1979 to '84. Sampras
has only two pro doubles titles of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not knocking Pete, but just sit back for a minute and have
a look at the two records,'' said International Tennis Federation
president Brian Tobin, who used former Aussie great Roy Emerson in
the comparison. ``Pete has 11 Grand Slams and two Davis Cups (and
didn't play in the final of one of those). Emerson has (a record)
12 Grand Slams and eight Davis Cup final wins on his record. So how
would you compare the two?''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also argued that it's not feasible to be No. 1 today and
play Davis Cup full time. ``If I play Davis Cup,'' he said, ``my
ranking goes to No. 4 or 5 in the world. You can't have
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   By that logic, though, Jonas Bjorkman could've been the tour's
best player last year. He finished No. 4 despite playing singles
and doubles in three rounds of Davis Cup for winning Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis Cup debate stirred again when last week's final, won
by Sweden over Italy in Milan, became the first played without a
player ranked in the world's top 30. The U.S. was without a top-25
player in its embarrassing 4-1 loss to Italy in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Tobin said the ITF, which runs Davis Cup, is
considering changes to ensure better Davis Cup participation. His
ideas include reducing early-round ties to a best-of-three-sets
format, giving the previous year's finalists a first-round bye and
awarding ATP Tour points to players for their victories.

 &HT;    Advantage to Vikings in home-field battle
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons have already clinched a playoff berth and
assured themselves of their first home game in the postseason since
the 1980 season. But the odds are long against them wrestlng
overall home-field advantage from the Minnesota Vikings, and a loss
Sunday would be doubly costly _ both in the race for home-field
advantage and for the NFC West title.
</P>
<P>
   If Minnesota (12-1) and Atlanta (11-2) end up with the same
record, the Vikings currently have a huge advantage in the
tiebreaker that would most likely come into play.
</P>
<P>
   The first tiebreaker is head-to-head competition, which doesn't
apply. The second is won-loss percentage within the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, who have games remaining at Baltimore, home against
Jacksonville and at Tennessee, finished their NFC games with a
record of 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is 9-1 in the NFC, with a game Sunday at NFC West rival
New Orleans and Dec. 20 at Detroit (where the Lions have beaten
Atlanta five straight times).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta must win those games to finish 11-1 in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons do that, and also finish with the same overall
record as Minnesota, the third tiebreaker is won-lost percentage in
common games.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was 6-0 against St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago and New
Orleans. If the Falcons beat New Orleans and Detroit, they would
would be 6-0 as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth tiebreaker is net points _ or the difference in
points scored vs. points allowed _ in NFC games.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, who are on a pace to break the NFL's single-season
scoring record, outscored their 12 NFC opponents by 179 points.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has outscored 10 NFC opponents by 101 points.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Falcons would have to win their next two games by
a combined 79 points to win this tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta loses Sunday, and the Vikings win, Minnesota will
lock up overall home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the NFC West title, the Falcons and 49ers (10-3)
split their two games this season, eliminating the first
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   The next tiebreaker is record within the division, where both
teams are 6-1. The Falcons' final division game is Sunday. The
49ers' last division game is against St. Louis the final weekend of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The third tiebreaker is record in the NFC, where Atlanta is 9-1
and the 49ers are 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   A Falcons loss at New Orleans would give San Francisco a
tiebreaker edge, provided the 49ers beat the Rams, which they have
done 16 straight times.
</P>
<P>
   But if Atlanta wins Sunday, and San Francisco loses to Detroit,
the Falcons will lock up the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also could lock up the division by winning their
next two games.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lester Archambeau did not practice Wednesday, as
the Falcons did not work out in pads, but he's scheduled to
practice today for the first time since breaking his left thumb in
Sunday's 28-21 win over the Colts. Archambeau, who had surgery
Sunday night to insert pins in the thumb, will wear a cast and test
it today. If Archambeau can't play, John Burrough will replace him.
... Wide receiver Tim Dwight suffered either a cramp or a strained
hamstring in the middle of practice. The Falcons' punt and kickoff
returner did not practice again, and his status for today is
unknown. ... Reserve cornerback Randy Fuller, who missed the Colts
game with a strained/bruised shoulder, returned to practice and is
expected to play Sunday. ... For the Saints, middle linebacker
Kevin Mitchell (knee) is out, replaced by rookie Chris Bordano, the
team's sixth-round draft choice from Southern Methodist. ...
Reserve linebacker Vinson Smith (knee) is questionable. ... Reserve
linebacker Ink Aleaga (hamstring), tight end Scott Slutzker (knee),
defensive tackle Wayne Martin (knee) and reserve tight end Tony
Johnson (groin) are all probable.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson update
</P>
<P>
   James Sims, the agent for running back Jamal Anderson, continues
to talk with Atlanta general manager Harold Richardson about a
contract extension, using the contracts of Terrell Davis, Barry
Sanders, Emmitt Smith, Robert Smith, Dorsey Levens and Curtis
Martin as a framework.
</P>
<P>
   Those contracts average 6.3 years and $5.3 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons reach a deal before the end of this season, they
could lessen the impact on future salary caps by spreading the
pro-rated portion of a signing bonus over this year and future
years. ``If it's feasible, yeah (the deal could get done soon), but
we're not going to rush this thing,'' Sims said. ``This is going to
be a significant deal, and significant deals don't get done in a
hurry. We're going to see how far Jamal can push this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   Falcons ticket manager Jack Ragsdale said about 5,500 of the
team's 6,900 or so season ticket ``accounts'' have reserved playoff
tickets. Those 6,900 accounts add up to 29,715 season tickets, but
Ragsdale said it's too early to say how many playoff tickets have
been reserved. Current season ticket holders are allowed to reserve
twice the number of tickets they have.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the team has taken down payments on about 1,500 new
season ticket packages for next year, with fans making those down
payments guaranteed playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining playoff tickets are tentatively scheduled to go on
sale to the general public Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining ground
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have won nine of their last 10 games in the NFC
West. If they beat the Saints, it will give them a 7-1 mark in the
division. The team has gone through the division with one loss just
twice before, going 5-1 in 1980 (division champions) and '91 (wild
card).

 Changing Default Font In Word 97  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Is there some way to change the default setting for Word
97 from Times New Roman 10 to Times New Roman 12? I am getting
tired of reformatting my letters after they are done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  I don't know why Microsoft uses 10-point type as the
default in Word. It's too small on the screen, and it's too small
when you print it out. Anyway, there's an easy remedy to the
situation. Go into the Format menu in Word and choose Font. Select
the font you want (in this case, Times New Roman 12), and click on
the Default button at the bottom of the window. From that point on,
all new documents will default to your chosen font.
</P>
<P>
   Copying to Another Drive
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to copy all the files from my old hard drive on
a Windows 95 computer to my new computer, which has Windows 98. I
am trying to avoid having to reinstall all my applications on the
new computer. Is there a smart way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: It can be done, but not easily. You'll need a program such
as DriveCopy from PowerQuest ($30), which can copy the contents of
one hard drive to another. And you'll have to remove the hard drive
from the new computer and connect it to the old one, which entails
opening up both cases and messing with cables and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I don't think it's possible to copy applications without
also copying the operating system, which means you'd be
transferring Windows 95 to your new hard drive. You could then use
the Windows 98 disc that came with your new computer to upgrade the
hard drive to Windows 98. But that seems like an awful lot of work
just to transfer your applications and documents.
</P>
<P>
   The more practical approach is simply to reinstall your
applications on the new computer and copy your document files from
the old computer to the new one using a floppy disk or a Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   Refurbished Computers
</P>
<P>
   Q: I occasionally see ads for refurbished/reconditioned
computers from major vendors. These often are near top-of-the-line
models, selling for a significant discount. Often, warranties are
provided. Are these PCs likely to be good deals, or are there
pitfalls a consumer should know about?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Assuming that you can get the specifications you want _
chip speed, memory, hard drive capacity, etc. _ a used or
refurbished computer can be a great deal. The components most
susceptible to failure are the hard drive and the CD-ROM drive, and
the monitor also could be a problem, especially if it's a few years
old. But if you get a warranty on those parts, there's little risk.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to consider is expandability. If you think you
might want to add a new video or sound card, make sure the computer
has enough PCI expansion slots.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of software. A good vendor will include
Windows 98 and a bundle of programs such as Microsoft Works, so you
won't have to fork over big bucks for a new set of applications.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Question
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there some way that I can print out the address book in
the Netscape e-mail program? A copy would be handy to have while
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: You're in luck. The latest upgrade of Netscape
Communicator, version 4.5, lets you do just that. With your address
book open, choose Select All from the Edit menu. Then choose Export
from the file menu. You can save the list in the Netscape format or
in formats that can be printed from a word processor or
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AOL UPDATE: &LR;  A couple of weeks ago, I outlined a way to control
cookies using AOL 4.0. There's a catch, however _ you also must
have Internet Explorer 5.0 on your PC. AOL has a built-in version
of IE, which doesn't let you block cookies. But if you also have IE
5.0 installed, the AOL program will utilize some of the options of
the latest Microsoft browser _ including cookie control. You can
download the Beta of IE 5 for free from  &LR; www.microsoft.com/ie. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get around AOL's cookie conundrum is to use any
version of IE or Netscape Navigator instead of AOL's browser. After
connecting to AOL, simply start your other browser (after adjusting
its settings for cookie control).
</P>
<P>

 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;

 &LR; Here's a cool way to get on the Web fast from the Windows 98
desktop. Right-click on any blank area of your taskbar (that's the
bar that runs along the bottom of the screen). Point to Toolbars
and choose Address. An address space will be displayed on the
taskbar every time Windows is running. Type an Internet address
into the space, hit Enter, and the Internet Explorer browser will
open automatically.

 &HT;    36-point buck may be a record

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A young Telfair County farmer might have taken a new
state record buck on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>

   The 36-point buck taken by Billy Joe Padgett, 23, of
Jacksonville, Ga., could score as much as 240 points on the Boone &AMP;
Crockett scoring system for game animals under the nontypical
heading. The deer was approximately 5 years old and had a gross
weight of 170 pounds, not bad for a normal eight-pointer, but it
seemed small under the massive rack.
</P>
<P>
   State Wildlife Resources Division biologist Bill Cooper checked
out the deer, and said, ``I'd say it's going to score at least in
the 230s. It will probably be a state record in nontypical.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the rack has to age for 60 days, so the official
measurements won't be taken until the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of those weird, bizarre racks. It's a genuine
pretty-regular-looking rack except it's so massive. You don't see a
rack like that down here in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The deer was killed on the 9,000-acre Whiteoak Plantation
Hunting Club, co-founded by Bob Heath and Kim Adamson of Atlanta.
It is adjacent to the Horse Creek Wildlife Management Area and only
a mile from Lake Montgomery, where the world-record largemouth bass
was caught 66 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Heath said Padgett and his father, Ernest, both had taken shots
at the big buck earlier in the season and were actively hunting it.
</P>
<P>
   The club is managed for trophy deer, 15-inch spread or better,
and has a membership cap of 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're filled up and have a waiting list,'' said Heath.
</P>
<P>
   Former armory owner dies
</P>
<P>
   Bob Watt, former owner of Stone Mountain Armory and one of
Georgia's finest muzzleloading firearms makers and shooters, died
Monday in Columbia, Miss., of a massive heart attack. He was 62.
Watt was in the process of moving to Mississippi at the time. ``He
was something to shoot with,'' said Jack Crockford, retired
director of the Wildlife Resources Division, who also makes
muzzleloaders. ``He was so relaxed you'd think he was going to
sleep (when shooting).''

 BofA Loses Diversity Champion   By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The woman who ran the nationally recognized diversity program at
the old BankAmerica resigned after the bank's new owner, North
Carolina's NationsBank, removed her from her job.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Crane, executive vice president and director of
corporate diversity, left the bank at the end of November, two
months after NationsBank took over the San Francisco bank and
adopted its name. She was replaced by Lorraine Stimmel, previously
in charge of operations in the human resources department of the
old BofA.
</P>
<P>
   News of Crane's departure came after The Chronicle reported that
the 10 highest-ranking female executives of the old BofA were
demoted or left the bank when their jobs were given to NationsBank
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said the resignations reflected individual decisions
plus opportunities to collect big severance packages, not a pattern
of bias at the bank. The executives who stayed still have important
jobs, it noted.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former BofA employees said they didn't know why
NationsBank removed Crane from the diversity post. They said they
didn't know whether she was offered another job.
</P>
<P>
   The employees noted that Crane was an impassioned and outspoken
advocate for opening the bank to people from all backgrounds and
that her style might not have fit the more-controlled NationsBank
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was feisty. She spoke her mind, and she was direct,'' said
one former BofA executive.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Crane from BofA ``is a major loss,'' said
Michael Reed, a San Francisco diversity consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of her colleagues and subordinates feel she was critical
to BofA's assertive diversity program,'' Reed noted. ``She
championed many causes that were cutting-edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted by telephone, Crane declined comment on her
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Melba Spencer, a BofA spokeswoman, said the bank doesn't comment
on the departure of specific executives. She stressed that the new
BofA remains committed to advancing employees regardless of gender,
race or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is a core part of the culture'' of the new BofA,
Spencer said. ``We are looking forward to Lorraine Stimmel's
leadership in driving our company's commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Former California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, now the bank's
co-head of services for wealthy customers in California, said in an
interview that the new bank is keeping the old BofA's
equal-opportunity tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with the new BofA is that the values of the old
BofA are very much there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Crane joined BofA in 1979 and held a succession of increasingly
senior marketing jobs. Beginning in 1995, she took over the program
designed to make the bank a more hospitable place for women,
minorities, gays and lesbians to work.
</P>
<P>
   Her diversity training program was the largest
internal-education initiative ever carried out by the bank. Under
the program, more than 20,000 managers attended two-day sessions
aimed at sensitizing them to workplace discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's program was cited in August by Fortune Magazine, which
ranked the old BofA as the third-best place to work for blacks,
Latinos and Asian Americans among the nation's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   One BofA manager who went through Crane's two-day workshops
described it as ``pretty intense,'' particularly the role-playing
sessions in which participants acted out workplace interactions
among people of different races, genders and sexual orientations.
</P>
<P>
   Crane pushed BofA's domestic partners program, which grants
medical and other benefits to partners of bank employees, including
same-sex couples. The program has been adopted by the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies generally are seen at innovative companies in
emerging industries, such as technology, Reed said. ``You don't
tend to see these things at conservative financial institutions,''
he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Senator Barbara Boxer wrote BankAmerica Chairman and
chief executive Hugh McColl on Monday urging him to reach
agreements with activist groups setting targets for community
lending and investment in California.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Boxer said she was troubled by the resignation of
David Coulter, chief executive of the old BofA, and by recent
resignations of senior female executives.
</P>
<P>
   McColl has promised to meet with California political leaders
next month when he visits the state.

 Celebrating a Mouse That Revolutionized the World  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
It's December 1968. Lyndon Johnson is president, the Grateful Dead
is performing at Winterland and computers are giant
number-crunching machines that use punch cards. During a conference
in San Francisco, an unassuming computer scientist named Doug
Engelbart demonstrates an invention called the mouse _ and changes
the face of computing.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse and other innovations Engelbart showed off, such as
word processing and hyperlinking as a way of moving from document
to document, wound up transforming computers and making them
accessble to the average person.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, on the 30th anniversary of Engelbart's demo, dozens
of computer-industry luminaries gathered at Stanford University to
celebrate the 73-year-old inventor and to ponder what the next 30
years might bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This demonstration set a brushfire burning that spread across
the computing landscape,'' said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology
forecaster and director of the Institute for the Future in Palo
Alto. ``It was a mind-opening demonstration of possibilities that
had not occurred to the computing establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   What the researchers saw in 1968 was a new vision of computing.
Instead of big machines accessible only to technicians and used
only for business automation, Engelbart and his team at Stanford
Research Institute wanted to create a network of computers for
people to use to solve the world's problems.
</P>
<P>
   During the 90-minute demonstration using a custom-built
workstation _ there was no Fry's in those days _ they showed off
the graphical user interface, integrated text and graphics and
two-way video conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Their work and the demo inspired many of those who went on to
build the systems we use today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mind set that computers were for adding and
subtracting. The idea that computers would be developed to interact
with humans was unthinkable. It was a radical shift in what we
thought computers were for,'' said Charles Irby, who went to work
with Engelbart in the early 1970s on the networked computer system
called Augment.
</P>
<P>
   Engelbart's group lost its funding in the 1970s, which prompted
many of its researchers to migrate to Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC) and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Irby later co-designed the Xerox Star, the first commercially
available personal computer. Like an earlier model, the Xerox Alto,
the Star incorporated Engelbart's innovations of a mouse for
navigation and a graphical user interface.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kay was a graduate student at the University of Utah in
1968 when, despite a fever, he flew to San Francisco to see
Engelbart's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, he was Moses opening the Red Sea,'' said Kay. ``It
reset the idea of what it was to do personal computing. It wasn't
just a place where you went to do a few important transactions. It
was a place where you could spend all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay went on to co-found Xerox PARC, where some of the computer
industry's most important innovations were born _ among them, the
first personal computer, desktop publishing, laser printing and
Ethernet. Kay is now a Disney Fellow and vice president of research
and development at the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen wasn't even born in 1968. But he credited
Engelbart and others with laying the groundwork for the explosion
of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like waves on a beach, where each wave goes
further onto the beach,'' said Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape
Communications in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As an undergraduate at the University of Illinois, Andreessen
helped create Mosaic, the friendly point-and-click method for
navigating the Web that led to the development of Netscape's
Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   When he first put out Mosaic in March 1993, Andreessen said,
``the building blocks were there. The PC was becoming widely
available and the network was built. The Web was able to unlock the
power that was in the network.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the speakers yesterday worried about the future of
computing _ about whether the Internet would be taken over by
commercial interests and how the increasing presence of computers
in our lives would affect personal privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the PC did was move the power to the individual. With
pervasive networking, you can move the power back. So you have
companies that can read all your e-mail. Unless we deal with that
as a social problem, it will be built into the technology,'' said
Stuart Card, a Xerox Research Fellow and manager of the User
Interface Research Group at Xerox PARC.
</P>
<P>
   As for Engelbart, he feels his job is only half-done. Although
many of the technological ideas he advanced have been widely
adopted, his idea of people using the network to improve the world
hasn't come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the world has really bought it (the idea.) For
me, it's been a totally serious goal _ the idea of collective IQ,''
he said.

 WASHINGTON: press secretary. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Release of the panel's draft articles capped an extraordinary
two days of testimony by the president's top lawyers and legal
scholars and experts who argued that Clinton's misleading
statements and misconduct in the Lewinsky affair do not rise to the
level of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Few opinions were swayed as sharp exchanges marked the hearings,
and committee Republicans challenged Clinton's representatives over
and over to acknowledge that the President had committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., was among those who pushed the
president's defenders for more information. ``Your presentation has
helped point us to the portions of that record before us that you
believe are relevant to your client's defense,'' Canady said. ``But
let me say that I am still frustrated by what I consider to be
legal arguments that don't really meet the test of common sense and
human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In a counterattack, committee Democrats issued a censure
alternative that would condemn the president for ``making false
statements concerning his reprehensible conduct'' and wrongly
taking steps to ``delay the discovery of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic censure proposal _ drafted by Reps. Rick Boucher
of Virginia, Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts and Tom Barrett of
Wisconsin _ also states that Clinton ``remains subject to criminal
and civil penalties for this conduct.'' Clinton would be obligated
to sign the censure. The proposed wording does not include
imposition of a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the committee chairman, said he would allow a
committee vote on the measure, but then added that he would vote
against it. Even the measure's sponsors conceded that censure has
no chance of passing the Republican-controlled panel. But Democrats
voiced hope it would win enough support from moderate Republicans
to force Republican leaders to allow a floor vote on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum for censure received a boost from a prominent
Republican, former Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, who
announced his own version of an alternative at the committee
hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's plan, which White House officials said they did not know
of in advance, mirrors the Democratic alternative, but would also
include a fine to penalize Clinton for his misconduct. Democrats
say they would be open to the president's negotiating a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of the House would be upheld if something like
that were to be approached,'' said Weld, who testified in defense
of the president on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant shift, the White House moved from a crouch to
aggressive support of a censure option. ``The president's general
position is that he's done something blameworthy,'' Lockhart said.
``If members of Congress want to come to him with an idea short of
impeachment, it's something he would consider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the majority of the House wants a vehicle to vote on some
other option than impeachment, then they should be given that,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to comment on the details of any censure
motion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who support a censure option still face an uphill battle.
Rep. Robert Livingston, the speaker-designate, has not ruled out a
censure vote on the floor, but the Republican whip, Rep. Tom DeLay,
is actively blocking any attempt to let lawmakers vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 31 Democrats who in October voted for the
Republican impeachment inquiry resolution _ Tim J. Roemer of
Indiana, Ellen Tauscher of California and Jim Moran of Virginia _
collected signatures from the group for a letter to Livingston,
urging a floor vote on a censure motion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic
leader, started calling the 31 Democrats to see how they would vote
on impeachment. Between three and five Democrats might vote for
impeachment, Democratic aides say, meaning that 14 to 16
Republicans would have to oppose impeachment to kill it on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, the Democratic whip, was calling to make sure
all Democrats _ even those who are retiring or who lost re-election
bids _ are planning to return for next week's momentous vote on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The draft documents were released as the White House counsel,
Charles Ruff, was finishing an eloquently meticulous defense of why
Clinton should not be removed from office for his admitted
misconduct in the Monica S. Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said the timing of the release of
the articles of impeachment was clear evidence of the partisan
nature of the judiciary proceedings and of closed-mindedness on the
part of the Republican majority. Committee Democrats quickly issued
a 13-page point-by-point rebuttal of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hearing room after the proceedings, Hyde told
reporters that he planned to vote for all four articles of
impeachment, and he predicted that at least one of the perjury
counts would be approved by the full committee.
</P>
<P>
   The first article in the drafts charges Clinton with perjury
before the grand jury on Aug. 17, and outlines four accusations.
Among them, Clinton is charged with ``false and misleading
testimony'' about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and his
efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses in the Jones sexual
misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   The second article on perjury charges Clinton with signing an
affidavit in the Jones case on Dec. 23, 1997, pledging to tell the
truth and then lying about whether he had a sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. The article also accuses the president of giving
false statements under oath in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The third article of impeachment accuses Clinton of obstructing
justice in an effort to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal the
existence of evidence'' in the Jones case. The article lists seven
acts that the Republican committee staff believes bolster the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on Dec. 17, the article charges, Clinton
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky, who is not named in the draft, to lie in a
sworn statement and to give false testimony. The article also
accuses the president of helping create a plan to hide evidence _
the gifts that he gave Ms. Lewinsky _ and of successfully pressing
to get Ms. Lewinsky a new job in New York to buy her silence in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article of impeachment charges that the president
``misused and abused his office,'' laying out four instances. Among
them, the article charges, is that Clinton lied to the American
people, gave false and misleading statements to White House aides
and his Cabinet officers, and ``frivolously asserted'' executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The committee reorganized the 11 main charges contained in the
report by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. In addition, the
committee added at least three supporting instances.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice article, the committee charged
that Clinton did not correct his lawyer, Robert Bennett, during the
Jones deposition, when Bennett asserted that Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit proved that ``no sex of any kind'' had occurred and
should foreclose any questioning of Clinton on that matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the article alleging abuse of power, the committee added the
accusation that the president lied to the American public and that
the president committed perjury by lying in his answers to 81
questions submitted by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These four articles of impeachment reflect the evidence we
have had before us and the testimony we have had before us,'' said
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have tentatively set aside Dec. 16
through Dec. 19 for debate and votes, Republican aides said.

 Apple Preps Laptop Version of iMac  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Apple Computer is readying a low-cost laptop version of its popular
iMac in an all-out bid for consumer sales, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The new portable _ &UR;  &LR; reportedly called WebMate _ is translucent
plastic, like its desktop forebear, and comes with a lightning-fast
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   One insider described several prototypes of the lightweight
portable, including a ``spiffy'' curved model with 300 MHz
processor, built-in modem, Ethernet connections and universal
serial bus for connecting to printers, scanners and other devices.
Although a price has not been set, it is expected to be competitive
with the inexpensive $1,500 laptops &UR;  &LR; on the market, one source
said.
</P>
<P>
   The WebMate is due in the first half of 1999 but could be sneak
previewed at next month's Macworld Expo computer trade show at
Moscone Center, sources said. (During a speech to educators
yesterday in Seattle, interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs said a new
consumer portable will be shown later in the year, not at
Macworld.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an aggressive attempt by Apple to drive a stake in the
ground for the consumer market,'' said Matthew Rothenberg, content
director at MacWEEK.com in San Francisco, which has been tracking
Apple's new products. ``The iMac has kicked ass in the desktop
consumer market, and Apple intends to do the same with its new
laptop.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Apple sold 278,000 of its curvy aquamarine iMac machines in
the six weeks following its August debut, and industry observers
estimate that as many as 800,000 units will ship this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some are calling WebMate, code-named P1, the technologic
successor to the defunct eMate, a four-pound, $600 clamshell-shaped
computer that was well received by students and educators but
discontinued as part of Apple's cost-cutting measures. Unlike the
eMate, which used Apple's Newton operating system, WebMate is
expected to run the Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The new notebook would round out Apple's personal computer line.
The PowerMac and PowerBook anchor the company's business offerings,
while the iMac is a desktop PC for consumers. All three models have
sold well, triggering a financial turnaround that has vaulted Apple
from fiscal despair to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Apple is tinkering with a ``palmtop'' computer
project that would resurrect elements of the ill-fated Newton
MessagePad, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   That project, called MacMate, would come with either the Mac OS
or much-rumored Mac OS Lite _ a graphical-user interface designed
for palmtop devices _ and provide wireless connections to the
WebMate, iMac, PowerBook and other Macs. It reportedly would
include software for connecting to both Mac and Windows machines.
</P>
<P>
   MacMate, which probably will not debut until late 1999,
allegedly was spotted at a meeting of the Hong Kong Newton Users
Group earlier this year. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, an Apple board
member, has publicly hinted about an upcoming $500 handheld Mac.
MacMate is the likeliest candidate to fulfill that description,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has maintained the semblance of a handheld project despite
shutting down its Newton division in February. At the time, the
company said it was ``committed'' to a Mac-based portable,
beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also could conceivably strike a deal to develop a hybrid
of 3Com Corp.'s popular PalmPilot device, or sign a co-marketing
agreement with 3Com, sources said. In a recent interview in
Fortune, Jobs said Apple attempted to acquire 3Com's Palm Computing
division.
</P>
<P>
   The new consumer Macintosh models are expected to help stoke a
remarkable comeback at Apple by further boosting its lot in the
home market. Until recently, it had squandered market share with
consumers because, as Jobs has repeatedly said, the company didn't
build sufficiently compelling products.
</P>
<P>
   The number of consumers who bought Macs plunged to 4.3 percent
last year from 11.2 percent in 1995, according to ZD Market
Intelligence. That total, however, is on the upswing with iMac
sales, said analyst Matt Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company _ which hemorrhaged $1.8 billion in 1995,
1996 and part of last year _ has now registered four-straight
money-making quarters and is expected to finish in the black for
its first quarter, ending December 25.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has relied on a streamlined product strategy and
aggressive cost cutting to reverse its flagging fortunes. The iMac
has been a runaway hit, topping the best-seller list at computer
superstores, according to ZD Market Intelligence in La Jolla (San
Diego County).
</P>
<P>
   An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the rumored

FBI BREAKS UP ALLEGED MONEY-LAUNDERING SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The FBI arrested Wednesday an employee of BankBoston's
West Newton branch and two bank customers for participating in a
scheme involving a group of Russian emigres who sought to launder
$2.7 million in alleged drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Oksana Galchanskaya, 24, of Needham, was among nine people from
New York and the Boston area arrested and charged in the 43-count
indictment issued by a federal grand jury in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, federal undercover agents, posing
as narcotics dealers, provided $2.7 million in cash to three
members of the group and with the assistance of Galchanskaya. In
return, the undercover agents received wire transfers, cashiers
checks and other checks drawn on accounts set up at BankBoston's
West Newton branch and at Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal officials, most if not all of the nine are
Russian emigres living in Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year employee of the bank, Galchanskaya worked as a
customer service representative.
</P>
<P>
   The two other defendants also charged in the case, Roman Luban
of Newton and Samuil Lyubomirsky of Brighton, opened and maintained
accounts at BankBoston that were used in the money laundering
operation, the indictment stated.
</P>
<P>
   A BankBoston spokesman said Wednesday night that the bank had
been cooperating with the FBI investigation for nearly a year and
would now begin an internal investigation into how the bank's West
Newton branch could have been used in the scheme for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of BankBoston is our most important asset,''
said spokesman Bruce Spitzer. ``All of us feel disappointed, hurt
and outraged when any action appears to tarnish that integrity or
violates the public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, federal undercover agents met some
of the defendants numerous times in Manhattan and in Dedham,
Allston and Taunton over the past two years. During the meetings,
the agents would exchange large amounts of cash and receive the
wire transfers, cashiers checks and checks drawn on accounts at
BankBoston and other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics traffickers and other criminal enterprises that deal
with large amounts of cash customarily seek to have their currency
turned into checks and other financial tender that can then be
transferred through the worldwide banking system and used in
legitimate businesses. In recent years, federal and local law
enforcement officials say they have detected an increased
involvement in money laundering by criminal groups comprised of
Russian emigres.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 20 years, Congress has enacted several bills to
improve law enforcement's ability to strike at money laundering,
including legislation requiring that banks and other institutions
report all cash deposits of more than $10,000 to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants received more than
$200,000 in commissions from the federal agents for laundering the
cash proceeds. The defendants' goal was to ``function as a
financial institution'' by accepting large amounts of cash from the
undercover agents and exchanging it for ``wire transfers and
checks,'' without filing the required cash transaction reports.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment stated that Galchanskaya accepted at least one of
the deposits, for $25,000, at BankBoston's West Newton branch in
January 1998 without making out a currency transaction report on
the deposit, as required by federal law. On that same date,
Galchanskaya issued several checks drawn on an account set up at
the bank. Those checks later were given to the undercover agents.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all money laundering and conspiracy charges,
each defendant faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of
$500,000.

ANALYSIS: IMPEACHMENT DRIVING A SMALL WEDGE INTO GOP

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Rep. Henry Hyde proclaimed in September that
the impeachment of a president could not succeed unless it was
bipartisan, Republicans hoped the scandal over President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky would fracture the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   But now as the impeachment inquiry into the president moves
steadily toward a climactic House vote next week, the issue instead
is driving a wedge into the Republican Party. Fearing defections,
Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Wednesday asked
Republicans to ``withhold judgment'' until his committee finishes
its work.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican split is not huge. Most of the 228 Republicans in
the 105th Congress are expected to support impeachment, while only
a few dozen have come out against impeachment or are considered
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But the division is significant because these Republicans hold
the key not only to Clinton's fate but to their party's survival as
a congressional majority. Some of them fear that an impeachment
vote could imperil them, leaving them with local enemies among
Democrats and independents if they vote yes and among Republicans
if they vote no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will prevent the Republican Party from holding marginal
districts and picking up new districts,'' said Rep. Peter King, a
New York Republican who has become one of his party's most vocal
opponents of impeachment. ``It will relegate us to minority party
status.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to encourage more Republicans like King, the White House
on Wednesday featured as one of its defenders the former Republican
governor of Massachusetts, William Weld, who was head of the
criminal division of the Justice Department under Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Weld took center stage in Washington was when
Clinton tried to reach across party lines in 1997 and name him
ambassador to Mexico. Weld saw his nomination torpedoed by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., whom Weld accused of ``ideological extortion''
and of blocking him because he was fighting for an inclusive
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Weld, though measured in tone, broke just as
dramatically with the majority of House Republicans by proposing a
tough censure option in lieu of impeachment. It would require a
written congressional report on the president's behavior; a written
acknowledgment of wrongdoing by the president, a fine paid by
Clinton, and no attempt to forestall Clinton's possible prosecution
on perjury after he leaves office, Weld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to forget this stuff,'' Weld warned of
impeachment, reminding Republicans that voters had chosen Clinton
even after learning of Gennifer Flowers' accusations that the two
had had an extramarital affair. ``This is a man who's been elected
president of the United States twice and thus entitled to this
office.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also signs of a roiling struggle inside the sizeable
Republican delegation from New York.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing that he favored a ``strong statement of
rebuke,'' Rep. Amo Houghton, an upstate Republican, said he planned
to reach out to an array of party elders, including Howard Baker,
Bob Michel, Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, for help to propel censure
forward in place of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And while aides to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato denied that the New York
Republican was doing any lobbying a day after he said impeachment
would be a ``grave mistake,'' another Republican close to D'Amato
had recently been making the same point to some fellow New Yorkers
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who defeated D'Amato
in November, said Wednesday he hoped D'Amato's remarks would push
other Republicans to support censure. ``I think that Sen. D'Amato
came out and said what he thought all along,'' said Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde himself became so concerned that he sent a letter to fellow
House Republicans asking them to hold off declaring themselves
until his committee completed work on articles of impeachment. He
said in the letter that he was available for phone calls. He told
reporters he wanted to contact fellow Republicans and ``urge them
to keep their powder dry.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Republican aide outside the committee said, ``New
York is not bleeding'' and that he expected a number of the
uncommitted Republicans from New York to come out for impeachment,
perhaps in the next several days. So far, Houghton, King and Rep.
Jack Quinn have come out against impeachment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The impeachment struggle has become just the latest test of
whether Congress' largely southern Republican leadership and its
fervent conservatives can co-exist easily with its northeastern
moderates. Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who opposes
impeachment, said he did not expect to be ostracized for his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of respect going on among members,'' he said.
``We mostly intuitively know this is not an easy thing. There's
almost a sense of camaraderie among Republicans because we do not
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who has been one of Clinton's most
ferocious critics, sounded only half joking when he said Wednesday
afternoon, ``It's the civil war all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the northeasterners, he said, ``If their constituents are
telling them it's okay for the president to perjure himself and we
want you to stand for that, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans, like Barr, come from solidly Republican
districts. But the impeachment vote is particularly agonizing for
those Republicans, many from the northeast, who represent swing
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents of impeachment argue that those Republicans will
not suffer from a vote to impeach the president because the Senate
will never convict the president, thus nullifying the vote. But
Democrats, who picked up five House seats in the last elections,
have been poring over lists of Republicans who come from districts
that voted for Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to help round up votes for Clinton by sending
Democratic House members out to argue privately to these
Republicans that they will be opposing the will of their
constituents and their vote could haunt them in two years.
</P>
<P>
   King, who wants a censure alternative to come to a vote in the
House, warned that his party will slip back into the minority if
its leadership does not accommodate the needs of Republicans from
swing or Democratic-leaning districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the party leadership is still showing itself as the
gang that can't shoot straight,'' he said. ``If anyone genuinely
supports impeachment, than they have the absolute moral right and
obligation to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anyone who thinks this is going to help Republicans
politically is absolutely crazy. This is going to divide the
Republican Party. It's going to re-energize the Democratic party.
And it's going to drive away independents,'' King said.

 NLRB Sides With Nurses At Adventist Hospital  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A federal labor official said yesterday that nurses have the right
to organize at an Adventist-run hospital in Ukiah that had argued
that its religious character should make it exempt from U.S. labor
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Miller, regional director of the National Labor Relations
Board, ruled that Ukiah Valley Medical Center must follow the same
labor laws as other nonreligious hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, the employer provides health care
services similar to those provided by any other acute-care
hospital,'' Miller wrote in a 31-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``To grant an exemption to the employer and to other
church-operated health care institutions would potentially impact a
significant segment of the workforce in the health care industry
and ... interfere with the fulfillment of the government's
compelling interest in promoting national labor peace,'' Miller
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ukiah Valley, a 101-bed hospital owned by the Seventh-day
Adventist church, had sought exemption from federal labor laws
after 75 percent of its nurses signed cards last summer asking for
a union election.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials told the NLRB in hearings that Adventist
teachings have long prohibited church members from joining unions.
They said forcing Ukiah Valley executives to bargain with a union
would impede their ability to seek policy guidance directly from
God.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukiah Valley dispute has been watched closely by labor
organizers and management at other religious hospitals, including
Catholic hospitals facing union drives in Sacramento and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have said it could set a national precedent on
the issue of whether religious hospitals should be required to
follow labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Ukiah Valley executives said they are likely to
appeal the NLRB ruling to the full board in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with the ruling and are sure that at some point we
will be appealing it, but we don't know what the time frame would
be,'' said CEO ValGene Devitt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nurses union hailed the ruling as a major victory
for workers everywhere, not just at religious hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a chilling moment in history if the
employer's objections were upheld,'' said Rose Ann DeMoro,
executive director of the California Nurses Association. ``I could
see Catholic Healthcare West claiming an exemption next, followed
by every other religious order. In fact, I could even see Bill
Gates starting to talk about his relationship with God if it would
help him deny employees their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   With about $38 million in revenues, Ukiah Valley is one of 14
hospitals in California and 159 hospitals worldwide operated by the
10-million member Seventh-day Adventist church.
</P>
<P>
   The only full-service hospital in Ukiah, it was formed when
Ukiah Adventist Hospital took over Ukiah General Hospital in 1988.
Of its 170 registered nurses, fewer than 20 are Adventists.
</P>
<P>
   Ukiah Valley's nurses launched their union organizing drive for
several reasons. Because of budget troubles, the hospital had to
cancel some planned pay raises and bonuses. And _ like nurses at
many other hospitals _ the Ukiah nurses felt that patient care has
declined because of cost-cutting measures related to the spread of
managed care.

CLINTON TO FOCUS ON GENOCIDE AND CHILD LABOR ON RIGHTS DAY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will announce Thursday the
creation of an early-warning center to focus U.S. intelligence
resources on uncovering potential genocide and a large increase in
funding for programs to stop child labor around the world, senior
administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also sign an executive order to press the
bureaucracy to carry out U.S. obligations under human rights
treaties that currently lack implementing legislation; announce new
immigration guidelines to allow children to more easily claim
political asylum; and promise modest new aid to help
nongovernmental organizations respond faster to humanitarian
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives are part of the U.S. effort to commemorate Human
Rights Day. Thursday is the 50th anniversary of the adoption by the
United Nations General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, and Clinton will also announce a new annual award for
Americans who have furthered the cause of human rights at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The early warning center for genocide will be based at the State
Department, in the intelligence and research division, and will
include CIA officers, the officials said. At the same time, the
National Intelligence Council is trying to develop indicators for
genocide to avoid new horrors like those between the Hutu and Tutsi
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous critics of administration policy have said that the
early inaction of U.S. and Western officials in the mass killings
in Rwanda and Bosnia stemmed less from ignorance than from an
unwillingness to commit troops and resources to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The awards are named after Eleanor Roosevelt, one of first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton's heroes, who was instrumental in the
passing of the Universal Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The policy initiatives will also provide $30 million a year, up
from $3 million, to the program of the International Labor
Organization to abolish child labor, and provide up to $8 million
over several years to help private human rights organizations send
assessment teams and monitors and hire local organizations to
respond to human rights emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The president will also announce a new group, to be chaired from
the White House, to promote U.S. compliance with human rights
treaties despite widely differing laws _ on treatment of children,
for example _ in different states.

 Cadence to Buy Quickturn, Foiling Mentor Takeover  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cadence Design Systems Inc. yesterday agreed to a $253 million deal
to buy Quickturn Design Systems Inc., which has spent the past four
months fending off a rare high-tech hostile takeover bid by rival
Mentor Graphics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence's friendly offer tops Mentor's unsolicited bid of $216
million made in August. Cadence and Quickturn, both of San Jose,
plan to close the deal in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Graphics, which had hoped to get Quickturn stockholders
to approve its offer at a special Jan. 8, 1999, meeting, did not
indicate whether the firm would increase its bid. In a brief
statement, the Wilsonville, Ore., company said it was ``reviewing''
its options and had no further comment on the Cadence offer.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence, the largest seller of advanced-design software for
chips and electronic products, plans to turn Quickturn into a
wholly owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Quickturn makes systems and software used by chip designers to
test their creations, an area of chip development that Cadence
wanted to offer, especially with chip designs becoming more
complicated, said Cadence CEO Jack Harding.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technological perspective, they have a lot of things
that we need,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Harding said he started investigating the idea of a merger with
Quickturn because of Mentor's hostile takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor's offer of $12.16 per share of Quickturn stock ``made us
ask, `What are we missing?''' Harding said. ``We did some analysis
on our own. Once we realized what was going on, we realized, `Hey,
we needed this company.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cadance agreed to swap one share of its stock valued at $14 per
share for each share of Quickturn stock. Mentor had offered
Quickturn shareholders $12.13 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Cadence fell 81 cents to $29.19, while Quickturn's
shares rose $1.63 to $13.81. Shares in Mentor fell $1.25 to $8.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``A merger with Cadence is a superior outcome for our
shareholders, our employees and our customers and allows Quickturn
to continue to pursue its business strategy,'' Quickturn CEO Keith
Lobo said in a statement. ``We believe our shareholders will
recognize the value of this combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Mentor Graphics won a key court ruling that
appeared to clear the way for its hostile takeover attempt of
Quickturn. A Delaware Court of Chancery judge ruled that Quickturn
directors breached their responsibilities to stockholders by
amending the company's ``poison pill'' provisions to defeat
Mentor's takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence announced last month that it was laying off about 560
workers, or 12 percent of its workforce, and taking a
fourth-quarter charge of $36 million to trim costs and focus on
more profitable parts of its consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Harding said there was little overlap between Quickturn and
Cadence employees and that he expects the merger to cause few
layoffs.

SPORTS COLUMN: FRANCHISE PLAYERS WHO DON'T LEAD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where have all the point guards gone? That is what comes to mind
every time Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning lumber out of another
failed bargaining session with the truculent owners, and fumble the
issues, like so many bounce passes into the post.
</P>
<P>
   They admit that most players by societal standards make a lot of
money, but we ought to consider their life styles, and help out
when they go panhandling in Atlantic City next week. Sure, we
should. Hey, buddy: can you spare a grand?
</P>
<P>
   I can already hear the Ewing fans mumbling: there I go again,
getting on poor, philanthropic Patrick. Tough. Noble a warrior as
Ewing may be, a man who doesn't know better than to pull the cell
phone from his ear as he makes a very public exit from a funeral
chapel (saw this with my own disbelieving eyes a couple of weeks
ago, after Red Holzman was eulogized in Queens) should not be
influencing the livelihood of others.
</P>
<P>
   This has much more to do with being selfless than it has to do
with being smart. Find me two honest Knicks who would call Ewing an
angel of the cooperative spirit, on the court or off. Charles
Oakley laughed when I raised this point during a conversation last
week. ``That's why we're in this situation,'' he said. ``You have
all these so-called franchise players who aren't leaders, who don't
make anyone better.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as we are all numb to the $2 billion boondoggle that is the
pro basketball lockout, the players appear desperate for a point
guard's improvisational genius. I seem to recall reading that John
Stockton spoke up at a player gathering several weeks ago,
suggesting a more conciliatory negotiating stance, and was shouted
down. Where have all the other point guards gone?
</P>
<P>
   The one-dimensional thinkers in control of the union
outrageously claim they would rather lose the season than take what
the owners want to give them. As Pat Riley would say, meet force
with force. As Mourning would respond, punch back when hit. Forget
the time of the game, the consequences of the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew the owners were gearing up for this fight,''
Isiah Thomas recently told Sam Smith of The Chicago Tribune. ``They
were prepared. This is not the time to fight, to stand up and say,
`I'm the biggest, I'm the baddest.' This is the time to live
another day, have the fight three years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the owners in three years will have their
sights set on another rich television deal, as opposed to pocketing
millions from their latest haul. Their chests will not be so
puffed. Has it occurred to the union to bargain for the kind of
contract reopener the owners demanded three years ago? Even without
one, who says the players can't strike, if whatever deal they agree
to has the punitive effect the union leaders insist it will? Who
says at some future point that they can't decertify, which is what
Ewing's group used as a platform to gain control in the first
place? Could they not dispatch an independent operator like David
Falk to canvas the networks, explore a rival league, while they
settle and play on?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, fund-raisers are dreamed up in gambling sites, one
public relations nightmare after another. If these are Ewing's
ideas, someone please grab hold of his cell phone and dial 911.
This is not meant to belittle the players' sentiment, their
reluctance to let the owners tighten the reins. But these are not
coal miners being sent to inhale fumes. These aren't factory
workers being laid off, or having their benefits stripped. The
entertainment industry is about here and now. How can they let so
many players surrender a year off a short career, and risk
financial ruin?
</P>
<P>
   A wise point guard, when trapped, makes the high-percentage
pass. ``The thing we always prided ourselves on,'' said Thomas, a
former union president, ``is not missing paychecks.''
</P>
<P>
   History says the most important leaders in the National
Basketball Association have been those who could make the right
play, in midair, or mid-act. Bob Cousy founded the union in his
friend's basement in Worcester, Mass. Oscar Robertson led a
threatened boycott of the 1963 All-Star Game for improved benefits
and lent his name to the lawsuit that helped produce free agency.
Thomas in the late 1980s fought off the agents to redirect salary
cap money for a better pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the owners unexpectedly cave, Ewing may yet emerge from this
a union hero. Or he may wake up one morning to a player disaster,
no season at all. The clock is ticking. The pressure is building.
This is no time for a clumsy center to initiate the last play. But
then, where have all the point guards gone?

SPORTS COLUMN: ELWAY AND MARINO OFFER SUNDAY TREATS TO FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like two old gunfighters who had an insignificant skirmish when
they were young, Dan Marino and John Elway are circling each other
for only their second shootout, but on Sunday they must first stalk
the Jets and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after having been chosen far apart in the first
round of the 1983 stock show, Marino and Elway are the only
quarterbacks in National Football League history to have thrown for
more than 50,000 yards. That adds up to more than 28 miles on
each's odometer.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami on Dec. 21, because of the quirks of the NFL schedule
formula, they will duel for only the second time. In 1985 at
Denver, the Dolphins won, 30-26, as Marino hit 25 of 43 passes for
390 yards and 3 touchdowns. Elway was 18 of 37 for 250, with no
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Their second confrontation couldn't come at a better time _ with
the Dolphins trying to protect their 1972 Dolphin ancestors' 17-0
record as the NFL's only undefeated and untied team _ unless the
Broncos are upset by the Giants at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's link to the Giants is Ernie Accorsi, now the Giants'
general manager. Accorsi, as the Baltimore Colts' general manager
in 1983, selected Elway with the No. 1 choice. But when Elway
threatened not to report, the Colts' owner, Bob Irsay, soon traded
Elway to the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to trade John,'' Accorsi recalled. ``John was
talking about playing baseball instead, but some people in baseball
told me he really wasn't a major league prospect, so I was willing
to let it play out.''
</P>
<P>
   Irsay swapped the negotiation rights to Elway to the Broncos for
quarterback Mark Herrmann, the rights to offensive tackle Chris
Hinton and a 1984 first-round choice that turned out to be guard
Ron Solt. The next year, Irsay took the Colts for another ride, to
Indianapolis in moving vans.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami on Sunday night, with first place in the American
Conference East at stake, Marino will be a reminder of how his
now-familiar foe, the Jets, ignored him in the draft. So did 25
other teams. Mike Hickey, now a stock broker but then the Jets'
director of player personnel, remembered why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the draft,'' Hickey recalled, ``the thing we were
worried about more than anything was that Don Shula would trade
half his draft to the Colts in order for the Dolphins to get Elway
with the first choice.'' Because Elway was going to be the obvious
first choice no matter who was picking.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Dolphins, with David Woodley at quarterback,
had just lost Super Bowl XVII to the Redskins, 27-17, after having
stung the Jets, 14-0, in the American Football Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   When it was the Jets' turn with the 26th choice, four
quarterbacks had already been selected: Elway by the Colts, Todd
Blackledge by the Chiefs, Jim Kelly by the Bills (he jumped to the
United States Football League for three seasons) and Tony Eason by
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was available, but the Jets preferred Ken O'Brien, out of
Cal-Davis. With the 27th pick, the Dolphins took Marino, from Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our mind,'' Hickey said, ``Marino had a few things against
him. Early that year against a huge North Carolina rush, he had
thrown the ball up for grabs. He had a knee problem. He had
football sense but not book sense. Without book sense, we wondered
how long it would take him to adjust to the Jets' complicated
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dolphins took Marino, the Redskins, with the last
choice in the first round, took Darrell Green, the Texas A&AMP;M
cornerback headed to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six or seven months later,'' Hickey said, ``I called Bobby
Beathard, then the Redskins' general manager, and asked him if he
would've taken Marino if the Dolphins hadn't. He told me, `No, we
wanted Darrell Green all along.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien developed into a decent quarterback for the Jets, while
Marino emerged as an instant Pro Bowl starter who had no trouble
adjusting to Shula's offense. He now holds virtually all the NFL
passing records, including 48 touchdown passes in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jets ignored Marino, and Elway was traded to the Broncos
by the Colts over Accorsi's objections. But now, 15 years later
against the Jets and the Giants on Sunday, both quarterbacks will
be throwing passes as only they can. &QL;

NO OFFER WAS MADE BY SAUDI FOR TROUBLED U.S. HEDGE FUND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prince Walid bin Talal, the Saudi billionaire businessman known
for strategic investments in troubled companies, considered buying
the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management two months ago but
never made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   The prince was approached by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. to determine
if his Kingdom Holding Co. had interest in buying the hedge fund in
Greenwich, Conn. The approach was made soon after Goldman and 13
other Wall Street banks and brokerage houses injected $3.6 billion
to save the fund from bankruptcy, people close to Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks did not result in an offer by the prince, those people
said. They did not rule out the possibility that the prince might
still make a proposal, but they said that they thought no such
offer was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Shoucair, assistant executive manager for international
investments at Kingdom Holding in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, told
Bloomberg News on Wednesday that talks to buy Long-Term Capital had
ended. ``It never got any serious consideration,'' he said. ``It
never got beyond a half-hour phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has tried before to broker a deal for a wealthy investor
to buy the fund. In the hours before the consortium made final its
agreement to rescue and assume majority ownership of Long-Term
Capital in September, Goldman teamed up with investor Warren E.
Buffett, offering to buy the fund at a steep discount to the market
value of its assets. Long-Term Capital's partners rejected that
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, after the consortium had taken control,
Goldman and Buffett made another pass at the hedge fund. In
discussions with the hedge fund's new board of directors, Buffett
asked for an up-front commitment that financing would remain in
place if he were to buy it and that the parties would agree in
advance to sell at a discount. He never made a formal offer or
named the price he would be willing to pay, people close to the
discussion said, and the talks have ended.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to sell Long-Term Capital has eased in recent weeks,
in part because the market value of its portfolio has risen
sharply. After losing almost all the original investors' capital by
early September, and then tumbling after the rescue, the portfolio
rose more than 20 percent, or $700 million, in November. That
leaves the Wall Street banks that financed its rescue with healthy
paper profits, though bankers are still cautious about predicting a
full recovery.

JUDGE POSTPONES EXECUTION OF CANADIAN MAN IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge Wednesday ordered Texas to postpone
the scheduled execution on Thursday of a Canadian man convicted in
the 1975 murder of a wealthy East Texas woman and instead called
for a hearing to determine whether the man's right to a fair
clemency process had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales of Texas immediately appealed the
decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my hope and expectation that the execution will
proceed as scheduled,'' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   If the appeals court overturns the judge's order, the execution
could proceed as scheduled at 6 p.m. on Thursday in the Texas death
house at Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the Canadian, Joseph Stanley Faulder, had drawn
international attention in recent days, largely because of
accusations by Faulder's lawyers that their client had never been
properly informed at the time of his 1977 arrest of his right to
contact the Canadian Consulate.
</P>
<P>
   But the stay of Faulder's execution, issued Wednesday afternoon
by Judge Sam Sparks of federal district court, was not based on
that issue, but on another raised in a separate appeal in the Texas
courts. That appeal grew out of a Texas civil court judge's ruling
last week in a class-action suit brought by a group of lawyers on
behalf of all Death Row inmates. The appeal contended that the
18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles had habitually failed
to hold its meetings in public, sometimes voted over the telephone
or by fax and failed to state the reasons for its decisions or to
record its votes.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's lawyers had requested a stay of execution, saying that
there were deficiencies in the Texas clemency procedures and that
there was, in fact, ``no meaningful opportunity for pardon or
commutation of his death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks ruled that Texas did provide meaningful opportunity for
pardons, but decided that further fact-finding was needed to
determine whether there were deficiencies in the clemency process.
He scheduled a hearing on the matter for Dec. 21 in Austin,
although he noted, ``It is unclear how the board can document that
its procedures are not arbitrary if it does not document its
procedures at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for another convicted murderer, Danny Lee Barber, 43,
also won a temporary reprieve from Sparks for their client on the
same grounds Wednesday, just an hour before he was to die by lethal
injection in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether Faulder had been properly informed of his
consular notification rights is part of an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, which has yet to announce whether it intended to
hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the United
States and all other signatories are required to inform foreign
citizens upon their arrest that they have the right to contact
their consulate. Texas officials said they had never informed
Faulder of that right because they did not know he was a Canadian
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The government in Canada, where public opinion is strongly
opposed to the death penalty and where Faulder's case has received
great attention, has appealed to the United States government to
intercede with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in seeking at least a
temporary reprieve for the condemned man.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union added its voice Wednesday when Helmet Tuerk,
Austria's Ambassador to the United States, issued a statement on
behalf of the union asking Bush to halt the execution.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge's announcement of a stay in Faulder's
execution capped a busy day of developments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the state's pardon board announced that it had voted
unanimously to recommend against any clemency in the case. Under
Texas law, Bush is allowed to grant only one 30-day reprieve in any
death penalty case without a recommendation for clemency from the
parole board, and he has no power to reduce a death sentence
without the board's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Bush said that he intended to let the
appeals work their way through the courts before making a final
decision on a 30-day reprieve, but he indicated little interest in
granting one for Faulder. For one thing, the governor said, Faulder
had never claimed to be innocent, so the only issue was whether he
had received due process, and that was up to the courts to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to enforce the laws of the State of Texas,'' Bush
said. ``We're a death penalty state. We believe in swift and sure
punishment.''

BAY STATE HAS `HOUSING AFFORDABILITY' PROBLEM, STUDY SHOWS  
 HOUSING AFFORDABILITY ON DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the midst of an economic and real estate boom, many
low- and moderate-income residents are struggling to find and keep
a place to live, according to a study being touted as the first
comprehensive examination in more than a decade on the state of
housing in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the University of Massachusetts' Donahue
Institute, concludes that one out of every four households in
Massachusetts _ renters and homeowners alike _ are contending with
a ``severe housing affordability problem,'' with a number facing
homelessness, eviction or foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first statewide study on housing that has been
done in more than decade,'' said Aaron Gornstein, executive
director of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association,which
sponsored the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report's focus is on people like Theresa Shenett, who
wonders whether she will soon be spending the holidays in a
homeless shelter. Shenett is now waiting for a judge to decide
whether her landlord may evict her from a one-bedroom Jamaica Plain
apartment she shares with her son and a relative. ``It's taken away
all the spirit of Christmas,'' Shenett said during a recent
interview, tears on her tired face.
</P>
<P>
   A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and
policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with
steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are mostly working people, they have jobs, but the jobs
aren't paying enough for them to pay for the cost of housing,''
said Michael Stone, a professor at UMass Boston, and one of the
authors of the study. ``Prosperity on the one hand tends to mask
the plight of many, many people, not just poor people but
middle-income people who aren't sharing in the prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding affordable housing has also been made more difficult by
the fact that a number of apartment owners have sold their
properties as condos, taking advantage of the strong real estate
market.
</P>
<P>
   Facing higher rents, increasing numbers of lower- and
middle-income residents have found themselves unable to pay their
rents. According to the study, evictions increased by 64 percent
from 1993 to 1997, and the state also has experienced a 100 percent
increase in the number of homeless families since 1990. The authors
contend that about 10,000 families in Massachusetts live in
shelters or on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highest level of homelessness that we've had ever,''
said Philip Mangano, executive director of the Massachusetts
Housing and Shelter Alliance. ``The demand for homeless programs in
general is greater than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who've managed to hold on to their homes are having a
tough time making ends meet, the study found, characterizing about
36 percent of all renters in the state as ``shelter poor,'' meaning
they can't really afford the amount they pay for housing, based on
their total income and expenses. The study also found that while
minority home buying has helped to push the state's homeownership
rate to about 62.3 percent, minority mortgage applicants still face
rampant discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, denial rates for black and Latino applicants were 53
percent and 38 percent, while the denial rate for whites was just
26 percent. Moreover, upper-income black and Latino applicants were
denied mortgages at twice the rate of whites in the same income
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Today's predicament in housing differs significantly from that
of the 1980s, when the state's housing market experienced a similar
upturn, housing advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a number of afforable housing units compared to the
1980s...and we've seen significant cutbacks in goverment funding
for housing programs during that time,'' Gornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of about 22 percent of the state's rental housing
stock receive some form of state or federal subsidy. About 16
percent of those units are operated by state or local housing
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   With many developers eyeing a newly attractive rental market,
especially in Boston and the close-in suburbs, local officials are
doing what they can to try and maintain what remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough market and the traditional ways to finance
housing don't exist anymore,'' said Pat Canavan, housing policy
advisor to Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
</P>
<P>
   Those most vulnerable in today's tight rental market include
single mothers, the elderly, immigrants, and the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Brighton, Manuel Velasquez, his wife and three children
scrape to stay in a cramped two-bedroom apartment they share with
an army of cockroaches and the occasional mouse. Velasquez, who
works as a janitor and parking lot attendant, wonders where in the
world they will go if they have to leave their $550 a month home.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Elsa Ruano, a 51-year old widow, waits as she has
since 1992 for her name to rise to the top of a waiting list for
public housing. She rents out three bedrooms in her three-bedroom
apartment to scrape together $650-a-month. Recently, the landlord
tried to hike Ruano's rent to $1,400, a move thwarted for now
through the efforts of a local community activist.
</P>
<P>
   The study's authors say it underscores the need for the state to
devise more creative ways of coping with a problem they predict
will only get worse. Among the initiatives CHAPA's Gornstein would
like to see adopted: a measure that would fast-track the process
that allows cities and towns to seize abandoned homes for use as
affordable housing; and a $4 million a year state tax credit that
would give investors tax incentives for backing the development of
low-income projects.
</P>
<P>
   However, within the Cellucci administration, the report received
a rather frosty reception. ``We weren't overly surprised by the
information,'' said Eric Gedstad, spokesman for the Department of
Housing and Community Development. Gedstad said the state spends
$300 million a year on affordable housing.

OREGON'S GAY WORKERS GIVEN BENEFITS FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.J., Vt., Pa.)  (bl) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first ruling of its kind, an appeals court in Oregon
ruled Wednesday that the state constitution gave homosexual
government employees the right to health and life insurance
benefits for their domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, to my knowledge, the first time a court has said it's
unconstitutional not to give benefits to the domestic partners of
gay and lesbian employees,'' said Matt Coles, director of the
Lesbian and Gay Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties
Union. ``And there is no state in the country that provides
domestic partner benefits to all government employees.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oregon does already provide benefits to the domestic
partners of its employees: while the case was on appeal, the state
voluntarily began offering such benefits to its direct employees.
The employer of the three lesbian plaintiffs in the case, Oregon
Health Sciences University, has also voluntarily begun offering
such benefits, although it is no longer part of the state, but a
separate public corporation.
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling Wednesday involved only that university, Coles
said, the decision would apply to every employee of a governmental
entity in Oregon, expanding the benefits to thousands of teachers,
police officers and others who work for local government.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rocklin, the assistant attorney general who argued the
case, said he was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know yet if we'll appeal, and it's hard to say exactly
what the impact of the ruling would be,'' Rocklin said. ``The court
dismissed the state defendants because OHSU is no longer a state
entity. It's not completely clear to me whether it would apply to
all government employees in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the state Court of
Appeals, upheld a 1996 trial ruling in the case, finding that the
denial of benefits to the three plaintiffs, all nursing
professionals in long-term relationships who had applied for
medical and dental insurance for their partners in 1991, violated a
section of the state constitution similar to the Equal Protection
clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a provision that is echoed in other states, the Oregon
constitution provides that ``no law shall be passed granting to any
citizen or class of citizens privileges or immunities, which, upon
the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The three lesbian couples said they were members of a class of
citizens, homosexual couples, that was being denied the privilege
of insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The university argued that it was not discriminating against the
class of homosexuals, since it denied insurance benefits to the
unmarried partners of all employees, heterosexual and homosexual
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``That reasoning misses the point, however,'' the court said.
``Homosexual couples may not marry. Accordingly, the benefits are
not made available on equal terms. They are made available on terms
that, for gay and lesbian couples, are a legal impossibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many private companies and local governments
have voluntarily decided to offer benefits to domestic partners.
And New York and Vermont, like Oregon, provide benefits to domestic
partners of their own workers, but not to those who work for local
or county governments.
</P>
<P>
   While the Oregon case is apparently the first in which courts
have ordered such benefits, as a constitutional matter, several
courts, in New Jersey and elsewhere, have rejected the kind of
argument that prevailed in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a new area of law, and there's a similar case
pending in Pittsburgh,'' Coles said. ``But when I look at this
decision, I think what a difference a decade makes.''

DEAL WOULD CREATE CANADA'S 2ND-LARGEST NEWSPAPER GROUP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ After fighting off a hostile takeover bid from a
crosstown competitor, Sun Media Corp., one of Canada's largest
newspaper companies, agreed Wednesday to accept a rival deal with a
Montreal publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger between Sun Media of Toronto and Quebecor
Inc., which publishes newspapers in French and English, is worth
about $680 million (U.S.). The deal would create the second-largest
newspaper group in Canada, controlling more than a quarter of the
nation's daily newspaper circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This match puts together our newspaper strength in different
cities,'' Paul Godfrey, president of Sun Media, said in a
conference call with reporters Wednesday. ``It makes us into a
truly national newspaper chain.''
</P>
<P>
   The new group formed by Sun Media and Quebecor would have a
combined circulation of 7.8 million copies a week and would include
daily newspapers in 10 of Canada's top 11 markets. Vancouver is the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian newspapers have been going through a shake-up and
consolidation recently. Combined daily circulation hit a peak of
5.8 million copies a day in 1989 and had been declining ever since,
though there have been gains in the last few months, according to
the Canadian Newspaper Association,
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Sun Media agreed to sell The Financial Post
in Toronto to the publisher Conrad Black. In the complex deal, Sun
Media received four daily newspapers in southern Ontario from
Black's Hollinger International Inc. and its subsidiary, Southam
Inc., for about $100 million (U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   In late October, Black began The National Post, incorporating
The Financial Post into the paper's business section. The day after
Black's newspaper hit the stands, Torstar Corp., which publishes
The Toronto Star, Canada's largest daily newspaper, announced an
unsolicited takeover bid for Sun Media.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun Media resisted the Torstar bid in part because it was
considered too low and also because the two organizations have
incompatible editorial positions and newsroom cultures. Sun Media
publishes tabloid-sized newspapers filled with sports,
entertainment and conservative editorials. The Toronto Star is a
broadsheet whose editorial position is left of center.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Media conducted preliminary talks with Quebecor before
Torstar's bid, and the pace increased substantially in subsequent
days. An unsuccessful bid by Quebecor to take over Sun Media in
1996 had raised some concerns because the chairman of Quebecor,
Pierre Peladeau, who has since died, supported Quebec independence.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey said Wednesday that ``talk of any animosity between our
companies just is not so.'' He said that Sun Media maintained a
``friendly rivalry'' with Quebecor but that the proposed merger was
a good fit because the two chains do not compete directly in any
market.

 &HT;    MacArthur members to pick Florida development firm
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Today in Chicago a Nobel-Prize winning
physicist, two former presidential advisers and an epidemiologist
who helped rid the world of smallpox will cast aside the vexing
questions of global population growth, environmental degradation
and nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   For a few moments, large swaths of South Florida land will be
the center of attention for the board of the John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member board, normally focused on giving away money to
cure world ills, will turn to making money and, in so doing, shape
the future of northern Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The board will pick between two bidders: WCI Communities, a
Bonita Springs homebuilder partly owned by the foundation; and the
St. Joe Co., the Jacksonville development company that owns 1.1
million acres, most in Florida's Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   WCI offered the highest bid, between $200 million and $240
million, sources close to the bidding said, but asked MacArthur to
provide some financing. St. Joe offered a cash deal for about 20
percent less.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will control the pace of development on 14,808 acres
in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties. The land is all that
remains in South Florida from the holdings of the foundation's
namesake, the late insurance magnate John D. MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   The board will base its decision on a recommendation from its
staff, a consultant and the board's investment committee, made up
of seven board members and two outsiders. The foundation refuses to
identify the investment committee's members or to comment on the
bids.
</P>
<P>
   Board members refuse to comment, as well. They follow a policy
of leaving the talking to staff, assuring the board speaks to the
grants community with one voice. Their decision may not be
announced for several days, said MacArthur attorney Josh Mintz, who
is overseeing the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Board members oversee a 20-year-old foundation with $4.3 billion
in assets, the eighth-largest in the nation, The Chronicle of
Philanthropy reported in January.
</P>
<P>
   Board meetings are a ``phenomenal'' experience, bringing
together top thinkers in their fields to grapple with health
concerns in Nigeria or discrimination in America, Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being at a university. Every board meeting they're
talking about serious intractable problems. It's absolutely
facsinating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is best known for its so-called genius grants to
``exceptionally creative individuals,'' but those represent a small
proportion _ $6.5 million _ of its $150 million a year in
gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   The board will judge the Florida land sale with the same
approach it brings to judging grants, Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   They form a jury of remarkable peers.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Murray Gell-Mann, holds the 1969 Nobel Prize for
physics. He is a co-discoverer of the subatomic particle known as
the quark.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Dr. William Foege, led the successful campaign to
eradicate smallpox in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Two members served at the highest levels of the federal
government: Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's former
national economic adviser, and Shirley Mount Hufstedler, President
Reagan's first secretary of education. A third, Drew Saunders Days
III, spent three years as President Clinton's solicitor general.
</P>
<P>
   Three others, steel company executive George Ranney Jr., builder
Alan Hallene and banker Thomas Theobald, ran large corporations.
Elizabeth McCormack counsels the Rockefeller family.
</P>
<P>
   Only one member, Tyson, was born after World War II (1947). Ten
are men, six are women, two are black.
</P>
<P>
   They are paid from $27,000 to $40,500 a year, depending on
expenses and committee assignments. President Adele Simmons, who
has run the foundation since 1989, received $468,729 in salary and
benefits in 1996, the most recent year available.
</P>
<P>
   Original member Paul Harvey, the ABC radio commentator known for
his staccato delivery and ``The Rest of the Story,'' voluntarily
accepts less, $2,300.
</P>
<P>
   The original board had six members, chosen by MacArthur, who
died in 1978. He picked his wife, Catherine; his son, Roderick;
three business associates; and Harvey, his longtime friend from
Chicago. Only Harvey, now 80, still serves.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman John Corbally arrived in 1979, with the
foundation in its infancy. A university president, he ran the
foundation until 1989, surviving Roderick MacArthur's accusations
of overspending and board misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of board members picks new members. They are limited
to three four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   What are they looking for? ``Good thinkers and broad-minded
people,'' Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   How is the board perceived?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is considered a very prestigious and impressive board,''
said Dorothy Ridings, president and chief executive of the Council
on Foundations in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not people who are doing this to get their name on
some expanded resume. These are people who really care.''

THE BIG CAREER OVERSHADOWING THE RIGHT CAREER  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opera singers keep showing up in the wrong places. Sometimes
they are good singers: Cecilia Bartoli, appearing as Susanna in the
Metropolitan Opera's ``Marriage of Figaro''; Renee Fleming, very
nearly appearing in the Met's ``Traviata,'' and Patricia Racette,
who did appear there. Sometimes they are not good enough: Marcelo
Alvarez, for example, opposite Ms. Racette, as Alfredo.
</P>
<P>
   Who or what put these people where they ended up, and why,
begins as a mystery. Ms. Bartoli is a splendid mezzo-soprano and a
gifted clown, but turned loose on Mozart, her physical comedy paved
over the ambiguities that make Susanna so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming, of the pure and melting soprano voice, withdrew
from Franco Zeffirelli's latest exercise in directorial grandiosity
scarcely three weeks before opening night. It was, I think, a
prudent move for several reasons. Ms. Racette has all the goods to
handle Verdi's demanding first act but no contact with her
character at all.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, a tenor from Argentina, presents a different case, but
his offers a clue or two about the others. Vigorously promoted and
copiously interviewed before his appearances here, Alvarez embodied
hopes: not only his own and the public's but also those of his
managers. As the Pavarotti-Domingo era slides away, the salable new
tenor star has yet to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps still smarting from the unfortunate hoopla surrounding
Roberto Alagna a few years ago, managements wisely refrained from
calling Alvarez the Fourth or even the Fifth Tenor. Alagna is a
better singer than he appeared to be at the Met three seasons ago,
but the stigma of those beginnings has never really gone away.
</P>
<P>
   The music business, shrunken and downsized, knows that it cannot
flourish on small enterprises. Discover the big career; making
money in classical music depends on it. Success comes in the form
of packages: the tying together of recitals, operas and
popular-music crossovers with the media of recording and
television. Audiences buy tickets to events featuring people they
see on television. Records feed public appearances, and the process
works the other way around as well.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a wide-reaching presence at the center of these
packages to make them work, and the search is on. One wishes that
it were conducted in a more perspicacious way. Alvarez is somewhat
less than a diamond in the rough; he is a singer with unused good
qualities and some misused ones as well. Letting him lurch clumsily
through a major opera production in New York was an act of wishful
thinking, and a distinct unkindness to the singer himself.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez needs time in smaller, quieter opera houses and a coach
to teach him that musical eloquence is not outbursts of emotion
piled one atop another.
</P>
<P>
   His promoters and managers must have heard him in the flesh
beforehand, or is it that they did, and simply didn't listen
correctly? The disturbing trend everywhere in the business is the
presence of decision makers who are not musicians: eager salesman,
to be sure, but too often armed with the wrong information about
their products.
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining the big career means bigger repertory. Ms. Bartoli
has stuck largely to Rossini and the like, and only teased us with
the prospect of roles beyond. Ms. Fleming's canceled Violetta in
``La Traviata'' was a clear attempt to get her beyond the lovely
lyrical roles she has done with such dazzling beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming's handlers can howl angrily when it is suggested
that her withdrawal was for reasons other than personal, but I
think that deep down they know that Violetta is inappropriate for
her gifts. This is a career-defining role and good business, but it
demands a certain tough brilliance that Ms. Fleming simply does not
possess. She can be grateful she didn't sing it, especially in a
voice-eating 3,900-seat habitat like the Met.
</P>
<P>
   I worry that the opera business _ the opera singer business, in
particular _ is interested too much in the big career and not
enough in the right career. Trying to inflate something beautiful
of moderate size into blockbuster proportions is a devouring and
ultimately unsuccessful endeavor. I wish that a Bartoli or a
Fleming, instead of worrying about expanding her repertory, could
be led to settle on what she does best.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of expansion are not new to the music world. Thirty
years ago, midlevel American symphony orchestras felt Ford
Foundation money jingling in their pockets. Although it was
intended for endowment building, much of it was squandered on
delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Hometowns suddenly looked provincial and confining; now was the
time to conquer the world. There would be recordings and tours,
Carnegie Hall and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of such ventures is still to be found in cities
like New Orleans, Denver, Kansas City and San Diego. Orchestras
forgot who they were, what they could do, and what their rightful
constituency was. The financial crashes that resulted have
frightened the classical-music world ever since. Ambition without
prudence and foresight is lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Miscasting in opera is epidemic, and its motives have too little
to do with music and too much to do with jobs and careers. The
singers themselves have the final say, but given the size of the
average backstage ego, modesty and good sense are often too much to
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   If bad judgment can be visited on a decent young man like
Alvarez, it stands to reason that it will affect career decisions
for people far more talented than he. A heartbreaking Rusalka, a
gorgeous Manon, Ms. Fleming escaped from ``La Traviata'' with her
life.

DEBATE OPENS TODAY ON ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee opens a historic
debate on Thursday on articles of impeachment accusing President
Clinton of 17 counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse
of power.
</P>
<P>
   A draft version released on Wednesday asserts that Clinton
``willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial process'' to
cover up his illicit affair with Monica Lewinsky. The resolution
declares that Clinton should be removed from office for ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' against the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans released the draft as Clinton's lawyers
wrapped up a two-day defense presentation that failed to slow the
impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   With the Judiciary Committee on a fast track to approve
impeachment articles by the end of the week, Clinton's defenders
stepped up efforts to reach a compromise that would result in a
censure of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be our last opportunity to avoid going over the
precipice and triggering a genuine constitutional crisis,'' Rep.
William Delahunt, D-Mass., said in releasing a draft resolution
condemning Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff told lawmakers that the
president is ``open to any reasonable suggestion'' that would avoid
an impeachment showdown. He also assured Republicans that Clinton
would not accept a pardon to avoid possible criminal prosecution
after his term ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for an end to this process,'' the White House
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments to the House panel, Ruff acknowledged that
Clinton deliberately misled investigators and the American public.
He also agreed that reasonable people could conclude that the
president lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conduct, although morally reprehensible, does not warrant
impeachment, does not warrant overturning the mandate of the
American electorate,'' Ruff said. ``The president did not obstruct
justice. He did not tamper with witnesses. He did not abuse the
powers of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense failed to sway Clinton's critics, who remained
convinced that the president committed a series of crimes to hide
his extramarital relationship. The panel of 21 Republicans and 16
Democrats is expected to formally recommend the president's
impeachment in a series of votes tomorrow and possibly Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to take up the issue next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only believe your defense if I check my common sense at
the door and I forget the way the world really works,'' said Rep.
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other presidents _ Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon _
have been subjected to articles of impeachment. Nixon resigned to
avoid a House vote in 1974. Johnson was impeached by the House, but
the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to
remove him from office in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution against Clinton alleges 17 offenses in four
articles of impeachment:
</P>
<P>
   Article 1 accuses him of lying to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Article 2 accuses him of lying in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit in a deposition and in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Article 3 accuses him of obstructing justice by lying to White
House aides, plotting to hide gifts that he had given to Lewinsky
and encouraging the former White House intern to lie about their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Article 4 accuses him of abusing his power by asserting
executive privilege against independent counsel Kenneth Starr and
by lying to the American public, to executive branch officials and
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency,
has betrayed his trust as President and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States,'' the draft resolution states.
</P>
<P>
   The censure alternative would condemn Clinton's behavior without
calling for his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The draft released yesterday concludes that Clinton dishonored
his office and ``violated the trust of the American people'' by
making ``false statements about his reprehensible conduct.'' It
also accuses him of trying to ``delay discovery of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution does not call for a fine or any other penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both parties agreed that the strongest case for
impeachment hinges on the perjury allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case _ I hate to say it _ I think the president
lied,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Berman and other Democrats contend that lying under oath
about a consensual sexual affair does not meet the constitutional
standard for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to impeach a president because we think he gave
false answers about sexual relations and about touching,'' said
Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin debating the
proposed impeachment articles this afternoon after final summations
by the panel's staff. No votes are expected until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, who drafted the censure proposal with other committee
Democrats, acknowledged that the committee is almost sure to reject
the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker-elect Bob Livingston of Louisiana has not said whether
he will permit a censure vote in the full House, but other GOP
leaders, including Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Whip
Tom DeLay of Sugar Land, adamantly oppose the idea.

`PORGY' AND THE RACIAL POLITICS OF MUSIC  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Cori Ellison is a singer and the dramaturge at the New York City
Opera. 
 By CORI ELLISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches, a pop-inflected, genre-bending,
dramatically singular masterpiece of the 20th century is finally
edging into the standard operatic repertory. Is it Poulenc's
``Dialogues of the Carmelites''? Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of
the Mtsensk District''? It could be either, but the opus in
question is Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess,'' which shares with those
mighty works enough visceral dramatic sweep and power, musical
invention and craft, vocally and theatrically meaty characters, and
mythical resonance to match any of Verdi's middle-period operas.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Thursday, the New York Philharmonic offers concert
performances of ``Porgy and Bess'' at Avery Fisher Hall,
culminating a weeklong Gershwin centenary celebration and offering
a fresh chance to reflect on the piece's long journey toward
high-art status. Since the checkered performance history of ``Porgy
and Bess'' runs parallel to the civil rights movement, it may
provide a telling diagnostic on the covert racial politics of the
classical-music world.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby McFerrin, who will conduct at the Philharmonic, would seem
to have just the right credentials to approach this hybrid work. A
wide-ranging jazz vocalist, composer and arranger, noted for his
collaborations with classical artists like the cellist Yo-Yo Ma,
McFerrin has in recent years focused his musical efforts on
symphony conducting.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in ``Porgy and Bess'' is longstanding and, you
might say, in his blood. His father, Robert McFerrin, a baritone,
provided the singing voice for Sidney Poitier's Porgy on the
soundtrack of the 1959 film version of Gershwin's opera, and his
mother sang in the chorus for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music has been in my body for 40 years, probably longer
than any other music,'' McFerrin said recently from his home in
Minnesota, where he has held the creative chair of the St. Paul
Chamber Orchestra since 1994. Over the last two years, he has led a
handpicked ensemble of singers in concert performances of ``Porgy
and Bess'' in Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and St. Paul. ``In
large part, I wanted to do this to honor my father and my musical
childhood,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The elder McFerrin was the first black singer to sign a
Metropolitan Opera contract. He made his debut, as Amonasro in
Verdi's ``Aida,'' in January 1955, just weeks after the
better-publicized debut of the contralto Marian Anderson. But
McFerrin never achieved Anderson's fame in the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   He had previously sung with the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and
the National Negro Opera Company, and had appeared in William Grant
Still's ``Troubled Island'' at New York City Opera and in the
Broadway run of ``Lost in the Stars.'' But the bulk of his career
was devoted to university teaching posts, recital tours and a busy
private voice studio in the Los Angeles area. He now lives in
retirement in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McFerrin's career trajectory recalls that of two other
illustrious Porgys, Todd Duncan and William Warfield. Duncan,
discovered while singing in a black opera company in New York, was
plucked from a teaching position at Howard University to create the
role of Porgy in the work's 1935 premiere, at the Alvin Theater in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, he became the first black artist to sing at New York
City Opera, and he later appeared on Broadway in ``Cabin in the
Sky'' and ``Lost in the Stars.'' Warfield, who starred in a 1953
Broadway revival and tour of ``Porgy,'' which effectively launched
the career of Leontyne Price, also appeared on Broadway in
``Regina'' and ``Showboat.'' But both men remain engraved in
popular memory as Porgy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price's career, of course, took a different turn. Her 1953
Bess was prelude to a string of high-profile opera debuts in San
Francisco and Vienna, and at Covent Garden, La Scala and the Met.
Far from being typecast as Bess, she became an international
operatic superstar. More than that, she was the model for a line of
exotic, glamorous, slightly enigmatic and highly fashionable black
divas, including Grace Bumbry, Shirley Verrett, Kathleen Battle,
Barbara Hendricks, Jessye Norman, Denyce Graves and Marvis Martin,
who will sing Bess with the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   The only black male opera singer to approach such celebrity even
remotely is Simon Estes, who sang Porgy in the belated Met premiere
of Gershwin's opera in 1985. Yet this patrician bass-baritone,
trained at the Juilliard School, had already carved a niche for
himself in Verdi and Wagner in Europe and at the Met long before he
boarded the crippled Porgy's goat cart.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Deas, who will sing Porgy with the Philharmonic, as he has
elsewhere with McFerrin, could conceivably inherit Estes' mantle.
His robust, cocoa bass-baritone voice and musicianly presence have
made him a busy and respected concert artist with a diverse resume
that encompasses Dave Brubeck and Anthony Davis as well as Handel,
Monteverdi, Rameau, Shostakovich, Varese, Verdi and Wagner. Yet his
only standard opera role to date is Leporello in Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni,'' last season at the Eugene Opera, in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile Deas is not without ambivalence at his first major
break. ``My natural inclination is to say: ``Why Porgy? Why do I
have to do my rite of passage on my knees, so to speak?' '' he said
one recent afternoon in Central Park. ``For years, I dreaded the
prospect of being typed into something like Porgy, or being
expected to end a recital with `Old Man River.' There was this
perception that I was a black singer first. Well, when I was at
Juilliard, it never occurred to me that I was majoring in black
singing. There was this entire world of music, and I wanted to
explore every aspect of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deas had a defining experience early in his career, while
touring with a vocal quartet and performing in a small town in
Southeast Missouri. ``I was singing to this white Bess, `You is my
woman,' '' he said, ``and you could see that the audience was
physically uncomfortable, moving and twitching the whole time. I'll
never forget it. I also remember being struck the first time I saw
Simon Estes at the Met, in a romantic role and caressing a white
female onstage. I didn't want to react to that, because it is not
an issue for me personally, but I couldn't help but be struck by
it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess'' has sometimes seemed a mixed blessing to
black artists. It has long served as a foot in a door, but now that
the opera world is more open to blacks, what door might that be?
Solicitous voice teachers often counsel black students to avoid
``Porgy and Bess,'' at least until their operatic careers are
already established.
</P>
<P>
   The opera has also caused controversy among critics and
audiences, particularly among blacks. Although its catchy tunes
have attained folk status, its nature and value have been much
debated. Gershwin's oxymoronic designation of the work as a folk
opera is itself a bone of contention. It has often been assailed as
an outsider's inauthentic re-creation of black music, notably by
Virgil Thomson, who branded it ``an unsavory mixing-up-together of
Africa, Israel and the Gaelic Isles.'' (Thomson later recanted this
position.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue with blacks is, how can a white person write
the black experience?'' McFerrin said. ``Well, they can't. It's as
simple as that. But Gershwin spent a lot of time in Charleston at
churches, homes and nightclubs, listening and getting the rhythms
in his body. He was humble enough to let the music in and be a
conduit for it in the best way he could. So it's not anthropology.
But the bottom line is, he captured something in a special way.
</P>
<P>
   Was `Carmen' written by a Gypsy? Was `Don Giovanni' written by a
Spaniard? No. But do these operas capture something about the human
condition? Do they have gorgeous music? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Perceived racial stereotypes involving violence, drugs, gambling
and naive hedonism have compounded the work's difficulties. ``These
characters are of a certain time and place,'' Deas said. ``And I
think Gershwin loved them and wrote music for them of tremendous
nobility, strength and depth. If I felt there was any
condescension, I wouldn't be singing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin's pedigree as a Tin Pan Alley tunesmith steeped in
ragtime and blues made him an unlikely candidate for opera. Yet in
``Porgy and Bess,'' he draped his jazzy materials over an orthodox
operatic matrix of arias, recitatives and leitmotifs, informed by
years of symphonic composition and study of Stravinsky, Scriabin,
Bach and Chopin. And he was unambiguous about his lofty ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am successful, it will resemble a combination of the
drama and romance of `Carmen' and the beauty of `Meistersinger,' ''
he wrote in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gershwin helped seal the fate of ``Porgy and Bess'' in 1935
by assigning the premiere to the Theater Guild, despite the Met's
interest in the work. Although the run lasted 124 performances
rather than the two offered by the Met, his choice of the
commercial theater meant inevitable compromises. Gershwin's
innovative orchestration was watered down to fit a Broadway pit.
Massive cuts were inflicted to relieve the strain of an
eight-performance workweek.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1941 Broadway revival, the producer Cheryl Crawford further
diluted the score by replacing Gershwin's masterly recitative with
spoken dialogue. All these adulterations contributed to the
perception of ``Porgy'' as a quaint musical sprinkled with hit
tunes, and cheated audiences of its full impact.
</P>
<P>
   The critical tide began to turn after the Houston Grand Opera
presented the first performances of ``Porgy and Bess'' in its
full-length operatic version in 1976, complete with a tour and a
recording. In its restored original form, it began to enter the
repertory of major opera houses, including the Met and
Glyndebourne.
</P>
<P>
   McFerrin, for his part, is trying his best to preserve the
score's jazziness. As he travels with his troupe of singers, he
finds himself in front of largely white orchestras. ``I'm
constantly trying to get the musicians to play around the bar
lines, to stretch and bend,'' he said. ``We need to let this music
show its humidity.''

GEN. HAMILTON HOWZE, ARMY AIR STRATEGIST, DIES AT 89
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas, _ Gen. Hamilton Hawkins Howze, whose vision
of a ``sky cavalry'' transformed the Army's use of helicopters
before the Vietnam War, died Tuesday in Fort Worth. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the Army fights today'' is due to Howze, said Bob
Leder, spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron, where Howze was a
vice president after he retired from the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral for Howze, a West Point graduate and fourth-generation
decorated veteran, will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at Saint Andrew's
Episcopal Church in Fort Worth. Burial will be at the cemetery at
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where Howse was born.
</P>
<P>
   Howze presided over the Army's Tactical Mobility Requirement
Board in the early 1960s.MDBU/.MDNM/. Later known as the Howze
Board, it explored the effectiveness of air mobile operations, said
Jack Moran, executive director for military aircraft at Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Howze the ``father of air mobile operations,'' Moran
said the four-star general ``was instrumental in the Army
organizing the First Cavalry Division, which fought so valiantly in
Vietnam (between) 1965 and 1971.''
</P>
<P>
   Howze was born Dec. 21, 1908, at West Point, N.Y. His father,
Major Gen. Robert L. Howze, was commandant of cadets at the time.
Hamilton Howze, who entered the academy in 1926, graduated in 1930,
according to an academy spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Brig. Gen. Hamilton S. Hawkins, participated in
the charge up San Juan Hill during the Spanish-American War. His
great-grandfather, Hamilton S. Hawkins, was an Army surgeon who
died in the Mexican War.
</P>
<P>
   Howze graduated from an El Paso high school and attended Ohio
State University for one year. He was commissioned a lieutenant in
the cavalry after graduating from West Point.
</P>
<P>
   For his service in World War II, he received two Legions of
Merit awards, one in Italy and one in North Africa. He won a Silver
Star for service in North Africa, among other service awards.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, Howze was commanding general of the 82nd
Airborne Division and later of the 18th Airborne Corps. In 1955, he
was named director of Army Aviation in the Office of the Deputy
Chief of Staff for Military Operations. He was later chief of the
United States Army Advisory Group in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   From 1963-65, he was commanding general of the 8th U.S.
Army/United Nations Command.
</P>
<P>
   Other service included three years in the Department of the Army
in Washington, and an assignment in Europe that included being
deputy chief of staff for operations of the Seventh Army.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. General Robert Williams, 80, of Fort Worth, was
president of the Army Aviation Test Board in 1955 when he Gen.
Howze.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Howze's concept was one in which ``air vehicles,
particularly air helicopters'' replaced ground vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of aviation aircraft performing supplementary
functions, such as transportation or observation or supplementing
the firepower, the air vehicles became the primary means of doing
those things, particularly the helicopter gun ships.''
</P>
<P>
   Howze led the introduction of helicopters ``carrying rockets and
machine guns, delivering fire power,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams described his friend as an ``impressive individual''
who ``acted like a general'' but ``never took anything too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from active duty in 1965, Howze moved to Fort
Worth and was vice president for product planning at Bell
Helicopter until 1971, when he retired but remained a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Howze served on the board of Fort Worth's Museum of Science and
History and was elected president in 1970. He also was on the
city's Traffic Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As a frequent contributor to the ``Star-Telegram'' opinion
pages, Howze wrote about issues such as terrorism in the late 1970s
(he advocated media restraint in reporting about terrorist
activity), the U.S. mission to rescue hostages in Iran in 1980 and
women in the military (he opposed the admission of women to
military academies).
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``A Cavalryman's Story: Memoirs of a Twentieth Century
Army General.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Mary Henry Howze of Fort Worth; two
sons, William G. Howze of Harker Heights and Guy R. Howze of
Austin; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

LAWYER IN CLEAN-WATER SUIT ASSAILS NEW YORK'S TACTICS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Hudson Valley
environmentalist, has accused state officials of improperly
requesting his personal real-estate records in an effort to
embarrass him, saying officials may be trying to discourage his
conservation organization from pushing a lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's group, Riverkeeper, has filed a lawsuit to force New
York City to use tougher restrictions on septic tanks in areas
around the reservoirs that supply the city's water. But now
Kennedy's own septic tank has come under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be an effort to intimidate me,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is seeking records related to Kennedy's five-bedroom
home on a 10-acre lot in Mount Kisco, N.Y., on the shores of
Howlands Lake, which is part of the New York City watershed.
Kennedy says he believes that the officials suspected that his own
septic tank did not meet the standards he demands in his suit, but
Westchester County documents dated 1987 indicate that it does.
</P>
<P>
   A house built on four acres of land that Kennedy sold, however,
appears not to meet the standard, according to the county
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald J. Tramontano, one of the two state Health Department
officials who requested Kennedy's records, said the request was
part of a general study of 6,000 Westchester County septic systems
begun before Kennedy's suit was filed in October. But he
acknowledged that the actual request for the documents concerning
Kennedy's home was made in November, after the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to pull any dirty tricks on anybody,'' said
Tramontano, who, as director of the Health Department's Center for
Environmental Health, said he had been cooperating with Kennedy for
years to fight water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Tramontano said he was tipped off by someone in the Westchester
County Health Department that Kennedy's septic system might not
meet strict standards. Tramontano then asked county health
officials to turn over documents relating to the septic system.
</P>
<P>
   But before turning them over, a County Health Department
employee called the Westchester County attorney, Alan D.
Scheinkman, who advised him not to give them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't appear to serve any legitimate governmental
purpose,'' said Scheinkman, who, after consultation with County
Executive Andrew J. Spano, demanded that state officials make a
formal written request, which they have not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a back-channel request that seemed to be solely to
embarrass Kennedy,'' Scheinkman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The suit that Riverkeeper is filing along with nine other
environmental groups seeks to force the city to stop using less
stringent state guidelines than those the city had planned to use
on the construction of septic systems in the New York City
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state and the city closely cooperate on watershed
issues, Kennedy said he thought the state was trying to help its
partner when it sought his records. Mike Mckeon, press secretary to
Gov. George Pataki, seemed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were doing due diligence and this came up in the
process,'' he said. ``In a lawsuit, you go about getting as much
information as you can about the entire case.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over these rules are the latest front in the
long-running battle over how to protect the city's drinking water
from pollution without throttling development in the counties where
the reservoirs are located.
</P>
<P>
   The city and northern communities agreed 22 months ago on a
broad initiative to curtail pollution in the watershed, thereby
forestalling the need for the city to build a huge new filtration
plant to meet federal drinking water standards.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency, which approved the
accord, has criticized the city for reverting to the weaker state
standard. On Tuesday, the Watership Partnership Council, consisting
of the governmental and private groups that drafted the watershed
agreement, is to meet in Albany to try to settle the lawsuit.
Kennedy and Tramontano both say they hope the meeting will be
successful.

2 MOVES INDICATE ASIAN CRISES MAY BE EASING 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In two signs that the global economic crisis is
easing, South Korea said Wednesday that it was immediately paying
back nearly $3 billion in emergency loans that kept it afloat last
year, and China successfully raised $1 billion from foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean move was a sign that the country, still deep in
recession, now felt confident enough to draw down its reserves to
repay the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese move to raise money on Wall Street _ with a bond
offering that was in such demand that the country raised twice as
much money as had been expected _ made it the first emerging-market
economy in Asia to issue international bonds since the Russian
default in August.
</P>
<P>
   Neither event by itself is evidence that the crises are over.
But both are indicators that investors around the world take into
account when they decide when a panic is over, whether, in short,
it is safe to go back in the water.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, which has been desperate to declare a restoration of
confidence in the markets, immediately seized on the South Korean
repayment as a sign that the country had hit bottom. IMF managing
director Michel Camdessus called the repayment an ``important
watershed in the process of Korea's emergence from last year's
foreign-exchange crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The bailout of South Korea, which the fund led, totaled $58
billion. The country drew on just part of that to meet its
obligations this year.
</P>
<P>
   China's move, raising money that a country with $144 billion in
foreign reserves really does not need, was a sign that investors
still hungered to invest there, despite continuing risks elsewhere
in Asia. When the offering was priced Wednesday, China had to pay
investors an interest rate only 2.8 percent higher than the U.S.
Treasury pays on 10-year Treasury securities. The 10-year note was
set to yield 7.346 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, if China can indicate that our economy has the
resilience to withstand external shocks we can also help boost
confidence with the region,'' Deputy Finance Minister Jin Liqun
said in a telephone interview Wednesday from the New York
headquarters of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the lead underwriter of the
offering along with Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade investors to return to Asia, Jin made extensive
presentations Tuesday in New York about Chinese prospects, arguing
that China had weathered the worst of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   China is an exception. It has fixed the exchange rate of its
yuan against the dollar, and Jin repeatedly said Wednesday that
``we certainly are committed to maintaining the value of our
currency,'' though did not specify for how long.
</P>
<P>
   The solidity of the implicit guarantee is important to
investors, who saw Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia end similar
commitments last year.

UNIVERSAL-POLYGRAM MERGER EXPECTED TO MEAN LAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Seagram Co. is expected to announce
today massive layoffs in its music business that may affect as many
as 3,000 employees as it completes the $10.4 billion acquisition of
PolyGram NV.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram executives have already said they plan to cut $300
million in annual costs from the combined Universal and PolyGram
music groups, which have 15,500 employees. The restructuring would
be designed to improve profit margins at the the combined
operation, which will have a 25 percent share of the world's
recorded music business.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram will close the deal, announced last May, for Polygram
today as the Montreal-based concern continues its transformation
from a beverage specialist to an entertainment conglomerate.
Analysts have said the deal makes sense because it will broaden
Universal's roster, which has strong domestic appeal with acts like
Reba McEntire, the Wallflowers and B.B. King. Labels include MCA,
Geffen, Interscope, GRP and Universal.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam-based Polygram, already the world's largest music
company, has a massive roster including Hanson, Elton John, Sheryl
Crow, U2 and Luciano Pavarotti. Labels include Decca, Def Jam, A&AMP;M,
Verve, London, Island, Mercury, Motown and Deutsche Grammophon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an analyst, I can't estimate how many jobs will be cut, but
the number that's been kicked around is 3,000,'' said Linda
Bannister of Edward Jones. ``The two companies could mix fairly
well, given Universal's domestic and PolyGram's international
strength, but any time you have a merger of this size, there's
bound to be some integration pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister noted it's crucial for the Universal-PolyGram
integration to go smoothly. ``The last thing you want is turmoil
because you want to attract new artists and keep your stable
intact,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has given a generally positive response to Seagram's
purchase because it came at a time when music sales have been
stagnant, ensuring that the price of assets would be favorable to
buyers. Philips Electronics put PolyGram up for sale because it did
not fit in with its core business.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram is under pressure from Wall Street to improve its
performance. It announced Wednesday that Universal Studios' dismal
performance at the box office during the fall will give the
division a $65 million loss in its second fiscal quarter. Pricey
disappointments included ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the
City.''

YANKEES READY TO INCLUDE PETTITTE IN CLEMENS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees have expressed a willingness to trade Andy Pettitte
in a package for Toronto's Roger Clemens, according to a major
league executive. The teams, however, are not close to agreeing on
the parameters for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Toronto, forced to swap the five-time Cy Young Award winner
now that Clemens has demanded a trade, is apparently making
progress toward a deal with another team.
</P>
<P>
   Gord Ash, the Blue Jays' general manager, said Wednesday night
that he has received an offer from a team he would not name _ the
Colorado Rockies or the Detroit Tigers, perhaps _ and now he has
referred that team to Clemens' agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday evening, neither the Yankees nor the Texas
Rangers, once thought to be the front-runners for Clemens, had been
given the go-ahead to speak with the agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Rangers apparently are finding Toronto's demands
for Clemens _ four quality major league-ready players _ difficult
to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   An executive involved in the Toronto trade talks said that
within the discussions of possible combinations, the Yankees have
indicated that they are willing to trade Pettitte, who they refused
to trade repeatedly in recent years; the third baseman Mike Lowell,
who became expendable once the Yankees re-signed Scott Brosius to a
three-year, $15.75 million deal, and second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At least to this point, the Blue Jays do not seem interested in
Pettitte. Rather, Toronto has asked for Alfonso Soriano, a
20-year-old shortstop the Yankees signed as a free agent last
summer, for $3.1 million, as well as pitcher Ramiro Mendoza, Bush
and Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays would love to have Orlando Hernandez, but
Hernandez is a frontline starter whose modest contract of $1.65
million for each of the next three years makes him too valuable to
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, would not comment
on which players were being discussed, saying only that he
continues to talk with the Blue Jays about Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to the parameters of a possible deal is only the first
of two obstacles the Yankees must hurdle before trading for
Clemens. The second will presumably be negotiating a new contract
for Clemens, who can veto any trade proposal. The Yankees then
would also have to make other trades that would make room for
Clemens' contract within the Yankees' payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, there is only moderate enthusiasm for a Clemens deal
within the organization, though at any given moment the owner
George Steinbrenner could order Cashman to make a trade. As with
the Houston Astros and the Cleveland Indians _ other teams
attempting to trade for Clemens _ the Yankees fret about giving
away valuable players in a trade and then being forced to pay
Clemens like a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, however, the Yankees may feel as if trading a
package that would include Pettitte, Lowell and Bush won't cut
deeply into their reservoir of talent. Pettitte, 26, has 67
victories in his first four years in the majors, and he has
demonstrated an ability to pitch in big games. The Yankees refused
to include him during trade talks with Seattle, Toronto and other
teams in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But scouts around baseball believe that the quality of
Pettitte's stuff is diminishing gradually, much in the way Jim
Abbott regressed and was released before his 30th birthday. At the
same time, Pettitte's salary is skyrocketing _ he earned $3.8
million in 1998, and he will be eligible for arbitration after each
of the next two seasons. If the Yankees' executives agree with the
assessment of others that Pettitte's ability is diminishing, they
could trade him now.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, 25, batted .304 for Class AAA Columbus last season and
was called up in September. The Yankees are waiting to see if
Lowell will be part of the Clemens trade, and if he is not, they
already have discussed a trade that would send Lowell to Florida
for the young pitchers Joe Fontenot, who threw well against the
Yankees in a game last June, and the minor leaguer Ed Yarnall, a
former Mets farmhand who was part of the Mike Piazza deal last May.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres also have interest in Lowell _ in fact, a
Toronto official said that the Blue Jays have discussed the
possibility of shipping Lowell to the Padres if they get Lowell
from the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 26, primarily served as a part-time player for the Yankees
last season, but will likely be traded before next season, while
the Yankees can still capitalize on his value as a potential
everyday player.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees initially offered Lowell, Bush and a minor leaguer
for Clemens on Monday, to open negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, committed to improving its team under new ownership,
tried and failed to sign pitcher Randy Johnson last month. Now it
is poised to pursue Clemens as its ace, and by signing the
right-hander Mark Clark to a two-year, $9.5 million contract on
Tuesday, the Rangers have the flexibility to trade one of their
other starting pitchers, Aaron Sele or Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sele is eligible for arbitration and draws a higher
salary than Helling, Texas would be more likely to trade Sele.
Toronto has also asked for outfielders Rusty Greer and Ruben Mateo,
as well as another player.

THE ANATOMY OF A RESCUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ When the wave crashed over the stern and
swamped their 18-foot boat, they were probably in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When another wave turned the vessel side-to and capsized it,
they definitely were.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue the center-console was too small to be out at
the Channel Islands, though boats that size routinely cross the
Santa Barbara Channel from the mainland. Others could argue the
skipper and his father should have been paying better attention to
the breakers and less to the big perch they were catching at
Smuggler's Cove, on the east end of Santa Cruz Island, southwest of
San Pedro Point.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't an advisory on small craft. This is an anatomy of
a rescue, a rescue that took place on a sunny Saturday in September
with 2-foot seas and 6-mile visibility. If any rescue was typical,
this would be it. But none ever is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think it's gonna be simple,'' said one rescuer, ``but when
you get there, there's always some unexpected element.''
</P>
<P>
   The following has been pieced together from the Coast Guard's
situation report and accounts of the rescuers: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The skipper of the sailboat Tin Cup watched a small boat capsize
in the surf off Smuggler's Cove. At 11:11 a.m., he called a mayday
on Channel 16, the emergency frequency for marine radios, reporting
he was unable to recover the men without putting his own boat in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The call was received by the Group Operations Center at Coast
Guard Station Long Beach, where five specially trained petty
officers coordinate rescues from Morro Bay to San Clemente and out
to 200 nautical miles. At least two officials man the room at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   The operations center has considerable assets at its disposal _
four cutters that can be under way within an hour, dozens of
smaller rescue boats that can slip their moorings in less than 15
minutes and three helicopters with rescue swimmers aboard that can
be airborne within 20 minutes. Sundry vessels and aircraft are
available from other sources, including the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   At Long Beach, Petty Officer 1st class John Hurst and his
communications specialist, Petty Officer 3rd class Francisco Lopez,
were on watch the day the small craft capsized. Maintaining
communication with the Tin Cup, Hurst ordered the Coast Guard
Channel Islands' 41-foot utility boat and its crew of four under
way. It was 11:12 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the dynamics of a rescue off the Channel Islands,
it is important to understand that all major operations are
coordinated by Long Beach, even if a mayday is called a half-mile
from a subordinate Coast Guard station.
</P>
<P>
   When a call is logged in, the search-and-rescue controller
assigns it a priority status _ ``distress,'' ``alert'' or
``uncertainty.'' Anything life-threatening _ when boaters are
reported in the sea, as in this call _ would automatically be a
``distress'' situation.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:15 a.m., a Coast Guard Air Station Los Angeles helicopter
was ordered airborne. Two minutes later, confirmation was received
that Coast Guard Channel Islands had diverted its 41-footer from a
training mission and was heading to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:18 a.m., an urgent marine information broadcast was issued
requesting details from other vessels near enough to the capsized
boat to see what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at 1,000 feet above the Anacapa Passage, Coast Guard
Auxiliary pilot Ken Coddington of Thousand Oaks was on routine
patrol in his 1947 Navion L-17A when he heard the mayday. He
diverted to the scene and was there within seconds, dropping down
to 500 feet and circling. He spotted the capsized boat and the men
in the surf, then reported weather and water conditions back to
Long Beach for the benefit of the inbound helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   With Coddington's data, Hurst instructed Tin Cup's skipper to
have the men swim to the beach. Lopez telephoned Channel Islands
National Park's dispatch operator and requested a ranger respond to
the beach at Smuggler's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the rescue, the Tin Cup's skipper had launched
a dinghy and tried to get to the men in the water. It was uncertain
whether the men were injured or in shock. They were reported to
have no life vests.
</P>
<P>
   Park Ranger Darcy MacDonald was on her fourth day of a seven-day
tour at Scorpion Ranch on Santa Cruz Island. At her disposal is a
3,000-pound inflatable boat and an all-terrain vehicle. She took
the call on the Park Service's own radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald responded, grabbing her rescue kit containing a wet
suit, fins, a rescue ring and a rope bag. She opted to travel the
3{ miles overland by ATV, figuring it would be faster; had it been
anywhere other than Smuggler's Cove, she would have taken the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, I saw their boat in the surf and two guys in
waist-deep water trying to flip it over,'' MacDonald said. ``I rode
over to them. They were fine. The helicopter was hovering
overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11:24 a.m., the Tin Cup reported to the Coast Guard that the
men were safely on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   At 500 feet, Coddington reported the arrival of the ranger and
was instructed to stand down.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two minutes into the rescue, MacDonald confirmed to Coast
Guard Long Beach the two men were on the beach, uninjured. She
assumed responsibility for the men's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a man and his father. They were glad to see me and
showed no signs of shock or hypothermia,'' she said. ``It was an
unusually warm day, so hypothermia was not a big concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kinder, a park maintenance worker, arrived in a second ATV.
He produced dry jackets for the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, as she is trained to do, evaluated the men's condition
and determined the best and safest way to get them off the island.
The Coast Guard determined its job was done at 12:35 p.m., and the
Channel Islands unit's utility vessel departed the scene and
resumed training.
</P>
<P>
   Vessel Assist, a marine-salvage outfit, was hailed to right the
anglers' craft. At 3:32 p.m., the rescued boaters were en route to
Channel Islands Harbor with their boat under tow; by 6:00 p.m. they
were reported safely moored.
</P>
<P>
   For the rescued, the day won't soon be forgotten. For the
rescuers, it was a day like any other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR:
</P>
<P>
   Vessel Assist Association is a boater's Triple-A &UR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeremy Bagott &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _There comes a time in a Coast Guard operation
when a rescued boater becomes a polluter and the wreck, the
pollutant.
</P>
<P>
   From the Coast Guard's perspective, it might even be better if
the crippled craft runs aground. Otherwise, it becomes a hazard to
navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the salvage of the vessel falls upon the owner. But
the wreck will be governed by admiralty law and the rights of
salvage, meaning anyone can salvage it without the owner's
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Trust the Channel Islands National Park on the urgency of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Park Service gets really testy,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Mark
Steinhilber of Coast Guard Group Long Beach's Department of
Investigations. ``Maybe (the owner) hasn't been maintaining the
boat. Maybe he's made poor decisions. Maybe he's a victim of
circumstance. It doesn't matter. He has to deal with the
wreckage.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Vessel Assist Association, the boating equivalent of
the Auto Club.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Delano, the Vessel Assist contractor from Point Dume to
Point Conception, was monitoring the Santa Cruz Island rescue on
that uncloudy September Saturday from his base station in Ventura's
Harbor Village.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:56 a.m., 45 minutes after the initial distress call,
Delano was contacted by the men involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Delano and his daughter, Kathy, motored to the scene in their
33-foot salvage boat. On the beach in Smuggler's Cove, the capsized
boat was taking a pounding in the surf line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the boat would be ground up in the surf unless
something was done right away,'' said Channel Islands National Park
Ranger Darcy MacDonald, who assisted the boaters after they swam
ashore. ``A boat will fill with sand after a while. We tried to
flip it over, but it was too heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   While they waited the two hours for Vessel Assist to arrive, the
two rescued men were assisted by MacDonald in gathering their
belongings, which were strewn across the beach. They even salvaged
lunch from the debris _ a bag of potato chips, oranges and a soda.
</P>
<P>
   Vessel Assist skipper Dave Delano anchored at the surf line.
Kathy Delano went over the side and swam to the beach with a
waterproof hand-held radio and one end of 1,000 feet of ski line.
</P>
<P>
   The boaters were then pulled off the beach inside their righted
boat and transferred to the Delanos' vessel for some hot coffee on
the way back to the mainland _ a ride home they never expected but
for which they were grateful. &QL;

LOVERS OF SWING STAGE A TOE-TAPPING PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As protests go, it was one of the more tuneful. For
an hour Wednesday, a swing band held forth from behind police
barricades outside The New York Times on West 43rd Street, rallying
cabaret stars, Lindy hoppers and perhaps 75 other ardent fans in
support of WQEW (1560-AM), New York City's only station devoted to
American popular standards.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co., which owns the station and took over the
format from WNEW-AM in 1992, said last week that it would lease
WQEW at year's end to ABC Inc. for eight years of children's
programming by Radio Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want swing to get lost in the shuffle,'' said George
Gee, who with six members of his 17-piece ``Make Believe Ballroom
Orchestra,'' belted out ``Take the A Train,'' ``Satin Doll'' and
``In the Mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer Susannah McCorkle credited WQEW and WNEW with boosting
her career. ``People need to know how great this music is,'' she
said as she was joined by Kathleen Landis, who accompanies herself
on the piano at the Cafe Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my music, music created in New York City,'' Ms. Landis
said. ``If no one speaks up it could be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Sherman, who accompanies herself on Cole Porter's piano at
the cocktail terrace of the Waldorf-Astoria, said the pending loss
of the station left her bereft. ``You turn on that radio, it's like
having another person in your house,'' Ms. Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Times Co., Lisa Carparelli, said that
while station supporters were within their rights to protest, ``We
have a responsibility to make prudent business decisions to insure
the success of the company in what became a very competitive
market, and sometimes this requires difficult trade-offs like the
one we made about WQEW.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, ABC has the right to buy the station after the
eight-year lease. The two parties did not provide the financial
details but one executive valued the package at about $40 million.
The Times Co.'s other station, WQXR-FM (96.3), is not affected.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the protesters described themselves as ordinary
listeners devoted to the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen when I wake up and when I go to sleep,'' said Howard
Samara, 62, an advertising man who showed up in a black T-shirt
with the legend ``Swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Teltser-Schwarz, 61, said she treasured the WNEW and WQEW
memorabilia that she had collected over the years. Without the
station, she said, ``there'll be nothing for the grannies to dance
to in their kitchens.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest was organized by Bruce Cohen, a public relations man
representing Gee's swing orchestra. Taking photos outside the
police barricades he said, ``Not exactly a day of rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a police officer if he anticipated ``any civil
disturbance,'' Cohen said, ``We might up the tempo from time to
time.''

PLAYER BENEFIT ANGERS SOME AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angered and insulted by an exhibition game designating one of
its two charities as financially struggling players, a National
Basketball Association player agent Wednesday criticized his peers
and the all-star players involved in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Glass, who represents five players making the league's
minimum annual salary of $272,500, said he was insulted over how
fellow agents and the game's promoters, David Falk and Arn Tellem,
were planning to divide the proceeds from the Dec. 19 game. The
exhibition, scheduled in Atlantic City, will benefit Unicef and the
NBA players who have been hurt financially by the league's
five-month-old lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is troubling me to a tremendous degree,'' Glass said.
``I support it in a way that shows the unity of the union and to
show the owners that their game is not the only one in town. But
for them to say this will benefit NBA players as a charity is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of my players has ever asked me for money and will not
accept money from this game. The entire portion should go to
charity. The idea that a player making $275,000 can't manage his
money, and needs the fans to bail him out, is absurd and insulting.
If that's the break between the agents, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass was one of more than 70 player agents who took part in a
conference call Wednesday with the union's executive director,
Billy Hunter. The call was mainly to assuage fears that the NBA
season would be canceled. Hunter did his best to soothe their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He told the agents, some of whom were more than skeptical, that
the two sides in the league's labor dispute were not as far apart
as many believed and that if the players remained unified, a deal
would be struck in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But other agents echoed Glass' concern over a public backlash
that arose after a news conference on Monday in New York to
announce the exhibition game, which will be televised by Showtime.
Aside from Falk and Tellem via satellite from Los Angeles, the
union's president, Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, Allan Houston,
Glen Rice and Dominique Wilkins also participated in the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Though they tried to preface their statements by saying that
fans should not feel sorry for the players, comments from Mourning
and Ewing about players in need were roundly criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the beating on this thing,'' one agent said
Wednesday. ``Let's just make sure we keep these guys out of the
casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's last general session was held in Las Vegas, Nev.,
which also drew the public's ire. Except for the involvement of its
players, the union is not involved in the promotion or the
organization of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hunter was upset with some of the charity game's
proceeds going to players was unclear. The union declined comment
on the matter Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But there apparently is growing support to make sure that all
revenues from the game _ courtside tickets are said to be priced at
$1,000 _ go to charity, said one player agent, who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what David and Arn are thinking, but that's not
our agenda,'' Glass said. ``This is everything I'm against. Why in
the world, if you knew there was going to be a problem with a
lockout, would you not prepare for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely taken aback. We ask the fans to wait for our
season to start so they can start paying exorbitant prices for
tickets again. Now, we're going to turn around and ask them for
money?''

PATRIOTS' OWNER DEFENDS DEAL FOR STATE-BUILT STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Facing four hours of sharp and occasionally
argumentative questioning by Connecticut lawmakers Wednesday,
Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, defended the terms
of his tentative contract to move the team to a state-built stadium
in Hartford, but asserted that the deal would be as good for the
city as it would be for him.
</P>
<P>
   First in cramped caucus rooms and later on statewide television,
legislators grilled Kraft on the costs and risks of the agreement,
which would provide the football team with a $375 million stadium,
rent-free, in return for a 30-year agreement to stay in Hartford.
But Kraft insisted it wasn't a giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal has been portrayed by some as a sweetheart deal, and
I don't think that we've done a good job getting the message out on
this deal,'' Kraft, 57, said. ``That just isn't true. I want to say
this up-front: I'm at an age where if I make a commitment for the
next 30 years, that takes me through my lifetime, I believe. I
don't want to do a deal that isn't a good deal, both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers said they were not sure about that, however, and
said they still did not have enough information to evaluate the
decision. ``People keep saying it's a done deal, but every
legislator I talk to has serious reservations about it,'' said
state Rep. Nancy Beals, a Democrat from Hamden.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. John Rowland released a private study
commissioned by the state that showed that the stadium would pay
for itself over the 30-year span of the agreement. But on Wednesday
the Legislature's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis issued a
report concluding that the project would wind up costing taxpayers
as much as $323 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft told lawmakers that the deal was fragile and discouraged
them from contemplating any changes. But the House majority leader,
Moira Lyons, said that after meeting with Kraft she still had
concerns about the agreement. She said the governor's negotiators
had agreed to take up the issues with Kraft's representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that in good faith, they're going to see what they can
do,'' Ms. Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   With such questions remaining, some legislators worried that
they would have little time to review the measure before the vote,
scheduled for next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Republican, has said he was willing to stake his
legacy on the plan, and the leaders of the House and Senate, both
controlled by Democrats, are energetically pushing it. The
opposition, on the other hand, has been diffuse, and the lawmakers
who are leery of the plan have mostly raised questions rather than
organizing outright opposition.
</P>
<P>
   One group of opponents, the Connecticut Citizens Action Group,
livened up the Legislative Office Building, where the hearing was
held, by handing out cheese with stickers that said: ``Kraft Gets
$1 Billion. Our Kids Get Surplus Cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opening remarks at the hearing, Rowland acknowledged that
the opposition had become increasingly vocal, telling lawmakers,
``You've heard from constituents that obviously are opposed to it,
because they are the only people who call.'' He called the
eight-hour hearing ``our opportunity to drive past the doldrums and
the naysayers.'' He implored the Legislature to consider the
alternative _ no new franchise _ and compare that to ``the
long-term hit that we get with an NFL franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots and the Kraft family believe in us,'' the
governor said. ``Now, it's time for us to believe in ourselves. No
dream is worth having without some risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kraft said he could not predict how his plan would
fare. ``There were a lot of questions _ hard questions _ and that's
good for us to hear,'' he said. The Senate president, Kevin
Sullivan, described legislators as ``cautiously inclined _
skeptically inclined'' to seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said in his testimony that while the team is to pay no
rent during the 30-year lease, the Patriots would would be paying
operating expenses. He added that the 10 percent tax the Patriots
will pay on ticket sales was a better deal for the state than rent,
since the amount would grow as the stadium flourished.
</P>
<P>
   The provision that has drawn the most ire from lawmakers is a
guarantee of as much as $17.5 million a year that the state would
pay if luxury suites and boxes went unsold. Although the governor
and Kraft have maintained publicly that this is a nonnegotiable
provision, aides to the governor have promised senior lawmakers
that they will try to tinker with these guarantees to try to reduce
the state's risk.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the guarantees, Kraft pointed to the risk he was
taking. He asked lawmakers to imagine they owned the Patriots and
had the choice of moving to Los Angeles or Houston, which lack NFL
teams, or to Hartford. ``Let's analyze,'' he said, tossing out a
few statistics about the wealth and size of the bigger cities.
``Hartford,'' he continued, ``is a city that has not had a great
record in maintaining corporations here or attracting new
corporations _ and I say this respectfully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to come to Hartford,'' he continued. ``That analysis
was simply an academic one, to make you understand how we try to
get an equivalent basis, on these guarantees.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas, _ Gen. Hamilton Hawkins Howze, whose vision
of a ``sky cavalry'' transformed the Army's use of helicopters
before the Vietnam War, died Tuesday in Fort Worth. He was 89.
</P>
<P>

decorated veteran, will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at Saint Andrew's
Episcopal Church in Fort Worth. Burial will be at the cemetery at
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where Howze was born.
</P>
<P>
   Howze presided over the Army's Tactical Mobility Requirement
Board in the early 1960s.MDBU/.MDNM/. Later known as the Howze
Board, it explored the effectiveness of air mobile operations, said
Jack Moran, executive director for military aircraft at Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Howze the ``father of air mobile operations,'' Moran
said the four-star general ``was instrumental in the Army
organizing the First Cavalry Division, which fought so valiantly in
Vietnam (between) 1965 and 1971.''
</P>
<P>
   Howze was born Dec. 21, 1908, at West Point, N.Y. His father,
Major Gen. Robert L. Howze, was commandant of cadets at the time.
Hamilton Howze, who entered the academy in 1926, graduated in 1930,
according to an academy spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, Brig. Gen. Hamilton S. Hawkins, participated in
the charge up San Juan Hill during the Spanish-American War. His
great-grandfather, Hamilton S. Hawkins, was an Army surgeon who
died in the Mexican War.
</P>
<P>
   Howze graduated from an El Paso high school and attended Ohio
State University for one year. He was commissioned a lieutenant in
the cavalry after graduating from West Point.
</P>
<P>
   For his service in World War II, he received two Legions of
Merit awards, one in Italy and one in North Africa. He won a Silver
Star for service in North Africa, among other service awards.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, Howze was commanding general of the 82nd
Airborne Division and later of the 18th Airborne Corps. In 1955, he
was named director of Army Aviation in the Office of the Deputy
Chief of Staff for Military Operations. He was later chief of the
United States Army Advisory Group in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   From 1963-65, he was commanding general of the 8th U.S.
Army/United Nations Command.
</P>
<P>
   Other service included three years in the Department of the Army
in Washington, and an assignment in Europe that included being
deputy chief of staff for operations of the Seventh Army.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. General Robert Williams, 80, of Fort Worth, was
president of the Army Aviation Test Board in 1955 when he Gen.
Howze.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Howze's concept was one in which ``air vehicles,
particularly air helicopters'' replaced ground vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of aviation aircraft performing supplementary
functions, such as transportation or observation or supplementing
the firepower, the air vehicles became the primary means of doing
those things, particularly the helicopter gun ships.''
</P>
<P>
   Howze led the introduction of helicopters ``carrying rockets and
machine guns, delivering fire power,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams described his friend as an ``impressive individual''
who ``acted like a general'' but ``never took anything too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from active duty in 1965, Howze moved to Fort
Worth and was vice president for product planning at Bell
Helicopter until 1971, when he retired but remained a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Howze served on the board of Fort Worth's Museum of Science and
History and was elected president in 1970. He also was on the
city's Traffic Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As a frequent contributor to the ``Star-Telegram'' opinion
pages, Howze wrote about issues such as terrorism in the late 1970s
(he advocated media restraint in reporting about terrorist
activity), the U.S. mission to rescue hostages in Iran in 1980 and
women in the military (he opposed the admission of women to
military academies).
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``A Cavalryman's Story: Memoirs of a Twentieth Century
Army General.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Mary Henry Howze of Fort Worth; two
sons, William G. Howze of Harker Heights and Guy R. Howze of
Austin; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

NHRA EVENT GETS NEW SPONSOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDORA -- The Automobile Club of Southern California has
reached a multi-year agreement with the Glendora, Calif.-based
National Hot Rod Association to replace R.J. Reynolds and its
Winston cigarette subsidiary as title sponsor for next year's
season-ending event at Pomona Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The event, formerly known as the Winston Finals, now will be
called the Auto Club of Southern California NHRA finals and will
conclude the NHRA's 22-race circuit. Last month's Winston Finals
attacted an NHRA-record 138,000 fans during the four days of racing
that concluded on Nov. 15. Cash and contingency awards of more than
$1.7 million were paid.
</P>
<P>
   While the NHRA has yet to announce the indvidual prize purses
for each national event, NHRA president Dallas Gardner said there
would be no change in guidelines for the Auto Club of Southern
California Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rewarding to see an organization with such an impressive
membership significantly increase its presence in NHRA Winston drag
racing by sponsoring one of our marquee events,'' Gardner said.
``The Automobile Club of Southern California NHRA Finals will
continue to be one of our greatest traditions, showcasing
tremendous competition as well as the exciting drama that unfolds
as all NHRA Winston champions are crowned.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the sponsorship change comes less than a
month after a settlement was reached between U.S. tobacco companies
and several state governments, including California.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the settlement states that each tobacco company is
entitled to the sponsorship of one (racing) series. Speculation is
that R.J. Reynolds will choose to remain with NASCAR stock car
racing and its immensely popularWinston Cup series.
</P>
<P>
   However, an R.J. Reynolds spokesman denied the company was
dropping out of Pomona event for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process for (the agreement with Auto Club) started over a
year ago, so it has nothing to do with (the tobacco) settlement,''
said Greg Littell, director of sports marketing for R.J. Reynolds.
``This was just a chance for us to give up a property and allow
another company to increase its involvement (in NHRA drag
racing).''
</P>
<P>
   Littell said R.J Reynolds is willing to do that because next
season it has a number of special events planned to celebrate its
25 years of association with the NHRA, including the Winston
Showdown. That special non-points event will showcase Top Fuel
dragsters racing Funny Cars next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to step aside so that another company could be a
title sponsor,'' said Cliff Pennell, president of R.J. Reynolds'
Sports Marketing Enterprises. ``We've enjoyed a fantastic 24-year
sponsorship of the Winston Finals. However, a year ago, we were
advised that if we ever wanted to give up the Winston Finals, the
Automobile Club of Southern California would like to have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed that given the importance of the event to them, it
was a good idea. Otherwise, we would never have given up the
Winston Finals. Allowing a sponsor that is already involved with
NHRA Winston drag racing to get even more involved is definitely
good for the sport. The Automobile Club of Southern California and
a race at Pomona are a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who said he began talking with the Auto Club nearly two
years ago, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds previously announced it would not to renew its
sponsorship contract with Funny Car driver Whit Bazemore, but
Pennell maintains the company will remain heavily involved in drag
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite not having the Winston Finals, our commitment to NHRA
Winston Drag Racing in 1999 remains the same,'' Pennell said. ``All
of the money, energy and effort that went into the Winston Finals
will stay in the sport. We are focusing our event sponsorship on
the Winston Showdown (at Bristol, Tenn.) next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the Auto Club should take some of the heat
off the NHRA, which has received pressure from members of the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors who don't want an event
sanctioned by a tobacco company held on L.A. County property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win proposition for the both of us,'' Gardner said.
``We know it will be good for the NHRA, good for Winston and good
for the entire sport. With the the Auto Club and its nearly five
million members, it's a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Club's sponsorship of the event is not the
organization's first involvement with the NHRA or motorsports. AAA
has been an associate sponsor for Gary Densham's Funny Car
operation the past three seasons and has backed the Auto Club Road
to the Future Award since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile organization has also been title sponsor for the
NASCAR Winston West Auto Club 200 at California Speedway the past
two seasons as well as being an associate sponsor at the Long Beach
Grand Prix since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Club of Southern California has a rich history in
motorsports, including sanctioning and promoting track and
endurance races in the early 1900s. Although it stopped sanctioning
events until a few years ago to focus on member services, the Club
for decades has worked closely with manufacturers, mechanics and
state agencies to improve vehicle technology and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this has a way to reinforce our brand,'' said Tom
McKernan, Auto Club president and CEO. ``We've been involved with
Densham, the Road to the Future Award and the NHRA California Hot
Rod Reunion. This is just another way for us become more visible
and reinforce our brand.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday., Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra's FBI dossier, opened seven months after his
death, now makes it clear that some legends resist tarnish better
than others. The bureau's tawdry collection of charges, gossip and
weirdo conspiracy theories all stamped with dates and the official
FBI seal might besmirch a more traditionally wholesome American
superstar. But for one who has long been certified as an earlier
generation's celebrity tough guy, how much does it hurt to hear
that Frank Sinatra was not exactly Pat Boone? OK, so there are
charges about shady associates and that he had, shall we say, an
active social life, or even that he was a lefty who was ready,
maybe, to rat on his lefty pals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more interesting are the documents about the younger
Sinatra, whose doings were not yet filtered through lawyers, agents
or wives. His arrest in Bergen County, New Jersey, in 1938 was for
the quaint old crime of seduction, a law no longer prosecuted in
this country. The Sinatra mug shot at age 23, with its sultry pout,
still exudes enough testosterone to snarl traffic in downtown
Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
   The young Sinatra's encounter with the World War II military
draft is even more intriguing. A letter passed along to the bureau
from the gossip columnist Walter Winchell suggested that Sinatra
had tried to evade the draft with a $40,000 bribe. After
investigating for four years, agents decided the charge was not
true. They reported that the man with the golden larynx also had a
chronically bad ear, not to mention ``mental instability.''
Specifically, the psychiatric examiner for the Jersey City draft
board wrote that ``the patient stated that he was neurotic, afraid
to be in crowds ... would want to run when surrounded by people.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who sang ``It Was a Very Good Year'' and ``My Way'' had
a hearing problem? The guy who J. Edgar Hoover feared could
personally lead his thousands of screaming bobby-soxer fans
straight into sin or to Moscow, this Pied Piper of the old
Paramount, didn't like crowds? The explanations and possibilities
are endless. So, maybe he sent a buddy. Maybe he faked it. Maybe he
conned the shrink. Maybe the answer is not to focus on the FBI's
records but on his.

RUFF INSISTS CLINTON DID NOT COMMIT PERJURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wrapping up President Clinton's defense at
impeachment hearings, White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff
conceded Wednesday that ``reasonable people'' might conclude that
the president made false statements under oath about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff insisted that the president did not commit the crime of
perjury because Clinton's testimony was based on his understanding
that sexual relations meant sexual intercourse. He contended that
the president's goal was to be ``evasive'' and ``as of little help
as possible'' to prosecutors trying to build a case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's painstaking efforts to draw distinctions between legal
wrongdoing and what he described as ``morally reprehensible''
conduct came on the second day of the White House defense effort
before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Before he had concluded his testimony, the Republican committee
members released four draft articles of impeachment against the
president, including two accusing him of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the action, Ruff continued to contend that there was no
convincing evidence in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report
on the Lewinsky matter to support his contention that Clinton
committed perjury, sought to obstruct justice or abused his
presidential powers to keep his affair with Lewinsky private.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has not committed a high crime or misdemeanor.
His conduct, although morally reprehensible, does not warrant
impeachment, does not warrant overturning the mandate of the
American electorate,'' Ruff said as the 37-member panel sat in rapt
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have committed an impeachable offense, the
president must have acted to subvert our system of government. And
members of the committee, that did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff added that what Clinton had done essentially with his
``wrongful relationship'' was violate ``his sacred obligations to
his wife and daughter,'' not to mention the trust placed in him by
the American people. For that, Ruff suggested, Clinton has suffered
enough ``privately and publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said the president would accept any ``reasonable
suggestion ... to end this process'' short of impeachment. His
statement raised the possibility that Clinton would agree to appear
on the House floor to be censured, or publicly reprimanded for his
conduct, and pay a financial penalty as well. Both have been raised
as alternatives to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's concession, under questioning from Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., that Clinton may have made false statements
surprised some GOP panel members who have pressed the White House
repeatedly to admit that the president lied under oath. But the
lawyer stopped far short of that, insisting that none of Clinton's
statements to the grand jury or in a deposition for the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case amounted to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that the president testified truthfully
before the grand jury,'' Ruff declared. ``I have no doubt he walked
up to a line he thought he understood. Reasonable people could
determine he crossed that line. But in his mind, and that is the
heart of perjury, what he thought he was doing was being evasive
but truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's interpretation of what constitutes perjury was supported
by a panel of legal scholars and practicing attorneys who offered a
point-by-point rebuttal to Starr's charges that Clinton had lied
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which included the former Republican governor of
Massachusetts, William Weld, and a former Watergate prosecutor,
argued that no ``responsible federal prosecutor'' would even think
of bringing perjury charges in court like those outlined by Starr
because conviction would be difficult, if not impossible, to
obtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president were not involved, if an ordinary citizen
were the subject of the inquiry, no serious consideration would be
given to a criminal prosecution ... having to do with an alleged
cover-up of a private sexual affair with another woman,'' said
former Illinois U.S. attorney Thomas P. Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't get in the door; it would be declined out of
hand,'' Sullivan added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not perjury for a witness to evade, obfuscate or answer
nonresponsively,'' Sullivan told the panel of 21 Republicans and 16
Democrats. ``The evidence (in the Starr report) simply does not
support the conclusion that president knowingly committed perjury,
and the case is so doubtful and weak that a responsible prosecutor
would not present it to the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that in perjury cases
prosecutors must prove that lies were ``knowingly'' made under oath
and that they were ``material'' to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans, however, were indignant at the claim that
Clinton should be treated as an ordinary citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that we're still not getting straight talk and
the truth,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., adding that Clinton
``is not just any ordinary citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As president he has a higher responsibility to set an example
and uphold the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense of the president, Ruff described several
instances of ``facts and evidence'' favorable to the president that
Starr left out of his report to Congress. They involved both
testimony from Lewinsky and others that Ruff said support many of
the president's statements that Starr claims are lies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ruff claimed that testimony from Betty Currie, the
president's personal secretary, supports Clinton's contention that
he never asked Lewinsky return his gifts and that the prosecutor
never bothered to ask Lewinsky if that testimony was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff also pointed to the independent counsel's claim that
Clinton lied to reporters last March when he said he had not held
discussions with his lawyers about claiming executive privilege to
prevent certain White House officials from testifying before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a transcript of that exchange with reporters, Ruff said
Starr failed to note that Clinton was responding to a question
about whether first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton should be included
as a protected official in the privilege claim, something Ruff said
had not been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's defense on that issue stunned some members of the
committee because some Republicans have repeatedly referred to
Clinton's comment on executive privilege as evidence that he has
``engaged in a pattern of lies and misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (Republicans) were listening, I think Mr. Ruff was
compelling,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a committee
member who supports censure for Clinton, but not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, leaving out information that could be material to a
case ... at least in my neck of the woods, is appalling,'' she
said.

EDITORIAL: DEBT RELIEF AFTER A KILLER STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tropical Storm Mitch devastated Nicaragua and
Honduras, they were Latin America's poorest nations. While they are
still struggling to prevent disease, provide shelter and get food
to the victims, those nations and their less-affected neighbors are
thinking about long-term reconstruction. They need billions of
dollars to rebuild. Creditor nations and international donors must
forgive the debts of Honduras and Nicaragua. Washington should also
grant the region trade preferences that encourage economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua, one of the world's most indebted nations, owes $6
billion to governments and institutions such as the International
Monetary Fund. Last year it paid 11 times more in debt service than
it spent on basic health care _ 40 percent of its export earnings.
Honduras owes $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington suspended for two years their payments on debt owed
to the United States, but this is not enough. The United States
should join European nations such as France in forgiving the debts
and offering some relief to El Salvador and Guatemala. Washington
should also use its influence to get the I.M.F. and other lending
institutions to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Relief must be conditioned on good use of the money. It must be
closely monitored to insure that it goes to basic infrastructure,
education, forestation, health and other programs that will give
Nicaragua and Honduras the tools to emerge from poverty. Washington
should also allow illegal aliens from Central America to stay in
the United States. It has promised to stop deportations only until
January.
</P>
<P>
   Washington can help the affected Central American nations
recover the trade and investment benefits they once gained from the
1984 Caribbean Basin Initiative. Their advantage was lost to Mexico
after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which
also hurt the Caribbean. To help both regions develop a diversity
of new jobs, President Clinton should ask Congress to give their
exports the same entry to the United States that Mexican exports
enjoy.

WET SUITS A MUST IN WINTER SURF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD COUCH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ They're a little cumbersome, tough to put on
and they take away some of the customary sensation. But they
provide the protection Southern California surfers need in the
wintertime, especially with a lady like La Nina around.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No.1 when a weather phenomenon cools ocean temperatures to
below 60 degrees: Wear your rubber wet suit.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't grow up skinny-dipping in one of Minnesota's
10,000 lakes, or if you don't have blubber for epidermis, you're
going to need a wet suit and booties to surf this year's winter
swells.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County lifeguard Capt. Jim Doman is not a
physiologist, but he knows what can happen to the body when winter
water temperatures drop to as low as 50 degrees at Zuma Beach,
where six months earlier highs reached 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that you have 12 minutes to live in 43-degree
water,'' Doman said, recalling a briefing he received during a
Rocky Mountain river-rafting trip. ``Anything below body
temperature can cause your temperature to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when hypothermia happens, and this winter, with its La
Nina phenomenon, is shaping up to be particularly nasty.
</P>
<P>
   As Surfer magazine put it, La Nina is El Nino's ``frigid
sister''; meteorologists predict that Southland ocean temperatures
will be much colder than normal for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers take heed: ``If you want to stay out there long, you'll
need a wet suit,'' Doman said.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Jack O'Neill realized this a long time ago. O'Neill,
who founded the wet-suit company that bears his name and was
inducted into the Huntington Beach Surfing Walk of Fame in July for
his contributions to surfing culture, is credited with inventing
the first wet suit for surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that up in Santa Cruz in the late 1940s and early
'50s, die-hard surfers coated themselves with Vaseline and wore
wool sweaters wrapped with duct tape to stay warm in the region's
colder waters.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative solution, O'Neill picked up a Navy dive suit
at a surplus store in 1949. While it didn't hold up well in the
pounding surf, the inventive waterman knew he was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, O'Neill came upon a unicellular-foam material
that he used to create and market the first wet suit specifically
for surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Today's wet suits are made from a combination of high-tech
materials, but the main ingredient is neoprene, said Scott Daley,
director of marketing for Body Glove, a company that has been
manufacturing wet suits and other surfing products since 1953. The
elastic panels of wet suits are held together with glue and
specialized stitching.
</P>
<P>
   The way wet suits work is simple. While in the ocean, a thin
layer of water is trapped between the skin-tight synthetic suit and
the body. That water is warmed by the body and sustained for
varying lengths of time, depending on the suit's thickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, wet suits help you retain body heat,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of wet suits broadened the scope of surfing around
the world. Surf breaks in places once thought to be too cold to
surf have been conquered. Grizzlies no longer have a monopoly in
Alaskan waters, and surfers have joined the lobsters on the shores
of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and Body Glove are not the only ones keeping surfers
warm. The November issue of Surfer magazine includes a special
advertising section featuring wet suits from 11 different
companies.
</P>
<P>
   There are long-sleeve and short-sleeve full suits, spring suits
(with short legs) and hooded varieties. They range in thickness
from 2mm to 6mm. Some have heavy-duty zippers. Most are made with
Velcro closures. There are even reversible wet suits _ black on one
side, blue on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Wet suits are generally priced from $115 to $350. Sales in 1997
were estimated at $100million, according to the Surf Industry
Manufacturing Association.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal for wet-suit companies is to continue making
products that are as light and offer as much flexibility as
possible, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when surfers are paddling into 40- to 50-foot sets at
Maverick's in Northern California, the last thing they need is
being hampered by their rubber suits.
</P>
<P>
   Words to wet-suit wise
</P>
<P>
   When surfers plunk down $300 or more for a wet suit, they don't
expect it to rip apart after one year of regular use.
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers offer reasonable warranties and will repair
tears within the first two years of purchase. However, primary care
for the wet suit rests with the surfer. They are not indestructible
but should hold up for at least three to four years of winter
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   A few tips to make them last longer _ and to keep you out of
jail:
</P>
<P>
   _ Put on a wet suit when it is completely dry. Putting one on
when it's wet can put too much stress on the panels that are
stitched together to make it complete.
</P>
<P>
   _ A wet suit is put on feet first, one leg at a time. To reduce
stress on the materials, some surfers put a plastic bag on the
foot, which allows their leg to slide right in. When the foot comes
out the end, take off the bag and repeat for the other leg.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rinse thoroughly with fresh water after each use. Saltwater
can deteriorate glue and stitches in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Let the wet suit drip-dry only, and hang it up in a cool, dry
place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, a word to the wise. There are indecent-exposure laws
on the books, so dress accordingly. Most surfers change into their
wet suits in parking lots, along the side of a road and other open,
public places. Use a beach towel to wrap around yourself while
changing. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   By turning international weapons inspectors away from the
headquarters of its ruling party Wednesday, Iraq showed why the
U.N. Security Council should make no move toward lifting economic
sanctions. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was right to warn
promptly that Washington will hold up any review of Iraq's status
until Baghdad honors its pledge of unhindered access for the
weapons investigators. The surprise inspections that began Tuesday,
in which U.N. specialists look for hidden materials and records
with little advance notification, are particularly important.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is seeking a review not only of arms issues but also its
record in other areas, like returning Kuwaiti prisoners and
property. Baghdad is hoping for some recognition of overall
progress and a narrowing of the requirements to win relief from
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The country has done little to merit a favorable report. Its
record on arms, as reported in October by the U.N. inspection
chief, Richard Butler, is poor to mixed. There are large gaps in
Iraq's ability to account for the supplies of VX nerve gas, anthrax
bacteria and botulinum toxin it was known to possess before the
Persian Gulf War. On non-weapons issues, Iraq has done even less to
meet obligations that were supposed to have been fulfilled more
than seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident was perfectly consistent with Saddam
Hussein's seven-year record of obstruction. Iraq has permitted
routine inspections since the most recent crisis eased last month,
but it has rebuffed requests for relevant documents and now looks
to limit surprise visits.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam never ceases to hunt for ways to divide the Security
Council in hopes that he can limit inspections while winning relief
from sanctions. The two goals are incompatible. The only route to
lifting sanctions is full cooperation with inspections. &QL;

SHORT NOTES ON PUBLIC PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JAMES BARRON  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One will that will not be found on the Web site created by
HERBERT E. NASS _ www.willsofrichandfamous.com _ is that of the
director Alan J. Pakula, who died in a freak accident on the Long
Island Expressway last month.
</P>
<P>
   The reason has to do with ethics. Nass, a probate lawyer who
wrote a book called ``Wills of the Rich and Famous'' (Warner,
1991), has clients like Pakula and the artist Roy Lichtenstein, who
are, well, rich and famous. ``I feel uncomfortable putting their
particular wills on my Web site, even though wills are public
record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has more than 100 wills Nass did not handle,
including those of Truman Capote, Thomas Jefferson and Alfred
Hitchcock. As for Pakula, his will, filed in Surrogate's Court in
Manhattan, left his estate of more than $500,000 to his widow,
HANNAH PAKULA. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of talk about hand holding on Tuesday at Central
Synagogue's service of appreciation for firefighters, police
officers and city officials who helped fight the blaze that scarred
the twin-towered landmark on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI praised RABBI PETER RUBINSTEIN for
``accomplishing what I thought no religious leader in this city
could accomplish: getting me to hold hands with MARK GREEN.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was referring to a moment on the night of the fire,
when several city officials joined hands while Rubinstein led a
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' the mayor said at the Tuesday service. ``It
won't become a habit.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rubinstein praised city officials, including
JEROME HAUER, the director of the mayor's office of emergency
management, ``who really held our hand for a long time.'' This,
apparently, was metaphorical hand holding. ``I don't remember
whether he was in there'' for the Aug. 30 prayer, Rubinstein said
Wednesday. ``He was so busy directing things outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the reconstruction of the synagogue is completed in 2000,
the congregation will be ``nomadic,'' scheduling many services in
other large places of worship or auditoriums. The one on Tuesday,
for example, was at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, on 55th
Street. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, Anonymous vs. Anonymous _ the custody trial in which
the billionaire RONALD O. PERELMAN is squaring off against his
third wife, PATRICIA DUFF _ was back on the docket in JUSTICE
EILEEN BRANSTEN's courtroom Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Bransten summoned the couple after Perelman lost his bid
to have the trial delayed while his appeal of a five-day-old
appellate division ruling was being argued. Perelman had wanted the
custody proceedings closed to the public; the appellate division
ruled last Friday that they must be open. Wednesday, JUSTICE JOSEPH
SULLIVAN of the appellate division refused Perelman's request to
halt the trial until the appellate division has ruled on other,
related issues.
</P>
<P>
   So Judge Bransten began hearing testimony. ``We put on a
court-appointed security expert,'' said one of Perelman's lawyers,
ADRIA HILLMAN. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after the Surgeon General warned that smoking
was hazardous to one's health and three years after New York City
adopted antismoking regulations for restaurants, a cigarette bar
has opened in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1,400 restaurants in this city that exclude
smokers,'' said BRIAN MICHELS, the owner of Circa Tabac, at 32
Watts Street. He stocks more than 100 brands of cigarettes,
including some that go for $8 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air in here will be cleaner than the air outside,'' he
said. ``We've invested in an air purification system like the one
they have on the Space Shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it does the job. ``I expected to leave reeking'' of
cigarette smoke,'' said LAURIE ABRAHAM, the health editor of
Mirabella and a hostess of a party at Circa Tabac on Monday. ``I
was really surprised because I left there and my hair didn't
smell.''

 &HT;    COURT BLOCKS TWO TEXAS EXECUTIONS
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Austin federal judge on Wednesday blocked the scheduled
executions of convicted killers Joseph Stanley Faulder and Danny
Lee Barber, raising new legal questions about the secretive process
by which Texas considers clemency for its condemned criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
refused to overturn the delay of Barber's execution ordered by U.S.
District Judge Sam Sparks, prison officials moved him from the
``Death House,'' a building in a downtown Huntsville prison that
houses the execution chamber, back to death row at the Ellis prison
unit just outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said the New Orleans-based appeals court
indicated it would decide today whether to let Faulder's execution,
scheduled just after 6 p.m. today, also be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they were unsure what effect Wednesday's
rulings might have on other pending executions. But they agreed the
development marked a new and possibly ominous turn for Texas'
long-controversial clemency system, which has survived several
similar legal challenges in past months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action affects two cases right now _ and that's all,''
said Glen Castlebury, a prison system spokesman in Huntsville.
``We'll await further word from the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen Texas convicts have been executed so far this year, two
so far this month. One other execution is scheduled in December,
and four are set in January. Since it reinstated the death penalty
in 1982, Texas has executed 162 men and one woman _ a record _ and
has 451 prisoners awaiting execution.
</P>
<P>
   Spark's order came less than an hour before Barber was to be
executed at a Huntsville prison for killing a Balch Springs woman
in a 1979 robbery. Faulder, a Canadian national, was to be put to
death today for killing a Gladewater widow in a 1975 robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the state Board of Pardons and Paroles had
vetoed clemency requests for both convicts _ fueling a growing
storm of international protest in Faulder's case.
</P>
<P>
   In a seven-page order signed at mid-afternoon, Sparks ruled
there are enough questions about Texas' clemency process to warrant
a Dec. 21 hearing and determine whether Faulder received the proper
legal review of his request to have his death sentence commuted to
a lesser penalty.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:10 p.m., he signed a similar delay for Barber based on the
delay he granted Faulder. He set a Dec. 22 hearing in that case.
Earlier this year, Sparks refused to halt the execution of Karla
Faye Tucker _ the first woman executed by Texas since the Civil War
_ over the same questions about Texas' clemency process. Other
execution-bound convicts also have tried to delay their deaths with
similar filings, all without success.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in an Ohio case could
change that, Sparks noted in his order. That ruling questioned
whether unspecified ``minimal procedural safeguards'' might be
required in clemency proceedings to guard against arbitrary
decisions, a process that remains unclear in Texas because state
officials have refused to detail how they review and decide
clemency cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unclear how the (Board of Pardons and Paroles) can
document that its procedures are not arbitrary if it does not
document its procedures at all,'' Sparks' order in Faulder's case
states.
</P>
<P>
   At another point in his order, Sparks quoted from the Supreme
Court ruling: ``Judicial intervention might, for example, be
warranted in the face of a scheme whereby a state official flipped
a coin to determine whether to grant clemency, or in a case where
the state arbitrarily denied a prisoner any access to its clemency
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Babcock, a Minneapolis lawyer representing Faulder, could
not be reached for comment about Sparks' order. But Maurie Levin,
an Austin attorney handling a separate civil-court appeal on
Faulder's behalf, said his legal team was encouraged by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Parole Board Chairman Victor Rodriguez said he remained
confident the clemency system will survive the legal test. ``We
believe we operate properly and constitutionally, with adequate due
process,'' he said. Barber, 43, a onetime roofer from California,
was sentenced to death by lethal injection for the October 1979
slaying of Janice Louise Ingram of Balch Springs, just east of
Dallas. Police said she was beaten to death with a piece of pipe,
then stabbed in the throat, by an intruder who she surprised
burglarizing her home.
</P>
<P>
   Barber also is serving life sentences for three other murders
and a 20-year-sentence for a Dallas burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, 61, was convicted of the July 1975 murder of Inez
Phillips, the matriarch of a wealthy Texas oil family who was
fatally stabbed during a robbery at her East Texas home. Beaten
with a blackjack when she resisted, then gagged and bound with
tape, police said a maid found Phillips' body with a knife imbedded
in her chest.
</P>
<P>
   If executed as scheduled just after 6 p.m. Thursday, Faulder
would be the first Canadian put to death in the United States since
1952.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's chain of events began at 8 a.m. when the 18-member
parole board voted against commuting the death sentences of either
Barber and Faulder to lesser terms. Without comment, it also vetoed
their requests for a 30-day reprieve. The recommendations were
forwarded to Gov. George Bush, who was left only with the option of
delaying each case 30 days. At a Capitol press conference a few
hours later, Bush gave no indication he planned to delay either
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a two-hour delay, then cancellation, of Barber's
execution, relatives of his victims expressed anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so stunned,'' said a sobbing Lisa Turner, Ingram's niece,
who was to have watched Barber's execution. ``When are we going to
have another chance? The courts are going to have to get off their
butts and do what's right for the families of who he killed. It's
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's right,'' cried Ruth Rae Clowers, another
niece. ``They bring us down here, we lose a day's pay of work and
they don't execute him. Why should he have rights? I feel awful.''

WELFARE REFORM IN TEXAS SHOWS SOME PROGRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the first major snapshot of Texas welfare
reform, a new survey shows more than half of those weaned from cash
payments are working nearly full-time and earning more than minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more government supports are needed _ transitional benefits,
high school equivalency diplomas, expanded child care _ to ensure
the goal of permanent self-sufficiency, said DHS Commissioner Eric
M. Bost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come into our offices, it is no longer what can we
do to help put you on welfare. Our focus is what can we do to help
you get a job to stay off welfare,'' Bost said.
</P>
<P>
   Findings of the survey, conducted by Texas A&AMP;M University and
the Texas Department of Human Services, are based on responses of
1,396 individuals or 51 percent of those contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Questions explored what is actually happening to those who leave
welfare or are directed away from it before they apply for
assistance. Bost said the results could help state legislators
strengthen the system when they reconvene in January.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol news conference Wednesday, Gov. George W. Bush
touted the survey as evidence welfare-to-work programs and
faith-based support systems are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas now recognizes it is more compassionate to help people
find a job than it is to make them dependent upon government.
Welfare reform is working in Texas,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that 100,000 families have left welfare rolls
since the state enacted reforms four years ago. Another 146,000
still receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, roughly $188
monthly for a mother and two children.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey shows 55 percent of those who either left
welfare or were diverted from applying were working at the time
they were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   They averaged 34 hours of work a week and hourly pay of $6.28 an
hour, higher than the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The most common jobs included restaurants/fast food (15
percent), clerical (13 percent), retail and sales (13 percent),
nursing (12 percent) and janitorial (6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always asked if 45 percent of the people in the survey
were not working, what are they doing? How are they existing?''
Bost said. He added that half of those said they are supported by
relatives while only 10 percent to 11 percent said they need help
from food banks or other charitable services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not indicate to us that there is a significant number
of people out there who are seeking assistance from food banks or
are homeless as a result of welfare reform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most common items cited when asked about needs in getting
work were a high-school equivalency diploma, work clothes, reliable
transportation, child care, health care, education and training to
improve job skills.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bresette, an analyst at the Center for Public Policy
Priorities in Austin, questioned why respondents were not asked
about hassles they might have in dealing with DHS and the Texas
Workforce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is so dramatic in getting them off the
benefits,'' he said. ``It would have been useful to ask about
clients' experience with the system in the current environment. Are
they being offered the opportunities to get a GED or get some
training so that job isn't $6.28 an hour but $8.28?''
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings of the survey, taken between December 1997
and May 1998, reveal:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirteen percent reported being employed at some point during
the six-month survey even though they were not currently working.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-one percent said their jobs offered advancement
opportunities, while 26 percent reported receiving a raise and 40
percent had jobs with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixty-six percent received food stamps; 70 percent continued
on Medicaid; 37 percent got the supplemental nutrition through the
Women, Infants and Children program; and 15 percent lived in public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-two percent had a mentor who inspired or motivated
them.
</P>
<P>
   Bost said more in-depth studies are planned with larger samples
in order to detect problems that cause former welfare mothers to
cycle back onto assistance. The next study will also ask how
children formerly on welfare are faring if their families are
doubling up with others in crowded living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, University of Texas anthropologist and author Laura
Lein said Wednesday that she is launching a nine-month study to
closely follow the personal experiences of selected families who
tend to fall off and on the welfare rolls. Lein is the co-author of
a book that explored the real-life budgets of welfare mothers and
how they supplement benefits to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Bresette and Lein said it is important for people leaving TANF
rolls to continue receiving support from Medicaid, food stamps and
child care assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The following over time is going to be critical,'' Bresette
said of the state's efforts. ``In a snapshot like this you could
argue that this is not that different than welfare recipients in
Texas have behaved in the past. Our grant is so low, work is a
better deal. Many of the clients use TANF as unemployment
assistance of sorts.''

DISSIDENT FROM SHANGHAI ARRIVES IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Chinese dissident fleeing a new round of arrests of
democracy activists in Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and
announced that he and other opponents of the Chinese government
plan a demonstration Thursday at the United Nations to protest the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who was released in April from a
Chinese labor camp, is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which
was formed in June during President Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter at Kennedy International
Airport, Yao, 44, said little about why he had left Shanghai,
except that he and his younger brother, Yao Zhenxiang, 38, had been
sent to a labor camp in 1996 on a ``trumped-up charge'' of
publishing pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Yao, who is also a prominent figure in the China
Democracy Party, is scheduled for release in April.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and
sympathizers of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang
Youcai, is to go on trial Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly,'' Yao
said at the airport, referring to his party. Washington gave Yao a
special visa, which expires in February.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wang Bingzhang, 50, an adviser to the overseas committee of
the party, said later that Yao had left China for personal and
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scared all the time,'' he said, referring to Yao's
wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family had a terrible life, especially the daughter.
Secret agents followed them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The family trading business, which was 12 years old, was
shuttered by the government in 1996, said Wang, a former surgeon in
Beijing, ``so they had no way of living.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after Yao made organizational trips to several
provinces, democracy activists urged him to go abroad, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted him to tell the truth about what is really
happening in China and to call on the whole world to pay
attention,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights
in China, a New York-based group, said the China Democracy Party
was a growing presence in some of China's most populous provinces,
including Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their most vocal leaders have all recently been
detained,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laroche said the Yao brothers, especially the younger man,
won prominence by helping to finance predecessors of the China
Democracy Party with money from the family business before it was
closed by the government.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MELBOURNE, Australia _ You've heard of made-for-TV sporting events.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What you may not have heard is the Presidents Cup that begins
today is a made-for-Greg Norman event, especially when it takes
place in his backyard at Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Which would be
fine if this were any other year in Norman's life and his golf game
was in its usual, faultless groove.
</P>
<P>
   But after seven inactive months to rehabilitate his surgically
repaired left shoulder, and only one month of swinging a golf club
in preparation for this week, Norman admits this may not be the
best timing for him to put on a heroic show for the home folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can ever knock the rust completely off in
this game, to tell you the truth,'' Norman said. ``One thing that
is great about this game is that the day you think you're swinging
great, you can get humbled the next day. Like when I play with
Steve (Elkington), he sees there might be something I am missing
(in my game) because we play so much golf together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that because of the layoff? Possibly, yes. Is that because
I haven't played enough tournament golf lately? Possibly, yes. To
say I might be a little rusty? Yeah, I might be a little rusty. But
I'm ready to go. I'm not worried about the rust being there.''
</P>
<P>
   But his doctor is. Norman said he has been communicating with
his medical advisers on a regular basis and that they are not
pleased about how much golf he has played in the early portion of
his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very concerned that I've played too much golf to this
moment,'' Norman said. ``I haven't had a day off in over two weeks
now, and he's very concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants me to sit back and re-evaluate things on Sunday
night. He'd like to see me stop playing for six weeks after Sunday
and just let my shoulder get strong again.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't exactly sound like the prescription for a Norman
domination this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman knows this is his party. He was the loudest voice in
getting the PGA Tour to bring the Presidents Cup away from America
for the first time. And whether he's rusty or tweaking his swing or
whatever, he has to be ready to be the anchor for the international
team that will try to wrest the Cup away from the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   It is a match that brings together 24 of the world's greatest
golfers, even if some of them might not be household names. There's
Paraguay's Carlos Franco, who lived in a one-room shack in Asuncion
until he was 14 and occasionally putts with his driver when his
traditional flatstick is more of a flatsick. There's Shigeki
Maruyama, who is funnier speaking Japanese than most American
golfers are speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the big boys like Fred Couples, Ernie Els, Tiger
Woods, David Duval, Elkington and Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody is a bigger heavyweight this weekend than Norman. He
is a legend in Australia. And before his shoulder surgery, his game
was as strong as anybody's in the world and he was atop the global
rankings because of it.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 22, he had bone spurs that caused tendinitis shaved
out of his shoulder. He didn't hit a golf ball again until Sept. 4.
That 4{-month layoff provided Norman with the chance to spend more
time with his family than ever before. They did what families do in
the summertime _ take vacations and do other things together.
</P>
<P>
   Norman returned to competitive play at his Shark Shootout, which
he won with Elkington. But even Norman admits Elkington carried the
brunt of the load.
</P>
<P>
   In his first four-day tournament since the surgery, Norman
barely made the cut at the Australian Open last week. He had a
second-round 82 and finished far out of contention against a modest
field.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as Elkington said, Norman will be thrust into a tough
position _ even for a player with a well-tuned game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are never really playing under any big pressure at
this time of year, and this is a big-pressure event,'' Elkington
said. ``I don't think we're going to catch them off-guard. They
probably have the greatest team they could ever get together. They
have such a strong team that we'll have to play very well to keep
up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Norman said, confidence is at an all-time high for the
international squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rate it (his team's chance of winning) very highly,'' Norman
said. ``We have an extremely good balance to the team. We've got
guys who fit together well. And that's why I think from my
perspective and from hearing the players talk, I rate our chances
very, very highly.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Elkington: ``This is the best team we have had out of the
three (Presidents Cup) teams. And we only got beat by a point (in
'96) on their soil. We feel like our team is maybe a little
stronger this year, and we are playing on our home soil. We're
pretty pleased with our team, and we feel pretty confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he likes to think of it as a team effort, it was Norman
more than anybody else who coaxed PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem
and other golf honchos to stage the third Presidents Cup in a
country other than the U.S. The clincher in moving it to Royal
Melbourne came in the hours right after Fred Couples' dramatic
30-foot putt clinched the Cup in '96 for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times like that Sunday evening two years ago, in our villa
there, those are the things that last forever in a player's mind
and in Tim Finchem's mind, because very seldom do you get a chance
to express yourself the way we expressed ourselves then,'' Norman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes like this: After Couples' putt doomed the
international team, the players congregated in a room adjacent to
the course. For more than an hour, they drank beers together and
talked about what had just transpired. It was an outpouring of
emotion that swayed Finchem to send the Presidents Cup to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done so well in that match, even though we lost by a
whisker,'' international captain Peter Thomson said. ``Something
was proved, that this was a team with some power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the end of the week, and we had done so well, and
somebody started the speech-making and then everybody wanted to
have a go. So as the beer flowed, I think we got very emotional. I
think they wanted to play the next week and reverse the result.''
</P>
<P>
   That Finchem was in the room made the moment all the more
spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty emotional, with stuff said from the heart,''
Elkington said. ``Finchem was there, and we told him that we didn't
know if we could all get together and play this one more time in
America, because if this was going to grow as an event, you have to
play it away from America sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, here they are, 23 of the world's greatest golfers and
one guy who is expected to be the brightest star of them all,
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only his shoulder will let him be the life of the party
for the international side.

YONKERS SLOWLY ADJUSTS TO HOUSING DESEGREGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ To assess the impact of this city's efforts to
comply with a court order to desegregate white and minority
neighborhoods, the poor and the not-so-poor, consider the lives of
Darnelle Burns and Jonathan Iacovino.
</P>
<P>
   Darnelle and Jonathan are 12-year-old boys who live around the
block from each other, Darnelle in a low-income housing development
on Clark Street, Jonathan in a sturdy two-family brick house on
Belmont Avenue. Darnelle, who is black, calls Jonathan, who is
white, his best friend. And Jonathan, who, like Darnelle, idolizes
Michael Jordan and relishes video games, says that in his eyes,
``it doesn't matter what color you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Their families, though, have never met.
</P>
<P>
   Darnelle's grandmother, Mildred Logan, who has raised the big,
boisterous youth since infancy, moved to Clark Street in 1994,
hopeful that Darnelle might thrive in a roomier, safer environment.
But she knows that some white neighbors are just not comfortable
with racial and ethnic minorities. And although Louis Iacovino,
Jonathan's gregarious father, says that he has no problems with any
of his new neighbors on a personal level, he also contends that the
Clark Street development has enervated the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give them credit: They're very decent, and I've
got no complaints,'' said Iacovino, a 31-year-old businessman who
is contemplating moving his family to Mahopac. ``But my personal
opinion is that they should put the housing all in one area. It's
tough on property values, you know? Once people hear the words
`low-income housing,' forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy around the corner? He's trying to sell his house. And
one time, these people who were interested drove around the
neighborhood, spotted that housing, and they never called back.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after a U.S. District Court judge ordered Yonkers
to desegregate, many city residents are still struggling to
accustom themselves to the sight of new neighbors in old
neighborhoods _ slowly, warily and with mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But if most of these neighbors are not exactly swapping recipes,
they do seem to be co-existing peacefully, according to interviews
in recent days with more than three dozen residents and city
officials.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of serious problems flaring up in any
of the neighborhoods where integration has become a part of
day-to-day life. There have been no complaints, even, from some of
the most ardent opponents of integration, who now say that the
effect of the housing has not been as bad as they had feared.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that has long been convulsed by such a controversial,
explosive issue, that is no small achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's reached a point where people are now tired by the
issue, and I think people have moved on,'' said Kevin Condon, a
former City Councilman who often tried to bridge the dueling sides.
``I think that wouldn't have been possible if people's worst fears
about the housing had turned out to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   What may also have helped douse emotions is that Yonkers is a
more diverse city now than it was in 1980, when the desegregation
battle first exploded. With growing numbers of black, Asian and
Hispanic residents, parts of the city have become more naturally
integrated, Mayor John Spencer said. ``I've seen neighborhoods look
different from just driving around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Spencer and other officials breathed a sigh of relief
last week when New York state agreed to pay $16.4 million to help
the city build new housing and buy existing homes in predominantly
white neighborhoods for middle-income families who are
predominantly black and Hispanic. City officials say they hope the
settlement will end a protracted battle that has saturated every
aspect of life here, from education to real estate, from politics
to neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1980, when the Justice Department and the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a
discrimination lawsuit against the city, charging that Yonkers had
contributed to decades of segregated housing and schooling patterns
by restricting public and subsidized housing to the city's
southwestern quadrant. Five years later, Judge Leonard Sand of U.S
District Court in Manhattan ruled in favor of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Sand ordered the city to provide sites for 200 rental
units of public housing for low-income families and, later, 800
units of subsidized housing for middle-income families, outside of
the predominantly minority southwest section. But the City Council
defied those orders with such disdain that the judge imposed fines
against the city that reached $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rare was the Council meeting at which people did not engage in
shouting matches, or affix bumper stickers in protest to their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very poisonous,'' said Spencer, mayor of Yonkers since
January 1996. ``All intellect went out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   A few things helped to smooth things out, though. In 1992, the
city revamped its government, giving more power to the mayor at the
expense of an often-fractious City Council. Four years later, city
officials persuaded the federal government to give Yonkers more
local control over the housing program. And following Sand's ruling
in February that the state was also responsible for Yonkers'
segregated past, the state agreed last week to contribute $16.4
million to finish the housing program.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, city officials had relented and complied with the
judge's order to build the 200 units. Colonial in style, and
discreet by design, the units were spread across seven sites
throughout the city. By 1996, the city had come up with a plan to
accommodate the 800 middle-income families: building four new
developments totaling 140 or so units and assisting the other
people with buying houses in existing neighborhoods. The first of
those four developments is scheduled to break ground soon.
</P>
<P>
   Those milestones, city officials liked to say, proved that
Yonkers was not the cesspool of racism and hatred that others had
painted it as being.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, Yonkers was the laughingstock of the country
because they looked like the most racist city in the Northeast,''
said Robert Crain, a professor of sociology and education at
Teachers College of Columbia University who has researched Yonkers'
desegregation efforts. ``But it wasn't. It was really no different
from any other suburban community in New York or New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Spivey was one of the first to move into one of the
low-income complexes, the Lawrence Christopher Townhouses on
Midland Avenue, in the shadow of Tibbetts Brook Park. She had moved
into her $500-a-month, two-bedroom town house from a housing
project in search of a better and quieter life for herself and her
daughter, Diane. It wasn't easy, at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there was a little prejudice,'' said Ms. Spivey, a
70-year-old black woman retired from a job at the city's Board of
Education. ``People passing by, they'd call you names. The
neighbors, they were a little bit leery, because they didn't know
who we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Pagano, a retired 78-year-old carpenter who has lived on
Midland Avenue for 14 years, was one of those neighbors who
vigorously opposed the idea of low-income housing. But now that
some time has passed, he has changed his mind _ as have most other
people in the neighborhood, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical at first,'' Pagano said, examining a Christmas
display on his front lawn. ``We figured it was being shoved down
our throats. But we've had no problems, and we say hi to them. We
talk about family and kids, sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the low-income town houses on Clark Street, near Yonkers
Raceway, Yvonne Dixon also recalls encountering hostility at first.
Before she had even moved into her two-story town house six years
ago with her husband and three children, neighbors were putting
their houses up for sale, alarmed at the news that minority tenants
were moving nearby.
</P>
<P>
   These days, a gulf of unfamiliarity still exists. Mrs. Dixon has
never thought about asking her neighbors to baby-sit for her
children; she has never, she recalls, been inside any of their
houses. But the fact is, she never expected much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fine, everything is peaceful,'' Mrs. Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the people who bitterly opposed Sand's rulings, there
is the feeling that the low-income housing units have worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think it's been pretty successful,'' said Jack
O'Toole, former president of the Save Yonkers Federation, a group
opposed to the desegregation order. ``I don't think there's as much
crime or antisocial behavior as we expected.'' In fact, serious
crimes in Yonkers dropped 24.7 percent from 1980 to 1997, in line
with national trends.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-housing remedy, though, has its share of detractors,
in particular the NAACP. Under the city's plan, families earning
less than 50 percent of the Westchester median income can get as
much as $40,000 in grants to help them buy a house. So far, 170
families have received assistance through this program,
three-quarters of them members of minorities, with most of the
people making about $45,000 to $50,000 a year, said Raymond
Fitzpatrick Jr., a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer who has represented
Yonkers in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, it is a program, city officials repeatedly
say, that is intended to foster economic, not racial, integration.
``These are middle-class, working, mortgage-qualified human beings
of all shapes, sizes and colors,'' Spencer said. ``What is wrong
with that?''
</P>
<P>
   What is wrong, according to the NAACP, is that the city has
drifted from the original intent of the lawsuit _ providing
assistance to low-income minority families _ and has cloaked the
issue of desegregation in the innocuous language of economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast number of beneficiaries are not the people whose
rights it was determined were violated,'' said Michael Sussman, a
lawyer for the NAACP. ``We have to start telling the truth about
this, and not sugarcoat it for the white community.''

CADENCE TO ACQUIRE QUICKTURN DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Playing the white knight, Cadence Design Systems
Inc. agreed Wednesday to acquire Quickturn Design Systems Inc.,
which has been the subject of a hostile takeover bid by the Mentor
Graphics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence said it would swap stock worth $14 a share, a total of
$253 million, for Quickturn. Mentor had bid $12.13 a share in cash,
but its offer was rebuffed by Quickturn, which has been battling
the deal in the Delaware courts. Mentor said Wednesday that it was
reviewing its options in light of the competing offer.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence's shares closed at $29.1875, down 81.25 cents on the New
York Stock Exchange. Quickturn's shares closed at $13.8125, up
$1.625, and Mentor's shares at $8.75, down $1.25, both in NASDAQ
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence, based in San Jose, Calif., and Mentor, based in
Wilsonville, Ore., are bitter rivals in the market for the
electronic automated design software used to fashion new chips.
</P>
<P>
   Quickturn is a leader in the related market for specialized
computers that can emulate a new chip design before it is crafted
in silicon, providing a kind of virtual verification that the
circuitry will work as intended.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor acquired a small French company with an emulation and
verification product last year, but cannot market it in the United
States because of a court order stemming from a patent-infringement
suit by Quickturn. That suit comes to trial in Oregon in February.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor originally proposed the merger as a friendly deal that
could put an end to the litigation, but the offer was spurned by
Keith R. Lobo, Quickturn's president and chief executive.

   HARTFORD _ New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, grilled for
hours by legislators Wednesday, defended the widely publicized plan
to move the football team here but privately said he would agree to
changes in the $350 million proposal to make it more palatable for
legislators and taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the marathon hearing before the General Assembly ended
late last night, Kraft and state negotiators were already tinkering
with the agreement, looking for a graceful way to lessen
controversial luxury seat guarantees that could cost taxpayers as
much as $17.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Those guarantees, agreed to in a memorandum of understanding
signed last month between Kraft and Governor John Rowland, would
make up the difference if the team was unable to sell all of the
expensive club seats and corporate boxes in the stadium Connecticut
proposes to build.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the deal said the team was willing to make
concessions that would lower the state's potential liability, but
nothing so drastic that it would endanger the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While no one would say just how the outline could change,
discussions were expected to continue almost around the clock until
the exact language is agreed upon and a final bill is ready for
state legislators. A special session vote is scheduled for Tuesday.
The legislation, if approved, will amount to a binding contract to
move the team here from Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're negotiating a host of things _ the guarantee, the exit
fee ...'' said House Majority Leader Moira Lyons, a Stamford
Democrat, referring to penalties Kraft would pay if the team left
the state before the 30-year lease concludes. She said she did not
know how the guarantee would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Others familiar with the negotiations said the legislation could
be written without a specific stadium site in mind, in the event
the current proposed location, on which a steam plant now sits, is
deemed to have overwhelming environmental problems that would
prohibit construction. The bill would also authorize the state to
borrow more than is needed to cover the stadium costs, perhaps $407
million in all, to cover infrastructure and part of a proposed
convention center, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, looking nervous as he took the hot seat in the largest
hearing room available at the state Capitol, answered lawmakers'
questions on just about every aspect of the project.
</P>
<P>
   While he tried to allay fears about environmental costs, luxury
seating guarantees, and how a maintenance slush fund will be used,
Capitol police tried to dispel another potential problem: About 75
labor protesters chanting ``What do you want? Good jobs. When do
you want them? Now.'' The group was quickly diverted out of the
Legislative Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also passed out slices of cheese before the hearing
to symbolize other human service needs in the state, but Kraft kept
his composure throughout the ordeal, which was reasonably tame _
certainly not as rowdy as a community meeting in South Boston where
Kraft unsuccessfully tied to sell a stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing Wednesday, few lawmakers said they opposed
the plan to move the team to a site along the Connecticut River
here by 2001, although many voiced skepticism over the benefits of
luring an NFL franchise and the total pricetag.
</P>
<P>
   Even the state representative from the neighborhood within
walking distance of the proposed stadium site seemed contented by a
promise from Kraft's son, Jonathan, that the team would rely on
local small-business owners for stadium operations and Robert
Kraft's assertion that property values around the facility will not
go down.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Evelyn Mantilla, a Hartford Democrat, later said
she wanted a 30 percent job guarantee for people in the
neighborhood that abuts the site. She said she is also worried
about displacement, traffic, noise, and air pollution resulting
from the stadium and she hoped the team would tell her what she
wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed to the Patriots coming to Hartford,'' Mantilla
said. ``I'm concerned because none of my questions have been
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft, who also testified, said he was not discouraged
by the tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were treated in a warm way,'' the younger Kraft said. ``...
People were open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any changes in the agreement signed last month, the
younger Kraft said: ``We would expect it to materially embody'' the
original language. ``If we were going to negotiate, we certainly
wouldn't do it in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   But sources said both sides were finding room to negotiate parts
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who secretly negotiated the deal with Kraft, was the
first to testify, spinning figures and pitching the plan as the
only option for revitalizing Hartford, a city that exudes poverty
just beyond its clean and corporate downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote on Tuesday is not about them,'' Rowland said,
referring to the Krafts and their team. ``This vote on Tuesday is
about us. It's about Hartford, it's about Connecticut, a vision for
the future of our entire community. ... The alternative is to lay
dormant.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that $650 million in public funds was spent
revitalizing Bridgeport, one of the poorest cities in the nation,
by doing things such as luring a minor-league baseball team there.
</P>
<P>
   He also apologized for the secretive and hasty process that led
to last month's dramatic announcement that he had struck a deal to
lure the team away from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who met privately with legislators for several hours
before the hearing, was the second witness who appeared and he
spent nearly 90 minutes emphasizing three points: That the 10
percent tax on stadium revenue that will help pay for the stadium
was the equivalent of an $8 million annual lease payment that will
grow over time; that the team is paying for the operational costs
of the stadium, something he said is unusual in publicly financed
deals; and that the team is being generous in its commitment to
develop the University of Connecticut football team, which will
also play in the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal has been portrayed as a sweetheart deal,'' Kraft
said. ``I don't want to do a deal that isn't a good deal both ways.
... We are committing to spending $70 million of our capital for a
hotel, and an NFL retail and virtual reality development. These two
projects will only succeed if the Adriaen's Landing project
succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Adriaen's Landing is a $1 billion project that would include the
stadium, possibly a convention center, housing, retail stores, and
entertainment along the river.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft also said he was not approaching the deal as a cold,
bottom-line-fixated businessman. If he were, he said, he could have
sold the franchise to Los Angeles or Houston and made more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go to L.A. We're not going to Houston. Our
family will not move this team out of New England ... and we want
to be able to compete with the other stadiums in the NFL,'' Kraft
said.
</P>
<P>
   The seat guarantees, he said, ``force us to work together very
closely to make this a successful project and we want to feel the
private capital investment we're making in this project will
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft received polite applause before he left the hearing, hours
before the public was allowed to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the citizen commentary _ the strongest of the day _
focused on union jobs, worries about increased property taxes, the
environment, traffic, and the secrecy of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Panzarella, a part-time musician, drove up from New Haven
to voice his opposition, and waited in an anteroom to put in his
two cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the biggest boondoggle and waste of a half
billion dollars the Legislature can come up with,'' he said. ``But
I think it's a done deal.''

   HARTFORD _ New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, grilled for
hours by legislators Wednesday, defended the widely publicized plan
to move the football team here but privately said he would agree to
changes in the $350 million proposal to make it more palatable for
legislators and taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the marathon hearing before the General Assembly ended
late last night, Kraft and state negotiators were already tinkering
with the agreement, looking for a graceful way to lessen
controversial luxury seat guarantees that could cost taxpayers as
much as $17.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Those guarantees, agreed to in a memorandum of understanding
signed last month between Kraft and Governor John Rowland, would
make up the difference if the team was unable to sell all of the
expensive club seats and corporate boxes in the stadium Connecticut
proposes to build.

<P>
   Extreme summer heat and humidity of the kind most threatening to
health have become more frequent in the United States over the last
half century, two federal researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   According to their study, in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature, the frequency of extremely hot, humid days and of heat
waves lasting several days increased substantially from 1949 to
1995. In terms of the threat to health, however, another finding
was especially significant: The increase in heat stress was greater
at night than in the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that extremely high temperature and humidity
over successive nights is a crucial factor in heat-related deaths.
When nearly 600 people died in a heat wave in Chicago in 1995, for
example, many of the deaths were attributed to an unremitting
combination of record high nighttime heat and humidity that allowed
no respite from daytime heat stress.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have shown that extreme summer heat has more impact
on people's health than any other kind of severe weather, and that
the elderly are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these climate trends continue, they may pose a public
health problem, particularly as there are increasing numbers of
elderly people,'' wrote the authors of the study, Dr. Dian Gaffen
and Rebecca Ross, research meteorologists at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory in Silver
Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent trend toward more extreme heat generally coincides
with a warming of the Earth's surface in recent decades, both
globally and in the United States. The dominant view among
scientists is that at least some of this warming has been caused by
emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, which is
emitted by the burning of coal, oil, natural gas and wood. The
Earth's average surface temperature, which has risen 1 degree
Fahrenheit in the last century, is projected to rise 2 to 6 degrees
over the next century, further increasing humidity and making heat
waves more frequent and intense. By comparison, surface temperature
has risen 5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit since the depth of the ice age
18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the increasing frequency of extreme heat and humidity
cannot be directly linked to the warming trend, Dr. Gaffen said it
was ``consistent with what is predicted in the global warming
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center,
agreed. ``I think these are the types of conditions that will
become more frequent and more intense when they do occur'' if the
climate warms as projected, Karl said. ``We've already seen
examples of that this past year,'' he added, referring to last
summer's heat wave in Texas. The projected increases in global
temperatures, he said, ``would make this rather commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, Karl said, the Gaffen-Ross findings ``seem to be
consistent with what we know from other analyses.'' He said that if
data through 1998 were included in the study, ``I'm sure they would
find even stronger trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the last two years have been the two warmest on
record.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross had for some time been studying global
distributions of temperature and water vapor, and they found an
increasing trend of rising humidity accompanying rising
temperatures. So, Dr. Gaffen said, they decided to see whether this
meant that extremes of heat and humidity were also increasing.
</P>
<P>
   They defined ``extreme'' as the highest 15 percent of
temperature and humidity measurements, as recorded every three
hours around the clock in July and August from 1961 through 1990.
This threshold, they report, is ``closely correlated'' with levels
above which, according to other researchers, human mortality
increases sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross analyzed records at 113 government
weather stations around the country, mainly at airports, in search
of information on two variables: the combination of temperature and
humidity that meteorologists call ``apparent temperature,'' and
temperature alone.
</P>
<P>
   Apparent temperature is a measure of the combined impact of heat
and humidity on people and the sensation that results. It is
increasing faster than temperature alone, the researchers said,
because humidity is increasing faster. This would be expected in a
warmer climate, since more water evaporates and the atmosphere can
hold more.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers computed their thresholds of extremity for the
average daily temperature, the daily maximum temperature and the
daily minimum temperature for July and August at each weather
station. They found that from 1949 to 1995, the annual frequency of
days on which the thresholds were surpassed increased at all but 16
of the 113 stations. The increases were largest for the minimum
``apparent temperature,'' which basically translates to a measure
of combined nighttime heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   At some stations, Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross found that over the
half century, the number of nights with extremely high apparent
temperatures doubled, to about 18 days a year from about 9 days a
year in some places. The largest and statistically most significant
trends were found to occur in some of the nation's most populated
areas, especially from the Middle Atlantic States south to Florida,
as well as along the West Coast and in big cities in the Southwest.
Eight of the 15 cities in which the trend was most pronounced were
in the Southeast _ including Miami, which headed the list
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Daytime increases were found to be not nearly as dramatic. In
fact, the upward trend was statistically significant only west of
the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   East of the Rockies, the apparent temperature increased more
than temperature alone. West of the Rockies, where summertime
humidity increases are less marked, the trends of the two variables
were similar.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators defined heat waves as periods of three or four
days in which the average daily apparent temperature exceeded the
top 15 percent threshold. On average, they found, each weather
station experiences 1.7 three-day heat waves and one four-day heat
wave a year. In the contiguous United States, the number of heat
waves increased by 88 percent from 1949 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Two caveats have been attached to the study. To some extent,
said Dr. Gaffen and Ms. Ross, the rising heat probably reflects
increased urbanization; the concrete and asphalt in urban areas
absorb and retain more heat than rural areas. But Ms. Gaffen said
that most of the trend cannot be explained this way.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she said, not all the weather stations in the
study were in urban areas. For another, the researchers looked for
but did not find a correlation between population growth _ a
measure of urbanization _ and trends in extreme weather.
</P>
<P>
   The other caveat was offered by Dr. Laurence Kalkstein of the
University of Delaware, who has long studied heat and health. The
threshold of extreme heat adopted by the researchers was not really
selected on the basis of the relationship between health and
extreme heat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies by Kalkstein have found that the threshold at
which heat begins to kill people varies from one city to another.
``That's my only disagreement'' with the study, he said.

FDA APPROVES WIDER USE OF LIVER DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the expanded
use of Rebetron, a treatment already on the market for hepatitis C,
a viral infection of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, liver
cancer and liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C infects an estimated four million Americans and
kills 8,000 to 10,000 a year. The disease, spread mainly by dirty
needles and exposure to infected blood, is the leading reason for
liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in
June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon
drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease. The
expanded approval now means that Rebetron can also be given to
patients who had not taken interferon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebetron treatment combines interferon injections with a
second anti-viral drug, ribavirin, which is swallowed in capsules.
</P>
<P>
   A six-month treatment costs $6,400 to $8,600. By the end of
October, Rebetron sales had totaled $46 million, according to IMS
Health, a firm that tracks the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA cautioned that Rebetron is not a cure and that it is not
known whether the treatment can delay the progression of liver
disease caused by the virus. It suppresses blood levels of the
virus far better than interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say that not all hepatitis C patients need
Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike
symptoms, anemia, depression and suicidal behavior. It can also
cause birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded use was approved over the protests of patient
advocates, who object to the way Rebetron is being sold. Interferon
and ribavirin are sold together as a kit, a practice known as
bundling. Patients cannot get ribavirin without purchasing the
entire kit.
</P>
<P>
   A Schering-Plough spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said Rebetron is
sold in this way because ribavirin has been approved for use only
in combination with Schering's brand of interferon.
</P>
<P>
   But some patients say that their doctors would like to prescribe
ribavirin with another brand of interferon. And they accuse
Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high
price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another hepatitis treatment development, Glaxo Wellcome and
Biochem Pharma said Wednesday that the FDA had approved their drug,
lamivudine, as the first oral therapy for the treatment of
hepatitis B. In the United States, the drug will have a wholesale
cost of $1,250 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lamivudine, also known as 3TC and marketed under the trade name
Epivir, has previously been approved for the HIV virus, for which
it is the most commonly prescribed drug. Epivir for AIDS will
generate an estimated $800 million in revenue this year. Hepatitis
B affects many more people than AIDS, perhaps as many as 350
million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those patients are in Asian countries, where the cost of
the drug may be prohibitive, so analysts say it is difficult to
estimate the potential market. But there are an estimated one
million hepatitis B patients in North America and about twice that
many in Europe, where price is less of an issue.

ASTRONAUTS PUT SPACE STATION'S ANTENNAS INTO PLACE

<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman floated
outside the fledgling international space station Wednesday to
equip it with two boxy communications antennas to link it to NASA's
Mission Control Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Their nearly 7-hour spacewalk began at 2:33 p.m. CST. The
excursion was the second of three from the shuttle Endeavour on the
first station assembly flight.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle astronauts are scheduled to complete the antenna
installation Thursday when they enter the recently linked U.S.
Unity and Russian Zarya modules, the first two components of the
station, for the first time. The modules were stacked together atop
the shuttle's combination docking mechanism and airlock Sunday,
creating an eight-story tower. The spacewalkers scale the modules
as they work.
</P>
<P>
   Once fully installed, the communications system, using a
National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite link, will
enable the staff of Mission Control in Houston to monitor the
flight computers aboard Unity and send commands to many other
systems in the two modules. Motion control for Zarya will still be
transmitted by U.S. and Russian staff at mission control in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we are doing is basic construction,'' said
Newman, who was moved around the outside of the station on the tip
of Endeavour's 50-foot long robot arm. ``I don't think the tasks
will ever be mundane. The environment we will be working in will
always be very, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous view when you come out,'' said Ross, who
lashed himself to the outside of the modules during what was his
sixth career walk in space. ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the televised views transmitted to the ground, the backdrop
for Wednesday's spacewalk was the silver gleam of the new station
modules against the vast black of deep space and the rich blue hues
of cloud-filled skies over the Earth 245 miles below. At one point,
the astronauts paused from their work, distracted by a far-away
lightning storm.
</P>
<P>
   With Ross assisting, Newman strung a pair of long communications
cables from the Russian to the American module.
</P>
<P>
   One will furnish the signals from the U.S.-financed Russian
module to American controllers as well as a two-way video link that
can be used by the first occupants of the new station to
communicate with the ground. The second will allow communications
for station residents who don Russian suits and use the future U.S.
airlock for spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the two men wrestled a pair of 100 pound, suitcase-sized
antennas to installation points on the left and right sides of the
American module. Working separately, they plugged the bulky devices
into the hull of Unity and fastened them down in four places.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Wednesday's spacewalk was not as frantic as the
first one Monday when Ross and Newman made 40 electrical power and
computer data connections in the Russian hardware.
</P>
<P>
   In this spacewalk there was time for several unusual tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 10-foot-long tool called a ``boat hook'', Newman tugged
free a guidance antenna on the Russian module. Two of the
4-foot-long devices failed to unfurl properly after the Zarya was
launched by the Russians on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   As it was during Monday's excursion, the two spacewalkers worked
in concert with astronaut Nancy Currie, the shuttle's robot-arm
operator, and pilot Rick Sturckow, who served as their timekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion's only low point was when Ross lost a large piece
of insulation the astronauts were applying to the outside of the
American module.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry, one of the thermal covers got away from you,''
Endeavour Commander Bob Cabana radioed from the shuttle's cockpit,
surprising his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did it go?'' a frustrated Ross responded as the
blanketlike material drifted slowly away. ``It was all tethered, I
guarantee you. I don't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's spacewalk, Ross lost two aluminum tools, a
2{-pound socket and an 8{-pound wire carrier, equipment that was
supposed to be secured when not in use.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to recover the blanket was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got well out behind us and dropped down pretty fast,''
Cabana told Mission Control. ``We lost sight of it in the
darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Cabana was to lead his crew into the Unity and
Zarya modules for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are looking forward to on the ingress is the first
official act on the international space station and that is turning
on the lights,'' said Frank Culbertson, NASA's deputy director for
station operations.
</P>
<P>
   A final spacewalk is planned for Saturday night.

PROFILE: FAR FROM THE PLEADING CROWD: FURBY'S DAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich.)  (js) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Hampton knows what he would have done if his parents had
presented him with a Furby on his ninth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, I'd take the fur off,'' said Hampton, now 47, who
invented the five-inch gremlin in his California home last year but
who was willing, for the sake of a telephone interview, to
transport himself to the basement of his boyhood home near Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two, I'd open up the case, the shell,'' he continued. ``Three,
look at everything as it's working _ that way I can see how
everything is tied together. Four, I would start disassembling the
circuit board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I really succeeded,'' he said, ``I would put it all
back together and it would still work.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have never had the pleasure of elbowing through
Toys ``R'' Us in fruitless pursuit, the Furby is this season's
``it'' toy: a cuddly _ some would say cloying _ mechanized ball of
synthetic hair that is part penguin, part owl and part kitten.
Furby has a synthesized 200-word vocabulary in a language called
Furbish and the ability to squeal if the lights go out, snore and
even sneeze.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pet Rock and Tickle Me Elmo had mated, in a union sealed
with a Mood Ring, they would have given birth to a Furby.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he or she _ the sex of the Furby is at the owner's
discretion _ came from the imagination of Hampton, a perpetual
inventor of toys and medical products who lives with his wife and
two young sons in a home without electricity in the Tahoe National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   He won't name the nearest town, which is 25 miles away, because
he says he is afraid of frantic parents' beating on his door
demanding the plush companions, which have been flying off store
shelves and now fetch 10 times their suggested $30 retail price on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton pleads not guilty to stoking the marketing juggernaut
that has engulfed the Furby, which has been presided over by the
company to which he licensed the toy last year, Tiger Electronics
of Vernon Hills, Ill. And even though the estimated 2 million units
sold have probably made him millions (he won't say), his naivete is
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is someone whose earliest idea of a toy was a
toaster waiting to be taken apart. Before he reached puberty, he
says, the basement of his family's white-brick home in Roseville,
Mich., was littered with nearly a dozen broken radios belonging to
neighbors _ which he fixed, for a few dollars, sometimes at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 13, he began working in a little television repair
shop. Not long after that, he resurrected a World War II radar
system (which wound up jamming the local police frequency) and
built a ham radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a neighbor call and say, `Are you WA8-JAD?' '' he
recalls. ``My voice was coming out all over the neighborhood
telephones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My brothers were playing with more traditional toys,'' he
says. ``Me, I would much rather have a tube checker.''
</P>
<P>
   Having read in Popular Electronics that ``the best electronics
school was the Navy,'' Hampton enlisted soon after graduating from
high school in 1970. He chose aviation electronics as his
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   During his eight years in the service, he traveled the world,
learning Japanese, Thai, Chinese and Hebrew. His training led to
jobs in Silicon Valley, including one designing the video game
Q-Bert and another in product development for Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, he formed his own design and consulting
company, Sounds Amazing, and it was in that capacity that he
traveled to New York in February 1997 for the annual Toy Fair trade
show.
</P>
<P>
   There, he saw the interactive, digital pets known as Tamagotchi.
Though they exist on electronic screens no bigger than a watch, the
toys require their owners to feed them and clean up after them with
the push of a button, or they die.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton saw a fatal flaw: ``You can't pet it.'' So he returned
to his home workshop and began writing about his ideal virtual pet,
with the working name Furball. ``I started a script, like, if you
rub his back, he'll purr,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave Furby a language, an amalgam of all the languages
he had picked up. Thus when Furby says ``da,'' he is using the
Mandarin word for ``big.'' When he says, ``ay lo,'' for ``light,''
it is a variation of a Hebrew word for God.
</P>
<P>
   Using a crude electronic board not unlike the Heathkits he
played with as a boy, Hampton brought Furby's scratchy voice to
life. A former colleague from Mattel, Caleb Chung, created the
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1997, Hampton had sold the idea to Tiger
Electronics. By February, a crude model was shown at the Toy Fair,
tethered to a generator. In September, Wired magazine endorsed
Furby as the season's ``hottest new toy,'' and the toy industry was
on its way to having its next Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   In an accolade that only the Internet could bestow, one
disgruntled owner has conducted an online autopsy of his Furby
(www.phobe.com/furby/), complete with a toe-tagged ``crime scene
photo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly,'' the self-described scientist wrote, ``we find him
much more amusing dead than he was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton has seen the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was, `That's what I would have done,' '' he
said. ``The other side of me said: `My baby! They're dissecting my
babies!' ''

VACCO FAILS IN BID TO VERIFY VOTERS IN RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for Attorney General Dennis Vacco
acknowledged on Wednesday that their effort to have the police
verify the registration of thousands of New York City voters could
not proceed because the Giuliani administration would not cooperate
without a court order.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of telephone conferences and trips between New York
City and Albany, aides to Vacco and his Democratic challenger,
Eliot Spitzer, both sought judicial intervention to determine who
would be certified as the state's next attorney general next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Wednesday morning, Justice Thomas Keegan of
state Supreme Court in Albany made clear to campaign officials and
city lawyers that he would not order the police to conduct
door-to-door searches to determine the eligibility of thousands of
residents who the Vacco campaign contends voted illegally in the
Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   In unofficial results by the state Board of Elections, Spitzer
led by 26,011 votes out of 4.2 million cast. While Spitzer has
declared victory, Vacco has not conceded, asserting that there was
widespread fraud in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Vacco campaign said a comparison of voting rolls
with credit reporting data indicated that 103,000 people in the
city might have been fraudulently registered. It invoked a
seldom-used state law providing for the police to question
residents whose eligibility had been challenged.
</P>
<P>
   An impasse ensued, however, over the interpretation of the law.
The Vacco campaign argued that it required only a single
commissioner's complaint for a police canvass to be set in motion.
The president of the city Board of Elections said it was a matter
for the whole board to decide. Keegan said it was an electoral
matter, not a judicial one. And Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declined to
act without the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Spargo, a lawyer for Vacco's campaign, said Wednesday
that even without the police canvass, the Republican incumbent
still intended to prove that tens of thousands of votes were
fraudulently cast in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for alternatives to address the unwillingness of
the police to act,'' Spargo said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the campaign was considering using dozens of
volunteers to make telephone calls and conduct their own
investigation of the eligibility of voters and would present its
evidence to Keegan at a hearing on Monday. But he added that the
options being weighed would produce ``nothing with the
admissibility of police checks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Spitzer's lawyers filed two motions in state
Supreme Court in Albany. One was to overcome an obstacle created
Tuesday by the New York City Board of Elections, whose 10 members
split along party lines and failed to certify the election returns
from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's lawyers asked the court to compel the city's board to
meet on Saturday and not adjourn until it had certified the
election results and sent the figures to the state. Under state
law, elections are to be certified by the Board of Elections by
Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York City board's function is ministerial and they
have no jurisdiction over fraud,'' said state Sen. Martin Connor,
the Democratic minority leader and a lawyer for Spitzer's campaign.
``The action they took was inappropriate. It was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Keegan signed an order requesting representatives
of the New York City Board of Elections to appear in court Friday
morning to explain why they failed to certify the results of
balloting in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's lawyers also asked Keegan to dismiss lawsuits by the
Vacco campaign that had asked for a new election to be held or for
the attorney general to be declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Vacco campaign's effort to compel a police canvass of more
than 100,000 homes in heavily Democratic New York City produced an
outcry from Democrats who said it was aimed at areas where
Spitzer's lead was widest, particularly black and Hispanic
neighborhoods, and would intimidate voters and suppress turnout in
future elections.
</P>
<P>
   While the use of police officers produced predictably sharp
differences between the two parties, it also exposed some fissures
within the GOP. While the strategy has been championed by Vacco and
William Powers, the Republican Party state chairman, Gov. George
Pataki has distanced himself from the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican who is widely considered to have in
interest in national office, said he was concerned about using the
police to investigate voter fraud. ``You want people to become part
of the political process,'' he said. ``We want to do everything we
can to encourage people to come out and vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the law is so rarely used that election
officials have had to employ it only four times in the last two
years and only to check on a handful of voters, according to Naomi
Bernstein, a spokeswoman for the Board of Elections ``We certainly
haven't had anything on a scale like the latest case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Giuliani said the Police Department could conduct a
check on the registration of as many as 10,000 residents without
substantial interruption of other police functions. But Wednesday,
administration officials said that they feared that the city would
be the target of a wave of lawsuits from civil liberties groups if
it began the police checks and reaffirmed that the city would not
undertake such an action without the protection of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has appeared in public only once since the Nov. 3
election. But Spitzer is assuming the role of attorney
general-elect, with appearances Thursday in Rochester and Buffalo
on a tour of upstate cities.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Goldstein, Spitzer's campaign press secretary, said,
``Just because Vacco has been in hibernation for a month, that's
not going to stop Eliot Spitzer from meeting his new constituents
across New York State.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., is to preside next week in
the speaker's chair if, as expected, the full House debates
articles of impeachment against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood was picked by the outgoing speaker, Newt Gingrich, whose
aides asked LaHood on Monday whether he wanted the job. Republican
aides said Gingrich did not want to end his four-year tenure by
presiding over what is expected to be a highly divisive debate, and
that the incoming speaker, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., did not want
his tenure to begin on that note.
</P>
<P>
   LaHood, 53, a former high school teacher and counselor to
delinquent teen-agers, has a reputation for fairness that
Republican leaders hope will translate into a calming influence on
the proceedings and will help give the party an aura of
even-handedness. He has not indicated how he would vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was elected to the House only four years ago with
the Republican rebel class of 1994, LaHood has not been associated
with the rebels. He was one of three of the new freshmen who did
not sign Gingrich's Contract With America. He also helped organize
a bipartisan House retreat in Hershey, Pa., last year to help
members get to know each other better and treat each other with
more civility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, LaHood has presided in the speaker's chair perhaps
more often than any other Republican in recognition of his
knowledge on procedure, said his spokesman, Tim Butler. He accepts
the assignments willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He views it as a high honor,'' Butler said. ``This will be one
of the most momentous votes taken in this century.''
</P>

2 ASTRONAUTS INSTALL ANTENNAS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA's astronaut construction workers Wednesday added
communications antennas and removed unneeded equipment from the
exterior of the space station in another spacewalk from the shuttle
Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   Starting a scheduled seven-hour spacewalk early, Col. Jerry Ross
of the Air Force and Dr. James Newman, a physicist, emerged from
Endeavour's airlock at 3:34 p.m. Eastern time with the primary task
of improving the communications systems aboard the two station
sections docked to the shuttle's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half through the excursion from the shuttle, the two
astronauts completed their primary objective _ installing two,
100-pound communications antennas on opposite sides of the
American-made Unity connecting module.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts wrestled with the suitcase-sized antennas as they
pulled them through a narrow tunnel into the cargo bay. Then, with
Ross riding the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm and Newman moving up
the side of the module on a tether line, the spacewalkers moved the
antennas halfway up the 35-foot-tall module.
</P>
<P>
   Each astronaut installed an antenna and Newman hooked his to a
video cable running down from the Russian-built Zarya module. On
Thursday, when the six-member crew enters the station modules for
the first time, the astronauts will hook the antennas to equipment
on the inside and test a video conferencing system that will be
used in the early stages of station construction.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's spacewalk, the second of three planned for the
11-day mission, was less difficult than the one conducted on
Monday, when the astronaut team had to hook up 40 electrical and
data connectors attached to stiff cables.
</P>
<P>
   Successful completion of that task allowed electricity to flow
from Zarya's solar power panel into Unity, activating the module.
</P>
<P>
   The new antennas also will give NASA's Mission Control at the
Johnson Space Center, in Houston, the ability to monitor Unity and
to have direct control over operations on the station without
having to go through Russian ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts quickly moved through the other objectives of the
spacewalk, which included erecting a folding sunshade over a
computer mounted outside Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Working around the 7-story, 35-ton Zarya-Unity stack, the
astronauts also were to remove restraints used to stabilize four
Unity hatchways during launching. These hatches will be docking
ports for other station modules, including the framework for a
giant solar array and a cupola viewing port, that will be added in
the five-year construction period.
</P>
<P>
   Newman also was to install insulating covers on trunnion pins
that held Unity in Endeavour's shuttle bay when launched last
Friday. Leaving the pins exposed would allow heat to escape the
module and make it more difficult to regulate temperatures inside.
</P>
<P>
   As the astronauts worked their way around the station's aluminum
exterior, bright sunlight illuminated the ``Unity'' emblem, causing
Ross to remark to his partner: ``Kind of neat working up here right
by the Unity sign, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the spacewalk, ground controllers gave the
astronauts permission to try to unstick one of two rolled-up
antennas on Zarya. The astronauts confirmed on Monday that
explosive bolts that were to unfurl the four-foot long antennas had
fired after Zarya was launched on Nov. 20, but failed to deploy the
devices, to be used to help dock other ships to the Russian module.
</P>
<P>
   Newman tapped one of the antennas free with a 10-foot-long
extendable grappling hook that was being delivered aboard Endeavour
for later station crews to use. Newman, attached to the robot arm
maneuvered by Lt. Col. Nancy J. Currie of the Army, was kept at a
safe distance while prodding the antenna into its correct position.

REPUBLICANS UNVEIL ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unmoved by two days of White House defense
arguments, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee unveiled
four articles of impeachment Wednesday accusing President Clinton
of lying under oath, obstructing justice and abusing his power.
</P>
<P>
   Draft copies of the articles, which the committee begins
debating late Thursday, were handed to committee members as they
listened to White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff conclude his
lengthy, meticulous arguments against impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared with no input from Democrats on the committee, the
articles accuse Clinton of behavior that meets the ``high crimes
and misdemeanors'' standard for presidential impeachment written
into the Constitution 211 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alleging that Clinton's effort to conceal his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky betrayed the public trust, each
of the articles concludes: ``William Jefferson Clinton, by such
conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office
and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust
or profit under the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately blasted the Republican-controlled
committee for distributing the drafts of the articles of
impeachment before the president's defense had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After denying the president the right to see the charges
against him before offering his defense, the committee majority
decided to proceed with impeachment without even listening to his
defense,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he will
press the panel to vote on the articles by late Saturday. He also
has agreed to let the committee vote on a Democratic alternative to
impeachment, a resolution censuring the president and demanding his
signature on the resolution document rebuking him for
``reprehensible conduct with a subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of the articles of impeachment are approved _ the panel
is expected to send at least one to the full House _ Clinton will
become only the second president in U.S. history to face an
impeachment vote by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   House debate on any article of impeachment or the
Democratic-sponsored censure resolution, if it clears the
committee, would be scheduled next week. If impeachment is
approved, the president would go on trial in the Senate, a process
some experts predict will take six months.
</P>
<P>
   Only one president, Andrew Johnson, has been impeached by the
House. Following his Senate trial in 1868, Johnson was acquitted by
one vote. In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned after the House
Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him
for his role in the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting across the street from the Capitol in the same
wood-panelled room where the articles against Nixon were debated,
the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday heard Ruff concede that
Clinton might have been more than misleading in his behavior
surrounding the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., asked if Clinton had lied
under oath, a hush fell over the committee room as Ruff, carefully
measuring each word, said that ``reasonable people ... could
determine that he (Clinton) crossed over that line and that, what
for him was truthful and misleading or nonresponsive and misleading
or evasive, was, in fact, false.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ruff argued, Clinton's sworn testimony did not
amount to perjury, which requires an intent to lie. ``The president
has not committed a high crime or misdemeanor,'' Ruff said.
Clinton's ``conduct, although morally reprehensible, does not
warrant impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   When the panel's nationally televised hearings resume in the
Rayburn Office Building on Thursday, the committee's Democratic
counsel, Abbe Lowell, and Republican counsel David Schippers will
make their closing arguments before debate begins on the articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the committee were prepared to push through a
motion to allow Schippers to show portions of a videotape of
Clinton's Jan. 17 testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit. It was out of this testimony, a sworn deposition leading
up to a trial of the now settled-case, that the president's
impeachment troubles emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The tape shows an uneasy Clinton at times speaking barely above
a whisper, at others hesitating and stammering as he responds to
questions. He denies under oath that he had ``sexual relations''
with Lewinsky, then pauses 14 seconds before answering ``I'm not
sure'' to one question, then hedging his response when asked if he
and the former intern were ever alone.
</P>
<P>
   While transcripts of the deposition were released by Jones'
lawyers and later by the House Judiciary Committee, the videotape
of his testimony has never been seen in public. Republicans who
want the tape shown Thursday consider it damaging to the
president's case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony in the Jones case forms the basis for one of
the two articles of impeachment accusing the president of perjury.
The second alleges that he lied during his Aug. 17 testimony before
a federal grand jury being used by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr to investigate the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   While modeled after the impeachment resolutions from the
Watergate scandal, the articles of impeachment were based largely
on Starr's 453-page report to Congress. The article accusing
Clinton of obstruction of justice outlines seven instances when the
president attempted to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal''
evidence related to the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse of power article alleges the president ``frivolously
and corruptly'' asserted executive privilege to keep aides from
having to cooperate with Starr's investigation. In addition, the
article accuses Clinton of making false and misleading statements
about the affair to Cabinet members, aides, the House Judiciary
Committee and the American people.
</P>
<P>
   While the article accusing Clinton of lying to the grand jury
seems assured of winning approval from the 21 Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee, it is unlikely to draw support from any of the
16 Democrats on the panel
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, one or two of the committee Republicans have
expressed reservations about the articles accusing Clinton of
abusing his power and lying in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Rep. Amo Houghton, a New York Republican who is
not on the committee, announced that he would vote against any
article of impeachment that reaches the full House. He is the fifth
Republican _ all moderates _ to declare their opposition to
impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democrats have said they will vote for impeachment.
Several other Democrats list themselves among the undecided should
the issue reach the full House.
</P>
<P>
   The House has 228 Republican members, 206 Democrats and one
independent, who is expected to side with the Democrats on
impeachment. Democrats picked up five seats in last month's
elections, which means there will be a 223-211-1 division of the
House beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton said he opposes impeachment but will support censure
because it ensures that Clinton's behavior is punished if
impeachment fails. ``I think an awful lot of people, in their heart
of hearts, would like to have another option to just up or down
impeachment,'' Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments were expressed by Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee, a Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and one of the
four authors of the impeachment resolution the panel will debate
late this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find common ground, and this gives us another place
for people to go in punishing the president short of impeachment,''
Jackson Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hyde said he thought it was fair to have the committee
vote on the censure resolution, he personally opposes it. Even if
the committee, as expected, rejects the resolution, Hyde's decision
to allow a vote could put pressure on Republican leaders to allow a
similar censure vote by the full House. Incoming House Speaker Bob
Livingston of Louisiana has not indicated whether he will allow a
censure vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde confirmed that he plans to discuss the case against the
president with some of his GOP colleagues who are not on the
committee, but he does not intend to lobby them to support
impeachment. Instead, he said, he will urge them to ``keep their
powder dry'' until they have all the facts and the committee has
finished its work.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman also wrote a letter to all House members
to ``respectfully request that you withhold making any decision''
until the committee votes on articles of impeachment and committee
members ``have had an opportunity to discuss the merits with you.''

COMPANY PROPOSING COMPLEX OF OFFICES, EATERIES AT PRUDENTIAL SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES  &UR; -- &LR;  sprawling 1.3-million-square-foot campus-style
office complex with up to nine buildings is planned for a 35-acre
site in the Warner Center area of suburban Woodland Hills where
Prudential Health Care has its western regional headquarters,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar Partners, a unit of Miami-based LNR Property Corp.,
recently bought a piece of land and is willing to spend more than
$200 &UR;  &LR; million on the development. It will be the most ambitious
project proposed for the Warner Center area during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar purchased the land, widely considered a prime site, from
Prudential in August for an undisclosed price. The project will
feature a collection of buildings between three and five stories
tall, several restaurants and a day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar will build in four phases with the tallest buildings
placed farthest fromthe street. The site will be subdivided into
18 parcels, in part to facilitate financing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Read, vice president of acquisitions for Irvine,
Calif.-based Lennar Partners, said said the company hopes to start
construction in the second or third quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar is leasing two buildings totaling 450,000 square feet
back to Prudential and would like to keep that company as a tenant,
Read said. Prudential officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to speculate on who the new tenants might be,
Read said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to do a build-to-suit (project) but we are fully
prepared to go forward on speculation. There are really no large
blocks of contiguous space in that market right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call the existing buildings to be torn down so the net
amount of expansion at the site will be about 800,000 square feet.
About 60 &UR;  &LR; percent of the land will be left as open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current buildings were built in the late 1970s to
Prudential's specifications. They are football fields. We think
that we can make better use of the site and make a nicer
environment than is currently there,'' Read said.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar's project will, in general terms, mirror what is in vogue
in the west San Fernando Valley's office market
 &UR; -- &LR;  lush landscaping and campus-style complexes. The market is
tight, with a vacancy rate of under 10 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Reitmann, an analyst at the valley office of commercial
broker Grubb &AMP; Ellis, said about 200,000 square feet of space was
leased in the west valley during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The west valley is definitely strong. It's one of those areas
that it really going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar has already briefed Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura
Chick and her staff on the plan and discussed it Wednesday night
during a meeting of the Woodland Hills/West Hills Neighborhood
Advisory Planning Council. Some directors of the Woodland Hills
Homeowner Organization got a briefing earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said she will make a decision on whether to support the
project after homeowners mull it over and it is evaluated by city
planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this. I am very eager to see development come to
Warner Center. I have seen some (drawings) and I think it would be
quite an amenity. There is lots of open space and pathway areas.
It's almost a parklike setting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chick did note that the city has a ``very detailed'' specific
plan that stipulates the kind of mitigation that would need to be
done for increased traffic.
</P>
<P>
   David Shender, a principal at the Pasadena, Calif.-based traffic
engineering consulting firm of Linscott, Law &AMP; Greenspan, estimates
that the project would add about 2,800 vehicles to the area a day.
</P>
<P>
   Lennar would pay about $3.5 &UR;  &LR; million on mitigation factors,
including widening streets and adding turn lanes to intersections.
The traffic management plan was based on guidelines set by the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We analyzed 21 intersections in the Warner Center area and
determined on a preliminary basis that 10 would require traffic
mitigation measures to alleviate the project's impact,'' Shender
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far nothing has been proposed for the freeway ramps at De
Soto or Canoga avenues or Topanga Canyon Boulevard which are
typically congested during rush hours. Shender declined to discuss
specifics of the traffic management plan because it is being
reviewed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   But since the project is located on Canoga Avenue, he expects
that ramp to bear the brunt of new traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners
Organization, said the project sounds good in general terms but he
is concerned about the parcel being split into lots and the
additional traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some problems but there isn't enough information for
us to tell them what we think will work and won't work. If you
can't improve the flow of traffic, just leave it the way it is,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   New large developments in Warner Center have been blocked since
1994 when the Los Angeles Unified School District sued the city,
claiming the Warner Center Specific Plan did not adequately
consider the effects of expansion on noise, traffic and pollution
problems at area schools. However, projects of 2 million square
feet or less, or those already approved, can go forward.

PRESIDENTS CUP HAS HIS VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Golf's goofy season, so named because of the
embarrassment of riches left on the greens after all the official
money has been claimed, finally gets serious this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the third biennial Presidents Cup, an
us-against-the-whole-world-except-Europe team competition held
every year the Ryder Cup isn't. This is not as unfair as it seems
because the U.S. team has about 10 of the world's top 20 players.
</P>
<P>
   And it's an event actually worth watching since it's about
winning a trophy rather than a check.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rare opportunity to glimpse one of the world's best
courses, Australia's Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Contoured greens
and Santa Ana-like conditions forecasted will cause Melbourne to
look a lot like the Valley in July _ or this week minus the heat.
</P>
<P>
   And while this tournament does not have the impact of a Ryder
Cup, it sure got respectable in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   For this we can thank Fred Couples, who secured the Cup with a
dramatic last-hole putt in the 1996 matches at the Robert Trent
Jones Golf Club in Manassas, Va., and some teammates who thrust him
in that position.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. entered the Sunday singles (one-on-one) play with a
lead but as the day wound down, Couples and Vijay Singh came to the
17th hole with the team match square. Couples was clinging to a
one-stroke lead as he lined up a 40-foot birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? Davis Love III, who had completed play, thought (begin
ital)his(end ital) head was going to blow up and he wasn't the one
holding the putter.
</P>
<P>
   Couples rolled his putt in and the Americans, who can't seem to
beat Europe anymore, celebrated what was considered a consolation
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Once order was restored, Singh took a stab at a 25-footer to
prolong the match, but his putt veered off to the right.
</P>
<P>
   That dramatic finish helped validate a competition that many
thought Australia-Florida native Greg Norman cooked up because he
can't play in the Ryder Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the international team went on a crying jag in the wake
of its defeat also helped give the Presidents Cup a boost in
stature.
</P>
<P>
   The international team, angered at losing a close match and the
unfeeling television producers that ordered up shots of Singh's
wife crying after her husband's missed putt, vowed not to let it
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   So they retired for a grief fest at their cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could have been in the cabin after we lost. . . I don't
think any of us really realized how important it was,'' Nick Price
told the Associated Press this week. ``Any of us who were sitting
in that cabin that evening understand the importance of this event
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that came out of that session was a demand the match
be played played outside the U.S. on an alternating basis.
</P>
<P>
   So the team from ``up over'' headed ``down under'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   On top of it online: The PGA Tour's Presidents Cup web site at
www.pgatour.com features real-time scoring and you can even listen
in on press conferences.
</P>
<P>
   At the completion of each hole, a scorer enters results into a
hand-held device, which transmits the data to an IBM PC server.
Hole-by-hole results are updated in real-time across the network
and distributed to broadcasters, scoreboards, on-site IBM
information kiosks and to sports fans worldwide via Internet.
</P>
<P>
   College signings: Three top-flight high school golfers have
signed letters of intent with USC. They are David Oh of Whitney
High in Cerritos, Candi Kung of Fountain Valley High and Mikaela
Parmild of Goteborgs Hogre Samskola in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Oh is one of the best young players in the country and is ranked
seventh in the Titleist/Golfweek national junior rankings. He won
the 1997 CIF championship and is an American Junior Golf
Association Rolex All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an excellent recruiting year on both the men's and
women's sides,'' said Kurt Schuette, USC's director of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Saying goodbye: Swing guru David Leadbetter has ended his
two-year teaching relationship with Korean star Se Ri Pak.
Leadbetter could not handle the circus atmosphere that now
surrounds one of the world's top women players. He quit via a
letter to one of her many managers. He must have learned that from
former pupil Nick Faldo, who this year informed Leadbetter his
services were no longer needed via a letter. &QL;

UNIVERSAL-POLYGRAM MERGER EXPECTED TO MEAN LAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &LR; UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Seagram Co. is expected to announce
today massive layoffs in its music business that may affect as many
as 3,000 employees as it completes the $10.4 billion acquisition of
PolyGram NV.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram executives have already said they plan to cut $300
million in annual costs from the combined Universal and PolyGram
music groups, which have 15,500 employees. The restructuring would
be designed to improve profit margins at the the combined
operation, which will have a 25 percent share of the world's
recorded music business.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram will close the deal, announced last May, for Polygram
today as the Montreal-based concern continues its transformation
from a beverage specialist to an entertainment conglomerate.
Analysts have said the deal makes sense because it will broaden
Universal's roster, which has strong domestic appeal with acts like
Reba McEntire, the Wallflowers and B.B. King. Labels include MCA,
Geffen, Interscope, GRP and Universal.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam-based Polygram, already the world's largest music
company, has a massive roster including Hanson, Elton John, Sheryl
Crow, U2 and Luciano Pavarotti. Labels include Decca, Def Jam, A&AMP;M,
Verve, London, Island, Mercury, Motown and Deutsche Grammophon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an analyst, I can't estimate how many jobs will be cut, but
the number that's been kicked around is 3,000,'' said Linda
Bannister of Edward Jones. ``The two companies could mix fairly
well, given Universal's domestic and PolyGram's international
strength, but any time you have a merger of this size, there's
bound to be some integration pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister noted it's crucial for the Universal-PolyGram
integration to go smoothly. ``The last thing you want is turmoil
because you want to attract new artists and keep your stable
intact,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has given a generally positive response to Seagram's
purchase because it came at a time when music sales have been
stagnant, ensuring that the price of assets would be favorable to
buyers. Philips Electronics put PolyGram up for sale because it did
not fit in with its core business.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram is under pressure from Wall Street to improve its
performance. It announced Wednesday that Universal Studios' dismal
performance at the box office during the fall will give the
division a $65 million loss in its second fiscal quarter. Pricey
disappointments included ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the
City.''

COWBOYS' SANDERS PRACTICES, BUT STILL IFFY FOR CHIEFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo walked
off the practice field yesterday and tried to explain life without
star cornerback Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an impact player,'' Campo began. ``He takes part of the
field away. That's what he does. He makes the opposing offense have
to account for his whereabouts. We've had to change some things.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the more Campo talked, the more antsy he became
regarding Sanders' absence during the past 3 1/2 games with a
sprained big toe on his left foot, and his iffy status for Sunday's
road matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the most important thing is his health,'' Campo
said. ``We want him ready for down the road. But I just wish it was
one way or another, where he was going to play or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sanders practiced yesterday for the first time since
suffering the injury against the Arizona Cardinals Nov. 15, his
availability against the Chiefs is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, whose left shoe has been fitted with a metal plate to
restrict his movement, gingerly tested his toe in some team passing
drills, and did some rehabilitation work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt a little,'' Sanders said. ``I don't know yet. We still
got quite a few days to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey was more optimistic about Sanders'
chances of playing than he has been in some time, but remained
noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders ``was out there with his pads on, pushed off on his toe,
changed directions,'' Gailey said. ``We'll have to see how he's
doing after doing that. It's good to have him on the field. We'll
just see how it goes the rest of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said cornerback Charlie Williams is scheduled to start
against the Chiefs, who feature one of the league's hottest passing
attacks. Kansas City quarterback Rich Gannon has thrown for six
touchdowns the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While Sanders' availability is uncertain, what is clear is the
Cowboys are a different team without him.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 0-5 without him in the starting lineup the past
two seasons, including losses against Minnesota and New Orleans the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to be more telling is the play of the Cowboys'
defense, which has seemingly crumbled since Sanders was injured
against the Cardinals. Before that game, the Cowboys ranked seventh
in the NFL in total defense, 13th against the pass and had given up
nine touchdown passes through nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Cowboys' defense has dropped to 14th overall,
24th against the pass and has given up 15 touchdown passes the past
four games.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of Sanders' absence goes beyond giving up big
chunks of passing yards. Schematically, the Cowboys have had to
change roughly 30 percent of their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, his chief replacement, said the Cowboys played more
man coverages and more press defense with Sanders. Without him,
they are playing more zone and laying off the receivers. Safety
Kenny Wheaton said the Cowboys are also playing a larger variety of
coverages to make up for the loss of Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mix it up to keep teams on their toes,'' Wheaton said.
``They never know which way we are going to roll our coverage. With
him, everybody knows we are going to roll to the other side and
leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   And considering Sanders' knack for the big play _ he has
returned one interception for a touchdown, two punts for touchdowns
and has a 55-yard pass reception _ the Cowboys also miss his
psychological influence.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, pointing to Sunday's 22-3 loss to the Saints, said
Sanders' big-play ability can jump-start a team. And his mere
presence would have forced the Saints to account for his
whereabouts and likely alter their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   His absence has also impacted the Cowboys emotionally. Defensive
tackle Chad Hennings said the team has missed Sanders, and his
return against the Chiefs would be a huge boost for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a safety blanket as a little kid that you had
to go to bed with all the time,'' Hennings said. ``The security
puts you more at ease, knowing that he's back there ... it's going
to be all right. I don't know if he's going to play, but we've been
praying for him to come back for a long time now.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House completed its defense against
impeachment before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday with
an admission by its top lawyer that ``reasonable people'' might
conclude President Clinton had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a methodical, somber assault, the White House counsel
and a last round of witnesses argued that no prosecutor would try
Clinton on the evidence gathered by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, no jury would convict him and no responsible Congress would
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   As presidential aides encouraged an alternative punishment like
censure, White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff tried to raise the
perceived stakes of impeachment, grimly urging the House not to
treat it as ``an indictment, or some formalistic slap on the
wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each member _ and I need not tell you this _ must bear the
weightiest burden that our Constitution contemplates,'' Ruff said,
``the burden of making an individual determination that the
president has committed such grave offenses against our polity that
he is no longer fit to serve, that the will of the people should be
overturned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, a Watergate special prosecutor and a seldom-seen architect
of Clinton's defense, appeared Wednesday afternoon before the
committee in hope of rescuing Clinton from becoming the only
president other then Andrew Johnson to be impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   He rounded out two days of relayed regrets and legal and
historical argument by saying that Clinton believes he could
eventually be prosecuted for concealing his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. ``Absolutely,'' Ruff said, when asked if he could assure
the committee that Clinton would not pardon himself or accept a
pardon from a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Ruff said that ``reasonable people'' might
determine that the president had lied, both in a civil deposition
in the Paula Corbin Jones case and in grand jury testimony about
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. They might conclude, he said, ``that
he crossed over that line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in his mind _ and that's the heart and soul of perjury _
he thought and he believed that what he was doing was being evasive
but truthful,'' Ruff added, capping a 10-hour session.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff mixed his acknowledgments of wrongdoing and reasonable
disagreements with a bare-knuckle attack on Starr's impeachment
referral to Congress. While Gregory Craig, special White House
counsel, tried on Tuesday to defer questions about specifics in the
case, Ruff embraced them, eagerly taking up Republicans' challenge
to debate the facts.
</P>
<P>
   With Craig having put a friendly face on the President's
defense, Ruff was intended to function as the closer, addressing
questions that members of Congress had raised and driving home
points previously made by other White House witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, leaning forward in the wheelchair he always uses, was a
formidable presence behind the witness table. His beetled brows,
grave delivery and sure-footed survey of the evidence contrasted
with Craig's more boyish, eager-to-please approach. Ruff's demeanor
suggested that the White House hoped to leave a last impression of
seriousness of purpose and occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff followed a panel of former prosecutors who spent the
morning piling derision on Starr's referral. ``This case would
simply not be given serious consideration for prosecution,'' said
Thomas Sullivan, a former U.S. attorney for the northern district
of Illinois. ``It wouldn't get in the door. It would be declined
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House considers it inevitable that the committee will
vote this weekend along party lines to approve up to four articles
of impeachment, which were released Wednesday. Over the last two
days _ in a strategy it intends to pursue until the House votes _
it pitched its arguments past the committee to the moderate House
Republicans that it fears might support impeaching Clinton in the
belief that the Senate will not remove him.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion remained respectful Wednesday, even as panelists
expressed contempt for some evidence and Republicans complained of
semantic games. ``This is good wordsmanship,'' Rep. Ed Bryant of
Tennessee drily complimented the panel of lawyers this morning.
</P>
<P>
   But no one gave any evidence of a changed mind. Wednesday
evening, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has adopted a more
moderate tone on impeachment, surprised Ruff with an argument that
Clinton had led a White House strategy to smear Ms. Lewinsky by
portraying her as a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   He advanced the theory that Clinton met with his secretary,
Betty Currie, the day after Jones' lawyers questioned him about Ms.
Lewinsky was to lead her through questions that would support such
a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's accusation started a storm of interruptions from the
Democratic side, and Ruff demanded time to respond. He said that
Graham had ``no basis for making that allegation'' and that ``a
very careful and well-considered decision was made to do our
damnedest to insure that in fact no such personal attack was ever
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The president met with Ruff for about an hour on Tuesday to
review the counsel's testimony, and Wednesday Ruff made repeated
statements of remorse on Clinton's behalf. Indeed, following an
example set by the White House on Tuesday, he beat up on his boss,
although stating that impeachment was not a reasonable punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He misled his family, his friends, his colleagues and the
public,'' Ruff said. ``And in doing so, he betrayed the trust
placed in him not only by his loved ones but by the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His voice lowered in mock, dramatic tones, Ruff _ an experienced
criminal defense lawyer as well as a prosecutor _ read at several
points from Starr's referral during his hour-long opening remarks.
Then, as he turned to evidence that he said exculpated Clinton, he
would shift to a conversational manner: ``Well, you might want to
know,'' he started at one point, after falling silent for a
well-timed sip of water.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday morning's panel, William Weld, the former
governor of Massachusetts and a Republican, lent a bipartisan cast
to Clinton's defense. He was harshly critical of Clinton's conduct,
saying that the president was ``already tarnished.'' Saying that
impeachment was not warranted and censure was not enough, he
recommended a five-part package that included censure, a fine, and
the possibility of eventual prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Like other panelists, Weld has a connection to the White House.
Clinton appointed him to be ambassador to Mexico, though the Senate
refused to act on the nomination. Weld did not tell the White House
in advance of his five-part censure proposal, said Joe Lockhart,
the press secretary. Officials refused either to endorse or disavow
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no public mention of the proceedings against him
Wednesday. He met Wednesday afternoon with 48 members of Congress
for a closed discussion of ways to bolster the Social Security
system. Wednesday evening, he presided at the annual ``Pageant of
Peace'' _ the lighting of the Christmas tree at the White House _
and held a holiday party for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton said that they were weighing whether he should
make another public statement of contrition, perhaps by seizing on
a reporter's question. Some of the president's outside advisers are
urging that he should soon begin speaking one-on-one to wavering
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and the panel Wednesday morning returned repeatedly to the
substance of the evidence against Clinton. As a result, the
committee plunged into its most detailed discussion of some of the
most graphic issues before it.
</P>
<P>
   One of Starr's accusations is that Clinton lied in denying that
he reciprocated Ms. Lewinsky's ``intimate touching.'' That is the
basis for a claim that Clinton has committed perjury, and the
committee has struggled to confront it on live television.
</P>
<P>
   After some panelists dismissed the dispute as a he-said-she-said
matter that could not be prosecuted, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.,
noted that witnesses interviewed by Starr's prosecutors said that
Ms. Lewinsky had confided her intimate relations with the president
to them. ``A jury would be hard pressed not to convict under those
circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Davis, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New York
and a former Watergate prosecutor, disagreed. Ms. Lewinsky had an
incentive to lie even to her friends, he said, because ``otherwise
she would be acknowledging an unreciprocated sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, Ruff presented a dramatic, televised
presentation of the arguments laid out in a 184-page legal brief
released by the White House Tuesday night. Along the way, he
challenged the frequent criticism that Clinton's legal team _ and
lawyers generally _ resorted to hairsplitting and legalisms.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff worried, he said, that ``our sometimes irresistible urge to
practice our profession'' could ``stand in the way of securing a
just result.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``it is not legalistic to point out that the president did
not say what some accuse him of saying,'' he continued. ``It is not
legalistic to point out that a witness did not say what some rely
on her testimony to establish. It is not legalistic to point out
that a witness was asked poorly framed or ambiguous questions.''

DODGERS BRASS MEETS WITH BROWN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, baseball's top free agent right-hander, spent most
of Wednesday meeting with Dodgers officials and will let the club
know Friday if he is still interested in playing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone did not make an official
offer, but the parameters are a six-year deal worth more than $72
million.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who appeared in the past two World Series for Florida and
San Diego, returned to his home outside Atlanta immediately after
the meetings. Brown and his agent, Scott Boras, spoke to the Angels
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 33, told Malone that playing closer to home would be
critical to his decision. But Brown also told Malone that he liked
the Dodger commitment to winning and the successful track record of
manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we are serious players,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding for Brown is expected to lead the agenda at the
four-day baseball winter meetings, which begin Friday in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is considered the favorite, but Colorado and Baltimore
also are interested. &QL;

L.A. SCHOOL TO END SOCIAL PROMOTION FOR FAILING STUDENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY AND DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Vaughn Next Century Learning Center has ended
the practice of promoting failing students to the next grade,
taking a lead in the district's effort to comply with the new state
ban on social promotion, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state law that will first apply during the 1999-2000
school year, students who are not performing at grade level at the
end of the term will have to attend summer school or take other
remedial tutoring. If they do not progress, they will be held back.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, a nationally renowned charter school in suburban
Pacoima, is launching its push to comply with the law by holding an
informational meeting tonight for parents of 200 students who have
been identified as needing extra help in reading. Those students,
in first through fifth grades, will attend an intensive weeklong
literacy program starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to bring the students up to grade level by the end of
the school year and prevent them from slipping further behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Tami Dozal, a first-grade teacher at Vaughn
who referred five students to the program. ``There are kids going
on (to the next grade level) when they're not ready. We have to do
something about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   By starting midway through the year, instead of waiting to bring
students up to speed in summer school, Vaughn should be able to
catch students who might otherwise fall even further behind during
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wait for summer school?'' principal Yvonne Chan asked.
``Why let them fail for six more months?''
</P>
<P>
   The school board two weeks ago adopted a districtwide policy to
end social promotion that will take effect July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Collins, director of curriculum, instruction and assessment
for the Los Angeles Unified School District, said he wasn't aware
of any other campus complying with the new state law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a student's performance will be gauged on grades
and scores on the statewide Stanford 9 standardized test.
</P>
<P>
   Districts will be required to hold back poor-performing students
in grades two, three, four and five -- the grade between elementary
and middle school -- and eight -- the grade between middle and high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he did not know how much it would cost to end
social promotion but said the LAUSD expects to receive $13 million
from the state to implement summer school and intercession programs
at elementary schools -- an amount that will pay for needed
remedial classes.
</P>
<P>
   At Vaughn, 384 students in grades one through five have been
identified as performing below grade level, according to
standardized test scores and report-card grades.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many LAUSD students performing below
grade level are passed on every year, but estimates range from 20
percent to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's new system establishes three tiers of students testing
below grade level.
</P>
<P>
   One group -- the 200 students whose parents were invited to
tonight's meeting -- needs a little more help to catch up. Those
pupils aren't in serious danger of repeating a grade but are
scoring around the 37th percentile on standardized tests for their
class.
</P>
<P>
   In the second group, about 120 students, learning significantly
slower than their peers, are at risk of being held back a year and
already are receiving intensive tutoring, Chan said. Administrators
will decide in mid-May whether they will be retained or sent to
summer school.
</P>
<P>
   In the third tier are 64 students with learning disabilities who
will be referred to a special-education program.
</P>
<P>
   Parents welcomed the help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea,'' said Marta Ramirez, whose 7-year-old son
is having trouble writing and will attend the January literacy
program. ``He's a little slow. He needs to write more.''

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PANAMA CITY, PANAMA _ The United States will forever hand over
control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government on Dec.
31, 1999. It will be a proud day for Panamanians, but they won't
have much time to bask in the historic moment. Private investors
are already busy drawing up plans to take away a piece of the
canal's abundant business.
 &HT;    Around 13,000 ships pass through the canal each year, hauling an
estimated 4 percent of the world's goods around the globe.
Moreover, about 70 percent of all trade through the canal is coming
from or headed to the United States.
 &HT;    To maintain its competitive edge, the current Panama Canal
Commission (PCC) _ which will become the Panama Canal Authority
following the management change next year _ is well into a US$1
billion improvement program that includes a widening of the narrow
Gaillard Cut, where the canal was gouged through the Continental
Divide. Galvanized by a big rise in canal traffic in 1995 and 1996,
the widening was speeded up and is due for completion by 2002.
Two-way traffic will be possible for even the largest ships and
canal capacity will rise.
 &HT;    But with steadily increasing traffic, projected at 2 percent per
year, there are plenty of entrepreneurs who scent an opportunity.
Schemes abound for capturing a slice of the action from the canal.
 &HT;    These so-called ``dry canal'' schemes are built on analysts'
bullish predictions for growth in containerization of about 8
percent per year. A dry canal system would include new ports where
containers would be unloaded and rushed across land to a waiting
ship on the other side. Nothing has come to fruition, yet, but
dreams are alive and on the drawing board.
 &HT;    ``Nicaragua will become the crossroads of world inter-oceanic
commerce,'' says Don Bosco, whose group, CINN, has been working
with Nicaragua's government on a dry canal plan since 1995 and
recently submitted its viability studies. The government's verdict
is expected by the end of the year. CINN would head a private
consortium to build two new ports and a 375-kilometer railway. The
estimated cost: at least $2.3 billion.
 &HT;    Bosco harks back to the days of the California gold rush _ when
both Nicaragua and Panama became favored routes from the U.S. east
coast to the gold mines _ to show there is ``historical precedent''
for a Nicaragua crossing. ``There is a clear and compelling market
demand for a certain kind of transportation service ... a new
trans-Isthmian service to exclusively transport containerized cargo
in a high-volume, high-speed mode,'' says Bosco.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, a U.S.-based group, Owl Securities and Investments,
plans a deep-water port on Costa Rica's Atlantic coast that could
also serve as a 'dry canal' terminal.
 &HT;    So will the Panama Canal have to live with some sharp new
competition muscling in? Although Alberto Aleman, who is the PCC's
senior administrator, acknowledges the canal does face competition
_ a change from 20 years ago _ he chuckles at such talk. ``Panama
has much more to offer,'' he says, describing it as ``the only port
in the world that has two oceans plus a canal that runs through it.
You can look at it as one big port.''
 &HT;    Indeed some big names _ port operators Hutchison Whampoa of Hong
Kong, Taiwan's Evergreen, and U.S.-based Stevedoring Services of
America _ all run ports in Panama, on both Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. The growth of SSA's Manzanillo International Terminal, set
up in 1994 in a joint venture with a Panamanian partner, has been
breathtaking. Last year, it handled 600,000 20-ft equivalent units
(TEUs, the standard container measurement). Hutchison and Evergreen
are presently unrolling their own operations.
 &HT;    Add in the historic old Panama railroad, which Kansas City
Southern Railways and Mi-Jack, a U.S. terminal operator, are
rebuilding after paying $60 million for a concession, and Panama
already has the key elements of the sort of dry-canal transshipment
operation being talked about elsewhere.
 &HT;    So why are other hopefuls so bullish? CINN's Bosco say there is
plenty of trade to go around. ``In 2005, when we are up and
running, the available east-west market for dry canal services will
be 12.5 million TEUs. From that we will try to grab 10 percent,''
he says.
 &HT;    They also say that dry canals are tailor-made to accommodate the
new generation of `post-Panamax' ships, huge container vessels that
generate large economies of scale for their owners but which are
too big to travel through the canal's 1,000-feet-by-110-feet lock
chambers. ``Back in 1965 there was only one percent Panamax vessels
in the canal,'' says Aleman. ``Now it is 30 percent.''
 &HT;    These ships can only fit in single file through the canal's
narrowest reaches, meaning more headaches trying to get all boats
through canal waters within the benchmark 24 hours.
 &HT;    ``We are seeing more and more delays,'' says Roy Newall, a
shipping agent in the city of Colon at the canal's Atlantic
entrance, who says it is one of his clients' prime concerns. ``If
you have a ship sitting here for two or three or five days, it is
catastrophic. I have been here for 30 years and I just don't
remember so many lengthy delays as we have had in the last five
years.''
 &HT;    The PCC, says Aleman, is tackling the problem. ``The shipping
industry is more and more like the airline industry. Time is of the
essence. You cannot have ships waiting a week to go through the
canal. You have to make sure that they can rely on getting through
the canal in time. That is why we are focusing on building
reliability.'' Panamanian officials are not ignoring the trend
toward larger vessels, he says.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, after the current improvement program ends, the
only way to raise capacity would be to build another set of locks.
In 1993, a study by the United States, Panama and Japan concluded
that additional locks should be able to handle larger ships.
 &HT;    Will a new canal be built? At a likely cost of $7 billion,
nobody is rushing to make a decision. It's being considered, but,
says Aleman, ``It does not make any sense to build that sort of
project if you do not have the demand.''
 &HT;    Says Newall: ``I feel quite sure that by 2010 or 2015, we will
have an extra canal.'' Shippers watch with interest. Next
December's transition ushers the canal not only into a new era of
ownership, but into a time of critical decisions.
 &HT;    Part of the interest and concern surrounds the circumstances of
the change. The world's richest nation is transferring the canal
into the hands of a small, relatively poor country. Charges of
nepotism and cronyism have already surfaced in Panama. Some
criticize Panama President Ernesto Perez Balladares for naming some
family and political allies to the governing board of the Panama
Canal Authority, which takes over after the United States leaves.
 &HT;    ``It is a way of life here. I think the industry is concerned
about nepotism and bribery and corruption in this part of the
world. I think it is a genuine concern,'' says one shipping agent
in Panama.
 &HT;    A political football and cash cow? ``I don't buy it,'' says
Aleman, who has held his post since 1996. The 47-year-old
Panamanian engineer has been named to head the PCA until 2005.
 &HT;    The makeup of the PCA board is filled with experience, says
Aleman, who notes that of the 11 people on the board, four are
already on the PCC; another three already sit on a
canal-consultation committee; and one used to work at the PCC. As
for future appointments, a president can only name three new
members every three years, making it difficult to pack the board
with favorites.
 &HT;    ``Panama is really committed to running the canal in an
efficient way,'' says Aleman.
 &HT;    Shipping industry officials agree. ``We do not expect any
changes. We have a lot of confidence,'' says Kim Gadegaard, vice
president for Latin American services of the Denmark-based Maersk
shipping line, a major canal customer. That confidence will be
tested in the next century.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PANAMA _ Estados Unidos pasara definitivamente el control del
Canal de Panama al gobierno panameno el 31 de diciembre de 1999.
Sera un dia de orgullo para los panamenos, pero no tendran mucho
tiempo para disfrutar el momento historico. Los inversionistas
privados ya trazan planes para aduenarse de una parte de los
abundantes negocios del Canal.
 &HT;    Unos 13.000 barcos surcan todos los anos el Canal, transportando
aproximadamente el 4 por ciento del volumen mundial de mercancias.
Ademas, alrededor del 70 por ciento de todo el comercio que pasa
por la via interoceanica procede o se dirige hacia Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Para mantener su ventaja competitiva, la Comision del Canal de
Panama (PCC), que se convertira en la Autoridad del Canal de Panama
al cambiar la administracion el ano proximo, ha puesto en marcha un
programa de mejoramiento de US$1.000 millones que contempla el
ensanchamiento del Corte Gaillard, antes llamado Culebra, donde se
abrio el canal a traves de la cordillera. Las obras de
ensanchamiento, galvanizadas por un gran incremento del trafico
canalero en 1995 y 1996, se aceleraron y deben terminar en el ano
2002. La obra permitira el transito en las dos direcciones hasta de
los barcos mayores y aumentara la capacidad del canal.
 &HT;    Pero con un constante incremento del trafico, proyectado en el 2
por ciento anual, hay muchos empresarios que olfatean las
oportunidades. Abundan los planes para aduenarse de una parte de la
accion en la via.
 &HT;    Los planes llamados de ``canal seco'' se basan en los optimistas
pronosticos de analistas que calculan un aumento del 8 por ciento
anual en el uso de contenedores. Un sistema de canal seco
comprenderia nuevos puertos donde se descargarian los contenedores
y se transportarian por tierra hasta un barco en la costa opuesta.
Ninguno de esos planes se ha concretado todavia, pero los suenos ya
estan en la mesa de trabajo.
 &HT;    ``Nicaragua se convertira en la encrucijada del comercio mundial
interoceanico,'' dice Don Bosco, cuyo grupo, CINN, trabaja con el
gobierno nicaraguense en un plan de canal seco desde 1995 y hace
poco presento sus estudios de viabilidad. El veredicto del gobierno
se espera para fines de ano. CINN encabezaria un consorcio privado
para construir dos puertos y una linea ferroviaria de 375
kilometros. El costo estimado es de US$2.300 millones por lo menos.
 &HT;    Bosco se remonta a los dias de la fiebre del oro en California,
cuando tanto Nicaragua como Panama se convirtieron en rutas
favoritas para viajar de la costa este de Estados Unidos a las
minas de oro, con el fin de demostrar que hay un ``precedente
historico'' para un cruce por Nicaragua. ``Hay una demanda visible
y urgente de cierta clase de servicio de transporte un nuevo
servicio a traves del istmo para transportar exclusivamente
contenedores de gran volumen y a gran velocidad,'' senala Bosco.
 &HT;    Entretanto, el grupo estadounidense Owl Securities and
Investments proyecta un puerto de gran calado en la zona atlantica
de Costa Rica que tambien podria servir como terminal de ``canal
seco.''
 &HT;    Entonces, tendra el Canal de Panama que afrontar una competencia
nueva y renida? Aunque Alberto Aleman, administrador del PCC,
reconoce que el canal encara competencia (lo cual no sucedia hace
20 anos), no le da gran importancia. ``Panama tiene mucho mas que
ofrecer,'' afirma, y dice que se trata del ``unico puerto del mundo
que tiene dos oceanos mas un canal que lo atraviesa. Puede
considerarse un gran puerto.''
 &HT;    Muchas grandes empresas, como Hutchison Whampoa, de Hong Kong;
Evergreen, de Taiwan, y Stevedoring Services of America (SSA), de
Estados Unidos, administran puertos en Panama, tanto en la costa
del Atlantico como en la del Pacifico. El crecimiento de la
Terminal Internacional de Manzanillo, de SSA, construida en 1994 en
una empresa conjunta con un socio panameno, ha sido sorprendente.
El ano pasado, la terminal manejo 600.000 contenedores de 20 pies.
Hutchison y Evergreen desarrollan actualmente sus propias
operaciones.
 &HT;    Si se agrega el historico ferrocarril de Panama, que Kansas City
Southern Railways y Mi-Jack, empresa estadounidense que opera
terminales portuarias, reconstruyen despues de pagar US$60 millones
por una concesion, Panama ya tiene los elementos basicos del tipo
de operacion de canal seco de que se habla en otras partes.
 &HT;    Entonces, por que otros se sienten tan optimistas? Bosco, de
CINN, dice que habra mucho comercio que aprovechar. ``En el 2005,
cuando estemos funcionando a toda capacidad, el mercado este-oeste
para los servicios de canal seco sera de 12,5 millones de
contenedores de 20 pies. De ese volumen trataremos de captar el 10
por ciento,'' apunta.
 &HT;    Tambien dicen que los canales secos estan concebidos para la
nueva generacion de barcos post-Panamax, enormes buques de
transporte de contenedores que son demasiado grandes para cruzar
las esclusas del canal. ``En 1965 solo el uno por ciento de los
barcos que cruzaban el canal eran Panamax,'' dice Aleman. ``Ahora
es el 30 por ciento.''
 &HT;    Estos barcos solo caben uno detras del otro por los tramos mas
estrechos del canal, lo que aumenta la dificultad de hacer que
todos los buques crucen la via en 24 horas.
 &HT;    ``Cada vez hay mas retrasos,'' comenta Roy Newall, un agente
naviero de Colon, en la entrada atlantica del canal. Newall senala
que el retraso es una de las mayores preocupaciones de sus
clientes. ``Si un barco tiene que esperar dos, tres o cinco dias,
es una catastrofe. Llevo 30 anos aqui y no recuerdo haber tenido
nunca tantos retrasos como en los ultimos cinco anos.''
 &HT;    La PCC, dice Aleman, trata de resolver el problema. ``La
industria naviera se parece cada vez mas a la aviacion. El tiempo
es un factor vital. No se puede hacer esperar una semana a los
barcos para que crucen el canal. Hay que garantizar que confien en
que pasaran por el canal a tiempo. Por eso es que nos concentramos
en fomentar la confianza.'' Los funcionarios panamenos, afirma,
estan al tanto de la tendencia de construir barcos mayores.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, cuando termine el programa de mejoramiento, la
unica forma de aumentar la capacidad seria construir otra serie de
esclusas. En 1993, un estudio de Estados Unidos, Panama y Japon
concluyo que haran falta mas esclusas para que pasen los barcos
mayores.
 &HT;    Se construira otro canal? Con un costo probable de US$7.000
millones, nadie se apresura a tomar una decision. Se considera
pero, como dice Aleman, ``no tiene sentido acometer esa clase de
obra si no existe la demanda.''
 &HT;    Dice Newall: ``Estoy seguro de que para el 2010 o el 2015,
tendremos otro canal.'' Los navieros observan el panorama con
interes. La transicion de diciembre del ano proximo lleva al canal
no solo a manos de nuevos propietarios, sino tambien hacia un
momento de decisiones vitales.
 &HT;    Parte del interes y de la preocupacion gira en torno a las
circunstancias del cambio. La nacion mas rica del planeta
transfiere el canal a un pais pequeno y relativamente pobre. Ya hay
acusaciones de nepotismo y favoritismo en Panama. Algunos critican
al presidente Ernesto Perez Balladares de dar puestos a familiares
y aliados politicos en la junta de directores de la Autoridad del
Canal de Panama, que tomara el control cuando los norteamericanos
se vayan.
 &HT;    ``Aqui es un modo de vida. Creo que el sector esta preocupado
por el nepotismo y los sobornos y la corrupcion en esta parte del
mundo. Pienso que es una preocupacion genuina,'' dice un agente
naviero en Panama.
 &HT;    Un circo politico y una mina de oro? ``No lo creo,'' dice
Aleman, en el cargo desde 1996. El ingeniero panameno de 47 anos ha
sido nombrado director de la Autoridad del Canal de Panama hasta el
2005.
 &HT;    Hay mucha experiencia en la junta directiva de ese organismo,
afirma Aleman. Indica que de las 11 personas que integran la junta,
cuatro ya estan en la PCC; otros tres son miembros de una comision
consultora del canal, y uno trabajaba en la PCC. En cuanto a
nombramientos futuros, un presidente solo puede designar a tres
miembros nuevos cada tres anos, lo cual le dificulta llenar la
junta de favoritos.
 &HT;    ``Panama se ha comprometido de verdad a dirigir el canal con
eficiencia,'' dice Aleman.
 &HT;    Funcionarios de la industria naviera estan de acuerdo. ``No
esperamos ningun cambio. Tenemos mucha confianza,'' dice Kim
Gadegaard, vicepresidente de servicios latinoamericanos de la
naviera danesa Maersk, un gran cliente del canal.
 &HT;    El siglo proximo pondra a prueba esa confianza.

 &HT;    Post-welfare study: 55% get steady jobs
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Many people who have been denied government aid
as a result of Texas' new welfare law have found steady jobs that
pay more than the minimum wage, according to a study released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush said the survey, conducted by the Texas
Department of Human Services and researchers from Texas A&AMP;M
University, suggests that welfare time limits and work requirements
push people into jobs, not poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more compassionate to help people find a job than it is
to make them dependent on government,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the results may be skewed because those who chose
not to respond or couldn't be reached _ almost half of those in the
survey sample _ are the ones most likely to be in dire straits.
They also note that many of the jobs offer little chance of
advancement, and that the average annual salary of respondents _
about $11,100 _ is below the federal poverty standard for a family
of three, which is $13,650.
</P>
<P>
   State officials point out that when food stamps and Medicaid are
factored in, a mother who works full-time at the minimum wage earns
107 percent of the federal poverty level, as opposed to 73 percent
of the poverty level on the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Human Services Commissioner Eric Bost acknowl- edged
that the state's booming economy is at least partly responsible for
the success of those who have made the transition from welfare to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test of welfare reform will be when we have a major
downturn,'' said Chris King of the Center for the Study of Human
Resources at the University of Texas. King said Bush and President
Clinton are ``the luckiest guys in the world in terms of reforming
welfare'' because state and federal changes have corresponded with
a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Texas instituted work requirements and time limits on benefits
for welfare recipients in 1996. Under the new rules, a person is
limited to 12, 24 or 36 months on welfare, depending on their
education and work experience. After the time limit is reached,
five years must pass before a person again becomes eligible for
help. Work or job training is required for most people between the
ages of 18 and 59.
</P>
<P>
   The federal welfare reform law passed by Congress in 1996 also
includes work requirements and time limits. In addition, the
federal government now distributes a limited amount of welfare
money to each state rather than providing a bottomless pool of
money to guarantee that everybody eligible for benefits receives
them.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has a waiver to to pursue its own welfare reform plan, but
the waiver runs out in 2002. At that time, the state will have to
comply with federal rules, some of which are more strict.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials say the state's welfare caseload declined to
148,750 in September 1998, down from 285,632 in January 1994. They
attribute the drop to changes in welfare rules, a strong economy
and efforts to combat fraud. The point of the study, they say, was
to find out what happened to the people who left the welfare rolls,
as well as those who requested aid but didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers randomly chose 3,298 people from each category, and
were able to conduct telephone interviews with 1,159 of them. The
rest of the people either refused to answer the questions or
couldn't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five percent of respondents had jobs at the time of the
interview, working an average of 34 hours a week at an average
hourly wage of $6.28. The federal minimum wage is $5.15. The most
common jobs were restaurant/fast food (15 percent), clerical (13
percent), retail and sales (13 percent), nursing (12 percent) and
janitorial (6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The state's 51 percent response rate is respectable for a survey
of this kind, experts say. But it elicits the question: What
happened to the remaining 49 percent?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they didn't respond inherently raises questions
about their condition,'' said Mike Lucas, and aide to Rep. Elliott
Naishtat, D-Austin. Naishtat sat on an interim legislative
committee examining the welfare-to-work law.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas and King also questioned the quality of the jobs that many
respondents found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are these jobs going to lead them anywhere? Can they support a
family? Is there any career path here?'' King said. ``Most of these
jobs don't provide these people with further access to education
and training, and that's the huge difference between people who are
working out well and those who aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Many respondents said they needed better training and education,
better child care, or better health insurance to be able to find
jobs or advance their careers. Bush and Bost said Wednesday they
will urge the Legislature to boost child-care assistance,
strengthen child-support enforcement and allow welfare recipients
who have found a job to continue to receive benefits for some time
in order to address those concerns.

CLINTON LAWYERS REBUFFED IN FINAL APPEAL TO HOUSE PANEL
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers were rebuffed Wednesday
in their last appeal to the House Judiciary Committee, as the panel
sent them home with four proposed impeachment counts arguing the
president should be removed from office because he ``willfully
corrupted and manipulated the judicial process of the United States
for his personal gain and exoneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the White House lawyers ended an impassioned,
marathon defense against the allegations, the Judiciary Committee
released a draft impeachment resolution that charges Clinton with
two counts of perjury and one each of obstruction of justice and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency,
has betrayed his trust as president, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States,'' each article of impeachment
states. The entire case arises from the president's sex scandal
with the former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tumultuous buildup to Thursday's opening debate by the
committee on the historic charges, Chairman Henry J. Hyde, an
Illinois Republican, also cleared the way for the panel to vote on
a Democratic alternative resolution of ``censure and
condemnation.'' The proposed rebuke, in biting language, would
require Clinton to admit he has ``violated the trust of the
American people, lessened their esteem for the office of president
and dishonored the office which they have entrusted to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The competing proposals emerged as Clinton's foes and allies
sought to sway a critical group of undecided lawmakers who are
expected to decide on impeachment in the full House next week.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans became public as the White House counsel, Charles
F.C. Ruff, issued a final, emotional plea in Clinton's two-day,
21-hour defense presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Clinton's conduct was ``wrong'' and ``morally
reprehensible,'' Ruff argued that his actions fell short of meeting
the standards for the ultimate sanction of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He betrayed the trust placed in him not only by his loved ones
but by the American people,'' Ruff testified. ``But the president
has not committed a high crime or misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's prospects in the House too close call, the White
House also called a last-minute Republican witness, former
Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld, who recommended the
president be fined, censured and compelled to submit a written
apology for his misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to approve at least one, if
not all, of the impeachment counts by Saturday. If the House votes
to impeach Clinton, the resolution would be forwarded to the Senate
for the first presidential impeachment trial in 130 years and the
second ever.
</P>
<P>
   The White House assailed the timing of the draft resolution's
release as the latest injustice in an impeachment process it says
has been tainted from the start by partisan fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``After denying the president the right to see the charges
against him before offering his defense, the committee majority
decided to proceed with impeachment without even listening to his
defense,'' said James A. Kennedy, spokesman for the White House
counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the unfairness of the timing of the charges, however,
we can now say with certainty that nothing in the record, nothing
in the facts, or the law, or the Constitution or these charges
compels the Congress to take the solemn step of impeaching and
removing the president,'' Kennedy added.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fray, independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr countered a
184-page rebuttal the White House issued Tuesday that portrayed
Starr's report on the Lewinsky affair as biased. Starr issued a
statement citing ``many misleading statements in the White House
submission.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigative phase of the Judiciary Committee proceedings
is expected to reach a dramatic finale Thursday. Hyde's chief
investigator, David P. Schippers, is expected to show, for the
first time publicly, excerpts of Clinton's videotaped deposition
last January in the sexual harassment case that Paula Corbin Jones
brought against him and settled last month.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers also plans to play segments of Clinton's videotaped
testimony in August before a federal grand jury investigating the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   In both proceedings, the impeachment articles allege, Clinton
repeatedly committed perjury to cover up his illicit affair with
Lewinsky and impede justice.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed obstruction-of-justice charge cites seven instances
when Clinton attempted to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal''
evidence in the Jones case. The abuse-of-power article alleges
Clinton ``frivolously and corruptly'' invoked executive privilege
and made false and misleading statements to his Cabinet, aides and
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the impeachment resolution charges that Clinton
made false statements when he responded in an affidavit to 81
questions from the committee asking him to admit aspects of the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Each count concludes: ``William Jefferson Clinton, by such
conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office
and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust
or profit under the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats quickly issued a 13-page response to the
draft resolution, citing rebuttals that ``erode the foundation for
the majority's allegations and establish that there is no basis for
an impeachment of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Several committee Democrats, while conceding the GOP majority on
the panel will prevail on at least one count of the impeachment
resolution, focused on the censure proposal. One of the plan's
chief architects, Representative William D. Delahunt of Quincy, had
been the first committee member to announce he would seek a censure
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said Hyde's agreement to allow a vote on the measure,
after first indicating he would block such a vote, could be
critical to resolving the protracted impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be our last opportunity to avoid going over the
precipice and triggering a genuine constitutional crisis,''
Delahunt said in a statement with his Democratic co-sponsors,
Representatives Rick Boucher of Virginia and Tom Barrett of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is expected to be thwarted by the panel's Republican
majority. But by allowing the committee vote, several Democrats
said Hyde effectively increased pressure on GOP leaders to permit a
vote in the full House, which many lawmakers favor as a way to
sanction Clinton without the trauma of a protracted Senate trial
and a possible transition of power if he were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the censure proposal could argue that standard
House procedures dictate a measure that fails to pass the committee
should not be considered by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.3l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The censure movement received a boost Wednesday when a key
moderate Republican, Representative Amo Houghton of New York,
announced he will oppose impeachment and called on GOP leaders to
help push for an alternative such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.3l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The lame duck House speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said he
will play no role in the impeachment matter, other than to vote
when the resolution reaches the House floor. ``I'm not getting near
that,'' Gingrich said in a brief interview. ``It's entirely up to
Livingston,'' he added, referring to the speaker-designate, Robert
L. Livingston of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.3l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has not committed whether to allow a censure vote,
although the majority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, whom Livingston has
effectively designated to oversee the impeachment process through
the House, staunchly opposes the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 31 Democrats who voted with every Republican
House member in September to launch the open-ended inquiry sent
Livingston a letter Wednesday denouncing Clinton's actions as
``immoral, reckless and harmful to our nation'' but not
impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, led by Representative Tim Roemer of Indiana,
called on Livingston to allow a ``vote for an alternative form of
punishment, such as a resolution to censure the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Roemer, in an interview, accused GOP leaders of ``cajoling and
arm-twisting'' lawmakers to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House tried to bolster anti-impeachment sentiment by
calling Weld, a former US attorney for Massachusetts, and several
other former federal prosecutors to testify that Clinton's actions
were not impeachable and also would not warrant criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is a loser,'' said Richard J. Davis, a former
Watergate prosecutor who also served as assistant Treasury
Secretary for enforcement under President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans stood by their proposed charges, however,
citing numerous allegations of false and misleading statements by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Wisconsin Representative F. James Sensenbrenner
Jr., who asked: ``Who's going to stand up for the truth here?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee on
Wednesday formally called for President Clinton's removal from
office in four draft articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of
perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed charges were disclosed even before the White House
had finished presenting its two-day defense of the president to the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the White House, top Democrats and a handful
of Republicans intensified their push to let the full House vote
next week on censuring the president as an alternative to
impeachment. But Republican leaders are resisting such a vote,
fearing it would siphon some moderate Republicans from voting for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In harshly worded language, the proposed articles pushed beyond
the grounds for impeachment outlined in the Starr report sent to
Congress three months ago, which accused the president of lying
under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, of
obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   But Judiciary Republicans folded the many allegations into four
counts: two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice
and one count of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury count was divided into two parts, one on the
president's testimony to the federal grand jury and one for his
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case. The split was
devised to address the concerns of some Republicans who are
reluctant to support a charge of perjury stemming from a civil
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of this,'' the eight-page draft of the articles
concluded, ``William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the integrity
of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, has
betrayed his trust as president, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which had for weeks demanded to know the
specific charges the Judiciary Committee was considering in order
to prepare its defense, immediately dismissed them as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the articles, there's nothing in the
allegations, there's nothing in the record, there's nothing in the
Constitution that brings anything here up to the standard of an
impeachable offense,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   And committee Democrats immediately issued a 13-page rebuttal to
the articles of impeachment, denouncing the Republicans for issuing
the charges before the committee begins hearing closing arguments
on Thursday. Charge by charge, the rebuttal attacks the credibility
of several witnesses, pointedly assailing Ms. Lewinsky's testimony
on several different matters.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed articles of impeachment will form the basis for the
committee's deliberations this week. On Thursday, the investigative
counsel for the Republicans, David Schippers, plans to show
Clinton's videotaped deposition in the Jones case as part of his
closing arguments. His Democratic counterpart, Abbe Lowell, also
will give a summation on Thursday. On Friday, the 37-member panel
begins debating the articles and is almost certain to vote along
party lines for impeachment by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the panel's draft articles capped an extraordinary
two days of testimony by the president's top lawyers and legal
scholars and former federal prosecutors who argued that Clinton's
misleading statements and misconduct in the Lewinsky affair did not
rise to the level of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Few opinions were swayed as sharp exchanges marked the hearings,
with committee Republicans challenging Clinton's representatives
over and over to acknowledge that the President had committed
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., was among those who pushed the
president's defenders for more information. ``Your presentation has
helped point us to the portions of that record before us that you
believe are relevant to your client's defense,'' Canady said. ``But
let me say that I am still frustrated by what I consider to be
legal arguments that don't really meet the test of common sense and
human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In a counterattack, committee Democrats issued a censure
alternative that would condemn the president for ``making false
statements concerning his reprehensible conduct'' and wrongly
taking steps to ``delay the discovery of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic censure proposal _ drafted by Reps. Rick Boucher
of Virginia, Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts and Tom Barrett of
Wisconsin _ also states that Clinton ``remains subject to criminal
and civil penalties for this conduct.'' Clinton would be obligated
to sign the censure. The proposed wording does not include
imposition of a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the committee chairman, said he would allow a
committee vote on the measure, but then added that he would vote
against it. Even the measure's sponsors conceded that censure has
no chance of passing the Republican-controlled panel. But Democrats
voiced hope it would win enough support from moderate Republicans
to force Republican leaders to allow a floor vote on some form of
censure.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum for censure received a boost from a prominent
Republican, former Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, who
announced his own version of an alternative at the committee
hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's plan, which White House officials said they did not know
of in advance, mirrors the Democratic alternative, but would also
include a fine to penalize Clinton for his misconduct. Democrats
say they would be open to the president's negotiating a fine, to
get around constitutional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of the House would be upheld if something like
that were to be approached,'' said Weld, who testified in defense
of the president on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant shift, the White House moved from a crouch to
aggressive support of a censure option. ``The president's general
position is that he's done something blameworthy,'' Lockhart said.
``If members of Congress want to come to him with an idea short of
impeachment, it's something he would consider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the majority of the House wants a vehicle to vote on some
other option than impeachment, then they should be given that,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to comment on the details of any censure
motion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who support a censure option still face an uphill battle.
Rep. Robert Livingston, the speaker-designate, has not ruled out a
censure vote on the floor, but the Republican whip, Rep. Tom DeLay,
is actively blocking any attempt to let lawmakers vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 31 Democrats who in October voted for the
Republican impeachment inquiry resolution _ Tim J. Roemer of
Indiana, Ellen Tauscher of California and Jim Moran of Virginia _
collected signatures from the group for a letter to Livingston,
urging a floor vote on a censure motion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic
leader, started calling the 31 Democrats to see how they would vote
on impeachment. Between three and five Democrats might vote for
impeachment, Democratic aides say, meaning that 14 to 16
Republicans would have to oppose impeachment to kill it on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, the Democratic whip, was calling to make sure
all Democrats _ even those who are retiring or who lost re-election
bids _ are planning to return for next week's momentous vote on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The draft documents were released as the White House counsel,
Charles Ruff, was finishing an eloquently meticulous defense of why
Clinton should not be removed from office for his admitted
misconduct in the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said the timing of the release of
the articles of impeachment was clear evidence of the partisan
nature of the judiciary proceedings and of closed-mindedness on the
part of the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hearing room after the proceedings, Hyde told
reporters that he planned to vote for all four articles of
impeachment, and he predicted that at least one of the perjury
counts would be approved by the full committee.
</P>
<P>
   The first article in the drafts charges Clinton with perjury
before the grand jury on Aug. 17, and outlines four accusations.
Among them, Clinton is charged with ``false and misleading
testimony'' about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and his
efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses in the Jones sexual
misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   The second article on perjury charges Clinton with signing an
affidavit in the Jones case on Dec. 23, 1997, pledging to tell the
truth and then lying about whether he had a sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. The article also accuses the president of giving
false statements under oath in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The third article of impeachment accuses Clinton of obstructing
justice in an effort to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal the
existence of evidence'' in the Jones case. The article lists seven
acts that the Republican committee staff believes bolster the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on Dec. 17, the article charges, Clinton
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky, who is not named in the draft, to lie in a
sworn statement and to give false testimony. The article also
accuses the president of helping create a plan to hide evidence _
the gifts that he gave Ms. Lewinsky _ and of successfully pressing
to get Ms. Lewinsky a new job in New York to buy her silence in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article of impeachment charges that the president
``misused and abused his office,'' laying out four instances. Among
them, the article charges, is that Clinton lied to the American
people, gave false and misleading statements to White House aides
and his Cabinet officers, and ``frivolously asserted'' executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The committee reorganized the 11 main charges contained in the
report by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. In addition, the
committee added at least three supporting instances.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice article, the committee charged
that Clinton did not correct his lawyer, Robert Bennett, during the
Jones deposition, when Bennett asserted that Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit proved that ``no sex of any kind'' had occurred and
should foreclose any questioning of Clinton on that matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the article alleging abuse of power, the committee added the
accusation that the president lied to the American public and that
the president committed perjury by lying in his answers to 81
questions submitted by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These four articles of impeachment reflect the evidence we
have had before us and the testimony we have had before us,'' said
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have tentatively set aside Dec. 16
through Dec. 19 for debate and votes, Republican aides said.

 &HT;    Scientists seek more detail in global weather forecasts
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The dramatic flip-flop from the withering
drought of this year's long, hot summer to October's sudden
historic floods could have been no more than the usual feast or
famine of Texas weather.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists say the flip-flop also fits a tentative forecast
for global warming: more weather extremes, from dryer drys to
wetter wets, and a particularly heavy increase in rainfall in many
parts of the world because warmer air holds more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the computer climate models that make such
predictions contain too few of the multitude of things that
influence climate _ and too many built-in fudge factors _ to be
wholly reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Working to improve those models is James Famiglietti, an
assistant professor of geological sciences at the University of
Texas. He is using ground observations and satellite imagery to
enhance the climate model of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder model and a similar one developed by German
scientists are considered the most reliable in predicting the
weather effects of global warming _ changes in climate tied to
accumulation in the atmosphere of gases from the burning of coal,
oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the climate models now,'' Famiglietti said,
``is that they have no rivers in them. They began as atmospheric
models only. The frontier of modeling is coupling the atmosphere to
the influence of the oceans and the surface water of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite continued debate in Congress on global warming,
scientists are steadily amassing evidence that it already may be
under way, including a recent finding that the 1990s have been the
warmest decade in 600 years.
</P>
<P>
   But, as tempting as it is to see last summer in Texas as more
proof of global warming, it only tied for fifth place in the number
of 100- or 100-plus-degree days _ 33. The most such days on record
in Texas came in 1923 with 66, according to the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   And the prediction that global warming will produce flip-flops
from one weather extreme to another in Texas and elsewhere is
little more than a hunch that global warming researchers share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of one simulation that says the cycles will be more
extreme,'' said Gerald North, chairman of the meteorology
department at Texas A&AMP;M University. ``But another model found the
opposite. The models have too much play in them. You need to narrow
them down (to) constrain the fudge factors.''
</P>
<P>
   To help constrain them, Famiglietti is trying to do on a global
scale what David Maidment, director of UT's Center for Research in
Water Resources, is doing regionally.
</P>
<P>
   Maidment and his colleagues are working to improve flood
forecasting by creating the first precision digital map of Texas
terrain elevations and their influence on runoff into creeks and
rivers. Radar rainfall measurements by the National Weather
Service, for instance, now focus only on areas of 1.24 miles,
called rainfall cells.
</P>
<P>
   The digital map will sharpen the focus so the weather service
can measure the runoff effect of rainfall on terrain-elevation
cells as small as 97.5 feet in area.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Famiglietti is trying to use satellite imagery and
ground surveys to reduce the 155-mile area focus of most global
climate models to as little as 31 miles, which should improve
forecasting of the hydrological cycle, or movement of water from
evaporation into the atmosphere and back again in the form of rain
and other precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Famiglietti also plans to use data gathered by the twin GRACE,
or Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment, satellites whose
international development is being coordinated by UT's Center for
Space Research.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites, built by German scientists and set for launch by
Russian ones in 2001, will monitor the climate-influencing effects
of ocean circulation and evaporation from rivers, lakes and
reservoirs by measuring tiny variations in the planet's
gravitational field.
</P>
<P>
   But improving the climate models ultimately will depend on
advances in computer technology. Even today's fast processing
speeds and large computer memories aren't enough for a global
climate model focused as finely as 31 miles in area to forecast for
longer than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Famiglietti, who is from Rhode Island, would
just as soon not see any more global-warming hints in Texas
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope we're not in for more summers like this (last)
one,'' he said.

A FAMILIAR CHALLENGE FOR JANKOVICH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ They know nothing of the athletic
department turmoil of the past three years, or of the burdensome
budgetary restraints. They've never heard of Michael Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   They know nothing about Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   But those who have worked for Sam Jankovich know one thing about
CSUN's athletic program:
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the mess may be, Jankovich will clean it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a doer, a guy that gets things done,'' University of
Miami men's basketball coach Leonard Hamilton said. ``He's
extremely focused, very thorough. He has a great feeling for solid
issues and for dealing with all different aspects of an athletic
department. It won't take him long to figure out what the problems
are at Northridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Named CSUN's interim athletic director Dec. 1, Jankovich has
seven months to work his magic on a program trying to push itself
into the quasi big-time, only to continually bumble and stumble
over itself.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich's former employees at Washington State University and
at the University of Miami speak of his ability to sway public
perception and raise funds, to build a network of individuals who
remain supportive after 20 years, of a no-nonsense approach that
doesn't tolerate complacency or failure.
</P>
<P>
   And they speak of a man with vision, and of a man with the
capacity to implement a plan that should carry CSUN through the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't always agree with his methods, but I agreed with what
got done,'' former Washington State football coach Jim Walden said.
``If you got your feelings hurt along the way, it didn't matter.
All I know is he got it done. He doesn't back up to get a paycheck.
Not everyone will like him, but those that like him will work hard
for him and be better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich is 64 years old and, admittedly, this is his last
significant undertaking in collegiate athletics. It doesn't mean
he's any less ornery, or tough, than he was 22 years ago when he
was named athletic director at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich's guidelines are simple: work hard and together, be
honest, perform within the rules and communicate _ or else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give everybody an opportunity, but they're going
to have to perform under these ground rules,'' Jankovich said.
``People who don't want to perform under those ground rules, this
isn't going to be the place for them because we're not going to
saddle somebody coming in here in six, seven or eight months from
now who is going to inherit a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes surprises. But the big problem you're faced to
deal with is that small problem that nobody addresses, and it
develops into a cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jankovich CSUN's chemotherapy. He was brought in after
Paul Bubb resigned last month in the wake of Abraham's arrest by
the FBI for alleged crack cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb came under scrutiny when it was learned former players
approached him nearly two years before Abraham's arrest, voicing
concern about their coach's behavior and a possible tie to drugs.
Bubb said he investigated and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the many gaffes Jankovich, an eloquent and
persuasive speaker, must fix. He must revive the program's public
image and somehow build support for a program that dropped four of
its men's sports _ only to reinstate them later _ in the spring of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among the financial problems he faces, the football program's
might be the worst. Trapped in an outdated, undersized stadium and
limited by an unheard of $5,000 recruiting budget, Jankovich must
find a way to continue the program's rise in Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just some of the problems. Gender equity issues
and the constant search for money plague the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving to put stability in the short term and permanence
in the long-term appointment of an athletic director,'' CSUN
president Blenda Wilson said. ``What we need is a full-fledged, in
place, athletic director willing to make a commitment to work seven
or 10 hours a day, or whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been on the job for nine days, not long enough to identify,
in detail, what is wrong at the school. But before he leaves the
post June 30, 1999 _ or later if finding a successor takes longer _
he wants to set up an agenda on how to run the department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASSESSING PRIORITIES
</P>
<P>
   CSUN wants to build new athletic facilities for football,
baseball, softball and intramurals, but surrounding neighbors are
resisting. The Big Sky Conference has mandated CSUN to build a new
football facility. The penalty for not doing so, in the most severe
case, could be expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   This situation is nothing new for Jankovich.
</P>
<P>
   When he began his seven-year tenure at Washington State in 1976,
the Cougars' football team played in a 27,600-seat stadium. With
growing fear the NCAA would institute a rule mandating Division I
programs play in a stadium with a capacity of at least 30,000,
Jankovich pushed to expand the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents wanted to use the funds elsewhere, and said the
residue of expanding the stadium would adversely affect the
baseball and track programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got resistance from nearly everyone,'' Walden, the former
Cougars football coach, said. ``When it was all said and done,
Washington State had a state-of-the art track, a beautiful baseball
field and a football field that sat 40,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich was creative in financing the venture, enticing local
businesses to donate time, money and services so the project
wouldn't be financed solely with cash.
</P>
<P>
   A $250,000 donation was given by the Martin family, for which
the football stadium is named, but a final figure wasn't totaled
because much of the construction was done through gift-of-kind
contributions, Washington State assistant athletic director of
communications Rod Commons said.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the three athletic venues also solidified
Washington State's standing in the Pacific-10 Conference _ which
was in jeopardy, Commons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of a visionary. He knew what it would take at
Washington State to get the job done,'' Commons said. ``He put the
first buyout clause in a contract. When Warren Powers was coach he
put in a clause saying if Warren was to leave he would owe the
school money, and if he was fired the school had to pay him. It
gave Sam protection.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STEPPING UP
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich parlayed his success at Washington State into the
athletic director's job at Miami. In 1983 he left for Coral Gables,
where he built the Hurricanes into one of the most feared, most
hated, and most successful programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most know about the three national championships in football,
but there were national championships in baseball, men's tennis,
women's tennis and women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jankovich resurrected the men's basketball program after a
15-year absence and had the Hurricanes join the Big East
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under his watch a lot of things changed for us,'' Miami
president Edward T. Foote II said. ``He's a strong athletic
director.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich also unified a frayed athletic department, primarily
through his intense, aggressive fund-raising policy.
</P>
<P>
   The year before his arrival at Miami, the school's athletic
fund-raising efforts brought in $750,000. One of the first things
Jankovich did was organize a booster club for the athletic program,
and not for individual sports. Five years into Jankovich's regime
Miami's fund-raising efforts brought in $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will immediately take (the Northridge) community and work
it,'' said Larry Wahl, Miami's senior assistant director for
communications and executive producer of Hurricanes Productions.
``Everyone in the community will know him. When he came here we had
three different athletic departments; a baseball department, a
football department and the rest of the athletic department. Sam
changed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich hopes for a comparable turnaround at CSUN. Michael
Rehm, CSUN's assistant athletic director/development and the
school's point man on fund raising, said Northridge raised $340,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
   With 1.3 million people in the San Fernando Valley and several
opportunities for corporate support, Jankovich figures CSUN's
budget woes can be cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think fund raising has to be (a big part of this),''
Jankovich said. ``I have to learn more about the marketplace, but
with the population I can't help but think (it should be better). I
have to see what they have in place, and how they're doing it. I
would anticipate there would be some changes about the approach,
and what has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich also pioneered the current way athletic departments
deal with shoe and apparel companies while at Miami. Instead of
individual coaches signing with companies, Jankovich struck a deal
with a sneaker company to outfit all of Miami's teams and wrote a
portion of it into coaches' contracts.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jankovich's tenure at Miami was not perfect. The NCAA
noted several major infractions, including the distribution of
excessive financial aid to athletes, a fraudulent use of Pell
Grants, improper employment of football players during the school
year and a lack of institutional control.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Reed, chancellor of the Cal State University system,
worked with Jankovich in Florida's state system and pushed for his
hire at CSUN because the good heavily offset the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got someone who knows what they're doing,'' Reed said in
understating the issue. ``In the sports business, he has a great
network that will work well at Northridge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUITED TO THE TASK
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, who resides in Hayden Lake, Idaho, comes from the
big-time but understands the Big Sky Conference. He is a University
of Montana graduate and a former Grizzlies assistant football
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich molded Washington State and Miami in his personality,
though his stayover as CEO of the New England Patriots, which
lasted from 1990 to 1992, was short-lived. He hired
ultra-successful Syracuse coach Dick MacPherson to coach the
Patriots, but both met the same fate. The professional game
differed greatly from college, and neither man lasted in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't detract from Jankovich's accomplishments at the
collegiate level. Instead, it fueled the thinking Jankovich was
best suited as a college administrator.
</P>
<P>
   It's why college presidents, trustees and athletic directors
continue to lean on him. Nearly a decade after Jankovich left
Miami, he's still active with the school, working as a consultant
on Miami's $35 million civic center.
</P>
<P>
   He also has done consulting work for San Diego State, the
University of Tulsa, Temple, Arizona State, the University of
Oklahoma and the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich's stay at CSUN is expected to last seven or so months.
At $9,334 per month the school is paying more than it has
historically for an athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the investment matures the dividends are expected
to be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich won't just outline what must be done for the athletic
department to succeed 20 years down the line, he will meticulously
detail and document what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   He'll conduct more interviews than Ken Starr, at a fraction of
the cost. Jankovich pledges to talk with students,
student-athletes, coaches, administrators, former athletes, alumni,
community leaders and anyone else who will offer an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The title is interim, but Jankovich wields the power to make
changes to a program in dire need of change. He will ask the
questions and provide the comprehensive answers that have some
coaches at CSUN shaking in anticipation of what might happen, while
others rejoice in the long-awaited arrival of such a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a colorful, fun, interesting person. He's hard-working,
very intense,'' Foote said. ``If it can be done, Sam's the guy to
do it.''

GUSTS PUSH BLAZE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. -- Santa Ana winds fueled a brush fire that
burned at least 30 acres in Glendale's Brand Park on Wednesday
afternoon, putting residents of the Hillcrest Avenue neighborhood
on edge, but not getting close enough to threaten their homes,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire crawled up the hillside quickly after it started around
3:20 p.m. Fortunately, about an hour into the fire the high winds
that had been gusting in the community north of Los Angeles since
noon started to die down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the winds continued to grow it could have been a problem,''
said Glendale Fire Department Capt. Eric Indermill.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters expected to contain the blaze during the night, but
were concerned high winds might pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were about a quarter-mile away from homes, and
residents who live nearby started preparing to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Susan DiCato, who has lived in the community since 1986, said
she packed her Ford Explorer with precious belongings and dropped
them off on the front yard of a friend. DiCato was scared because
the winds had been so high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a mini-tornado and then the fire started,'' DiCato
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lynch, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said she has
never seen a fire get so close to her home. The high winds woke her
up from a nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got up and started to make some nachos and I thought this
cheese smells like smoke,'' Lynch said. Then the phone rang and a
neighbor told Lynch that the hills were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Zakarian rushed home from work in Southern California's
City of Industry after his niece called to tell him about the fire.
He packed up his car with family photos and his best suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took all the pictures. The rest you can replace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was confident firefighters had the blaze under control,
he did run back in the house for something he forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I better take some underwear for tomorrow,'' Zakarian said.
``Just in case.''

DETOUR ON THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After James Hamm got dumped by the invertebrates running Arizona
State University, I decided to look around for a profession that
wouldn't automatically reject an articulate man with degrees from
college and law school only because he also happened to have killed
another human being in cold blood.
</P>
<P>
   And I found one.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Hamm to follow up on this, of course. But since
university officials decided a convicted murderer is not morally,
ethically and spiritually equipped to teach a couple of classes,
Hamm can enter vocational training for a less blindly restrictive
profession.
</P>
<P>
   The clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that is possible,'' said Rabbi David Rebibo. I'd been
sent to him by administrators at the Phoenix Hebrew Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patriarchs, our forefathers, used to be idol worshipers,''
Rebibo said. ``They changed. Any person who recognizes the wrong he
does, and takes appropriate action, expresses regret, learns,
progresses, can see a black paper made white.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is said in classical Judaism that the idea of repentance
was created before the world, before man, because God knew how we
would be, and repentance was the therapy for man to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Coffelt from the Presbyterian Church's Arizona Presbytery,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disturbed by what happened in the Hamm case,'' he
said. &QL; 
SOME RULES APPLY
</P>
<P>
   Coffelt said a man convicted of murder who was interested in the
ministry would first have to be a member of a church. He'd have to
get their governing body to endorse him, then apply to the
presbytery for permission to enter the three-year program for
becoming a minister. After that, a congregation would have to hire
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I was told the same thing by the Arizona Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been former felons who have graduated from the
seminary,'' said the convention's Sandy de Jesus. ``Something like
that wouldn't automatically disqualify an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   A man with Hamm's background also could become a Catholic
priest, depending upon where he'd like to practice.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to enter a monastery, it would be no problem. To
become a parish priest, however, he'd need approval from the office
of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to be practical,'' said Father Paul Orel of the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Phoenix. ``We recognize that we have human
beings who, in the ideal, should be merciful, loving and forgiving
in their hearts. But sometimes in practical ways they aren't there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at ASU, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And not among all the churchgoers who left less-than-Christian
comments concerning Hamm on my voice mail. Some of them probably
don't believe a man declared unqualified to teach the laws of man
would be permitted to teach the laws of God. &QL; 
The gospel story
</P>
<P>
   But there's a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   You may have learned in Sunday school about another murderer who
landed an important job. His name was Saul. The story goes that,
years ago, in Jerusalem, Saul and some pals participated in the
stoning death of a very nice man named Stephen. Saul then hired
himself out as a kind of vigilante, rounding up Christians.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as he approached the city of Damascus, Saul was said to
have been struck by a shaft of light from heaven, and called upon
by God to preach the gospel. And he did. He changed his name to
Paul, traveled and wrote ``letters'' that become the cornerstone of
the New Testament. And he became a saint.
</P>
<P>
   James Hamm is no saint. He's not looking to become a priest or
minister or rabbi. And he doesn't deserve redemption. All he
deserves, from having served his time in prison and improved
himself, is the benefit of the doubt. The chance to stand in front
of a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the dictionary translations for the word ``rabbi,''
there's one that seems to apply here more than others:
``Teacher.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The rules governing impeachment are like an
interstate highway: clearly marked, but with lots of possible exits
into more uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   Although approval of one or more articles of impeachment by the
House Judiciary Committee this week seems almost certain, almost
nothing else is. The pitfalls of politics seem likely to bring
detours from the impeachment road map set out in the Constitution,
congressional rules and precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold onto your hats, it could be a bumpy ride,'' Senate
Parliamentarian Robert Dove said.
</P>
<P>
   Expect minority Democrats in the full House to try to get a vote
on a measure that would censure, rather than impeach, President
Clinton. With the help of some Republicans, that maneuver on what
is called a ``motion to recommit'' could stop the impeachment
process cold. There also could be a move in the House to block the
appointment of ``managers'' of the impeachment trial, a requirement
before the Senate could hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Twists and turns aside, a simple majority vote on one or more
articles of impeachment would send the case to the Senate. The
House is also required to appoint those managers, traditionally
members of the House, who will act as prosecutors of the case. When
President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868, the House voted in
seven managers, said George Washington University history Professor
Leo Ribuffo.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then would vote to allow the managers to read the
articles and form itself into a court of impeachment, where the
chief justice of the Supreme Court presides. Once the Senate
becomes an impeachment court, its normal rules, such as the
filibuster, do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Such a vote could happen as soon as Jan. 8, Dove said.
</P>
<P>
   Things could get kind of weird in the Senate, though, Ribuffo
said. There, a simple majority vote can change the rules: for
example, the rule that says senators cannot talk during any
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that 100 senators will sit silent like jurors is
just wacky. It defies logic,'' Ribuffo said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Dove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can change the rules, but they almost never do,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   While the chief justice presides, he doesn't have the final say.
When Johnson was tried, the Senate overruled him 17 times, said
Ribuffo.
</P>
<P>
   The case might not even get that far. Ribuffo says the Senate
could simply decide not to hear the matter on the grounds that the
House was incorrect, an opinion that Dove disputes. Or it could
decide that the articles of impeachment expire with the current
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That situation is unlikely, many scholars agree, because there
is ample precedent of one Congress impeaching a government official
and another Congress trying that official. Probably the best known
example is that of Florida Judge Alcee Hastings, who was impeached
by the House in 1988 despite his acquittal in a court trial, and
convicted by the Senate in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His case is also famous because the Senate declined to impose a
political ``death penalty'' _ a separate vote the Senate can take
to bar the politician from a position of honor, trust or profit for
life. U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, a Democrat, was elected to Congress
in 1992 and still serves. He will vote on the Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that impeachment is largely a political
process that only mimics a legal one, and anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to know the deals being discussed in the
background,'' Ribuffo said. ``The public show of the Judiciary
Committee doesn't tell us much.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when the committee voted to impeach President Nixon,
the background drama being played out was the eventually successful
effort to get him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do anything they want,'' Ribuffo said. &QL;

CLAIBORNE NAMED ALL-AMERICAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker Chris Claiborne continued to add to
his lists of honors Wednesday by making the American Football
Coaches Association All-American team.
</P>
<P>
   The honor keeps Claiborne on pace to be USC's first unanimous
All-American. The last Trojan to become a consensus All-American
was wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne has two more All-American teams to make before
officially becoming a unanimous All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne will attend USC's team banquet tonight, then take a
red-eye flight to Orlando for Friday's Butkus Award presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii update: Defensive coordinator Bill Young's chances for
the University of Hawaii job improved Wednesday, after Utah coach
Ron McBride pulled out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Young, San Diego Chargers interim coach June Jones
and Arizona assistant Duane Akina as the top candidates for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii interviewed Jones, who is currently considered the
leading candidate, on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Young has been told he would hear from Hawaii by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Practice canceled: With academics causing about 15 players to
miss practice, USC decided to cancel Wednesday's session. The
Trojans will be off until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rest will be good for wide receiver R. Jay Soward, who
tweaked his ankle in last weekend's practice but will return
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Aaron Williams has been bothered by a strained
Achilles' tendon but is expected to return to practice before the
Sun Bowl. Florida State fan: USC tailback Chad Morton is confident
that No. 2-ranked Florida State will defeat No. 1-ranked Tennessee
in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He's believed the Seminoles were the nation's top team since the
Trojans lost, 30-10, in Tallahassee in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stick to that pick until the season is over,''
Morton said. ``I always thought they should be at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton is also lamenting that the Trojans ground game was not
nearly as successful as Miami tailback Edgerrin James, who rushed
for 299 yards against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that if we had more chances to run the ball, we would
have done better, but we had to start playing catchup right away,''
Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   New awards: USC will hold its football banquet tonight, and
coach Paul Hackett has added three awards _ linemen of the year,
top scout team players and special teams player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   TC-who?: Hackett was still a little unsure about Sun Bowl
opponent Texas Christian, because USC had not received game film
until late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about them except they're a good running
team,'' Hackett said.

UCLA HANDS OUT FOOTBALL HONORS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several area athletes were honored Wednesday at
UCLA's postseason banquet at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Senior center Shawn Stuart, from Saugus, won for all-around
excellence (the Paul Wellman Memorial) and academic achievement
(Jack R. Robinson Award).
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Gabe Crecion, of Northridge, was honored for
outstanding performance by a scout team player (Charles Pike
Memorial).
</P>
<P>
   And tailback Mark Reynosa, of Sylmar, received the Terry Donahue
Award for achievement by a walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other honorees were quarterback Cade McNown and safety
Larry Atkins, who shared the Red Sanders Award for most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Starting nose guard Micah Webb has a torn medial
collateral ligament in his left knee and will not play in the Rose
Bowl. Freshman Ken Kocher probably will start in Webb's place.
</P>
<P>
   Wait and see: Coach Bob Toledo returned from a recruiting trip
Wednesday and said he'll evaluate the future of beleaguered
defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti after the Rose Bowl _ as he
usually does with his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season's over, we'll discuss it,'' Toledo said. &QL;

WHAT'S BEHIND THE VACCO CASE? MORE THAN A SINGLE ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: NY-VACCO-ELECTION) 
 (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In politics, the partisan warfare usually ends the
day after the election, when candidates metamorphose into courtly
ladies and gentlemen, dutifully uttering pleasantries about their
opponents, and move on. But after a race that he apparently lost by
the slimmest of margins, Attorney General Dennis Vacco has refused
to stand down, even as he suffers repeated setbacks, as he did
Wednesday, in his stubborn quest for resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, in challenging the outcome of the balloting, Vacco, a
Republican, is seeking to avoid becoming one of the few statewide
officials in New York to be ousted after a single term. Yet there
are also other, more purely political motivations in play, in the
view of some analysts and participants in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership seems to be trying to taint the
ostensible victory by the Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, in
an effort to undercut his tenure and stoke resentment among upstate
Republicans. The party is also using the Vacco case to hone its
longstanding attacks on the way elections are conducted in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, though, even Vacco's aides acknowledge privately
that he is bruising his reputation. Democrats deride him as the
sorest of losers, a graceless politician who has reacted to his
defeat by throwing a legal temper tantrum. Some Republican
consultants grumble about the image that he and the party are
presenting.
</P>
<P>
   In the final unofficial count, Vacco trailed Spitzer by 26,011
votes out of 4.2 million cast, one of the closest statewide races
in New York in this century. Facing such a margin, the incumbent's
camp has adopted a variety of tactics to discredit the results in
the Democratic stronghold of New York City, raising the specter of
voting by the ineligible (illegal immigrants), as well as the
incorporeal (the dead).
</P>
<P>
   This week, Vacco's lawyers have argued unsuccessfully that there
was so much fraud that police officers should be required to fan
out across the city to verify the registration of tens of thousands
of voters. That move quickly highlighted the risk in his tactics:
many Democrats contended that the Republicans were seeking to
intimidate black and Hispanic voters in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Even Vacco's Republican ally, Gov. George Pataki, has kept his
distance, saying that he was concerned about discouraging people
from taking part in elections.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief time in elective office, Vacco, a former U.S.
Attorney in Buffalo, has occasionally seemed to lack political
sophistication. Early in his tenure, he famously said that suing
the tobacco companies for health-care costs would be like suing
milk producers for high cholesterol. The attorney general's refusal
to concede this election may be an instance of him relying more on
prosecutorial instincts _ win a case at all costs _ than political
ones.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle behind the Vacco effort comes from the Republican
State Committee, which in recent years has cultivated a reputation
for dogged fund-raising and organizing. In this election, though,
the Republicans were somewhat humbled, as Sen. Alfonse D'Amato went
down to defeat, Pataki won by less than expected and the state
Assembly remained solidly in Democratic control.
</P>
<P>
   If Spitzer is certified the winner, it will be the final
embarrassment for Republican Chairman William D. Powers, a former
marine who rebuilt the party after it fell into disarray in the
late 1980s. One way to cushion such a blow would be to depict
Spitzer's victory and tenure as irrevocably sullied by city
chicanery. That might also help Vacco with upstate voters if he
chooses to run for another office or seek his old job in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, the Republicans repeatedly tried to stir
ill will among upstate residents toward the city _ without much
success, say some political strategists _ so such a motive in the
skirmish over the balloting would not be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hoping that if they muddy the waters with this
election, they might have a step up four years from now,'' said
George Arzt, a spokesman for Spitzer. It is not clear, though,
whether such a tactic will work. In 2002, how many people will
remember how this race was decided? Who recalls that Karen Burstein
was Vacco's opponent in 1994?
</P>
<P>
   Vacco and Powers have declined to speak to reporters in recent
days. But on Tuesday, Powers issued a statement decrying the
Democratic criticism. He said the Democrats were trying to scare
and mislead people about Vacco's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats would rather divide New Yorkers than follow the
law,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like many Republican leaders, Vacco and Powers seem to have a
simmering mistrust of election practices in New York City. It has
become doctrine in some Republican circles that the Democrats use
their overwhelming majority in many city neighborhoods to
manipulate the balloting in close races. (Democrats have their own
complaints about Republican tactics in Republican bastions like
Nassau County.)
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the Republicans believe that even if they lose
their challenge to the Spitzer vote, they will at least have
demonstrated that the party intends to keep scrutinizing election
practices in the city. And by using technology like computer
databases to evaluate the voter rolls, as they have done in this
case, they are showing that there are new ways of ferreting out
possible misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The background of this litigation is the deep suspicion that
the Republican Party has had about elections in the city,'' said
Lawrence Mandelker, an election lawyer who works for the party but
is not involved in the Vacco challenge. ``There is this ongoing
series of operations designed to convince the Democrats that they
are not out there alone, that somebody is watching them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Powers put it another way. The Democratic
Party, he said, ``is not interested in determining in a fair and
objective way if our right to vote as citizens was illegally
diluted.''
