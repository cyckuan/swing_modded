<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's intellectuals on
DPA288WSD006S05PEQU03:0003:001316
Tuesday held a mass rally to declare solidarity with the
country's leading singer and composer Marcel Khalife accused of
allegedly insulting Islam.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of journalists, writers and politicians participated
in the rally, which was held at the headquarters of the
country's Press Association in Beirut, and signed a petition.
</P>
<P>
They said in the petition that the signatories assumed
responsibility for helping Khalife produce an album for which
he was facing blasphemy charges for including a Koranic verse
in one of his songs.
</P>
<P>
"If they decide to try Khalife, we will all go with him,"
novelist Elias Khouri told the rally.
</P>
<P>
Khalife, 49, is renowned in both Lebanon and the Arab
world. His songs were particularly popular among young Lebanese
during the country's 15-year civil war that ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Beirut's investigating magistrate Abdelrahman
Shihab accused Khalife of insulting Islam by incorporating verses
of the Koran into his song "Oh Father, It is I, Youssef."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he faced a similar charge for the same song,
which is included in his 1995 album "Arabic Coffeepot", but
pressure from intellectuals and the then Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri convinced authorities to drop the case.
</P>
<P>
Khalife has been referred to a Beirut court and could face a
six-month to three-year sentence in jail if he is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut prosecutor is studying the judge's indictment and
will set a date for a court hearing.

CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four people were killed and
25 others injured on Tuesday in a road accident involving a bus, a
taxi and a truck in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place at a highway junction near Suez, a town
140 kilometers east of Cairo, the country's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A truck from the Red Sea town of Zafarana collided with a bus
carrying workers of the Suez Cement Company on their way to work
for the early day shift, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bus driver lost control of the vehicle, which ran into a
parking car, the sources said. They attributed the accident to
high speed and reckless driving at the crossroads.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were the workers of the cement company. The
drivers of the truck and the bus were also killed. The injured
have been taken to hospitals in Suez.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are common in Egypt due to high speed and poor
road conditions. According to Interior Ministry reports, an
average of 6,000 people are killed in traffic accidents in Egypt
each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki has warned African leaders attending the third Southern
African International Dialog (SAID) to guard against turning the
conference into a mere talk shop.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told the leaders that there was usually no action taken
after such discussions, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As smart partners, everyone participating the conference should
answer the question, "what have we done to implement the decisions
we took to realize the perspective of smart partnership?" Mbeki
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the great advantage of this would be that it would
spur to action those like me who are great talkers and poor
doers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African president noted there would be no need for
the conference to continue if it would turn the leaders into
rapporteurs.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbeki noted that one of the serious challenges facing
African governments was of "little capacity".
</P>
<P>
"The last point I would like to make is that the more we report
to one another about what we are actually doing, the greater the
transparency among ourselves about our practical activity, the
more we will defeat rumor and prejudice and false knowledge which
in many instances create barriers of mistrust among ourselves," he
said.

LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The death toll has risen to 26 in
Tuesday's crash of two commuter trains in central London, rescue
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were bringing in floodlights and cranes to sift
through the derailed and smashed carriages throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
Police said it could take at least 24 hours before they would
know how many bodies remained trapped in the wreckage and could
remove them.
</P>
<P>
"It's a long and laborious process. The trains are extensively
mangled," Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Trotter told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The crash near London's Paddington main line station at the
peak of the morning rush hour also sent more than 130 people to
hospital, 26 of them with serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
It was the second fatal crash on the same stretch of line in

NICOSIA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides on Tuesday heaped praises on Cyprus' National Guards
annual military exercise "Nikiforos '99" which started in the day,
saying it was "very successful".
</P>
<P>
After watching part of the war game, he said it was a
combination of defensive and offensive moves in which all weapons
participated.
</P>
<P>
The military exercise, which started last Saturday, will last
six days.
</P>
<P>
Greek navy vessels, including a frigate and a submarine, and
Greek military aircraft, including two F-16 and two A-7 Corsair
and a C-130 with parachutists, took part in Tuesday's manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Turkish claims the manoeuvres cause
instability in the region, Clerides replied "it seems Turkey is
somewhat concerned about strengthening our defenses with the
participation of the Greek air force."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus reached an agreement in November 1993 that
Greece will offer Cyprus land, sea and air cover in the event of
fresh Turkish attacks.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on All U.N. Members to Pay Dues in Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday called upon all member states to "pay their
dues in full, on time and without conditions," saying this is "the
only solution" to the world body's chronic financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as Annan was addressing the Fifth Committee of
the General Assembly on how to improve the financial situation of
the United Nations, which, a non-profit organization, fully
depends on all member states for financial support.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution, quite simply, is that all member states
must honor their legal and moral obligations under the Charter and
pay their dues in full, on time and without conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, I would ask the General Assembly to consider
temporarily suspending the provisions of the financial regulations
requiring the return of surpluses to the member states," he said.
"Though by no means answer to our problems, this step would help
to improve our chronic cash shortage."
</P>
<P>
The United States, the richest country in the world, is the
biggest debtor to the United Nations, owing the world body some
1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States is again threatened this year within losing
its vote in the General Assembly next year if it doesn't pay an
estimated 350 million U.S. dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has held up payment of 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars for years, demanding that the United Nations streamline
its organization and institute a no-growth budget. Legislation
that would have paid off the bulk of the bills was vetoed last
year by U.S. President Bill Clinton because it contained unrelated
restrictions on U.S. spending for overseas family planning
organizations.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. reform, he said, "We have come a long way together.
Nearly three years later, it is fair to say that we have made good
and determined progress."
</P>
<P>
"But it is equally fair to say that we have a long way to go
before we can pronounce ourselves satisfied," he said. "The
transformation of our United Nations has yet to attack what I see
as an overly burdensome and overly intrusive approach to
administration."
</P>
<P>
"The international community continues to turn to the United
Nations for our unique services," he said. "The world public
continue to place faith in us as an agent of peace and progress."
</P>
<P>
"All of us want a United Nations that works -- for peace, for
development, for human rights and more," he said. "I believe that
such a United Nations is well within our capacity. But to reach
the goals we share, there needs to be a better way of doing
business in this house."

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Africa needs trained staff,
lean and mean management structure as well as effective system to
benefit from the globalization in the insurance sector, a senior
Ethiopian official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop of African Insurance Educators and
Trainers, Nituk Frnrnr, Vice Minister of the Trade and Industry,
said that the success in Africa's efforts for development and
liberal economy would be strengthened by competitive insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
Globalization had made all sectors but the insurance sector
more competitive, the vice minister said, adding that the fate of
small national insurance companies would be uncertain unless they
quickly build their capacities to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Georgen, representative of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said at the meeting
that Africa should take precautionary measurers as markets opened
to foreign participation.
</P>
<P>
He said competitive distortions may appear because of
unbalanced market structures, depriving of the insurance industry
from the expected benefits of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported Tuesday that a workshop of
African financial sector supervisory authorities that examines
financial regulations of the continent is underway here behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized by the UNCTAD, the Association for
African Insurance Supervisory Authority, the African Insurance
Organization, the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation, and the
National Bank of Ethiopia.
</P>

Some 49 participants from 31 African countries and the UNCTAD
are attending the workshops.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Southern African leaders
attending the third Southern African International Dialog (SAID)
came under fire Tuesday for lacking the sense of urgency in the
development of the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Peace Parks Foundation chairman Anthony Rupet said if the
unemployment problems facing the region were to be solved, there
was need to quickly speed up the development of the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that there is no sense of urgency in Africa,"
Rupet pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to start creating employment, they have to start
thinking seriously about developing the industry and put a sense
of urgency into it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The other problem facing the region was lack of marketing of
the tourism facilities which had the potential to attract more
people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Peace Parks Foundation was in the process of
establishing guest houses in the region to accommodate more
tourists.
</P>
<P>
"But still there are no airports in most resort areas. Worse
still there are also no aeroplanes which can carry large numbers
of people, strengthening the point that the leaders are not
serious enough," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Parks Foundation was a tourism organization dealing
with the development of tourism in different regions including the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes CAR Parties Work Together for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday voiced his hope to see that the government and
opposition of the Central African Republic (CAR) will find the
best way to work together to promote the peace process in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here through his spokesman, said Annan
"hopes that the government and opposition will find the best way
to work together, in a spirit of national reconciliation, towards
the consolidation of peace and development in the country."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement after the announcement by the
Constitutional Court of the Central African Republic of the
results of the first round of the presidential election in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"He wishes, once again, to acknowledge the peaceful and
responsible manner in which the people of the Central African
Republic have participated in this event," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic was calm Sunday after President
Ange-Felix Patasse was declared the winner of the presidential
election. However, defeated candidate David Dacko, who was the
country's first president after the independence from France in
1960, said that the voting was flawed and he hoped the people
would react, but in a peaceful way, reports said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeepers Sunday patrolled the capital city of Bangui
and gendarmes were out in force, but there were no reports of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The election was intended to be part of a national
reconciliation process following three army mutinies over pay and
political and ethnic bloodshed in 1996 and 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said here Tuesday that his visit to Athens had confirmed
the successful cooperation between Greece and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who is in Athens on a two-day working visit, added
that his visit further strengthened the already good relations
between the two countries in all sectors.
</P>

The visit had also had a positive effect on the two countries'
joint obligations to the European Union (EU) and the Balkan
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder noted that Germany wanted to bring together the two
countries and also wanted to take advantage of Greek experiences
in the region.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey's accession to the EU, he said that Turkey had
taken one step closer to the EU after his talks with Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Conservatives Want Big EU Treaty Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Conservative
party committed itself Tuesday to negotiating far-reaching changes
to the Treaty of Rome, founding charter of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Foreign affairs spokesman John Maples said at the party's
annual conference in Blackpool that the only decisions that should
have to be made at a European level were those involving the EU's
"core function" of free trade and free markets, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
He promised that when the party returned to government, it
would negotiate a treaty amendment "to allow each country the
freedom to decide for itself whether or not to apply new European
legislation."
</P>
<P>
Maples did not mention withdrawal from the EU as a possibility
and denied his push for a more flexible EU, first heralded by
party leader William Hague in a speech in Hungary earlier this
summer, was anti-European.
</P>
<P>
Maples said an amendment to the Treaty of Rome was needed to
"stop the slide to a superstate" in Europe and protect Britain
from "every anti-business, nanny state, interfering regulation"
from the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
"If the European Union develops into a Federal superstate, then
Britain will simply be a province of that superstate," the agency
quoted Maples as saying.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Privatizes Nacala Port and Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has privatized Nacala
port and railway system (CFM), which links Mozambique and
neighboring Malawi, by granting its management to Nacala Corridor
Development Company (SDCN).
</P>
<P>
According to an SDCN press release on Tuesday, the company
will be granted a 15 year lease to operate and manage the port,and
railway.
</P>
<P>
SDCN, whose board of directors is chaired by Former Mozambican
Defense Minister Alberto Chipande, is a consortium of Mozambican
companies (including CFM itself) and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign stakeholders are the American Railway
Development Corporation and Edlows of the United States, Tertir
and Somafel of Portugal, and Congifer and SAE-International of
France.
</P>
<P>
CFM and SDCN will also manage Malawi railways. The Malawi
Privatization Commission announced in June that the CFM/SDCN bid
had won the privatization tender.
</P>
<P>
Thus the entire operation, from unloading goods at the port of
Nacala through to their final destination in Malawi, and vice
versa, can be run in a smooth and seamless fashion.

<HEADLINE> More Wind Energy For Electricity Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Wind energy could provide 10
percent of the world's electricity requirements by 2020, create
1.7 million jobs and reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by
more than 10 billion tons, a report released Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Findings of the report indicated that a total of 1.2 million
megawatts (MW) of wind power can be installed worldwide by 2020,
producing more than the total electricity consumption in Europe
today. "In Europe, one fifth of this total capacity would be
installed, creating a quarter of a million jobs," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 million MW represents one fifth of 1998 worldwide
electricity consumption, highlighting the conservative approach
taken in the report of a business-as-usual world that doubles
electricity use by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The report, commissioned by Greenpeace, the European Wind
Energy Association and the Forum for Energy and Development,
unveiled their global energy blueprint at the Financial Times
World Renewable Energy Conference in Brussels, "the first major
business summit on renewable energy."
</P>
<P>
The three organizations called on all countries at next month's
U.N. Climate Convention meeting in Bonn to ensure that the Clean
Development Mechanism, outlined in the Kyoto Protocol adopted in
December 1997, promotes renewable technology transfer and excludes
nuclear power or the misleading labeled "clean coal."
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the 10 percent target, the report also
called on the world's governments to establish firm targets to
remove inherent electricity sector barriers, halt fossil fuel and
nuclear subsidies, and introduce a range of legally enforced
mechanisms to promote wind energy.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the Kyoto Protocol signaled to the energy
industry the beginning of the phaseout of fossil fuels," said
Corin Millais, Greenpeace renewable energy campaigner.
</P>
<P>
"Governments must now act to establish the regulatory framework
and set legally binding targets for renewables. There's no excuse
for inaction because wind power is an affordable, feasible,
mainstream global energy force that is able to substitute for
conventional fuels," Millais added.

ATHENS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece's current account deficit
reduced by 40.3 percent to 1.425 billion euros in January-April of
this year from 2.5 billion euros in the same period of last year,
the Bank of Greece announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Tuesday, the central bank attributed
the drop in the current account deficit mainly to an improvement
in the trade deficit, which reduced to 4.807 billion euros from
5.535 billion euros in the same four-month period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In April, the current account deficit fell to 396 million euros
from 868 million euros in the same month of 1998 while the trade
deficit stood at 1.242 billion euros from 1.504 billion euros in
the same month of last year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Transitional Administration in E.Timor Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday proposed the establishment of a United Nations
Transitional Administration of East Timor (UNTAET) for its
transfer to independence.
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the Security Council, Annan said the
UNTAET would consist of 8,950 troops, 200 military observers,
1,640 international police and a civilian police unit of 1,250
officers and other segments.
</P>
<P>
With a function of maintaining law and order in East Timor and
administering the territory, the UNTAET is projected to stay there
for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Operated under the authority of the Security Council and
exercised by the Secretary-General's special representative, the
body would be responsible for all aspects of the U.N. work in East
Timor, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Annan hopes that the UNTAET would be entrusted with a "robust
mandate." Apart from providing security, it would establish an
effective administration, assist in the civil and social services,
and support capacity-building for self-government.
</P>
<P>
He called on U.N. member states to provide experts and make
voluntary contributions to funding UNTAET activities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal reiterated
their agreement for the transfer of authority in East Timor to the
United Nations at a meeting on September 29, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The total transfer is expected to be completed after
constitutional changes are done late this month or in early
November.
</P>
<P>
The report, covering the period from August 9 to October 4,
reviewed the situation in East Timor, where the U.N. authorized
multinational force (MNF) started to be deployed on September 20
with an unspecified number of troops from 14 countries.
</P>
<P>
The force, expected to reach 8,000 with a further number of
countries to join, will be replaced by a long-term U.N.
peace-keeping operation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Officials Hail Deal on Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators Tuesday hailed a newly-clinched deal on the
first-ever safe passage route between Gaza and the West Bank as an
important step for the revived peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It is in our interest to have the Palestinian population in a
state of economic and cultural satisfaction," Israeli Internal
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told reporters after signing a
protocol on the safe passage route with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Minister of Civilian Affairs Jamal Tarif.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is good for the peace process. It is also good
for the stability between ourselves and the Palestinians as a
whole," Ben-Ami added.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Palestinians can travel by
cars or buses between Gaza and the southern West Bank city of
Hebron along a 43-kilometer-long route after security checks,
ending decades of separation between the two areas.
</P>
<P>
Those Palestinians who are prevented from entering Israel can
also travel along the passage, but on buses escorted by Israeli
police. Only those wanted by Israel will be denied permits.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people can move between Gaza and the West Bank by
going through the security procedure under the protocol. This is
the most important thing to us," Tarif said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also regard the opening of the safe passage as
an important step toward the realization of their aspiration to an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing... is the geographic and demographic
unity between Gaza and the West Bank," PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat
said in Gaza, hours before the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
Differences over security arrangements on the road had
prevented the safe passage route from being opened last Sunday as
stipulated in the revised Wye interim agreement signed in Sharm
el-Sheikh, Egypt, one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have, however, downplayed the postponement. They
held intensive talks after the deadline was missed, and reached
agreement Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the agreement over the safe passage symbolizes the
recovery of the mutual trust, which was severely damaged in the
three years of rule under Israeli hard-line prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Tarif said the trust building has begun ever
since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement.
</P>
<P>
As for the concern expressed by Palestinians that Israel might
use the safe passage to arrest wanted Palestinians, Ben-Ami said
Israel never intends to create a kind of trap and ambush in order
to get hold of those Palestinians that Israel otherwise couldn't
get hold of.
</P>
<P>
Israel has given up its demand to keep the right in the
agreement to arrest Palestinian suspects on the road, but it was
granted ultimate authority on security issues, like the issue of
passage permits and security checks.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami stressed that the Israeli security concerns will be
exercised "in such a way that does not infringe upon the rights of
the Palestinians and the dignity of the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tarif said the PNA has no doubt that the road is
under Israeli sovereignty. He pledged full Palestinian security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said at the ceremony that the two sides need "a few
days" to finalize all technical arrangements before the safe
passage can be opened.
</P>
<P>
Both officials said the two sides will start immediate
negotiations on the terms of the second safe passage route
stipulated in signed Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said the second route, which links Gaza and the
northern West Bank city of Ramallah, will be opened early next
year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Invest in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to invest in education to rescue the falling standards in
the sector.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Secretary General
Sylvester Tembo said Tuesday that education receives the least
investment from the government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at celebrations to mark the International Teachers Day
at the city square of Kitwe in Copperbelt Province, Tembo said
that the Zambian education sector was the least supported in the
entire southern African region.
</P>
<P>
"Government should deliberately revamp the education sector by
turning around and invest heavily in the teachers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The congressman also condemned the trends where policies in the
 education sector are made without seeking consultation or an
input from teachers, adding such trends are unfair and should be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Education Godfrey Miyanda released here
a joint statement with International Labor Organization, United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, United
Nations Development Program and United Nations Children's Fund,
saying the world acknowledges the contribution of teachers across
the globe in awakening potential and fostering the fundamental
capacity of human beings to seek knowledge, disseminate
information and share their collective wisdom.
</P>
<P>
He said despite their poor working conditions, limited
resources and inadequate remuneration, teachers have helped the
world to move forward and therefore are entitled to active support
of the communication industry and the societies they serve.
</P>
<P>
He said with the scourge of child labor, free basic education
has been provided by teachers worldwide as a key to removing an
estimated 120 million children worldwide between the ages of five
and 14 years from full time work and providing for their social
integration.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda pledged to work and cooperate with teachers to achieve
the common objectives as teachers have a central role to play in
the education delivery system, especially in the development of
children.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Former President Nyerere on Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Physicians attending
Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere, who has been in
critical condition at St. Thomas Hospital in London, said that he
is recovering slowly.
</P>
<P>
The doctors said a thorough medical examination on Nyerere,
suffering from leukemia, did not detect any other diseases
attacking him, the Tanzanian State House said in a bulletin issued
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old African statesman, admitted to the hospital 11
days ago, was being troubled by malaria, jaundice and breathing
problems during the course of treatment, said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
It said that all important parts of the body of Nyerere are
functioning properly and other new health problems cropped up
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The doctors said in a message faxed to the State House that
Nyerere's fever has been contained and his liver problem is almost
solved.
</P>
<P>
However, the doctors said that Nyerere still depends on life
support system, which helps him breathe and fight other health
complications.
</P>
<P>
The African (newspaper) said President Bill Clinton has pledged
to fly in American doctors to join the panel of British doctors.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has expressed appreciation to Britain
and the United States for their medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian High Commissioner to Britain, Abdulkadir Shareef, has
 expressed gratitude to the two countries, particularly during the
hard times Nyerere was experiencing.
</P>
<P>
Retired Tanzanian leader Rashid Kawawa, a close friend of
Nyerere, left capital Dar es Salaam for London to visit the ailing
former president.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, prayers were conducted at Aga Khan Ismailia
Tembpe in Dar es Salaam wishing Nyerere a quick recovery as
anxiety grips the nation.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He has tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.

NICOSIA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides on Tuesday heaped praises on Cyprus' National Guards
annual military exercise "Nikiforos '99" which started in the day,
saying it was "very successful".
</P>
<P>
After watching part of the war game, he said it was a
combination of defensive and offensive moves in which all weapons
participated.
</P>
<P>
The military exercise, which started last Saturday, will last
six days.
</P>
<P>
Greek navy vessels, including a frigate and a submarine, and
Greek military aircraft, including two F-16 and two A-7 Corsair
and a C-130 with parachutists, took part in Tuesday's manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Turkish claims the manoeuvres cause
instability in the region, Clerides replied "it seems Turkey is
somewhat concerned about strengthening our defenses with the
participation of the Greek air force."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus reached an agreement in November 1993 that
Greece will offer Cyprus land, sea and air cover in the event of
fresh Turkish attacks.

<P>
Ebeid told reporters after the meeting that he was given the
directives as the criteria for choosing the cabinet ministers and
that he will submit to the president a list of the ministers on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said he "would only allow those with high qualifications,
experience, success in previous jobs and integrity of character,
to serve in his cabinet."
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Ebeid holds a Ph.D. from Illinois University of
the United States and served several senior government posts
before he was appointed minister of public business sector.
</P>
<P>
Local reports have said the new cabinet will be sworn in
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The former cabinet headed by Kamal El-Ganzouri resigned in the
day after Mubarak was sworn in for a fourth consecutive six-year
term in office earlier at an extraordinary session of the
parliament, the People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak won about 94 percent "yes" votes in a yes-or-no,
uncontested referendum on September 26. Under Egypt's
constitution, the cabinet must resign to pave the way for the
formation of a new cabinet in the wake of a new presidential term
in office.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid, as minister of public business sector, was in charge of
the privatization program in the former government. His
appointment as the new prime minister demonstrated Mubarak's
determination and commitment to the economic reforms beginning in
1991, which have largely improved Egypt's economic landscape and
helped the country maintain one of the best economic performances
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Local media have anticipated a substantial cabinet reshuffle
due to what the media said the cabinet's failure to meet what the
people have hoped for and to achieve the ambitious goals set by
the president.

<P>
KATHMANDU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Food products made in Nepal do
not have labels to provide information to the consumers, the
official RSS news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
RSS said this was disclosed at an interaction program organized
by the Integrated Biologists Research Group here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According the group, labels used in food products should give
the name of the product, raw materials used, date of production
and batch number, date of expiry, weight, name and address of the
producer, trademark, price, specialty of production, color and
preservatives used, method for storing and warning.
</P>
<P>
But most food products in Nepal do not have or only have part
of the contents mentioned above, according to a research.
</P>
<P>
Pediatrician Sitaram Shrestha said baby food products should
give detailed information about the raw materials used, method of
feeding and production and expiry dates, but the baby food
produced in Nepal does not meet these requirements.

<HEADLINE> Home Purchase Loan Scheme to Benefit Families in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Four thousand and five hundred
families in Hong Kong will be able to benefit from the Housing
Authority's Home Purchase Loan Scheme (HPLS) which will be
launched Wednesday, Hong Kong's Housing Authority announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The application period for White Form applicants will last for
two weeks while Green Form applicants can apply throughout the
year. The quota for White and Green Form applicants is set at a
ratio of 2:1.
</P>
<P>
The quota of 4,500 for the period up to March 2000 was approved
by the Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee in July 1999.
The quota was set at the same level as in 1997/1998 while that for
1998/1999 was increased to 10,000 to cope with the demand.
</P>
<P>
HPLS applicants can choose between an interest-free loan or a
non-repayable mortgage subsidy receivable over four years.
</P>
<P>
Green Form applicants can borrow 800,000 HK dollars (102,000 U.
S. dollars) and repay in 13 years, or 600,000 HK dollars (77,000 U.
S. dollars) and repay in 20 years. White Form applicants, on the
other hand, can borrow 500,000 HK dollars (64,000 U.S. dollars)
and repay in 14 years, or 400,000 HK dollars (51,000 U.S. dollars)
and repay in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, applicants can choose to receive a monthly
mortgage subsidy, which requires no repayment.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Housing Authority said the HPLS has been
well received by the public. About 28,000 application forms were
received last year, against a quota of 10,000, of which 9,837
families had already bought their apartments.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the successful applicants had bought
apartments priced at 2 million HK dollars (256,000 U.S. dollars)
or below.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 40 percent of the 7,366 successful Green
Form applicants had bought apartments from the Home Ownership
Secondary Market Scheme.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Spokesman on Strategic Trade Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) follows international
standards in controlling the import and export of strategic
commodities, including computers and microprocessors, according a
government spokesman Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to press inquiries concerning the existing scope of
controls over import and export of strategic commodities, the
spokesman said such controls are essential for the purpose of
maintaining the confidence of supplying countries of these
products in our system.
</P>
<P>
The controls thereby enable Hong Kong's businesses to continue
to have access to high-tech products and cutting-edge technologies
which originate from these countries and which are necessary for
the economic development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The HKSAR's existing import and export licensing controls over
central processing unit (CPU) follows exactly the same standard of
controls adopted by the Wassenaar Arrangement, the concerned
international non-proliferation regimes looking after the control
of dual-use strategic goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Wassenaar Arrangement has maintained that CPU with 260
million theoretical operations per seconds (Mtops) or above should
be controlled.
</P>
<P>
"In line with our policy to follow the international standard
of controls, CPU with 260 Mtops or above, therefore, continue to
remain on the government's control list," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we understand that there will be discussions at the
Wassenaar Arrangement on the control thresholds of CPU and we
would be prepared to follow should the Wassenaar Arrangement
decide to relax the existing controls on CPU," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have proposed legislative amendments to incorporate such
revisions as well as other changes into our own control list by
amending the schedules to the Import and Export (Strategic
Commodities) Regulations. Subject to the approval of the
Legislative Council, the new control threshold would come into
effect on 22 October 1999," he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the need to facilitate trade in lower end computer
related products, the Trade Department of the HKSAR has taken
steps to speed up the license processing time. A simplified
arrangement has been put in place for license applications
covering CPUs which are commonly available in the market and are
not very sensitive in nature, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The department provides pre-license classification in advance
and gives expeditious approval of subsequent license applications.
This has significantly shortened the time required to process such
license applications. During the past three months, 80 percent of
the issued CPU licenses were processed within our pledged time of
three working days, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"With effect from March 1, 1999, the department has also
extended the validity of export license from 28 days to 3 months.
We believe that this has provided additional flexibility to
exporters in arranging the export of their goods." he said.

<HEADLINE> Looking For Urban Development Methods In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Wen Jiabao told
Chinese construction officials and professionals in a letter today
to look for new methods of urban development and planning to meet
the needs of urban modernization.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent to a national urban construction conference
that opened here today, in which Wen said that the urban landscape
in China has gone through drastic changes in the past 50 years,
especially in the past 20, since the reforms and opening up, and
that urban development has helped economic and social progress and
the standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels should pay more attention to urban
planning and management and mayors especially should be
responsible for this, Wen said, explaining that planners should
not only get their ideas from China's architectural traditions or
from foreign colleagues, but should study future trends against
the backdrop of social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Style, management, and assessing the environmental impact are
just as important as housing quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction recognized five cities as "garden
cities" at today's meeting. Nineteen cities, including Beijing,
Hefei, Zhuhai, and Dalian, have held the title since 1992. Twenty
mayors were also commended for their efforts in improving urban
development.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Indonesia's New House Speaker Akbar Tandjung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Akbar Tandjung, general chairman
of the Golkar Party, was elected as the new speaker of Indonesia's
House of Representatives (DPR) on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Born in Sibolga, North Sumatera Province, on August 14, 1945,
Akbar decided on a political career as early as his student days
at the University of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He moved to Jakarta halfway through his senior high school
study in 1962 and joined the Faculty of Technology of the
state-run university in 1964. Akbar once recalled that he entered
the university at a time when every student was expected to join
one of the many political organizations that had established bases
in campuses.
</P>
<P>
Akbar chose the Association of Muslim Students (HMI) and poured
his energy into the organization. One of the reasons that he took
his time to complete his study was because he was too busy playing
politics. He graduated only in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Akbar served as HMI chairman from 1972 to 1974, chairman of the
Indonesian Young Generation for Renewal from 1978 to 1979 and
chairman of the Indonesian National Youth Committee from 1978 to
1981.
</P>
<P>
He has been a member of Golkar (Functional Group), set up by a
group of military and civilian leaders in 1966, since his student
days and worked his way up the political ladder through the
various youth and student organizations he joined.
</P>
<P>
His first major break in Golkar came when he was appointed
deputy secretary-general in 1983 after helping Sudharmono get
elected as the party's chairman. Golkar has been dominating the
legislative body since the establishment of the New Order
administration led by former President Soeharto in 1967.
</P>
<P>
His two previous political mentors, former Golkar General
Chairman Sudharmono and Soeharto, saw Akbar as a skilled
administrator and a highly able organization man.
</P>
<P>
Sudharmono recruited Akbar as his deputy secretary-general when
he chaired the political organization from 1983 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto enlisted Akbar as a member of his cabinet. In
1988-1993, he was state minister of youth affairs and sports and
in 1993-1998, he served as state minister of housing and
settlements.
</P>
<P>
When Soeharto was re-elected in March last year, Akbar was
again asked to serve in the cabinet, keeping his housing
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Given his administrative and organizational qualities and
political skills, Akbar played a vital role in the meetings of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
decision-making body, both in 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Akbar was one of the 14 members of the cabinet who wrote to
Soeharto on May 20 stating that they were not willing to serve in
his cabinet anymore. Soeharto resigned the next day.
</P>
<P>
When B.J. Habibie took power on May 21 last year, Akbar's
political capabilities were exalted and he was moved into the
inner circle as the powerful minister/state secretary for the new
president.
</P>
<P>
At the extraordinary congress of Golkar in July last year,
Akbar became the first general chairman of the political
organization to be elected by a secret ballot, beating former
Defense Minister Gen. (ret.) Edi Sudradjat. Golkar was officially
declared a political party in March this year.
</P>
<P>
In order to concentrate on the June 7 general election this
year, Akbar quit his cabinet post in early May. The party came in
second in the election with 120 seats, trailing behind the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle which got 153 seats in the
new House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Akbar married late in his life, at 35 years old, a factor which
again he attributed to his political activities. He met his wife,
Krisnina Maharani, from Surakarta, Central Java, when he was
active in the Indonesian National Youth Committee. The couple now
have three children, all girls.

ATHENS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A regional NATO sub headquarters,
officially known as "Joint Command South Center," Tuesday operated
at Tyrnavos near Larissa, central Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said that the upgrading of Greece's position in the
alliance also confirmed the country's role as a force for
stability, peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Tyrnavos sub-headquarters would be a center
for the exercise of NATO policy in the region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. General Wesley Clark, allied supreme commander, also said
at the ceremony that the activation was associated with many hopes
about the functioning of the "new NATO" and the consolidation of
security and cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Tyrnavos sub-headquarters is one of four southern NATO
sub-headquarters activated recently. When fully operational, it
will have 453 commissioned and non-commissioned officers and 815
civilian employees, half of whom will be Greek.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Urges Turkey to Show Deeds for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Tuesday urged neighboring Turkey to translate the
unprecedented good climate in Greek-Turkish relations into deeds
and decisions which would create a solid foundation for the
improvement of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement's
parliamentary group, Simitis said that such deeds and decisions
had not yet been forthcoming, but expressed the hope that Turkey
would take a substantial step to advance its European vocation and
support efforts being made for closer cooperation, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
An impetus had been created that had given the neighboring
country the dilemma of choosing between peace and cooperation or a
gradual distancing from European structures and marginalization,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that Athens believed in Turkey's European
vocation but this entailed both rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas also noted at a
press briefing that for Turkey to be included in an EU candidate
country, it must fall into line with the decisions taken at the EU
summits in Luxembourg and Cardiff.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this case, Greece would have no objection to
upgrading relations between the EU and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have nearly gone to war three times in the
past 25 years for their disputes in the territorial waters, air
space limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the
Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that Turkey cannot join the EU unless it
improves its human rights record and relations with Greece as well
as not blocking Cyprus's accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The recent devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Greece have
provided the two neighbors a good chance to improve their strained
ties.
</P>
<P>
Greece has since softened its opposition to Turkey's eventual
membership in the EU. On Monday, Greece and Germany agreed to find
ways to help Turkey become a possible candidate country for the EU
by the Helsinki summit in December.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Personal Investment Authority
(PIA) Tuesday published the results of its fifth annual survey of
persistency (lapse) rates of life and pensions policies.
</P>
<P>
The PIA resolves to maintain its tough approach to firms with
poor results. The firms with poor persistency records would be
asked to provide an explanation.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that overall rates of persistency continue to
be low, with no improvement at all for regular premium policies,
25 percent of which lapse within three years and 30 percent lapse
within four years.
</P>
<P>
Joe Palmer, chairman of the PIA, said, "The PIA Board remains
very disappointed with firms with consistently poor persistency
where the underlying factors involve rule breaches and
mis-selling."
</P>
<P>
"The follow-up action we have undertaken on previous reports
shows firms that they cannot be complacent," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Enhance Strategic Ties With China: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Tuesday reiterated Pakistan's commitment to expand and
enhance its strategic partnership with China for peace and
development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a dinner hosted here, which was attended by
Pakistan Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad and other six cabinet
members, to mark the Golden Jubilee of the founding of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the most important feature of
Pak-China relationship is the commonality of "our perceptions and
views on all contemporary issues."
</P>
<P>
"Our overall understanding is rooted in our vision of the
future world: a just, fair and coercion-free world as dreamt by
the eminent founding fathers of China and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the Pak-China relations have been fostered and
nurtured with great care by the two governments and peoples and
stand as a shining example of a model friendship based on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have always extended due assistance to each
other in difficult times. In fact, we are friends in weal and woe.
For us in Pakistan this time-tested and all-weather relationship
is a great source of strength and confidence."
</P>
<P>
Aziz lauded the exceptional achievements of the Chinese people,
saying the half-a-century that has passed since the People's
Republic was founded has been replete with astounding successes
for China.
</P>
<P>
This year is no exception, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Macao will return to the motherland in December just as Hong
Kong did in 1997, and just like Taiwan will, one day," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said China's constant opposition to regional and global
hegemonism and its role in promoting a multipolar, just and
equitable world economic and political order has won her universal
respect and admiration.
</P>
<P>
China's policies, he said, have a special significance for the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that China will continue to
strengthen its cooperation with the developing countries to
promote their legitimate rights and interests.

<HEADLINE> Radical Reform Of New Car Pricing In UK Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Competition Commission
Tuesday recommended radical reforms of the way new cars are sold
and distributed in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Details of the proposed reforms have been sent to leading
carmakers and consumer groups as part of an on-going investigation
into the new car market, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Publication of the proposed reforms follows a mounting furor
over new car prices. According to the Consumers' Association,
carmakers charge up to 40 percent more for identical models in
Britain than in other parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "remedies letter" calls for changes in
recommended retail prices set by manufacturers for new cars.
</P>
<P>
The commission also called for an end to the "bundling" of
sales packages in which new cars are sold with incentives
including free insurance or roadside main tenance cover.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Introduce Road Manifest to Regulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) members have decided to introduce a "road
manifest" to discipline regional trade.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made here Tuesday during a meeting of customs
directors from Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after the meeting, Director of
Mozambique' s Customs Restructuring Technical Unit (UTRA) Pedro
Bule said that the road manifest has not yet been introduced in
his country.
</P>
<P>
The manifest consists of a listing (at the origin of the
merchandise) of all items of cargo carried across one or more
countries.
</P>
<P>
Introducing this document in the region is a matter of urgency,
and the customs services expect their respective governments to
produce their points of view by next week, Bule said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting discussed ways in which countries should
harmonize the implementation of both the road manifest and the
"customs assurance" of all merchandises on transit.
</P>
<P>
It also identified tax evasion and smuggling as a common
problem in the region, saying that a common strategy operated
under harmonized working mechanisms is needed to fight these
crimes.

<HEADLINE> China on Decolonization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- To reach the goal of
decolonization laid down in relevant U.N. resolutions remains an
arduous and pressing task facing all member states and calls for
even greater efforts by the administering powers as well as the
whole international community, China said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Special Political and Decolonization Committee
of the 54th Session of the General Assembly, Chinese Deputy
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang said
that despite the profound changes in the international arena, the
relevant principles in the Charter of the United Nations and the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries
and Peoples are still of practical relevance today.
</P>
<P>
According to the charter, the declaration and relevant
resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, the people of
non-self-governing territories enjoy the inalienable right to free
determination of their future status, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
It takes the joint efforts of all parties concerned, including
the United Nations, the people of non-self-governing territories
and the administering powers to ensure the exercise of this right,
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
As effective means to make known the will and situation of the
people of non-self-governing territories, dissemination of
information on decolonization and regional seminars participated
by, among others, people from non-self-governing territories
should continue to be accorded adequate attention and active
cooperation from all parties, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the administering powers to cooperate more closely
with the U.N. and make sure that people of non-self-governing
territories fully understand their rights. Besides, administering
powers should also offer non-self-governing territories more
assistance to help them establish a sound economic base," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Firms as Bank of Thailand Intervenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht strengthened over
the 40 per dollar level for the first time since September 16 on
Tuesday as the Bank of Thailand (BOT) tightened criteria for loans
to offshore companies.
</P>
<P>
BOT announced Tuesday that it has imposed a ceiling of 50
million baht (1.25 million U.S. dollars) for the loan to be
provided by any onshore company to a single offshore counterpart
to prevent speculative attacking on the baht.
</P>
<P>
The measure shored up the Thai baht value from under 40 baht
against the dollar to 39.81 baht in Tuesday afternoon's trading.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the announcement implied that there would be
greater restriction on bank outflows from onshore markets to
offshore markets.
</P>
<P>
Last week the baht dived to a 13-month low of 41.7 per dollar.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Telecom Merger at 129 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- In a single largest corporate
takeover, MCI WorldCom and Sprint announced Tuesday that they
reached a definitive merger agreement with a total value at 129
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal combines MCI WorldCom, the second largest U.S.
telephone company and Sprint, the third largest in a bid to take
on AT&AMP;T, the number one U.S. long-distance and wireless company.
</P>
<P>
The 129 billion dollar price tag includes the equity portion of
the long-distance business of Sprint as well as its PCS Group
subsidiary, which trades as a separate tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
MCI WorldCom's offer surpassed an earlier bid of 100 billion
dollars from regional BellSouth Corp which provides local phone
services in nine southeastern U.S. states but lacks a nationwide
wireless network.
</P>
<P>
The two companies expect the deal to be completed in the first
half of 2000 though analysts say the merger case would undergo
intense regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The union of the two would control some 30 percent of the 80
billion dollar U.S. long-distance telephone market, compared with
48 percent for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
MCI WorldCom and Sprint combined have more than 50 billion
dollars in annual sales against 53 billion dollars in sales for
AT&AMP;T in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Today was the opening day of a
five-day state-level fair on modern technology developments in the
southern city of Shenzhen, China's first.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening ceremony tonight, Premier Zhu Rongji
said that the Chinese Government has decided to hold the event in
Shenzhen annually for better economic and technological
cooperation with other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has never faced such fierce challenges
internationally in technology as it has today, with the global
economy depending more on technology developments and the
industrial use of scientific research results and that he hopes
that Chinese enterprises and research institutes develop more hi-
tech goods for the international market.
</P>
<P>
China faces the urgent task of developing its economy by
relying on technological advancement, he said, adding that the
central authorities have promulgated a series of incentives and
policies to spur the development of new and high technology.
</P>
<P>
The fair is being sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, Ministry of Science and Technology,
Ministry of Information Industry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and
the Shenzhen municipal government, with the hope of speeding up
the industrial use of scientific research.
</P>
<P>
There will be an exhibit of computer and communications
products for use on the web, as well as forums. Some 15,000 new
research developments in electronic information, pharmaceuticals,
new materials, and bio-engineering will be on display.
</P>
<P>
The forums will discuss the present situation and future hi-
tech industrial trends, the information-based economy, state
development strategy, and related financial, stock and investment
sectors. Keynote speakers include major government officials,
economists, Nobel Prize winners, and scientists.
</P>
<P>
There are delegates from all Chinese provinces, autonomous
regions, and municipalities, and from 27 academies outside China,
and from the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, and more than
20 other countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 multinationals are taking part and view it as a major
business event. The big names include Lucent, IBM, Siemens Nortel,
Ericsson, Epson, and Canon.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Okays Tax Cut on Diesel for 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved a tax cut on diesel by 0.5 baht (1.25 U.S. cents) per
liter for three months for fear that higher oil prices will affect
the country's economic recovery, a Government House press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a plan to ease the impact of higher
domestic oil prices and prevent effect on the economic growth in
the last quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The cut, which will be effective from Wednesday to January 5,
2000, is expected to cost the government 2 billion baht (50
million dollars) in revenue and the government would have to raise
other taxes to make up for the losses.
</P>
<P>
The planned tax cut would include 0.42 baht in excise tax and 8
satang in local maintenance tax.
</P>
<P>
The government currently charges 2.308 baht per liter of diesel
and earns about 60.5 billion baht (1.5 billion dollars) from
gasoline and diesel taxes annually.
</P>
<P>
However, the tax on gasoline will not be lowered this time
since the price of gasoline is considered as having less direct
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet also reviewed the possible impact of
increased oil prices on the economy in the last three months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The oil price hike will lead to an increase in commodity prices
and a decline in private consumption, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Higher oil prices will also have a negative impact on Thai
exports as they will undermine the competitiveness of Thai
products by raising the production costs and will affect the world
economy, resulting in a drop of demand for Thai products.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet thus called for all sectors to take measures to
save energy.

DHAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- "China will play a very vital role
for world peace and stability, for human civilization and
progress, for justice and equity and equality" in the 21st
century, said speakers at a seminar here on Tuesday.

Cultural, Economic, and Mass Communication Center on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic

</P>
<P>
"Sino-Bangladeshi relations have enjoyed an all-round growth.
Bilateral cooperation based on mutual benefit has produced
phenomenal results," said the former president.
</P>
<P>
The 50 years of history of New China "is a history of big
success and achievement. It is indeed a great success story,"
according to Lt. General (retired) M. Mahbubur Rahman, former

He said China and Bangladesh are close neighbors and historical
ties between the two countries date back more than 1,000 years.
"Today we have the best of relationship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's assistance to Bangladesh, Engineer Abdul
Mannan Khan said that though the volume of Chinese aid is not the

many projects funded by other countries and comply more with the
development priorities of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Bangladeshi people learn more from Chinese
experience for their own economic development.

BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Average consumer price index
(CPI) in the first nine months of this year in Thailand stood at
128, 0.4 percent higher compared with 127.5 in the same period of
last year, a Government House press release said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CPI rose because of higher prices for clothing, water
supply, medical treatment, medicines, construction, vehicles,
tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
However, CPI of food and beverage decreased in the same period
by 0.4 percent due to the lower prices of fragrant rice,
vegetables and fruits, vegetable oil and nutritious beverages.
</P>
<P>
CPI in September stood at 128.2 compared with 128 in August
because of higher prices for gasoline and water supply, according
to the press release.

<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) held a reception
here today to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic ties between China and the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan said that the Workers' Party of
Korea led by President Kim Il Sung and the DPRK recognized the
People's Republic of China (PRC) shortly after it was founded on
October 1 of 1949, and forged diplomatic ties with it on October 6.
This was an important event in bilateral ties, and ushered in a
new chapter of friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries have supported each other and
moved forward together over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that the two countries are linked by mountains and
rivers, adding that Sino-DPRK friendship initiated and fostered by
the elder generations of leaders has stood the test of time, and
has been deeply rooted in the hearts of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
Consolidating and developing traditional Sino-DPRK friendship
is a firm policy of the Chinese Government and sincere aspiration
of the Chinese people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Pak Dong Chun, deputy foreign minister of the DPRK, who is here
to attend activities marking the 50th anniversary of bilateral
diplomatic ties, expressed the conviction that with joint efforts
of the two countries, Sino-DPRK friendship will continue to grow
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that the DPRK people are very happy to see the
achievements scored by the Chinese people over the past half-
century, and also wished that the Chinese people will achieve more
successes in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: World Community Attaches Importance to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The 54th General Assembly
session Monday kicked off the two-day plenary meeting on the
challenge of the rapid increase of ageing population in the world
at large, mirroring the global community is paying growing
attention to this issue.
</P>
<P>
Many government representatives, who took the floor at the
plenary session, agreed that the United Nations, the biggest
inter-government organization in today's world, should take more
effective steps to ensure that older persons enjoy a better quality
of life.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, taking the shape of an open debate, is seen as an
activity to enhance the public awareness to the pressing issue in
the world.
</P>
<P>
With the development in economy, science and technology,
education, culture and health care, and the improved life quality,
many countries, including China, are seeing the average life
expectancy of their population on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Although it is not news to anyone that our societies are
ageing, it is necessary to put some basic facts into sharper
focus. Globally, one out of every 10 persons is aged 60 or over;
by 2020, the corresponding figure will be one out of every eight;
and by 2150, every third person will be over 60.
</P>
<P>
"Although statistics are often said to hide more than they
reveal, these are by any standards startling numbers," U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Louise Frechette told the plenary session
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They show beyond any doubt that, even if all other things
remain equal, families, communities and societies will be
dramatically different a century from now," she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the 47th General Assembly session proclaimed 1999 as
the International Year of Older Persons, with its theme "Towards a
Society for All Ages." The decision, coupled with the U.N.
principles on ageing, showed the world body gave top priority to
the global issue of elderly persons.
</P>
<P>
The theme "is founded on the basic idea of inclusiveness, which
should inform human relations, family cohesion and social
development that strengthen the society," said General Assembly
President Theo-Ben Gurirab, who is the foreign minister of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, the theme of ageing links us to an early period
of the evolution of the society and community interdependence when
older persons were revered for their wisdom and as repositories of
traditions, customs and past achievements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Questions relating to ageing were on the U.N. agenda as far
back as 1948. The noble ideals and objectives enshrined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights enjoin the international
community to strive towards creating and maintaining human
societies based on family values of loving and caring among all
members of the family.
</P>
<P>
The International Year of Older Persons organized conferences,
seminars, research studies, and initiatives that explored and
promoted the theme.
</P>
<P>
"Promotional events are also abundant, including cultural,
educational, art and social activities, as well as the launching
of commemorative stamps, posters, and calendars with the Year's
logo," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the International Year, the relevant activities have
so far involved 99 national committees and innumerable other
actors from all sectors -- governments, non-governmental
organizations, academic institutions and the corporate world, not
to mention the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
From Bangladesh to Brazil, from China to Cameroon, all pursuit
the same goal: highlighting the issue of ageing and raising
individuals and societies all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"China conducted a nationwide publicity drive on respecting
older persons and held regional workshops on family support and
community service and a large performance on the life of older
persons, with proceeds allocated to older persons in poverty,"
Annan said in his latest report on ageing to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, a huge elderly population and rapid speed of growth of
elderly population will surely pose a severe challenge to
developing countries, such as China, whose economies are still not
very developed.
</P>
<P>
Many developing countries are being marginalized in the
globalization process, and the ageing of the population will
become a major and more complicated social issue in the new
millennium. Therefore, the United Nations has the responsibility
to strengthen the relevant agencies and make their work more
effective to help, through various programs, the elderly
population enjoy their life.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian, in
a meeting with Madagascar's Minister of Armed Forces Marcel
Ranjeva here today, said he believes that Ranjeva's visit on the
50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China will open a new
chapter in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral friendship and cooperation have had sustained and
steady development since the establishment of diplomatic ties in
1972, Chi said, and exchanges of visits and programs in personnel
training have increased the mutual understanding and friendship of
the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi said he was grateful to Madagascar for sticking to the "One
China" policy and supporting China on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Ranjeva said that he is satisfied with the progress in
bilateral relations as well as in military relations, since China
is playing a greater role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, he said, they have noticed the
determination of the Chinese military to maintain the country's
sovereignty and territorial integrity under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China and that he believes that China's
peaceful reunification cause will come true.
</P>
<P>
Madagascar will stick to the "One-China" policy, he continued,
and said he hopes that the return of Macao to the motherland will
go smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged for the Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
decided Tuesday not to raise interest rates but left open the
possibility of a third rate increase later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Fed policy-makers moved their policy directive, which
signals the future course of interest rates, from neutral to one
tilting toward a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action was announced by the Federal Open Market
Committee in a brief statement after its closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
By leaving interest rates unchanged, the federal funds rate,
the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans,
continues to stand at 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision to leave rates unchanged had been widely
expected. For the second time this year, the Fed opted not to
raise rates while announcing a switch in its policy directive from
a neutral stance to one leaning toward a rate increase in the
future.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Fed said "the growth of demand has continued
to outpace that of supply as evidenced by a decreasing pool of
available workers willing to take jobs. In these circumstances,
the Federal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert
in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase
significantly... in a manner that could contribute to inflation
pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the
economy."
</P>
<P>
The brief statement emphasized that the switch did not signal
an imminent increase. A decision to raise rates in the future
would be based on upcoming economic data on growth and inflation,
the policy-makers said.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believed the Fed would leave rates unchanged
because inflation had remained well-behaved despite strong
economic growth and an unemployment rate remaining at a 29-year
low.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many economists said growth slowing in the second
quarter to 1.6 percent annual rate was a temporary lull. They are
looking for a growth rate of 4 percent in both the third and
fourth quarters, far above the 3 percent rate many Fed
policy-makers believe is prudent with today's tight labor market.
So they believe the Fed may raise rates this year by a quarter of
a point when it meets on Nov. 16, depending on what a fresh round
of economic data released between now and then.
</P>
<P>
The Fed already raised the federal funds rates twice early this
year by the same amount of one quarter point.

<HEADLINE> Allied Forces in Congo Threaten to Attack Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The allied forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Tuesday warned that their
troops will not sit and watch while the rebels and their allies
continue to attack and gain more ground at their expense,
according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Our warning is not a threat but real in that each side should
observe the cease-fire agreement thoroughly," Major General Amoth
Chingombe, Commander of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) Allied Forces.
</P>
<P>
"We will therefore use all means available at our disposal and
they shall be held responsible for the consequences," the
commander was quoted as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Chingombe noted it was disheartening that in some of the SADC
countries the media was distorting the truth announced by his
headquarters and did not verify the authenticity of information
from its sources.
</P>
<P>
"The SADC Allied Forces would like to inform both the regional
and international community that we have always issued communiques
but nobody seems to have bothered to investigate the numerous
cease-fire violations which have been perpetrated by the rebels
and their allies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cease-fire violations over the past week were at Momongo, Sambo
and Kileta villages, said the commander of the allied forces
fighting for DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, the
country's central bank, has finalized preparations to pay the
outstanding unpaid private depositors of the International Credit
Bank which was closed last year.
</P>
<P>
Payments to the bona fide private depositors excluding
government departments, parastatals and related accounts will
commence on October 11, the central bank said in a press release
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It called upon all private depositors of the closed commercial
bank to cooperate with the officials to ensure the success of this
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The International Credit Bank was closed by the central bank
for huge inside-lending and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
In the biggest financial sector reform in its history, the
central bank closed three commercial banks last year and two more
this year, sending shock waves among the average depositors and
the ruling elite.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on Countries to Pay U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday called on
some Member State to honor the principle of the U.N. Charter and
legal obligation by paying their U.N. dues in full, on time and
without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the statement at the Fifth Committee of the
General Assembly, when it met in a plenary session to discuss the
financial situation of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that all Member States can honor the financial
obligation to the United Nations under the Charter, and the
largest debtor in particular will do something meaningful to pay
their dues in full, on time and without condition," he said.
</P>
<P>
The delayment in paying their dues is the main factor which has
plunged the United Nations into chronic financial crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
A certain big country failed to pay its U.N. arrears not
because of its economic difficulties, but because of political
purposes, or because of the party struggle within the country,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable that some country fails to honor the
principle of the U.N. Charter and the legal obligations, and
imposes pressure on other U.N. members by delaying its payment,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
China is very much concerned about the fact that the financial
crisis has largely affected the implementation of some programs
at the United Nations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Seeks Drought-Tolerant Maize Varieties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Scientific and
Industrial Research Development Center (SIRDC) started a three-day
maize research workshop in Harare on Tuesday amid calls to speed
up the research aimed at coming up with drought and insect
tolerant maize varieties.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by scientists from Kenya, the
Netherlands, Mexico and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The maize research project was launched in 1997 and was
implemented in three phases of which the current project is the
second phase.
</P>
<P>
Director of Zimbabwe Biotechnical Research Institute Joseph
Gopo said the workshop was aimed at reviewing the progress that
has been made of the first phase since the last meeting that was
held in October last year in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He said due to drought conditions the country was facing it was
 imperative for researchers to come up with other new crop
varieties that are more resistant to drought and pests, adding
that with the shared knowledge from Kenyan scientists the work was
going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe has been experiencing droughts in the past years and
it is important that new drought resistant crops are invented to
ensure better yields," Gopo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, participants at the workshop have said farmers
should be included in these research projects so that they would
also know how research is done and also be able to do research
work on their own.

<HEADLINE> Moratorium Expected on Disputed Fishing in New Brunswick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Fishing dispute over the catch of
Atlantic lobsters has entered its third day with a moratorium
expected to calm the conflicting natives and non-natives in
troubled New Brunswick, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal said Tuesday that he was
pleased with native efforts to defuse the situation.
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Mi'kmaq chiefs are reported to meet Tuesday on a
30-day fishing moratorium in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have remained high in the Atlantic province of Canada
following a Supreme Court ruling last month that allows natives to
fish out of season and without a license to earn a moderate
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
While the glimmer of hope is expected to loom large, local
media have reported continued tension over the fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
A vacant cottage outside a native Mi'kmaq reserve in the
province was set ablaze late Monday. Police indicated the fire was
deliberately set against non-natives, but they fell short of
saying who were suspects.
</P>
<P>
Natives also feel frustrated that no charges have been laid
after three aboriginal men were injured Sunday night, when their
truck collided with a vehicle driven by non-natives.
</P>
<P>
The young natives were beaten after the collision, local media
said.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears about the spreading of the conflicts into
other Atlantic provinces.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Prince Edward Island lobster fishermen demonstrated
Tuesday morning at the Department of Fisheries office in
Charlottetown.
</P>
<P>
In Nova Scotia, non-natives have set a deadline until 6 p.m.
Tuesday for the federal government to curb the lobster fishing by
natives.
</P>
<P>
Non-native fishermen are worrying that lobster stocks could be
depleted before they are allowed to open fishery next spring.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa-EU Trade Deal Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Renewed wrangling over
wines and spirits is threatening to unravel the long-awaited
trade, development and cooperation deal between the European Union
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Four years in the making, the deal is due to be signed soon in
Pretoria. Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who is also the EU
president, is scheduled to attend the signing ceremony, government
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides were feverishly working to overcome
differences on the fine print of crucial areas of the draft
agreement. They center on the wines and spirits agreement which
forms part of the overall pact.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the EU was attempting to get South Africa to
relinquish not only the names "port" and "sherry" but further
"traditional expressions". These include classification details
like ruby or tawny for port and wine.
</P>
<P>
Agreement in principle on the wines and spirits, the last
remaining hurdle in the overall accord, was reached earlier this
year by politicians from both sides. Officials were left to
negotiate the fine print.
</P>
<P>
An EU diplomat said the latest disagreements were the result of
pressure on the South African government by the local wine and
spirits industry.
</P>
<P>
But South African sources said the earlier political agreement
had left too many gaps and they were now difficult to close.
</P>
<P>
The EU's stance is seen by many observers as part of a larger
campaign to protect geographical and other denominations for wines
and foodstuffs on a global scale. It is understood that the
United States is paying close attention to the EU-S. African
negotiations because of the possibility that international
precedents may be set.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the United States had warned South Africa that it
could take action against Pretoria if the latter caved in to EU
demands.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural department negotiator Ben van Wyk said his
country felt that some of the EU demand should be resolved at a
multilateral level.
</P>
<P>
Talks had been suspended pending further consultations between
the negotiators and their principals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Coreper, the EU ambassadors' body, meets Wednesday to consider,
among other things, a signing ceremony next Monday minus the wines
and spirits components of the overall agreement. This would allow
officials to continue negotiations on the remaining sticking
points.
</P>
<P>
Should these negotiations continue beyond next January, South
Africa's wine and spirits producers would not benefit from reduced
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
January 1 is the implementation date for the crucial trade
component of the EU-S. African deal.

ABUJA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and South Africa Tuesday
reached wide ranging agreement on mutual cooperation at the end of
an inaugural session of the Nigeria-South Africa Commission in
Abuja, Nigeria's capital.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, attended by vice-presidents of both
countries, focused on the healthy development of the economic
ties, cooperation in infrastructure, and the Joint Commission
which has just been launched between the two most important
countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the meeting said the economic
 cooperation between the two countries will center on the areas of
cement, automotive, pulp and paper, food processing, fertilizers
and sugar production.
</P>
<P>
The two nations also agreed to exploit last year's memorandum
of understanding between the two nations by "following up"
cooperation in geology exploration, mining technology,
metallurgical and mineral processing, mineral promotion and
development.
</P>
<P>
Both countries agreed to establish a working group of technical
experts to plan, implement and monitor strategies for cooperation
in the exploration and production of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest sales arrangement released last month by the
state- owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, South Africa
would start buying oil from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of Tuesday's meeting, both countries agreed
to collaborate in "data acquisition and management" of the solid
minerals development.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries went sour during the reign
of the late Nigerian military dictator General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
But "Nigeria and South African must rapidly put their troubled
histories behind them and start fulfilling the greatest destinies
thrust on them by nature for the good of their citizens and the
rest of Africa," Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said Monday
when meeting South African Vice President Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
He said that with democratization and the restoration of
majority rule in Nigeria, the two countries had incentives for
increased cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the Nigeria-South Africa Joint Commission
will be held in South Africa six months later.

International Dialog held in Victoria Fall, Zimbabwe, the Zambia
National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) television reported.
</P>
<P>
The labor movement should understand its role in national
development and therefore play a part in the process, the
president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the labor movement is key to the development and
should appreciate government decisions.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in reaction to the prevailing labor situation
in Zimbabwe where labor movement condemns the government policy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his disappointment at the labor movement for not
supporting the government program.
</P>
<P>
After independence, the indigenous blacks have the right to
claim land from the colonial masters, Chiluba added.
</P>
<P>
On the dialog, Chiluba said that his country has learned a lot
in various sectors of development such as proper resources
utilization and labor relations.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's New PM, Power of Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Atef Obeid, Egypt's new prime
minister named on Tuesday by President Hosni Mubarak, is an
economic expert who was the power of the country's economic
reforms featured in privatization.
</P>
<P>
Obeid was born on April 14, 1932 in the Nile Delta city of
Tanta, capital of Gharbia Governorate, 80 kilometers north of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He graduated from the Faculty of Commerce of Cairo University
in 1952 with a bachelor's degree and became an assistant professor
at Ain Shams University.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a doctorate in business administration from
Illinois University in the United States in 1962, Obeid taught at
Cairo University's faculty of commerce. From 1978 to 1984, he was
the head of the university's business administration department.
</P>
<P>
He also worked as a part-time professor at the American
University in Cairo between 1965 and 1984. He became an adviser
for the ministries of electricity, industry, higher education,
housing and information in 1973-84.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Obeid assumed the post of minister of state for
administration development and later minister of cabinet affairs
in charge of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
In October 1993, he was appointed as public business sector
minister, which he held until he was named prime minister on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming public sector minister, Obeid took part in the
preparations of a program, sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, for Egyptian economic reforms, which
began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Under the privatization program which kicked off in 1995, Egypt
planned to sell 314 state-owned firms. So far, the government has
sold part of 123 firms, or about 39 percent of the total
government-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
In August, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the government
earned 9.22 billion Egyptian pounds (2.67 billion U.S. dollars) by
privatizing the state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Obeid is married and has a son, Walid, and a daughter, Nora.

Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 finished higher, up 31.6 points higher at

<HEADLINE> IMF: Thailand's Economic Recovery Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic recovery
is now underway and the 1999 growth is expected to reach 3-4
percent, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IMF's executive board approved Tuesday the completion of the
eighth review under Thailand's Stand-By Arrangement, allowing the
Thai authorities to draw a further 500 million U.S. dollars from
the financial bailout package.
</P>
<P>
However, in view of the gathering recovery and stronger
external position, the Thai government announced last month that
it does not intend to use these additional resources.
</P>
<P>
To date, Thailand has drawn 14.1 billion dollars from bilateral
and multilateral contributors to its financing package totaling
172 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Directors welcomed the marked improvement in Thailand's
economic prospects," IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"They (directors) noted that the recovery is now underway with
growing signs of a rebound in manufacturing, exports, and domestic
consumption prompting an upward revision in the 1999 growth
forecast to 3-4 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To consolidate this process, which is at an early stage,
directors stressed the importance of maintaining supportive
macroeconomic policies and accelerating corporate and financial
reforms," he added.

<HEADLINE> National Reserves Increase in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The foreign currency and gold
reserves of Romania's National Bank (BNR) reached over 2.46
billion U.S. dollars at the end of September, going up by 356
million dollars against the beginning of the month, according to a
BNR statement released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In September, the foreign currency reserve was of 1.47 billion
U.S. dollars, 199 million more than in August. BNR continued the
payments for the foreign debt service, repaying 40.4 million U.S.
dollars in the month. The bank's reserves increased however,
because of foreign currency purchase on the domestic market, worth
203 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold stock remained a total 101.6 tons over the same
period, but its value increased by 157 million dollars, due to
price fluctuations on the international market.
</P>
<P>
With more than USD 2 billion of the foreign debt paid in the
first half of 1999, the BNR's main objective is to increase its
reserves. So, it consolidates its position of net buyer of hard
currency on the domestic interbank market. The reserve will also
increase with sums resulted from international loan agreements,
said the BNR officials.

<HEADLINE> Visitors Continue To Stream Into China's Terra Cotta Warrior Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The museum housing thousands of
terra cotta warriors and horses that were buried along with the
Chinese emperor Qin Shihuang has had more than 40 million visitors
since it opened to the public 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The museum, 37 kilometers east of Xi'an, the capital of
northwestern China's Shaanxi Province, celebrated its 20th
anniversary today and opened a new hall for other relics unearthed
from the imperial tomb.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 100 heads of state among those
visitors, according to the museum's curator, Wu Yongqi. The museum
houses over 7,000 life-sized terra cotta warriors and horses
unearthed since 1974, and tens of thousands of weapons. The relics
hall displays bronze chariots, a bronze cooking vessel weighing
212 kilograms, and an exhibition depicting the museum's 20-year
history. Wu says that some relics that haven't been previously
shown will be on display in the hall.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi government is working on plans to expand the museum,
according to vice-governor Zhao Dequan.
</P>
<P>
The lifelike soldiers and horses have been referred to as the
8th wonder of the world. They were made over 2,200 years ago
during the Qin Dynasty (221 BC -- 207 BC) and were buried less
than a mile from the emperor's tomb to protect his glory in the
afterlife. This "most splendid archeological find" of the century
was discovered accidentally in 1974 by a farmer who was digging a
well.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.S. Politicians Urge Delay in Vote on Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Three former senior U.S.
administration officials Wednesday urged the Senate to delay the
vote until next session of Congress on a treaty that would ban all
nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by John Deutch, former deputy secretary of
defense and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency (
CIA), Henry Kissinger, former secretary of state, and Brent
Scowcroft, former national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
In a joint opinion article in The Washington Post, they said
the treaty's supporters and opponents are "both wrong."
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to vote October 12 on whether to ratify
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The administration and
the Republicans both launched campaigns for and against the treaty.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is expected to make an appeal for the
ratification of the treaty at a White House event later Wednesday
while the Republicans will give a press conference to oppose it
before the president.
</P>
<P>
"While we are no fans of the CTBT, our purpose here is not to
argue its merits and defects. Our point is more straight-forward.
The simple fact is that it is premature for the Senate to vote on
the CTBT -- at least," Deutch, Kissinger and Scowcroft said.
</P>
<P>
"If we act now, there could be real costs and risks to our
security interests, including our nonproliferation objectives,"
they noted.
</P>
<P>
They challenges the argument by the supporters that
ratification of the treaty will make a major contribution to
limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The treaty requires that each of 44 specific countries sign and
ratify the document before it enters into force. Only 23 of those
countries have done so thus far.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should take advantage of this situation to
delay a vote on ratification, without prejudice to eventual action
on the treaty," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the uncertainty, and in the absence of any
compelling reasons for early ratification, it is unwise to take
early ratification now that constrain this or future presidents'
choices about how best to pursue our nonproliferation and other
national security goals while maintaining the effectiveness and
credibility of our nuclear deterrent," it added.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Senate leadership to reach an understanding with
the president to suspend action on the CTBT, at least for the
duration of the 106th Congress," it concluded.

HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
decided to stop importing diesel taxis after next year and will
provide grants to assist taxis owners to switch to liquid
petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles as a measure to improve the city's
air quality.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here Wednesday by Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in
his third policy address.

The government has proposed to the taxi trade that all diesel
taxis over seven years old be taken off the road by 2003 and that
no diesel taxis be allowed after 2006, Tung said.

As a result, diesel vehicles account for 98 percent of the
respirable particulates and 85 percent of the nitrogen oxide
emitted by vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the key to prevent and abate air pollution at
street level is to control the use of, improve and replace diesel
vehicles," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1994, more stringent standards for new diesel
vehicles, known as Euro standards, were introduced in Hong Kong to
reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 18,000 diesel taxis, 6,000-odd diesel
light buses, 70,000 other diesel light vehicles, 50,000 of which
are of pre-Euro standards, in Hong Kong. On a trial basis,
particulate traps will be installed in these pre-Euro-standard
vehicles to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
There are also 12,000 diesel buses and almost 40,000 other
medium and heavy diesel vehicles in Hong Kong. Half of these buses
and over 60 percent of the medium and heavy diesel vehicles,
totaling some 30,000, are pre-Euro standard vehicles. Installing
catalytic converters is believed to be the best way to reduce
emissions from these old diesel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.4 billion HK dollars (179 million U.S. dollars)
has been set aside as grants to owners of taxis, light buses and
other pre-Euro standard diesel vehicles for the purpose of
switching over to LPG, installation of particulate traps and the
fitting of catalytic converters, the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are other measures to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Department is expanding its smoky
vehicle spotter program and has been using more sophisticated
testing equipment for smoky vehicles since last month. Meanwhile,
the police have stepped up enforcement action against smoky
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"We also intend to expand the pedestrian zones in crowded and
more polluted parts of our city so as to reduce pollution caused
by vehicle emissions," the chief executive said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Futures Exchange
(HKFE) announced Wednesday that Alfred Fung Kwok Chor and Robert
Sze Tsai To have been appointed to its board as independent
directors.
</P>
<P>
The appointments increase the number of independent directors
from four to six out of a total of 15 directors.
</P>
<P>
"The addition of independent directors reflects the exchange's
commitment to openness and transparency," Chairman Geoffrey Yeh
said.
</P>
<P>
Fung, a Hong Kong native, studied law in London. His experience
includes work in North America as a consultant to law firms in the
United States and Canada. He is now a barrister-at-law and head of
his chambers in Hong Kong. Fung is a member of the Hong Kong Bar,
the UK Bar, the British Columbia Bar and Law Society, and the
Singapore Law Society.
</P>
<P>
Sze was born in Shanghai. He joined Price Waterhouse London in
1967 as a chartered accountant and was transferred to Hong Kong in
1971. He became a partner in 1974 and remained with the firm until
he reached its mandatory retirement age in 1996. Sze now serves as
a non-executive director of several listed companies in Hong Kong
including Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings and Dah Sing
Financial Holdings (the holding company of Dah Sing Bank).
</P>
<P>
The HKFE is a leading futures and options marketplace in the
Asia Pacific region, with a membership of more than 130 companies,
including a number of major international institutions. The
exchange is actively diversifying its product base, which now
includes currency, interest rate and equity-based products.

<HEADLINE> WHO Unveils Statue to Mark Achievement in River Blindness Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
unveiled a statue of a boy leading a blind man at its headquarters
Wednesday to mark the impending elimination of onchocerciasis,
popularly known as river blindness, in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
The unveiling of the statue should stand for recognition of
what public and private sector partnerships can do and a beginning
of a new era in this field, said WHO Director-General Dr Gro
Harlem Brundtland at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a landmark example of public and private-sector
collaboration, the transmission of the river blindness disease is
on the verge of elimination in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 12 million children, who would have lived with the
risk of being blinded by onchocerciasis, have grown up without
that risk to be independent and productive adults, according to
WHO. On the 25 million hectares of land now reclaimed for
cultivation, enough food is produced to feed 17 million people per
year.
</P>
<P>
Present at the unveiling were former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation Eveline
Herfkens, World Bank President James Wolfensohn and the Chief
Executive Officer of Merck &AMP; Co, Inc, Ray Gilmartin.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Returns "Junk Choppers" to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Mexico last month returned 72
U.S. Army helicopters of the Vietnam War-vintage to the United
States three years after they were donated to aid drug war, the U.
S. media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters were rejected as junk by a frustrated Mexican
military that never got more than a dozen of the clunkers airborne
at any one time, according to U.S. and Mexican officials. The
73rd helicopter had already been destroyed in a crash.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials agreed earlier this year to refurbish 20 of the
helicopters at U.S. expense at a cost of about 1.4 million U.S.
dollars per chopper.
</P>
<P>
But the Mexican military has told its U.S. counterparts it
still does not want them.
</P>
<P>
The UH-1H Huey helicopters were donated to Mexican authorities
to boost the Mexican military's efforts to combat drug production
and trafficking, improving the mobility of anti-drug squads over
rough terrain.
</P>
<P>
However, the entire fleet had been grounded since March 1998
when two Mexican Army crew members were killed in a crash because
of possibly faulty gearboxes in the choppers.
</P>
<P>
Mexico decided to return them because it does not believe it is
cost-effective for them to continue to fly them and ask the U.S.
military to take them back.
</P>
<P>
All the choppers were loaded into trucks and driven back to the
U.S. last month unceremoniously.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, both Mexican and U.S. officials lauded the
donation as a symbol of cooperation in the war against drug
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Forecasts 2-Pct Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), expressed
the confidence here Wednesday that Hong Kong is expected to record
an economic growth rate of over 2 percent in the second half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong economy has turned the corner and Hong Kong still
stands at the position close to the top level of the international
standard," said Tung at a press conference following the
publication of his third policy address.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the Hong Kong SAR government managed to stabilize the
financial market in the past two years and at the same time
introduced a series of relief measures, including reducing tax
rates and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"All these efforts have begun to yield fruits and Hong Kong has
been benefiting from its efforts," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong must continue to improve itself to stay
competitive and must have long-term strategies, especially in the
areas of education and environment.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is not only to make Hong Kong a world-class city,
but to enable Hong Kong's economy to continue to growth, to create
more job opportunities and also to make the community more
affluent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the housing needs of the society, the chief
executive pledged to reduce the waiting time for public rental
housing to three years by March 2006, from the seven years when he
took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to stabilize property prices and said Hong Kong
has already developed a land reserve to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the continuous economic growth will improve
employment and such measures as developing tourism and small and
medium-sized enterprises and innovating technology have all been
taken for this target.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rise 1.3 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods rose 1.3 percent in August, following a 2.5 percent gain in
July.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected increase was led by bigger demand for airplanes
and other transportation products and electronic equipment, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
August's performance marks the 12th increase in the last 15
months and provides fresh evidence of the continued rebound of the
manufacturing sector, which has been battered by a global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector posted the biggest increase, the
fourth monthly gain in a row, rising 4.8 percent in August. Demand
for airplane and aircraft parts led growth in this category. In
July, transportation orders rose 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile transportation category, factory
orders would have risen a solid 0.8 percent in August, the eighth
increase in the last 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Last month's orders for electronic and other electrical
equipment grew by 0.8 percent in August, following a big jump of 8
percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
The rise in overall factory orders occurred despite a 2.1
decrease in orders for industrial machinery and equipment, the
sector that includes computers. That drop followed a hefty 10.5
percent gain in July.
</P>
<P>
Orders for primary metals, the category that includes steel,
also fell 1.0 percent in August, after rising 3.4 percent the
month before.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods rose 1.2 percent in August, following
a 4.3 percent gain in July. Meanwhile, orders for nondurable
goods, such as fuel, grew by 1.5 percent with orders for
petroleum, coal products, chemicals and paper registering the
biggest increases. In July, nondurable-goods orders picked up just
0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. manufacturing sector continues to recover from the
global economic crisis, which dampened overseas demand for U.S.
goods. At the same time, manufacturers faced competition from a
flood of cheaper imports.

LONDON -- The number of people confirmed dead in the London
train crash has risen to 27, but police warned on Wednesday that
the death toll is likely to rise further.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened on Tuesday morning when the three-carriage
service run by Thames Trains from Paddington to Bedwyn in
Wiltshire collided with the London-bound Great Western 125 express
train from Cheltenham at Ladbroke Grove.
</P>
<P>
The initial Health and Safety Executive investigation suggests
the Thames train passed one red and two yellow warning signals,
ploughing into the Great Western which had been given a green
light.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Trotter, of the Metropolitan
Police, said the search for bodies would concentrate on the front
first-class carriage of the Great Western train, which was "
devastated" by fire.
</P>
<P>
The grisly search was suspended on Tuesday night with the
emergency services sure there was no one else left alive on either
train.
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 confirmed dead, 12 bodies remain at the scene but he
said he hoped they would all be removed by the end of Wednesday.

MOSCOW -- Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Wednesday that
Russian federal troops may cross the Terek River in Chechnya in
its latest campaign to root out Islamic rebels in the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will depend on the situation," he said, noting
that some of the Russian units have already advanced to as far as
Terek.
</P>
<P>
All federal troops have reached the Terokumsky irrigation
channel laid along Terek at a distance of 10 kilometers, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Terek River passes about 15 kilometers north of Grozny,
the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that the federal grouping continues "to create a
security zone around the republic" in the first stage of the

<HEADLINE> HK to Build 3.36 Billion U.S. Dollars Sewage Disposal Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is planning to build
a strategic sewage disposal project with a total investment of 3.
36 billion U.S. dollars, Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, named the Strategic Sewage Disposal Scheme, is
being implemented as quickly as possible, Tung said in his annual
policy address.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the scheme alone will cost a total of 1.06
billion U.S. dollars and the total cost for the remaining works
will reach an estimated 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the first stage of the scheme, "we are building a
massive network of tunnels 150 meters below the surface of the
Kowloon peninsula," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme also includes a sewage treatment works on
Stonecutters Island and a submarine pipeline to carry treated
sewage to the western seabed of the Victoria Harbor for discharge,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"Our plans call for us to invest heavily in sewage system and
treatment works in other areas including the new towns and small
villages in New Territories, as well as protecting the Mai Po
Nature Reserve," he said. He added that such spending would
increase by 50 percent to 1.16 billion U.S. dollars in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is only part of the efforts Hong Kong will exert in
the coming few years to tackle the sewage problem and make Hong
Kong a clean, comfortable and pleasant home.
</P>
<P>
Tung gave top priority to environmental protection in his third
policy address with the theme of "quality people and quality home:
positioning Hong Kong for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"A real change in the quality of Hong Kong's environment needs
more than just cleaning up litter and enforcing environmental laws,
it requires a fundamental change of mindset," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also announced a series of measures to
control air and water pollution.

<HEADLINE> Russian Regional Leader Urges Talks With Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Faced with a mounting pressure of
refugees from Chechnya, the leader of the Russian republic of
Ingushetia on Wednesday urged the federal government to start
talks with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
"The federal center should begin intensive talks as soon as
possible with the Chechen leadership represented by Maskhadov,"
Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said at a meeting chaired by
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko in Magas.
</P>
<P>
Ingush leaders oppose the use of force in resolving the
Chechen problem, although terrorism must be thwarted, he said. "
We must turn the Chechen people into an ally in combating
terrorism," the Interfax news agency quoted Aushev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Aushev warned against repeating the mistakes of the 1996 war,
which cost 90,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Ingushetia, already hosting 128,000 Chechen refugees, might
see the total number rising to 270,000-300,000 if a large-scale
land campaign starts. The tiny republic, which has a population
of about 300,000, will be even more hard-pressed to appeal for
outside help.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Matviyenko, who is in charge of social
affairs, arrived in Ingushetia to oversee the refugee problem.
She told reporters that Russia can cope with the refugee problem
by itself and does not need international help at the time.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Apache Company Buys Shell Canada's Oil Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. energy giant Apache Corp. is
buying Shell Canada Ltd.'s conventional oil business unit at 770
million Canadian dollars (about 524 million U.S. dollars), the
Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two companies announced Tuesday that the deal could be
closed next month to add the acquisition of Shell's Plain unit to
the U.S. firm, boosting its oil production almost fivefold in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
It means that Apache, whose current Canadian output is a modest
2,700 barrels per day, will become one of the top 25 oil producers
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Apache President Steven Farris described the deal as a "
strategic step," which will bring Canadian properties to 19
percent of the company's total proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
In its first major foray in 1995, Apache took over Calgary-
based Dekalb Energy Co. for 285 million Canadian dollars (about
194 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With a stock market value of about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars,
Apache expects Shell's Plain unit to keep its capacity of
producing almost 13,400 barrels of oil a day plus a daily 45
million cubic feet of natural gas.

TEHRAN, October 6 (Xinhua ) -- Two Dutch banks have opened two
8.5-year credit lines totaling dlrs 2 billion for the iranian
investors, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khosrow Salour, the commercial advisor to the Embassy of the
Netherlands in Iran, on Tuesday told the agency that the credit
lines are separate form the investments Dutch companies have so
far poured into the Iranian oil, gas, copper and petrochemical
sectors.

He put the volume of Iran-Holland trade for 1998 at about dlrs
706 million, adding that Iran's exports to the Netherlands amounted
to dlrs 413.5 million, 90 percent of which were crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Salour said that while crude oil constituted the main Iranian
export item to the Netherlands, industrial machinery, tire and
textile industries, steel, oil equipment and petrochemical
substances were major exports of that country to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that given the growing trend of economic cooperation
between the two countries, Dutch officials are negotiating with
authorities of the Iranian economy and finance ministry to
finalize new agreements for investments in Iran.

"Everything is ready. We are ready to play host with our
enthusiasm and first-class service to the world championships,"
Sun Hailin, vice-president of the Organizing Committee, told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad all the preparation for the tournament goes well,
and no delegation complained about the gymnasium and apparatus so

limited 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are confident that our staff can handle it without
problems in seven minutes through several rehearsals," said Gao
Jian, director of Competition Department.

</P>
<P>
A total of 651 athletes from 72 countries and regions will
compete in the biennial event, which is also the last chance for
gymnasts to qualify for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

<P>
PYONGYANG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Wednesday held talks with Kim Yong Nam,
President of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), to discuss relations between
their two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang said that the Chinese-Korean
friendship has stood the test of changes in international
situation since the two countries established diplomatic relations
half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kim's successful visit to China in June helped
consolidate and develop the Chinese-Korean friendship.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived here Tuesday for an official goodwill visit,
also expressed the belief that this traditional friendship will be
more fruitful in the next century with the kind care of their
leaders and the concerted efforts by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Describing the establishment of diplomatic ties between China
and the DPRK as "a major event," Kim said that Korean-Chinese
relations are witnessing further development with the care from
King Jong Il, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea,
and Jiang Zemin, Chinese President and General Secretary of the
Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tang's current visit will help further such
friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Macao's upcoming return to China will further prove the
correctness of China's policy to reunify the country, and the DPRK
is strongly opposed to the "two-state" statements made by Lee Teng-
hui, leader of the Taiwanese authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Tang and his DPRK counterpart, Baek Nam Sun,
attended a banquet hosted by the DPRK Foreign Ministry to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of diplomatic ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Tang called on Kim Yang Gon, director of the
International Affairs Department of the Central Committee of the
Workers' Party. He also met Baek Nam Sun on Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Says That Scientific Developments Need Commercial Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Li Lanqing said on
Wednesday that China's research and corporate worlds need to work
closely together for the commercial application of technological
developments.
</P>
<P>
Both the corporate world and the world of science and research
need to do so through various forms of cooperation, he said. Most
of the leading research institutes in China have no connection
with industry, and for this and other reasons, most of their
scientific and technological developments get shelved instead of
being put to commercial use.
</P>
<P>
As the information age approaches, he said, during a visit to
the Beijing Botanical Garden and a high-tech farming company, the
most important thing is knowledge, and, although a lot of
knowledge has been gained leading to a great number of
technological developments, only a small number of them have been
put to commercial use because of a missing link, which is the
commercial mechanism.
</P>
<P>
China needs to make an effort to establish that mechanism so
that technological developments can be put to commercial use as
soon as the market needs them. It is only by encouraging research
institutes to get taken over by industry or to be transformed into
enterprises that science and technology can play a greater role in
the economy and the economy can grow by leaps and bounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been using new technology in industry, agriculture,
communications, and environmental protection to promote economic
and social development and this is very promising and deserves
support, he concluded.

lucky loser" Todd Woodbridge have won through to play each other
in the quarterfinals of the Heineken Open, Shanghai after they
scored vastly different types of victories here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under cloudy and at times threatening skies, 23-year-old Rios
comfortably moved past Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-3, 6-2 while
Woodbridge rallied from a match point down to beat Hyung-Taik Lee
of South Korea 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (10-8).
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge had ironically lost to the South Korean in the last
round of qualifying but got into the main draw when his doubles
partner Mark Woodforde withdrew because of an arm injury.
</P>
<P>
Rios declared that he can feel his confidence slowly returning
and with each match he plays better. The world number seven said
his left leg injury which kept him out of ATP Tour events in the
middle of the year, including Wimbledon, was responding well to
continuous treatment.
</P>
<P>
"When you are not injured it's pretty easy to play well, when
you have problems with your body, it's pretty hard to go on court,
" said Rios.
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge put things together very well against Lee and said
it was one of the best matches he had played for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
He added that if he plays well he should not have trouble with
Woodbridge because "he's a doubles player now". Amusingly, barely
an hour earlier Woodbridge had made it clear he "hates to be
called a doubles specialist".
</P>
<P>
The Australian felt good about the week and was eager to build
on what he calls a "lucky break" getting into the main draw which
allows him to defend the ranking points he gained last year at the
Heineken Open, Shanghai when he was a quarterfinalist.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose and this is like an upward graph for me
right now," said Woodbridge. "I'm just hoping for match wins this
year because of my poor singles. I'm working on my game and it's
promising. I've got my goals and I want to get back to where I've
been."
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge had to fight so hard to escape from the match. In
the second set Lee led 2-0 and had three points for 3-0, but when
Woodbridge managed to break back and win 25 of 29 points, he felt
things were on the move even though it continued to be very tight
till the end.
</P>
<P>
"He is a very good player and I realised that when I played him
in qualifiers. That was a high standard match and he showed no
weaknesses and I can see no reason why he can't be in the top 100,
" said Woodbridge. "I tried to step up the pace, hit my forehand
and get in (to the net)."
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden managed to work
through a second set hiccup and defeated Lars Burgsmuller of
Germany. The fifth seeded Swede reached the quarterfinals with a
score of 7-5, 3-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The qualifier from Sweden, Andreas Vinciguerra, made short work
of American Cecil Mamiit 6-1, 6-3. There is a Swede guaranteed of
a place in the semifinals because Bjorkman will play Vinciguerra.
</P>
<P>
In the doubles, world No. 1 Leander Paes and Maheshi Bhupathi
made a solid step forward in their defence, thrashing Chinese pair
of Li si and Yang Jingzhu 6-2, 6-1.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Be Ready for Concord by Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that a preparatory commission tasked to
study proposed economic reforms through the Constitutional
Corrections for Development (Concord) process would complete its
work by the yearend.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview, Estrada said the Preparatory
Commission on Constitutional Reforms (PCCR) chaired by retired
Chief Justice Andres Narvasa has buckled down to work on the
economic reform proposals.
</P>
<P>
"They are very busy now. And hopefully, they will meet the
deadline on December 31," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the public anew to support his Concord
initiative which he said is a vital element of his program to help
the masses rise above poverty and reinforce the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration is doing all it can within its power
to liberate the majority of Filipinos from poverty, including
pushing the Concord process, even though it continues to encounter
opposition from some sectors.
</P>
<P>
Part of these long-term solutions is the implementation of
economic reforms through the Concord that will remove restrictions
on the entry of foreign capital into the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that allowing 100-percent foreign ownership of public
utilities and local businesses will encourage overseas investors
to pour their resources and technologies into the country, which
in turn will invigorate local industries and create more jobs for
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The present constitution bars foreigners from owning land and
gaining a controlling stake in local businesses, including public
utilities.

<HEADLINE> Somali Inter-clan Fighting Kills Nine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were
killed and more than a dozen others wounded in inter-clan
fightings for farmland ownership in the remote villages of Bulo
Ahmed and Kulmis, about 110 kilometers north of the capital on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 According to reports reaching here on Wednesday, the two
villages exchanged heavy gunfire with assault refiles, rocket
propelled grenades and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has forced dozens of families to flee their small
huts.
</P>
<P>
Clan elders from the various subclans of Shidleh in Jowhar town
have rushed to the fighting scene to broker for peace. Latest
reports from the villages said that the area has returned to calm,
but the tension is still high with the dispute unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said the fightings within Badih-Addeh clan for
land ownership have claimed more than ten lives and wounded many
others in villages near Bulo Burto district of Hiran region.
</P>
<P>
These emerging fightings have aroused concerns that Somali
unarmed societies, clans and subclans will get deeply involved
into inter-clan killings in the war-ravaged African Horn country.
</P>
<P>
Some of these clans are even challenging the main armed
communities who seem to have tired of fighting or weakened as a
result of earlier confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier non-armed communities of the Bantu, Biyomal, Rer Hamar
and Garreh clans have formed alliances against the faction led by
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and vowed to eliminate his forces from the
fertile regions of southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to Aden Hassan, a weapons dealer in Mogadishu, the
minority communities are buying a large amount of ammunition and
weapons, ready to launch attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nanchang, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Some universities on the
Mainland and those in other countries and in Hong Kong have
reached agreements on granting degrees from those universities
overseas and in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A member of the State Council's Academic Degree Committee made
the announcement here today at a seminar on Sino-Foreign
University Projects. The programs include an MBA from Beijing
University and Stanford University and an MBA with concentration
on hi-tech administration from Qinghua University and Arizona
State University.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the program is to train better administrators
which are badly needed in China.
</P>
<P>
The Committee says that there are 30 such programs in all
involving 27 universities from the Mainland and 25 from the U.S.,
Britain, Australia, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Thailand,
and 2 from Hong Kong. They include State University of New York at
Buffalo, New South Wales University, and Greenwich University.
</P>
<P>
Li Jun, the deputy-director of the Committee, says that the
joint university programs benefit the higher education system here
and help China get high quality teaching staff, materials, and
methods from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese institutions need to be well qualified to be
involved in the graduate program and degrees don't meet their
standards will not be recognized, he added.

<HEADLINE> JTC to Expand Business in China: JTC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore business
leader said Wednesday that the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will
expand business in China.
</P>
<P>
"Building on what we have achieved in Suzhou, we hope to do
more business in China," Major General Lim Neo Chian, chairman of
JTC, which contributes more than one quarter of the country's
manufacturing output, said at a press conference here to release
JTC annual report 1998/1999 and announce the corporation's future
plans.
</P>
<P>
"My direction is to do more rather than to do less in China,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lim noted that JTC's international operation has done well
despite the Asian economic crisis and projects by its overseas arm
JTC International (JTCI) in both industrial park development and
consultancy have made good progress.
</P>
<P>
He expected that JTCI will earn quite an amount of net profit
from its China branch XinSu company in Suzhou this year.
</P>
<P>
On fixed asset investment by investors in JTCI's industrial
parks in foreign countries, the JTC chairman said ready-built
factories in the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park have 57
customers to date, investing more than 400 million U.S. dollars
and generating more than 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Occupancy is 91 percent for standard factories and 60 percent
for flatted ones there, he added.
</P>
<P>
Data released by JTC shows that the figure is the highest among
JTCI's 19 industrial park and infrastructure projects in China,
the Philippines, Thailand, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and other
places.
</P>
<P>
Referring to JTCI's consultancy business in China, Lim said its
consultancy subsidiary, JTCI Consultants (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. (JTCI
Suzhou) has successfully expanded from its base in Suzhou to other
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994, JTCI Suzhou has since undertaken projects
in Shanghai, Baoding and Chongqing and is vigorously pursuing
Zhejiang, Tianjin and Beijing, Lim said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Passes Bill to Benefit Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives has passed a bill increasing the capital stock of
the government-owned Home Insurance and Guarantee Corporation
(HIGC) to benefit the homeless, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill passed Tuesday night, the yearly capital
stock has been increased to 50 billion pesos (1.25 billion U.S.
dollars) from the previous 2.5 billion pesos (62.5 million
dollars), and the corporate life is also extended for another 50
years.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Manuel Villar was quoted as saying the HIGC
guarantees loans made by home-buyers to private developers in mass
housing projects pushed by the government and this will surely
boost the government's mass housing drive and help provide shelter
to homeless Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The bill, Villar said, will restore private-sector confidence
to resume investments and lending operations for the housing
industry and will also come up with affordable units for
low-income earners.
</P>
<P>
Villar said the proposed law likewise gives poor Filipinos
access to own homes. Mass housing and agriculture have been named
the two top priorities of the government in its poverty
eradication drive, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the Senate version of the bill already passed, Villar said
the bill would be passed into law soon.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denies Indian Charge of Cross-Border Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday dismissed
as baseless India's allegations of cross-border terrorism, saying
such "baseless charges" have never been backed up with facts or
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The denial was made by a Foreign Office spokesman here in
response to Indian Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath's reported
statement Tuesday that resumption of dialogue with Pakistan was
possible if the latter ended cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are made as a smoke-screen behind which India
continues with its state-sponsored terrorism" in Indian-held
Kashmir, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the fact that Raghunath had linked resumption
of talks with stopping of alleged cross-border terrorism by
Pakistan, the spokesman said this kind of precondition for
resumption of dialogue is unacceptable to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has consistently rejected the "baseless Indian
allegations of support for the so-called cross-border terrorism,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about India's test-firing of the surface-to air
missile, Akash, on Tuesday, he said it was another step to
destabilize peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The test of the Akash missile "is yet another destabilizing
step by India for peace and security in the region," he charged.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Further Open Aviation Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is encouraging foreign and
 indigenous airlines to compete with the Nigeria Airways on
international routes to re-invigorate the country's declining
aviation sector.
</P>
<P>
The message was contained in a new aviation policy unfolded by
Aviation Minister Olusegun Agagu at the opening of the first
International Civil Aviation Forum held in Abuja Tuesday, reported
the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the new policy is aimed to develop Lagos
into the hub of African air transportation and travelling system.
</P>
<P>
Under this policy, private airlines would be allowed to compete
on international routes with the Nigeria Airways, the monopoly of
Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA).
</P>
<P>
Besides the liberalization of designated carriers on
international routes, other measures are also underway to boost
indigenous airline participation in international operations,
Agagu said.
</P>
<P>
He said these include simplifying aircraft flight clearance by
removal of military clearance and allowing foreign airlines into
more than one entry point in the country provided they pay
commercial compensation.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo had early in July directed the
Ministry of Aviation to produce, among others, an Action Program
to resuscitate the aviation industry of the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, subsequently, produced an action plan in such
areas as airspace and airport management, safety and economic
regulation, revival of the national carrier, stimulation of
foreign airline participation, reinforcement of manpower
development and development of Lagos into a hub.
</P>
<P>
According to Agagu, privatization of the airline is the
ultimate goal of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded Wednesday morning during Israeli shelling on south
Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
A man and his child were injured when Israeli artillery troops
fired shells on the village of Furoun on the edge of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Finnish battalion's position inside the village was also hit
by the shells, which only caused some damages to houses, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli warplanes also blasted other
mountainous areas and villages in and outside the border enclave,
which are believed to be hideouts for guerillas of Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 4500-strong United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon made
up of troops from nine countries are installed to help the
Lebanese government to restore authority over its land in the
south.

<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- France's exports to the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
reached more than 1 billion U.S. dollars in the first seven months
of this year, up 53 percent compared to the same period last year,
the Khaleej Times daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France's imports from the UAE during the same period
reached 30 million dollars, down by 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
France saw a sharp increase in its exports to UAE of
agricultural and food products, automobiles, electrical and
electronic equipments and consumer goods during the period, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The number of companies operating in the Jebel Ali
free zone in Dubai has increased to 1,600 from 88 countries,
making it the largest such zone throughout an area from Europe to
East Asia, said an official at the Dubai harbor.
</P>
<P>
Total investments in the zone are expected to exceed the two-
billion-U.S.-dollar level this year, the Arabic-language daily Al
Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco has called on American, Canadian and British
oil companies to engage in prospecting for petroleum and natural
gas in the country, the Arabic-language daily Al Hayat reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made on the sideline of a recently-held
International Energy Conference in Huston, U.S.A..
</P>
<P>
Morocco discovered large oil fields in the rocky central
regions of the Atlantic Ocean in the early 1980's. And unlimited
amount of petroleum exists in the southern region of Torfaya, but
the high cost of extracting and refining it makes the project
economically unfeasible.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government has decided to bear the debts
of Jordan's petroleum refineries amounting to 211 million dinars
(300 million U.S. dollars) instead of those of the Royal Jordanian
Airlines to facilitate its privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the national carrier involves the
separation of its auxiliary units, namely, the duty free market,
catering, supply, maintenance of engines and the training center,
as well as the setting up of independent companies to undertake
those units. It will then be sold to the private sector to settle
internal debts, the Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom quoted the official
as saying Wednesday.

where millions ride the rails every day.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- With both sides acknowledging that the U.S. Senate would
soundly reject a landmark treaty banning underground nuclear

saving way to put off a vote and declare victory.

<P>
The Congress and its allies were ahead in 106 constituencies,

constituencies, bagging two seats.
</P>
<P>
In Delhi, the BJP, which has bagged four of the seven Lok Sabha
seats and established a convincing lead in the remaining three
constituencies, is all set to sweep the parliamentary polls.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 elections, the BJP only won one seat in the national
capital.

<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is leading in Lucknow
constituency by 109,654 votes against his Congress rival Karan

expectations and projections by various opinion and exit polls.
</P>
<P>
He said that the BJP-led NDA will get a clear majority to form
the new government as voters appear to have favored
re-installation of Vajpayee as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the landslide victory in Delhi, he said it was
the first time since 1977 that the BJP was winning all the seats
in the national capital.

<HEADLINE> Turning HK into World-Class City: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), made his
pledge here Wednesday to turn Hong Kong into a world-class,
knowledge-based cosmopolitan city.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong should not only be a major Chinese city, but could
become the most cosmopolitan city in Asia, enjoying a status
comparable to that of New York in North America and London in
Europe," said Tung in his third annual policy address to the
Legislative Council Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong is faced with three momentous changes,
namely, globalization of the world's economy, rapid economic
development on the mainland, and economic restructuring, in the
move towards a new era.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation calls for urgency in action," Tung said.
"We must face the new reality: Hong Kong must position itself
firmly and clearly in the global economy."
</P>
<P>
Tung, who initiated the plan to develop Hong Kong into a world-
class city in his last policy address, said Hong Kong already
possesses many of the key features common to New York and London.
</P>
<P>
"For example, we are already an international center of finance
and a popular tourist destination, and hold leading positions in
trade and transportation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are all pillars of our economy. If we can consolidate
our existing economic pillars and continue to build on our
strengths, we should be able to become world-class," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Then, like New York and London, we will play a pivotal role in
the global economy, be home to a host of multi-national companies
and provide services to the entire region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we must admit that Hong Kong lags behind
other international world-class cities in many respects, in
particular human capital and living environment," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the unique advantages of Hong Kong, Tung said, "We
have the thriving mainland next to us. We are a melting pot for
Chinese and Western cultures. We are a high liberal and open
society. Our institutions are well established."
</P>
<P>
"Our per capita income is on a par with other affluent
economies. Our infrastructure is comprehensive. The rule of law is
secure and we have well-established regulatory and management
systems," he added.
</P>
<P>
"With such a strong foundation, we should be able to build on
our strengths and develop modern and knowledge-intensive
industries, erect new pillars in our economy and open up new and
better prospects," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Vows to Introduce Reforms, Maintain Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here
Wednesday that the SAR government will reform some of the existing
systems and procedures to adapt to changes and demands of the new
era.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his annual policy address, Tung said the government
has been determined to remove any weaknesses through reform during
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"Since Hong Kong has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy
following its return, it is natural that the community has greater
expectations of the government," said Tung. "Moreover, there is
still room for improvement."
</P>
<P>
He classified the reforms into three types. The first is
related to the improvement to some market mechanisms and injecting
greater vitality into the markets. The second is the
rationalization of the government's basic policies or delivery
systems. The third is the modernization of the civil service
structure which involves government efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said the reforms of the first type, which include the
strengthening of the linked exchange rate regime and the merger of
the two exchanges, will remove some of the weaknesses that
surfaced in the
financial turmoil and further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform of rationalizing the government's basic
policies or administrative structure, the government will launch
education reforms and the dissolution of the Municipal Councils,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
As for the modernization of the civil service, productivity
enhancement, and entry pay adjustment, these reforms are being
implemented gradually after consultation and careful deliberation
with the aim to improve services and efficiency, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung pointed out that the Basic Law underpins Hong Kong's
institutions and enables the Hong Kong SAR to build a quality
society with unique characteristics, adding that the institutions
provide the basis for Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law, a clean administration, freedom of the press,
protection of the freedoms and rights of the individual, are all
essential elements contributing to the success of Hong Kong," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"In seeking reforms, we will do so step by step paying due
attention to the need to maintain the community's prosperity and
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the individual circumstances, we will introduce
reforms in different areas at varying speeds and by different
means," said Tung, expressing his confidence that a better society
will be built in Hong Kong by implementing the reforms.

<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Foreign Minister Alhaji
Lamido justified the country's withdrawal of troops from Sierra
Leone, saying that the crisis had caused the nation heavily in
lives and resources.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters on Tuesday, "We have been there for
a number of years trying to restore democracy and it has been
quite a lot of burden to us in terms of the cost in human lives
and also in resources," reported the Vanguard, a major Nigerian
newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Nigerian troops in the West African
Peacekeeping Force or ECOMOG will continue to stay there at the
moment for the current troubles in Sierra Leone's peace process.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that he had met Sierra Leone's rebel leader Foday
Sankoh three weeks ago, and Sankoh "seemed more than willing to
surrender to ECOMOG", led by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the future United Nations peacekeeping force
in Sierra Leone, he said it will be a neutral arrangement,
despite the United Nations is trying to adopt the ECOMOG forces.
He said  the commander of the U.N. force would not be a Nigerian
like that is the situation in the ECOMOG.

Troops stationed in Warri, an ethnic clashes stricken area in

He added: "the army would no longer consider posting of

deployed.

"You are expected to be very neutral in any operation, you know

<HEADLINE> HK to Create Quality Living Environment: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) - Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here
Wednesday that the SAR government would make efforts to create a
pleasant and safe living environment for the citizens.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his third policy address to the legislators, Tung
said that the government will take three measures for this
objective: first, implement urban renewal thoroughly; second,
protect the natural environment of the countryside; and third,
fully utilize and beautify the Victoria Harbor in an integrated
fashion.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to set up an Urban Renewal Authority (
URA) next year to replace the current Land Development Corporation
(LDC), which has been shouldering the arduous task of urban
renewal, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The URA will be entrusted with powers to assemble land for
redevelopment to remove the obstacles of a protracted land
acquisition process and a shortage of rehousing resources the LDC
is facing.
</P>
<P>
"When the URA is established and the new initiatives are
implemented, we believe that all priority projects can be
completed within two decades, instead of three as previously
estimated," Tung told the 60-member Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The new approach to urban renewal aims at facilitating
comprehensive planning over larger areas, providing additional
open space, green belts, and community facilities and improving
road networks while preserving the distinctive features of the old
districts concerned.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to rehabilitate and preserve unique buildings
as this not only accords with our objective of sustainable
development but also facilitates the retention of the inherent
characteristics of different districts, and helps promote tourism,
" Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The government will review the existing heritage policy and
related legislation for better protection of historic buildings
and archaeological sites, he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Taking advantage of the beautiful natural landscape of Lantau
Island and Sai Kung District, we intend to develop these two areas
into centers of recreational and leisure activities compatible
with the principle of nature conservation," the chief executive
said.
</P>
<P>
To protect the Victoria Harbor, an integral part of Hong Kong
that all citizens treasure, the government has decided to scale
back the reclamation planned for the harbor.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we will make land available along the waterfront for
promenades and walkways so that our citizens and visitors can stay
away from the hubbub of the city, stroll along the promenades and
enjoy the beautiful scenery and refreshing sea breeze," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the open space on both sides of the harbor from Lei Yue Mun
in the east to Kennedy Town in the west, we will provide open
plazas, landscaped areas, marinas, shops and restaurants with
distinct cultural flavors," he went on.
</P>
<P>
Traffic corridors along the waterfront should be built as
underground or semi-submerged roads to alleviate noise and air
pollution as well as to improve the visual aspect, Tung said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) - Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here
Wednesday that he is confident that Hong Kong's economy will
continue to pick up as the most difficult times have passed.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his Policy Address to the Legislative Council
Wednesday afternoon, Tung said that Hong Kong's economy is showing
signs of turning the corner as the various relief measures taken
by the government in the past two years steadily produce results
and the Asian financial turmoil slowly subsides.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there has been a gradual revival of consumer
sentiment and Hong Kong's export trade has picked up, Tung said.
The number of inbound tourists has been on the rise and the stock
and property markets have stabilized, he added.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's economy has been growing steadily and will
continue to provide numerous business opportunities, the chief
executive said.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the "one country, two systems" concept
for the past two years has laid a sound foundation for the SAR's
future development, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have kept our economic framework intact and consolidated
Hong Kong's position as a financial center in the face of the
Asian financial turmoil," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"Overcoming the challenges faced in the past two years has not
been easy. It has only been possible because of the perseverance,
initiative and pragmatism shown by Hong Kong people and the ample
trust and full support shown by our country," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> HK to Further Develop Basic Education: Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- In his policy address here
Wednesday, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa once again stressed the importance of
improving basic education in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
One of the important policies is to delegate full authority and
responsibility to schools and their front-line staff as far as
possible.
</P>
<P>
This is resulting in a leaner departmental management structure,
he said, adding that at the same time, measures are also being
implemented to strengthen school-based management and enhance the
schools' accountability.
</P>
<P>
Whole-day primary schooling is also an important part of Hong
Kong's efforts to raise the quality of education, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the percentage of primary students enjoying
whole-day schooling has risen from 19 percent in 1997 to 32
percent this year. By September 2002, the percentage will have
doubled to reach the earlier interim target of 60 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has set the long-term target of achieving
whole-day schooling for almost all primary school students by the
2007-2008 school year, he added.
</P>
<P>
To help improve quality education, the government has set up a
5-billion-HK dollar (641 million U.S. dollars) Quality Education
Fund to support school-based innovative practices and to improve
the quality of teaching and learning, he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the government has granted some 580 million HK dollars
(74.3 million U.S. dollars) to over 1,000 projects, benefiting
more than 600,000 kindergarten, primary and secondary students, he
said, adding that the projects have improved the effectiveness of
both teaching and learning, and have encouraged the teachers and
principals involved to try out more creative ways of teaching.
</P>
<P>
Promoting information technology in education is also an
important government policy concerning education.
</P>
<P>
Since the publication of the five-year strategy on information
technology in education last November, the government has offered
schools cash grants for purchasing computers, provided 120 schools
each with an information technology coordinator, and begun
information technology training for teachers.
</P>
<P>
Within the next five years, Hong Kong school children will be
able to master the general application of information technology,
connect to the Internet, and be equipped to become life-long
learners with inquiring and creative minds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also provide comprehensive training
programs for school principals. The first program is scheduled to
commence in the 2000-2001 school year. All newly-appointed
principals will have to complete the first part of the program
prior to appointment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Language ability is also stressed. By 2005, all serving
language teachers must have attained the benchmarks established
for those teaching English in junior secondary schools and
Putonghua in primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will also provide support for the
development of quality private schools and Direct Subsidy Scheme
schools, as a move to introduce greater diversity and to give
parents more choice, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK, Guangdong to Improve Pearl River Delta Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government and the Guangdong
provincial government have pledged to make joint efforts to
further improve the environment of the Pearl River Delta region.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued Wednesday by HKSAR Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa and Governor of the Guangdong provincial government
Lu Ruihua, the two sides have agreed to set up a Joint Working
Group on Sustainable Development and Environment Protection under
the Hong Kong/Guangdong Cooperation Joint Conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, both sides have commenced joint
topical studies on acid rain, nitrogen dioxide, photochemical smog
and particulates to identify the sources of problem that affect
air quality in the Pearl River Delta region and to recommend
effective mitigation measures. Both sides pledge to complete the
joint study by early 2001 and devise as soon as possible control
strategies to jointly improve air quality in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are concerned about air pollution brought about
by motor vehicles in both places. It is therefore necessary to
establish the "Hong Kong-Guangdong Motor Diesel Fuel Specification
Working Group" to look into the feasibility of harmonizing motor
diesel fuel specifications between the two places and formulate a
concrete action plan to achieve such harmonization. The Working
Group will also explore measures that could be implemented in the
short term to reduce air pollution caused by cross-boundary
traffic.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have decided to establish the "Hong Kong-
Guangdong Working Group on Afforestation and Conservation" to
forge closer cooperation on the development of sustainable
forestry and nature conservation, including the exchange of
scientific information and technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
The new closed aqueduct of the Dongshen Water Supply System
would be completed by 2002. To ensure the quality of the water
supplied, both sides reiterate their great concern for improving
and protecting the water quality of Dongjiang River and their
further cooperation on pollution control and on improving the
water quality.
</P>
<P>
To improve the water quality in the Estuary, both sides agree
to enhance exchange regarding the protection of and cooperation on
the water environment so as to enable both sides to implement
proposals for protecting the water quality of the Pearl River
Delta Region and to formulate a management plan for the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will encourage cooperation in research on
environmental and planning issues that will contribute to
sustainable development of the Pearl River Delta region. They
will continue to work closely on the implementation of action
plans to improve the environment in Deep Bay (Shenzhen Bay) and
Mirs Bay, and to cooperate in the conservation of Chinese White
Dolphins.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Pledges Closer Ties With Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here
Wednesday that the economic link with the Chinese mainland is the
greatest advantage in the future development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The vigorous economic growth and intensification of reforms of
the mainland offer us new opportunities," said Tung. "There is
huge potential for cooperation in the commercialization of new and
high-tech innovations, as well as in the development of new
industries such as Chinese medicine."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the symbiotic relationship between Hong Kong
and the mainland is expected to gain momentum with the admission
of China to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"As services are one of Hong Kong's strengths, we can break new
ground and work with the mainland in the development of her export-
oriented industries, and in the use of information technology for
establishing new modes of business and industrial operations, "he
said.
</P>
<P>
To support such long-term economic cooperation, an inter-
departmental group chaired by the financial secretary has been set
up to liaison with relevant central government authorities and
experts on matters related to China's admission to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and
the Trade and Industry Bureau of the Hong Kong SAR have agreed to
set up a joint committee to strengthen communication on economic
and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
Tung pointed out that the 50,000 sq. km. region encompassing
Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macao, Shenzhen and Zhuhai in south China
will become a more integrated regional economy, following the
return of Macao to China at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"More Hong Kong People will invest, spend, acquire property,
travel and settle in the region," he said. "The increase in
economic strength of the region as a whole will in turn provide
impetus for Hong Kong's further growth."
</P>
<P>
"Under the concept of 'one country, two systems', we will
together explore ways to allow the free flow and pooling of
manpower, goods, capital ad other resources in response to
economic forces, so as to rise to a higher level," Tung pledged.
</P>
<P>
To cater for the increasing heavy demand for cross-boundary
traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong, the SAR Transport Bureau
is implementing a series of immediate measures aiming at expanding
the passenger and freight handling capacity of existing rail and
road crossings.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-Mainland Cross-Boundary Major Infrastructure
Coordinating Committee is actively working on the design and
implementation of new cross-boundary links, such as crossings,
marine terminals, shipping routes, railways and bridges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure aside, the SAR government is also actively
considering ways to streamline cross-boundary customs clearing
procedures, he continued, adding that Hong Kong-Shenzhen boundary
is already one of the busiest land crossings in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Traffic and trade between Hong Kong and the mainland will
thrive more than one can imagine, once these new projects and
streamlined procedures are put in place," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Succeeds Politically, Economically in Past Two Years: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
said here Wednesday that the Hong Kong government has been
successful in implementing the "one country, two systems" concept
in Hong Kong and in riding out the Asian financial storm in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his Policy Address at the Legislative Council here
Wednesday afternoon, Tung said that over the past two years, Hong
Kong has experienced two momentous changes -- Hong Kong's
reunification with the motherland and the considerable
readjustment to the economy triggered by the regional and even
global effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1997, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
SAR) government came into being under the principle of "Hong Kong
people running Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
"On the same day, we established the Court of Final Appeal in
the spirit of true judicial independence," Tung said. "We also
formed the Provisional Legislative Council and subsequently held
elections for the first Legislative Council of the SAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
All these fundamental changes have taken place smoothly, and,
at the same time, there has been no change in Hong Kong's economic
and legal systems, Tung added. "People's way of life has remained
much the same. Freedoms, including that of speech and of assembly,
have been safeguarded," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains a separate customs territory that cooperates
directly with the international community in areas such as
protecting intellectual property rights and fighting against drugs
and smuggling. "We also exercise our own stringent control on the
import and export of strategic commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The trend of mass emigration in the run-up to the handover has
now reversed to a flow of returnees.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, last year, even at the height of the regional
financial turmoil, there were over 23,000 transactions in new
private residential properties and over 33,000 in subsidized flats
under the Home Ownership Scheme, Tenants Purchase Scheme, Flat-for-
Sale Scheme and Sandwich Class Housing Scheme.
</P>
<P>
In total, people committed over 100 billion HK dollars to buy
their own homes here in Hong Kong. Even in the face of economic
volatility, these families have cast their vote of confidence in
Hong Kong's future with their assets and actions, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is subjected to severe blows of the financial crisis,
Tung said. "Our financial system came under immense pressure in
the summer of 1998. We faced speculative attacks in local stock
and foreign exchange markets. Confidence in our financial system
was shaken," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the SAR government, through the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority, made the decisive and timely decision to
enter the markets and stabilized them, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was widely criticized at that time. In retrospect,
exceptional though it was, we made the correct move," Tung
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We have since adopted a series of measures to strengthen the
linked exchange rate regime and our financial system's defense,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has consolidated Hong Kong's position as an
international financial center and the sudden arrival of the
financial turmoil only speeded up the necessary readjustment of
our economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Federal Troops May Cross Terek River in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
said Wednesday that Russian federal troops may cross the Terek
River in Chechnya in its latest campaign to root out Islamic
rebels in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will depend on the situation," he said, noting
that some of the Russian units have already advanced to as far as
Terek.
</P>
<P>
All federal troops have reached the Terokumsky irrigation
channel laid along Terek at a distance of 10 kilometers, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Terek River passes about 15 kilometers north of Grozny,
the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that the federal grouping continues "to create a
security zone around the republic" in the first stage of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
He said federal forces, which had encountered "pocket
resistance" from the rebels, might face large-scale military
operations by Chechen formations.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared for everything," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia lost two warplanes, one Su-24 attack plane and a Su-24
bomber, earlier this week and the fate of the pilots remained
unknown.
</P>
<P>
Search and rescue operation continues to locate the pilots. "
We have not lost hope for saving them," the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, former Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin voiced his opposition to the federal units' crossing of
the Terek River, warning of inevitable large-scale battles and
heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said he told President Boris Yeltsin the same thing
during the 1994-1996 Chechen war. Federal troops crossed the
river then and the war ended disastrously. Some 90,000 people
perished in that war.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Rejects Responsibility for Arsenic Contamination in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF)
on Wednesday denied that it was responsible for the arsenic
contamination in Bangladesh reportedly resulting from excessive
extraction of ground water by UNICEF-provided tube wells.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, visiting Deputy Executive
Director of UNICEF Karin Holmgrunn Sham Poo said the organization
was not the introducer of tube wells in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to Bangladesh to ensure pathogen-free safe
drinking water and mobilized people to use tube-well water in this
regard," she said, adding that extraction of ground water was not
the only cause of arsenic contamination.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has taken a multi-sectoral approach to address some
problems in Bangladesh, such as mobilization of people against
women repression, maternal mortality, acid burns and arsenic
contamination, she said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Local Government, Rural Development and
Cooperative Minister Zillur Rahman on Wednesday, the UNICEF deputy
executive director assured the Bangladeshi government of the
organization's continued assistance to control arsenic
contamination in the ground water of the country.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF would strengthen its assistance to prevent
arsenic-related health hazards and to combat the arsenic menace in
Bangladesh, she said.
</P>
<P>
Rahman told the UNICEF official that the causes of arsenic
contamination in Bangladesh have been identified and the
government has taken immediate steps to ensure the supply of pure
drinking water and other rehabilitation measures in the affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
Out of 64 districts in the country, 59 are affected and arsenic
contamination level is high in the ground water in 211 out of the
country's 460 thanas (sub-districts), he said.
</P>
<P>
"To control this national disaster, the government is working
with the donors, development partners and non-governmental
organizations for launching a collective endeavor to contain the
menace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic contamination in tube-well water was first detected in
the country's northern region in 1993 and arsenic-related diseases
have taken on an epidemic form in 21 districts of the country,
killing hundreds of people.

<HEADLINE> South Asia Should Join Hands for Energy Resource: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Dr.
Ram Sharan Mahat said that South Asian countries should speed up
their efforts to make optimal use of their energy resource
endowments to better develop their economies, the official RSS
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on regional cooperation in South Asia
organized by Foreign and Common Wealth Office of the United
Kingdom in London, Mahat said Nepal's vast water resources could
be used not only for generating electricity which could earn
revenue for Nepal, but could also bring external benefits such as
irrigation, flood control and navigation for the lower riparian
countries.
</P>
<P>
As benefits would go to lower riparian states such as India and
Bangladesh, they could be brought in to share the investment cost
also within the framework of regional cooperation, Mahat said.
</P>
<P>
Mahat also said that to bring down the investment cost of
hydropower and produce electricity at an affordable price, South
Asian countries should make their economies more business-friendly
and attractive to international investors, adding that policy
shifts under unstable political situations raise risks and push up
the cost.
</P>
<P>
The conference with its theme "South Asia: How Can Closer
Regional Cooperation be Achieved?" is taken place in London on
October 4-8, said RSS.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Launch Virtual Global Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is expected to
launch a virtual global exchange that offers listing and trading
of financial and non-financial products in multicurrency in its
offshore financial center of Labuan in March 2000, Bank Negara
(State Bank) Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Products to be listed on the exchange, known as Labuan
International Financial Exchange (LIFE), will include mutual
funds, bonds, derivatives, insurance-linked products and possibly
intellectual properties, the central bank chief said.
</P>
<P>
LIFE would be market-driven, run by participants of the market
and adopting best international practices of offshore exchanges
in the world, he said in his keynote address at the fourth Labuan
Annual Lecture services in Labuan, off Sabah, East Malaysia. His
speech was read out by the bank's assistant governor Awang Adek
Hussin.
</P>
<P>
"Its rules will be flexible to allow dual listings as well as
investors and companies from other jurisdictions to tap capital,"
Bernama news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cost of listing would be competitive and trading could be
conducted 24 hours a day, the central bank governor said, adding
that more importantly, there will be plenty of spin-offs to the
other offshore players to participate in the form of providing
custodial, depository, clearing and trustee services.
</P>
<P>
He said that LIFE would be developed and wholly-owned by the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) to draw on its resources and
experience.
</P>
<P>
LIFE will be regulated under the Labuan Offshore Securities
Industry Act (LOSIA) 1998 that also regulates the fund management
business in Labuan.
</P>
<P>
Through LOSIA, The Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority
(LOFSA), a one-stop agency that focuses on the development and
promotion of Labuan as an International Offshore Financial Center,
would be the regulator for LIFE, not the SC as on the on-shore
capital market.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali Abul, the LOFSA would be investing in a
gateway in the World Wide Web so that offshore players could link
to the gateway and interface with their customers.
</P>
<P>
It will provide comprehensive information on the Labuan
International Offshore Financial Center (IOFC) and customers will
have interactive access, via the gateway to financial products and
services offered by the various players in the center, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abul said the idea behind the gateway is to ensure no
duplication of investment by the offshore players and LOFSA.

<HEADLINE> 1000 Nigerians Feared drowned by Flood in Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 1,000 residents in
Kwara State, west of Nigeria, were feared drowned and about
300,000 displaced by flooding in Niger River in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 400 villages are believed to have been submerged by the
rampaging flood, the Vanguard, a leading Nigerian newspaper,
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Worst hit were towns and villages like Pategi, Lafiaji,
Tsaragi, Tsonga and Bacita in Kwara State where the sugar
plantation of the Nigerian Sugar Company was submerged.
</P>
<P>
The state's Governor Mohammed Lawal immediately went to the
flooding areas to assess the damage, while some of the survivors
blamed Nigeria Electric Power Agency (NEPA), which is in charge of
some dams on the upper stream of the river, for the situation.
</P>
<P>
They said the release of excess water from the dams that caused
the flood.
</P>
<P>
But a NEPA official denied that the opening of the dams'
spillway gates caused the flood, explaining that this would be
done soon.
</P>
<P>
The official said: "We have not opened any of the gates but we
are now calling on the state government to enlighten their people
to clear off the flood basin where people are staying illegally
because those reservoirs are now full to capacity and the spillway
gates will be opened at any moment from now."
</P>
<P>
The massive inflow of water comes from Rivers Kaduna and Niger
as well as heavy rainfall experienced in the areas this year.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ahmed Zuruq from Kwara threatened to sue NEPA for
damages arising from the disaster.
</P>
<P>
According to Zuruq, NEPA has reneged on its promise to release
excess water from the dams every four years and to the detriment
of the people of the area.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Lade, chairman of a Local Government in the flooded
area, said over 500 people from his local government area alone
were drowned in the flood.
</P>
<P>
Describing the disaster as the worst in recent times, he
appealed to the government to relocate the people of the area.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Formulate Masterplan for Banking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will formulate a
masterplan to address several issues related to the domestic
banking industry in a holistic manner, Bank Negara (State Bank)
Malaysia (BNM) Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive and coherent masterplan aims at developing
the banking sector and identifying winning strategies to be
pursued over the short to long term, he said in Labuan, off Sabah,
East Malaysia, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In formulating the masterplan, BNM would be assisted by
reputable international consultants, Ali Abul, who is also
chairman of Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority (LOFSA),
said in an address at the fourth Labuan Annual Lecture series
there, which was read out by the bank's assistant governor Awang
Adek Hussin.
</P>
<P>
"The masterplan will be formulated in consultation with the
industry and all other stakeholders. We expect the plan to be
completed during the first half of 2000," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the issues related to the banking industry included how
liberalization should be carried out in relation to the financial
markets and infrastructures, regulatory rules and policies, and
management capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is the vision and aspirations of BNM to create a
strong, progressive and competitive financial system. One which is
able to withstand future shocks without adversely affecting
macroeconomic stability. One that is able to support the nation's
economy effectively and facilitate the economic transformation
process in order for the country to attain developed status by

CANBERRA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- One third of people who applied
for tickets to next year's Olympics have had their order
completely filled, Sydney organisers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Sixty percent of people will get more than half of what they
ordered, and one in three people will have their order completely
filled," said John Bosiljevac, ticket operations manager of the
Sydney Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (SOCOG).

"There will inevitably be some disappointment," he said. "In
our case, we treated everyone equally by running a ballot."
</P>

Bosiljevac said a quarter of applications were unable to be
matched in the ballot, but said in many cases, people only missed
out altogether on high demand tickets, such as the D category
cheapest tickets for the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Applicants who have ordered tickets will begin receiving their
confirmation packages Thursday.
</P>

Those who didn't get everything they wanted will have two weeks

<HEADLINE> London Train Crash Death Toll Rises to 27 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of people confirmed
dead in the London train crash has risen to 27, but police warned
on Wednesday that the death toll is likely to rise further.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened on Tuesday morning when the three-carriage
service run by Thames Trains from Paddington to Bedwyn in
Wiltshire collided with the London-bound Great Western 125 express
train from Cheltenham at Ladbroke Grove.
</P>
<P>
The initial Health and Safety Executive investigation suggests
the Thames train passed one red and two yellow warning signals,
ploughing into the Great Western which had been given a green
light.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Trotter, of the Metropolitan
Police, said the search for bodies would concentrate on the front
first-class carriage of the Great Western train, which was "
devastated" by fire.
</P>
<P>
The grisly search was suspended on Tuesday night with the
emergency services sure there was no one else left alive on either
train.
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 confirmed dead, 12 bodies remain at the scene but he
said he hoped they would all be removed by the end of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police say the search will be a long and laborious task
</P>
<P>
Trotter refused to comment on speculation about the final death
toll but said there were about 500 people on the Great Western
train and at least 100 on the Thames train.
</P>
<P>
As well as the 27 confirmed dead, 165 were taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
An urgent public inquiry has been ordered by Deputy Prime
Minister John Prescott.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered Health and Safety Executive investigators to
issue a preliminary statement on the crash within days, to avoid a
delay like that which followed the Southall rail crash.
</P>
<P>
British officials pledged money on Wednesday to make Britain's
railways safer as rescuers cut through the charred and twisted
wreckage of a London train crash fearing they could find up to 90
bodies.
</P>
<P>
Amid charges that the Tuesday morning tragedy was the result of
a ramshackle, underfunded rail system, Junior Transport Minister
Lord Gus Macdonald said everything would be done to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
The death toll so far makes it Britain's worst rail disaster in
a decade.
</P>
<P>
Paddington, the capital's rail gateway to western Britain and
terminus for a high-speed link to Heathrow airport, was closed
after the crash and was not due to reopen before Friday.

<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
reintroduced open tenders for public works for the first time over
the past 10 years to step up transparency and accountability in
government business.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to open bids for 74 road projects held in capital
Abuja on Tuesday, Minister of Works and Housing Tony Anenih said
that in the past Tenders Boards had become moribund as the award
of contracts were carried out without due reference to the
relevant laid down procedures and government financial
regulations.

<P>
He noted the bidding session was a demonstration of
government's commitment to instituting transparency and
accountability in government business, New Nigerian daily reported

The minister expressed the hope that the reintroduction of open
tenders policy would encourage competitiveness in the choice of

<HEADLINE> Damaged Equipment Blamed for Nuclear Leakage in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Damaged equipment is believed to
have produced the heavy water leak at the Wolsong Nuclear Plant of
North Kyongdang Province, 305 kilometers southeast of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
South Korea Electric Power Corporation Deputy Chairman Park
Yong-taek told a press conference Wednesday that the heavy water
leaked out from the damaged pipe of a seal connecting the motor
and the pump of the No. 3 reactor.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why it was damaged. We will have to wait about
a week until after a thorough check is completed, Park said.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 environmental and civic groups across South Korea,
including the Korean Federation for the Environmental Movement,
have demonstrated at government complexes, demanding a joint
government-civilian team to probe the accident.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two workers were exposed to low-level radiation when
the accident occurred at around 7 p.m. local time Monday during a
preventive safety inspection of the cooling water pump of the No.
3 reactor, which had been out of service since September 23 for
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Science and Technology Ministry said all the
leaked 45 liters of heavy water has been retrieved inside the
plant and the leak didn't pollute the environment and it didn't
pose health hazards.
</P>
<P>
The exposure of the 22 workers of the South Korean Power
Corporation was far below the limited level of yearly average 50
mSV since the nuclear reactor was not in operation, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The 22 workers were exposed to radiation measured at between 0.
006 mSv and 4.5 mSv. Nineteen workers were put back to work while
another three are under special care for overexposure.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a team of nuclear specialists is
investigating details of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The leak was the smallest one of the past four accidents but it
was the first time that people was reportedly exposed to radiation
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 700,000-kilowatt No. 3 reactor went into commercial
operation last year as South Korea's first pressurized heavy water
reactor, which is modeled after Canada's CANDU reactors.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear leak came five days after a disastrous nuclear
accident in Japan in which at least 49 people were exposed to
radiation.

<HEADLINE> Top IDF Educator Warns Against Tolerance of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- One of the lessons Israel can
learn from NATO's onslaught on Yugoslavia is that the world may be
becoming more tolerant of civilian casualties, said a senior
Israeli military officer.
</P>
<P>
"During the war, NATO forces repeatedly hit civilian Serbian
targets and caused heavy civilian casualties. These attacks were
explained as the prices that could not be avoided in war," said
Brig. Gen. Yaacov Amidror, commander of military colleges of the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
</P>
<P>
"Yet the IDF's Grapes of Wrath Operation in 1996 was halted by
the American government in light of the mistaken Israeli strike on
Lebanese civilians," he said in an article published in the latest
edition of Ma'arachot, the Israeli defense establishment's
academic bimonthly.
</P>
<P>
And "now we have to see whether the NATO behavior in the Kosovo
war has the lowered standard of harming civilians" he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to be aware that there is a "new approach in the
relationship of the world and nations considered to be harming
international morality," he warned.
</P>
<P>
NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia from March to
early June, causing heavy civilian casualties and damages
estimated at about 200 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Shippers Ask for Code of Conduct in Shipping Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of ASEAN
Shippers' Council (FASC) Wednesday appealed to governments in the
region to implement an acceptable code of conduct governing the
affairs of the liner shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
The members of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) should also develop such a code of conduct at
the 10th UNCTAD meeting scheduled in Bangkok in February 2000,
FASC Chairman Vicharn Nivatvongs said at a press conference after
the opening of FASC's 22nd annual general meeting here.
</P>
<P>
This should also be a pertinent agenda for General Agreement on
Trade and Services (GATS) 2000 and the World Trade Organization
(WTO), he said.
</P>
<P>
FASC members reiterated at the meeting Wednesday the need for a
formal prior consultation mechanism to be established for more
open dialogues and consultations between shipping lines and
shippers.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism should also provide for government intervention
or arbitration if no agreements are reached by both sides, the
FASC chief said.
</P>
<P>
The very high and rapidly increasing levels of terminal
handling charges with little transparency, documentation fees and
other charges were the major concerns among FASC members, he said,
suggesting these charges be part of an all-in freight rate and not
be charged separately.
</P>
<P>
The three-day FASC 22nd annual general meeting, hosted by the
National Shippers' Council, brought together shipper organizations
from both within and outside the region to discuss and exchange
views on various subjects involving maritime transport.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Newspaper Slams Israel for Lack of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A pro-government Egyptian
newspaper criticized Israel on Wednesday for lack of actions and
steps to support its proclaimed readiness to resume peace
negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three months, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
"has displayed a gift for procrastinating and playing on words,"
the Egyptian Gazette newspaper said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands to resume the negotiations with Israel at the
point where they broke off. But the Israelis "are balking at"
Syria's demand and "playing tricks" to depict Syria as the one
unwilling to make peace, said the paper, which usually mirrors the
thinking of Egypt's leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks came to a halt after a series of
suicide bombings in Israel in early 1996. After Barak was elected
in May and took office in July, both countries expressed readiness
to restart their talks for a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are disputing over Israeli troop withdrawal
from the Golan Heights that the Jewish state captured from Syria
in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that the talks be resumed on the basis of a
promise by late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin that Israel
would pull back from all of the Golan Heights in return for peace
with Syria. But Barak has, so far, failed to respond positively.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis are taking aim at Syria to force it into a tight
corner, a campaign aimed at pressuring Damascus into sitting at
the negotiating table without a pre-set agenda, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It accused Barak of only saying "fine and conciliatory words"
and failing to translate his words into actions.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech at the Israeli Knesset (parliament),
Barak called on Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to "walk (with
him) through the door of opportunities and take the necessary
decisions - even if they are painful - for the sake of the
children of both countries, for a peace of courage and dignity."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian paper urged Barak to keep his promise to make
"peace of the brave."
</P>
<P>
It is Israel that needs to 'take the necessary decisions even
if they are painful' to realize peace with the Syrians by pulling
out of the Golan Heights, it stressed.

Political Commissar of Uganda's ruling National Resistance
Movement James Wapakhabulo will lead a delegation to Kigali on
October 11 to intensify efforts of mending ties with Rwanda,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Both sides sustained heavy losses during the August 13-17
clashes, the first sign of crack in the bilateral relations since
the two allies sent troops to back the DRC rebels soon after the
rebellion broke out in August of 1998.
</P>

The joint investigation team came up with a report in
September blaming the Ugandan side for the clashes.
</P>

The Uganda Military High Command reportedly rejected the
report, saying it was too biased and inconclusive.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Vows to Introduce Reforms, Maintain Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here
Wednesday
that the SAR government will reform some of the existing systems
and
procedures to adapt to changes and demands of the new era.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his annual policy address, Tung said the government
has been determined to remove any weaknesses through reform during
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"Since Hong Kong has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy
following
its return, it is natural that the community has greater
expectations of the government," said Tung. "Moreover, there is
still room for improvement."
</P>
<P>
He classified the reforms into three types. The first is
related
to the improvement to some market mechanisms and injecting greater
vitality into the markets. The second is the rationalization of
the
government's basic policies or delivery systems. The third is the
modernization of the civil service structure which involves
government efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said the reforms of the first type, which include the
strengthening of the linked exchange rate regime and the merger of
the
two exchanges, will remove some of the weaknesses that surfaced in
the
financial turmoil and further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform of rationalizing the government's basic
policies
or administrative structure, the government will launch education
reforms and the dissolution of the Municipal Councils, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
As for the modernization of the civil service, productivity
enhancement, and entry pay adjustment, these reforms are being
implemented gradually after consultation and careful deliberation
with
the aim to improve services and efficiency, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung pointed out that the Basic Law underpins Hong Kong's
institutions and enables the Hong Kong SAR to build a quality
society with unique
characteristics, adding that the institutions provide the basis
for
Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law, a clean administration, freedom of the press,
protection of the freedoms and rights of the individual, are all
essential elements contributing to the success of Hong Kong," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"In seeking reforms, we will do so step by step paying due
attention to the need to maintain the community's prosperity and
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the individual circumstances, we will introduce
reforms in different areas at varying speeds and by different
means," said Tung, expressing his confidence that a better society
will be built in Hong Kong by implementing the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Unveils Program Focus On Leasing, Maintenance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest airplane maker, said Tuesday it has unveiled a new program
to lease commercial jets to airlines and provide maintenance
services, adding the new program will ultimately bring in revenues
rivaling those on commercial jet sales.
</P>
<P>
"You'll see us being a very active participant in the growth of
Boeing," said Joe Gullion, president of Boeing's airplane services
group, noting that more than 10,000 Boeing planes now in use are
candidates for maintenance contracts.
</P>
<P>
The lease and maintenance schemes will focus first on used
airplanes but eventually will include new planes, according to
Gullion, who declined to predict how big the maintenance program
might become.
</P>
<P>
However, he compared it to General Electric Co.'s jet engine
business, where he said services account for 85 percent of the
revenues compared to 15 percent from engine sales alone.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Tuesday announced that DHL Worldwide, a global express
carrier, would lease 44 757-freighters from Boeing over 15 years
for 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and pay Boeing an undisclosed sum to
maintain the planes, including spare parts management, record-
keeping and engineering services.
</P>
<P>
Of the 44 757s that Boeing will lease to DHL Worldwide, 34 will
come from British Airways Plc's inventory, as the flagship British
carrier prepares to place an order for smaller jets.
</P>
<P>
Boeing will spend between 7 million to 9 million dollars each
to convert those 757s, which carry between 200-240 passengers,
into freighters and will deliver them to DHL Worldwide, plus
another 10 converted 757s yet to be identified by November 2003.

</P>
<P>
Intel said it had gained expertise in building Internet
commerce equipment for small businesses through its acquisition of
Dayna Communications in 1997 and "virtual private network"
capabilities by acquiring Shiva Corp. last year.
</P>

Intel said it will sell IPivot's Internet commerce equipment
directly to computer makers.

<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- France's Socialists are divided over a series of social
issues including stock holding, establishment of a public fund for
the retirees and the country's save-as-you-earn system, while
their left-wing allies are watching the debate with suspicion.
While the Ministry of Finance intends to cut tax on shareholders,
some socialist deputies are opposed to it, partly because of a
recent revelation about the tremendous compensations in stock
forms, which were paid by Elf oil group to its president Philippe
Jaffre in exchange for his resignation to give way to a merger
with Total.
</P>
<P>
-- The Swiss judicial authorities are investigating charges of
corruption and money laundering allegedly committed by the clan of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, after the recent discovery of
some credit cards owned by Yeltsin's family members during a
search of a Swiss-based construction company owned by a Kosovar
man, who is charged with corrupting Russian officials to obtain
contracts to repair Russia's palaces and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission has asked France to justify by
Friday its refusal to lift embargo on British beef products, while
London has called for a boycott of French farm products. France,
backed by Germany, has asked EU to call a meeting of its
commission of experts on the situation of ``mad cow'' disease in
Britain, because Brussels did not do so when deciding to lifting
embargo on British beefs two months ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Between 1991 and 1997, the wealth of French people increased
by 12 percent, mainly due to investigation in stock markets and
financial ventures. But the increase of the wealth of French
nation, which now stands at 26,000 billion francs (4,333 billion U.
S. dollars), has resulted in a widening of the gap of ownership
between the rich and the poor, with 10 percent of Frenchmen and
Frenchwomen owning 65 percent of the national wealth.

<HEADLINE> 13 Former Egyptian Ministers to Remain in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister-designate
Atef Ebeid will likely ask at least 13 of the 32 ministers of the
former government to remain in office, the national daily Al
Gomhuria reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of defense, information, foreign affairs, health,
environment and culture of the outgoing Prime Minister Kamal
El-Ganzouri's cabinet are widely believed to retain their posts,
said the pro-government newspaper, which usually reflects the
thinking of the leadership.
</P>
<P>
After he was sworn in on Tuesday for a fourth consecutive
six-year term in office, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak chose
Ebeid to form the new government. Ebeid is expected to submit to
Mubarak a list of cabinet ministers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid, former public business sector minister of El-Ganzouri's
cabinet, is in charge of the country's privatization program. His
appointment shows Mubarak's determination and commitment to
further carrying out the economic reform programs beginning in
1991, which have significantly boosted the opening and
diversification of Egypt's economy.
</P>
<P>
The report of the Arabic-language paper said Egypt will, for
the first time, create a new cabinet post, the ministry of
technology, to be in charge of the country's scientific and
technological development.
</P>
<P>
Hasham el-Sherif, former chief of the Cabinet Information
Center, is said to have been nominated for the post, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials including Hitler Tantawi, chief of the
Administrative Monitoring Agency, Ahmed Fadel, chairman of the
Suez Canal Authority, Hussein Ramzi Kazem, governor of Sharkia
Governorate and Ali Eddin Helal, dean of Cairo University's
Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences have been chosen to
take cabinet posts.

BANGKOK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will step up

Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sanan

hostages, came from the center, he said.
</P>

Meanwhile, the Thai and Myanmese governments have agreed to
exchange information to help strengthen security procedures at

<HEADLINE> Kenya Loses 9.7 Billion Dollars in 1995/96 Fiscal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Public Accounts
Committee has revealed that the government lost a total amount of
580 billion shillings (9.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the 1995/96
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Public Accounts Committee Chairman Henry Obwocha Tuesday told
the parliament that the Finance Ministry lost 515 billion
shillings while the Office of the President lost four billion.
</P>
<P>
Obwocha published the shocking statistics when he tabled a
summary document on the plunder of public funds and general
financial indiscipline that pervaded the public sector, local
press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The losses also included 9.3 billion shillings by the Central
Bank, 9.6 billion shillings by the defunct Kenya Post and
Telecommunications Corporation and Kenya Railways and other state
corporations.
</P>
<P>
However, Speaker Francis ole Kaparo rejected the document as
unprocedural and out of order.
</P>
<P>
Kaparo said the summary could be legally interpreted to be
Obwocha's own work and not that of the committee, which compiled
it after 69 sittings beginning last August.

MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A 5-seater light plane crashed at
about 10 a.m. Wednesday in the mountains of the central Philippine
province of Catanduanes, reports reaching here said Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in the city of San Andres,
Catanduanes, said the airplane was ferrying foreign investors
visiting the island province, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
But so far no reports are available on how many people there
are on board. Actually the provincial authority even could not
confirm where the foreign investors may come from.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted Jose Mapa, provincial administrator, as saying
that they often have visitors who come by helicopter but he was
not informed beforehand. He added that they usually send notice
before coming over.
</P>
<P>
Police and Red Cross rescuers, backed up by mountaineers have
set on foot towards the mountains in San Andres hoping to confirm
or find a trace of the wreckage, the PNA said.

<HEADLINE> Tung: Top Priority Given to Protection of Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa stressed that top priorities should be given to dealing
with air and water pollution and environmental protection in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks in his third policy address to the
Legislative Council here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "fostering quality people and beautifying our

homes", the policy address is mainly about education, health,
urban
construction and environment, but the focus is on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive devoted much of his speech to tackling the
air and
water pollution and protection of the environment. He also drew
the
blueprints for improvement of air quality, sewage disposal and
solid
waste recycling in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
In his seven-part speech, Tung said that looking back on the
past two years, Hong Kong has experienced two momentous changes.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's reunification with the mainland following the end
of colonial rule and the practice of a high degree of autonomy
under the unprecedented "One Country, Two Systems" concept, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the considerable readjustment to Hong Kong's
economy was triggered by the regional and even global effects of
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the first part of his speech, Tung emphasized the importance
of education among the young generations and health care for the
elderly and the youth, while in the later part of the speech he
stressed the necessities of institutional reforms and building a
caring, decent society with a rich cultural life.
</P>
<P>
To achieve even greater success in the next century, Hong Kong
must not only have people of high caliber and a quality
environment, but also sound institutions and a basic structure
which is conductive to economic prosperity, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Gold Industry to Go Ahead with Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Mining industry bosses in
South Africa have ruled out any moratorium on job cuts in the
beleaguered sector, despite a dramatic rise in gold price on world
markets, the Star newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But economic analyst Azar Jammine said failure by the gold
industry to immediately announce a moratorium could only mean
mining companies had sold gold forward in an irresponsible way.
</P>
<P>
"It will be an indictment of the industry. There should be a
moratorium on retrenchments in the gold industry straight away.
There should no longer be talk of retrenchments," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The spot price on the London Bullion Market surged to 338 U.S.
dollars an ounce on Tuesday from 314.50 dollars late on Monday,
before slipping back to 325.50 dollars at close. Prices have not
been so high since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase followed an announcement on September 26 by
15 European central banks that they would not add to planned sales
of gold and would contain the lending of gold during the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation that the International Monetary Fund will not sell
gold on the open market to finance debt relief to the world's
poorest countries has also lifted prices.
</P>
<P>
Roger Baxter, chief economist at the Chamber of Mines, said the
gold industry had become much more robust and competitive
following cuts in production costs in response to the low gold
price in July.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Presents 1999 Policy Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), delivered
his Policy Address of 1999 at the Legislative Council here
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is Tung's third policy address since he became the SAR
chief executive in mid-1997 when Hong Kong returned to China.
</P>
<P>
This year's address is mainly about the economy and education,
but the focus is on education and training of young generations.
</P>
<P>
"Within a hundred days, we will enter the new century and the
new millennium, and Now it is time that we should carry out what
we have achieved and to task the new course to the new century,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In his policy address, Tung reviewed Hong Kong's development
since its unification with China and pictured the way forward to
the next century to build Hong Kong into a knowledge based center.
</P>
<P>
Before spelling out the new policies, Tung looked back to the
past two years, saying that Hong Kong has experienced two
tremendous changes: the unification with the motherland and the
economic adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Taking Hong Kong into the new millennium, the chief executive
devoted the first part of his speech to taking stock of the policy
programs in his two previous blueprints and consolidating his
plans for the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Last year's priorities were strategies of innovation and
technological development, labor and employment, economic
development, and land and housing.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the delivery, Tung will give a press
conference for local and foreign reporters, detailing the main
points of the plans and programs.
</P>
<P>
Tung's speech goes live not only on the local radio and
television but also globally via the Internet starting at 2:30
p.m. local time (0630 GMT)

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel's Beaches Polluted by Heavy Metal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's beaches have been
contaminated by a large amount of heavy metal carried here by
wind from Europe and some of the metal is considered toxic and
with nitrates used in fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed in a comprehensive report on the sate of
Mediterranean beaches in 1998 published this week by the
Institute of Oceanographic and Limnological Research of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Researchers conducted test on dust particles on the beaches and
found that the contaminants were carried to Israel by dust
particles from Europe and some of them came down with the rain.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen and ammonia also made their way here from Europe
and the source of those elements was fuel combustion and animal
waste, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said that compared to rivers in other
places in the world, Israel's rivers have been polluted with
fertilizers to a considerably higher degree. This is because of
the small amount of water flowing in the rivers and large amount
of sewage poured into them.
</P>
<P>
The experts at the institute expressed fear that if the sewage
from the rivers reaches the sea, the sea may be contaminated with
fecal bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The main danger posted by the high concentration of
fertilizers is that they lead to the development of plant life
some of which is toxic. In Haifa Bay, the report said, irregular
amount of water plants, some toxic, have developed because of the
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Heavy metal tests on fish have shown that all the fish are
edible, although the report does mention a number of severe
problems of pollution of beaches caused by mercury.
</P>
<P>
High mercury levels have been found in Haifa Bay and the
main source of this pollution is the Haifa sewage treatment
plant and Haifa Chemicals, it said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Fisheries Output Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's fisheries industry has
reported output of 1.38 million tons in the first nine months of
the year, a 13.82 percent increase on the year-earlier period,
Vietnam's business newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report on Vietnam's fisheries says that fishing is now very
favorable as the southern fishing grounds have entered the peak
season. September output of the sector is posted at 107,000 tons,
4 percent above the average of the first eight months.
</P>
<P>
Seafood output reached 931,870 tons in the first nine months
while aqua-product farms obtained output of 447,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In the period the country's aqua-product exports grew 12.74
percent in value over the same period of last year to 690 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
September export receipts, however, fell to 85 million U.S.
dollars from the more than 100 million U.S. dollars in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the year's aqua-product export sales target of 950
million U.S. dollars, Vietnam's Ministry of Fisheries has urged
major coastal cities and provinces to take measures to control
natural disaster, raise a second shrimp crop in favorable areas
and import materials for export processing.

<P>
MACAO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Macao police on Tuesday seized a
large amount of smuggled raw materials for the production of
compact discs, the Macao Daily New reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Acting on some secret information, Macao police intercepted a
truck Tuesday afternoon at the Barrier Gate. The truck was
reported to be loaded with gumwater.
</P>
<P>
However, about 40 percent of the 698 cans were found to contain
colloidal granules which can be used to produce 190,000 pieces of
compact discs.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck was taken to the police station for
further investigation.
</P>
<P>
Local police sources said that smugglers have been racking
their brains to transport pirated CDs or raw materials for CD
production. And the cans detected this time were just mingled with
other cargo and stacked in the lower layers in the truck.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they will take more actions in an effort to
eradicate CD piracy in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Offer 49 Percent of Telkom to Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
prepared to offer 49 percent of Telkom Kenya to a foreign
investor, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This came after its initial offer of a 26 percent stake in the
telecom firm met little foreign interest, officials said Tuesday,
adding that even this may not be enough to attract a bid.
</P>
<P>
Some prospective strategic investors had strongly demanded an
option to increase their stake to a controlling 51 percent in the
coming years, they added.
</P>
<P>
Privatizing Kenya's dilapidated telecommunications industry is
seen by the World Bank as a major test of the government's
commitment to its privatization process, and would help propel the
stalled talks between Western donors and Kenya over the suspended
loans.
</P>
<P>
However, ceding a controlling interest to foreigners is a
political sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
The government had originally proposed selling 26 percent to a
foreign investor, to be followed by the sale of 20 percent to the
public through a share offer.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Tax Revenues Below July Peak in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's tax revenues in
September totaled 2.8 billion U.S. dollars, compared with 2.75
billion U.S. dollars in August and 2.9 billion U.S. dollars in
July, according to figures published Wednesday by the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, revenues totaled 23.6
billion U.S. dollars, compared with 21.85 billion U.S. Dollars
during the same period of 1998. After adjusting for inflation,
this was a real increase of only 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the tax revenues failed to rise
significantly in September and the tax collection in the month
may had been affected by the shortage of working days due to too
many holidays.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, income and real estate
tax revenues totaled 12.97 billion U.S. dollars. In real terms,
this was identical to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Customs and Value Added Taxes (VAT) revenues totaled 10.07
billion U.S. dollars during the first nine months of 1999, a real
increase of 4.3 percent over the same period last year. This
included a 3.3 percent rise in VAT revenues and a 8.5 percent
increase in import tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reported a drop in imports of durable
goods in September in almost every category.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months period as a whole, the ministry
said, imports of most durable goods rose, but car imports were
the exception.

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New iMac Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday
unveiled an even more sophisticated version of its highly
successful iMac computers, introducing machines with features
never before seen on a personal computer, according to reports
from the company.
</P>
<P>
The new iMac is slightly smaller than its best-selling
predecessor. The machine, which begins shipping immediately, runs
at 350 megahertz and retails for 999 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Extending the iMac family line, Apple also is selling the iMac
DV, a 400MHz, 1,299 dollar model that lets users play and edit DVD
movies, and a special-edition machine for 1,499 dollars that comes
in a clear gray color and is more powerful.
</P>
<P>
Apple interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs said the new basic
model should help Apple make further inroads with first-time
computer buyers seeking a cheap way to get connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Computer buyers who enroll for three years on CompuServe's
Internet service also receive an additional 400 dollars off any
Apple product.
</P>
<P>
Apple is hoping the added features prove more attractive than
sub-1,000 dollar offerings from such competitors as Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard, said Mitch Mandrich, the company's vice president
of worldwide sales.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts generally cheered the new Apple machines as
one of the company's strongest product launches to date.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the added video features and improved speed, memory
and audio performance of the latest iMac, the new machines look
essentially like the original iMac, which was introduced 13 months
ago, drawing overwhelming demand.
</P>
<P>
Apple Tuesday also unveiled a sixth color, graphite, for those
with more subdued tastes. The graphite color will be offered
exclusively on the new iMac DV Special Edition, which contains
extra storage and memory.

MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) on Wednesday gave separate
orders to their respective troops to cease fighting to ensure the
opening of their formal peace talks scheduled for October 25.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jarry Barican said in a press statement
that Defense Undersecretary Orlando Soriano, chairman of the
government peace panel, and Gadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for
political affairs, agreed Tuesday after meeting in the southern
province of Maguindanao to diffuse the situation in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"As of 10 a.m. today, both the military and the MILF troops had
been given specific orders to cease and desist from any further
fighting on the ground," Barican said in the statement read for
him by Deputy Presidential spokesman Angelico Salud.
</P>

According to the statement, Soriano and Jaafar also agreed to
meet again Wednesday afternoon to undertake all measures necessary
to ensure the opening of the formal peace talks between the two
sides due to open on October 25.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day heavy fighting between the government troops and the
MILF guerrillas in various parts of Central Mindanao has
reportedly claimed the lives of 67 rebels and 9 government
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MILF declared it will withdraw from the peace
talks if the government troops continue to attack the guerrillas'
camps.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out on September 26 when some 100 MILF
rebels attacked a military installation in Shariff Aguak,
Maguindanao.

<P>
HARARE, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) has approved the release of 130 million U.S. dollars to
support Zimbabwe's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
An official in the office of the ADB Executive Director for
Zimbabwe in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, told The Herald daily that an
agreement for the release of the funds was signed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Obert Matshalaga, director for domestic and international
finance of Zimbabwe's Ministry of Finance, signed the document
with Cyril Enweze, ADB vice-president for operations.
</P>
<P>
The money would be released in three tranches, with the first
tranche of 45 million U.S. dollars expected soon, the official in
Abidjan said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's funds would surely help revive Zimbabwe's economy
following the approval of the193 million U.S. dollars stand-by
credit for the country by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on
August 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, there were fears that Zimbabwe could fail to get
further financial aid from the IMF and the World Bank following
allegations of conflicting figures on the country's military
expenditure in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa has denied
misleading the IMF and said he had clarified the issue with the
IMF and the World Bank in Washington last week.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Issue Law Combating Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will soon issue a federal law to make money laundering a
crime, the local daily Gulf News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A committee comprising officials from the Central Bank and the
ministries of finance and industry, the interior and justice have
already prepared a draft legislation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The law, once approved, will define different crimes related
to money laundering and impose penalties and punishments
accordingly, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
At present money laundering-related crimes are being tackled
with directives issued by the UAE Central Bank and the ministries
concerned.
</P>
<P>
According to Central Bank officials, the UAE is vulnerable to
illegal financial activities because it is an excellent and
important commercial center with a very open market policy in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the UAE boasts of a stable currency without high
inflation. People can bring in and out as much as, and whatever,
currency they want.
</P>
<P>
All these factors contributed to attracting money launderers
to the UAE. Therefore, stricter policies and more cooperation
with international bodies are required to protect the country's
reputation, the officials stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A fire hit one of the biggest
bazaars in the northern Philippine city of Baguio early Wednesday
morning even as the city suffered from continuous downpour and
gusty winds caused by typhoon, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The PNA quoted Virgilio Hidalgo, spokesman of the local police,
as saying that the fire starting to rage in a five-story
commercial building at 5:00 a.m. has already destroyed thousand
pesos worth of properties despite absence of any casualty.
</P>
<P>
Hidalgo added that firemen from the city and surrounding
communities are still battling the raging fire in the building but
find it hard to contain the fire due to lack of equipment like gas
masks and unavailability of a fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, landslides triggered by typhoon "Pepang" resulted in
the closure of many roads in the region.
</P>
<P>
City social welfare officer Betty Fangasan said her office is
also trying to determine possible evacuation sites for flooded
families.
</P>
<P>
Aside from flooded houses, the City Disaster Coordinating
Council is also convincing other occupants of landslide prone
areas to evacuate their houses before darkness sets in.

<HEADLINE> South Asia's Longest Bridge May Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangabandhu Jamuna Multi-purpose
Bridge, the longest bridge in Bangladesh as well as in South Asia,
is likely to be privatized, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the Jamuna Multi-purpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) is
to go for a corporate restructuring of the bridge by floating its
shares in the stock exchange and as a holding company, the JMBA
may like to retain the majority of the shares.
</P>
<P>
The 4.8-kilometer-long 18.5-meter-wide bridge in Tangail
district, some 70 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, was completed in
June last year and links northwest Bangladesh with the country's
central-eastern region.
</P>
<P>
It is speculated that the JMBA would float shares of 5 billion
to 6 billion taka (100 million to 120 million U.S. dollars) in the
share market after forming a public limited company to raise its
capital which is expected to be used to maintain the bridge and to
develop other infrastructures of the country.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the JMBA invited scaled tender from local
chartered accountancy firms registered under the Chartered
Accountancy Act to make a feasibility study, and the authority
received three scaled tender proposals within the stipulated
period.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted as saying that all the three tender
proposals with recommendations from the evaluation committee of
the project have been sent to the JMBA board headed by the
communication minister, and the next procedure of privatizing the
bridge would start after getting the board's approval on the
recommendations by the evaluation committee.
</P>
<P>
A JMBA source said the procedure of privatizing the 900
million-dollar bridge would begin with an extensive feasibly study
by local chartered accountancy firms.

"Against Kazakhstan, our team played to our expectation. But it
is still not enough. We need to do some reshuffling to achieve our
goal of qualifying for the Olympics," he said.

"We need midfielders who move quickly and attack the rival
citadel," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he was negotiating with the club to release five
players who missed last Saturday's match due to their commitments
in the Asian Club championship.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks guard Latrell
Sprewell was ordered to pay about $105,000 Tuesday to a man and a
woman injured in a highway wreck that he admittedly caused.
</P>
<P>
Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma Feliciano, 54, were reportedly
seeking total damages of $3.5 million, according to Sprewell's
attorney.
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the jury said Sprewell did not act with malice
or oppression in the March 1, 1998, accident.
</P>
<P>
Perlas and Feliciano suffered minor injuries but they said the
accident caused nightmares, depression and problems with
relationships.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell admitted in court that he caused the accident when he
tried to drive his Mercedes-Benz back on the freeway from an exit-
only lane.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, which he served under
electronic detention at his Milwaukee home.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell said he would pay the two $450,000 in actual damages
plus two months of his $9 million salary in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
But Sprwell's attorney, Richard Valerian, argued the plaintiffs
' lawyers are making the minimal injuries appear to be major.
Valerian suggested giving them $30,000.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Migrants Remit 990 Million Dollars in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Around 350,000 Nepali migrant
workers working in different parts of the world send up to 69
billion rupees (990 million U.S. dollars) home in 1996-97 fiscal
year, The Kathmandu Post quoted a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This figure accounts for over 25 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary report "Foreign labor migration and remittance
economy of Nepal", released Tuesday by Department for
International Development, a British development agency, put the
number of Nepali migrant workers in Western Europe and other
western countries at 15,000; in the Gulf at 40,000; in the Far
East at 44,000; in India at over 250,000 and in other parts of the
world at around 1,000.
</P>
<P>
According to the report's "conservative estimate" for 1997, a
total of around 12,500 Nepalese work in Europe and perhaps as many
as 2,500 in North America. Britain has the largest number for a
single country, where 3,600 are officially registered and an
estimated 8,000 more work unofficially.
</P>
<P>
The report has broadly classified four regions where Nepali
migrants find employment - the West (Europe and North America);
the Far East and South East Asia, the Gulf; and India. Only a
small number of Nepalese are employed outside these four regions.
</P>
<P>
The smallest numbers are to be found in the first region and
many Nepalese living and working in this region do not send
remittances back home, particularly in North America where many
people are working as professionals, often accompanied by their
families.
</P>
<P>
"We have estimated that the European migrants alone sent back
around 4.4 billion rupees (63 million U.S. dollars) in 1997. From
North America we estimated a total of some 50 million rupees
(720,000 U.S. dollars)," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The second smallest number of Nepali workers in 1997 were in
the Gulf where a total of 40,000 Nepalese are employed. They sent
an estimated 1.5 billion rupees (22 million U.S. dollars). The
number, which increased dramatically since 1997, may now be about
90,000.
</P>
<P>
The region from which the great majority of remittance come
into Nepal is East and South East Asia where at least 44,000
Nepalese are employed, over half of whom are working illegally. In
Japan, an estimated 10,000 migrants are said to be illegal. A
conservative estimate produces a total of around 23 billion rupees
(330 million U.S. dollars) in remittances from this region.
</P>
<P>
Of this the majority comes from Hong Kong with 14.4 billion
rupees (210 million U.S. dollars); 6 billion rupees (86 million
U.S. dollars) from Japan: one billion rupees (15 million U.S.
dollars) from Brunei and Singapore respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other countries and regions where Nepalese are employed include
Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, the Maldives and
the Philippines. Of these countries and regions, the highest
remittance comes from South Korea with 256 million rupees (3.7
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In terms of absolute monetary value, India provides the largest
share with 40 billion rupees (580 million U.S. dollars),
accounting for 33 percent of total remittances.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the official number of those living
and working abroad increased during the 1980's, from around
400,000 in 1981 to around 660,000 by 1991. This constituted about
3.3 percent of the Nepal's population, and over 10 percent of the
economically active population.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Tuesday approved a foreign aid bill that will
reduce the country's foreign aid funding.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who last week promised to relieve 1
billion U.S. dollars in debt owed by the poorest countries, has
indicated that his administration will veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill offers "woefully inadequate" funding for foreign aid,
Clinton said in a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert on
September 30.
</P>
<P>
Democrats in the House complain that the bill does not match
the "leadership role" of the United States in the world, while
Republicans say there isn't any more money for foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
An earlier version of the legislation, which was compromised by
the House and Senate negotiators, was approved by a vote of 214-
211 on a partisan line.
</P>
<P>
The new bill eliminates 241 million U.S. dollars for a program
to assist former Soviet Union nuclear weapons scientists, and sets
aside 12.62 billion U.S. dollars in foreign spending for the
fiscal year 2000, nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars less than the
president had requested.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had vetoed the earlier version
approved by Congress because an anti-abortion provision was
appended to the legislation, prohibiting U.S. funds from flowing
into international family planning institutions that back abortion.
</P>
<P>
That provision was also eliminated in the new version. But
Clinton has still vowed to veto it, because of the "woefully
inadequate" funding for foreign aid.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks UN to Set up E. Timor Peace-Keeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday asked
the United Nations to set up a proper peace-keeping force for East
Timor immediately in place of the Australia-led international
force for East Timor (Interfet).
</P>
<P>
Interfet was formed because the UN decision-making process on
the peace-keeping force was very slow, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday at an airport press conference in
Subang near here on his returning from a two-week working visit to
New York, London and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
At the moment it is not really a peace-keeping force, it is a
temporary measure initiated by Australia mainly, but the United
Nations has sanctioned it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia was prepared to send a large military
contingent there to serve with the proposed UN peace-keeping force
"without any problem".
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has a 30-member complement in Interfet, led by a
brigadier- general.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian New House Speaker Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Akbar Tandjung, new Speaker of
Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR), was sworn in here
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Four new vice-speakers of the DPR were also sworn in
simultaneously. They are A.M. Fatwa (chairman of the National
Mandate Party), Soetardjo Soerjogoeritno (chairman of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle), Khofifah Indarparawansa
(chairman of the National Awakening Party) and Hamzah Haz (general
chairman of the United Development Party).
</P>
<P>
The new House speaker was elected following an acrimonious
debate over technicalities.
</P>
<P>
The debate, which went beyond midnight Tuesday, surfaced when
Crescent Star Party legislator Hartono Mardjono protested the
result of a consultative meeting which unanimously appointed Akbar
to the House's top post.
</P>
<P>
His objection came just after interim speaker Abdul Madjid
praised the result of the consultative meeting attended by
representatives of the House's 10 factions.
</P>
<P>
Citing the House's internal rules, Hartono said the decision
was not binding because the rules grant individual House
legislators the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
The new DPR was forced to vote to elect its speaker, and Akbar
won the voting with 411 votes.
</P>
<P>
The DPR has a total of 500 members who serve for five years. It
exercises legislative authority, with 462 members directly elected
and 38 reserved for the Military/National Police whose members do
not vote.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 of the 48 political parties which contested the
June 7 general election gained seats in the DPR.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle won the election
with 153 seats. The Golkar Party came in second with 120 seats,
followed by the United Development Party, the National Awakening
Party, the National Mandate Party, the Crescent Star Party and the
Justice Party.
</P>
<P>
The DPR meets at least once a year. All laws must have the
approval of the DPR, but the president has absolute veto. Members
of the DPR have the right to submit draft bills which require
ratification by the president. The president may enact ordinance
in times of emergency, which however must be either ratified or
revoked by the DPR at its following session.

<HEADLINE> Money Laundering Charges Filed in Bank of New York Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal District Court
indicted three people and three companies on criminal charges
Tuesday in the Bank of New York probe which alleges the laundering
of 7 billion U.S. dollars from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Peter Berlin, Lucy Edwards and Aleksey Volkov as well as Benex
International Co. Inc., Becs International L.L.C. and Torfinex
Corp. were named as the defendants. They are charged with
illegally funneling large amounts of money into the United States
through the bank from 1996 to August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The three-count indictment was filed under seal in U.S.
District Court on September 16. The charges are the first to
result from an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York
city.
</P>
<P>
Berlin was president of Both Benex and Becs, while his wife
Edwards was vice president in the Eastern European Division at the
Bank of New York and also an officer of Benex and Becs.
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that the defendants sent money
illegally through the Benex and Becs account at the bank; the
money was reportedly transmitted by Torfinex Corp. Prosecutors did
not disclose the role Volkov, president of Torfinex, played in the
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo While said, "The ongoing investigation
is very intense and broad," adding "it is likely to go on for some
time."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Warns Against Adverse Effects on Relations with Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has warned that the
recent siege of Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok by Myanmar armed men
could bring about some adverse effects on the bilateral relations
between Thailand and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, the official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar said Wednesday that the incident is the second major
lawless and untoward one to have occurred on the Thai soil.
</P>
<P>
"So it is time for Thailand, which has to shoulder the
responsibility, to stop and think that this could very well lead
to some adverse effects on bilateral relations between Thailand
and Myanmar," the paper warned.
</P>
<P>
The paper charged that the acts, perpetrated by "terrorists",
all originated from Thailand as their base of operations.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that at the Thai-Myanmar border, there are 24
camps officially recognized as refugee camps, saying that these
camps are historically linked with acts of "terrorism".
</P>
<P>
"Armed terrorist groups, under the mask of democracy, are using
armed force and violence which no government in the world can
accept or tolerate, and are launching their operations from places
inaccessible to the Myanmar government," it stated.
</P>
<P>
It blamed that most of these camps are simply providing shelter
to a variety of armed insurgents and their families, adding that
those who always cross over the border to attack Myanmar, come
from nowhere else, but these camps.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's remarks
carried on the October 3 issue of "the Nation" newspaper of
Thailand as saying that "It is necessary to keep a stricter and
closer watch on the opposition activities of expatriate Myanmar
students against the Myanmar government".
</P>
<P>
Five armed men, who are all Myanmar students living in
Thailand, seized the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok on last Friday
morning and held the embassy staff together with some foreigners
as hostages.
</P>
<P>
The incident ended peacefully on the next day afternoon with
all the 38 hostages freed before the armed men were flown out of
the embassy compound to the Thai-Myanmar border area with two
helicopters provided by the Thai authorities after negotiation
between them.

<HEADLINE> Diesel Prices Hike in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Government Tuesday night
announced an unprecedented 40 percent hike in diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
The new prices, which come into effect from Wednesday, will
partially neutralize the 60 percent increase in international
prices of diesel recorded over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
The basic price of diesel has been raised from 6.88 rupees
(0.16 U.S. dollar) per liter to 9.63 rupees (0.22 U.S. dollar) per
liter. But with taxes, the rates will go up further.
</P>
<P>
While the timing of the price hike may have seemed some what
unusual, senior officials of the Oil Coordination Committee (OCC)
said diesel prices should have been raised three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The decision had been postponed in view of the Petroleum
Ministry's view that the price fluctuation should be watched for
some time.
</P>
<P>
OCC officials claimed the issue of diesel prices had not been
raised in Wednesday's Cabinet meeting since increase of this
product can now be carried out by the Ministry under the new
liberalized policy regime.
</P>
<P>
The hike in prices will yield as much as 66 billion rupees
(1.53 billion U.S. dollars) to the exchequer and enable the OCC to
draw down the oil pool account deficit by this amount during the
current fiscal.
</P>
<P>
According to OCC officials, the pool account deficit will have
otherwise risen to 100 billion rupees (2.33 billion U.S. dollars)
by March next year. As a result of the price hike, the deficit
will be contained to 34 billion rupees (790.70 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But unless prices of other products like LPG and kerosene are
raised, officials said that the deficit cannot be wiped out and
payments to the oil companies will be deferred.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Decision to Quit Asiad Bid Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Indonesian
Olympics Committee (KONI) hailed the government's decision to
withdraw from its planned bid to host the 2006 Asian Games as a "
sensible retreat".
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia must show the spirit of brotherhood with an ASEAN (
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) country, which is seeking
the chance of becoming the host of the Asian Games," Arie Sudewo
was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sudewo was referring to Malaysia, one of around five candidates
to bid for the hosting of the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which launched its campaign during the 1998 Asian
Games in Bangkok, has looked serious in its aspiration and has
become a strong contender.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Indonesia which began its own campaign only
recently at the 1999 Brunei Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, has
looked pessimistic and stuttered in its plan, resulting from the
crippling monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The "untimely" campaign had drawn controversies given the
current condition that even Minister of Sport and Youth Affairs
Agung Laksono had asked KONI to review the plan.
</P>
<P>
But it was only last week that the government finally settled
to abandon its bid. Relinquishing the campaign, Indonesia has
pledged its support to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is now looking for some kind of pay-off for its
planned support by appealing to Malaysia -- if successful in its
bid -- to include sports which promise medal prospects to
Indonesia such as pencak silat, bridge and chess.
</P>
<P>
Sudewo said that KONI had planned for a delegation to meet the
Malaysian National Olympics Committee to talk over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would lobby Asian powers for pencak silat, a
traditional martial art popular in the Southeast Asian region, to
be competed in as an exhibition at the 2002 Asian Games in Pusan,
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are to submit their official bidding at the
general assembly meeting of the Asian Olympics Confederation in
Kuwait in November.

<HEADLINE> Workshop on Drug Law Enforcement Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A national workshop on narcotic
drug law enforcement is being held here to formulate a CD-ROM
training program compatible with the policies, laws, procedures,
codes and norms being practiced in each six-MOU countries --
China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, which began Tuesday, is sponsored by
Myanmar's Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) and
the U.N. Drug Control Program.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is conducted as a component of the six-country MOU
sub-regional action plan project on drug law enforcement training
in East Asia agreed by the six countries on July 11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The training method will eliminate the need to gather drug
enforcement officers to a training center, thereby saving time and
expenses pertaining to travel and undergoing training outside
their duty station, said Major-General Soe Win, secretary of the
Myanmar CCDAC and director-general of the Myanmar Police Force, at
the opening of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The program, at present, is being formulated by a professional
company and will be translated into appropriate language, he said.
</P>
<P>
A CD-ROM program for drug law enforcement training was first
demonstrated at the six-country MOU meeting in Laos in May this
year and a workshop of national project coordinators, training
experts and international project coordinators was later held in
Bangkok, Thailand, in July.
</P>
<P>
Attending the workshop are officials of the Myanmar Defense
Ministry, CCDAC, Customs Department, Food and Drug Administration
and Myanmar Police Force.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Accident Raises Concerns in S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The accident occurred at 7 p.m. local time during a preventive
safety inspection of a water cooling pump of the number three
reactor at the Wolsong nuclear plant, 305 kilometers southeast of
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The reactor had been out of service since September 23 for
maintenance, the South Korean Science and Technology Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said 45 liters of heavy water contained inside the
reactor leaked, but remained inside the plant and did not pollute
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Those exposed to the radiation were employees of the South
Korean Power Corporation. They were reportedly exposed to levels
far below the limited yearly average of 50mSV, since the nuclear
reactor was not in operation. Nineteen workers returned to work
while another three were prohibited to continue working there.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a team of nuclear specialists is
investigating the accident.
</P>
<P>
The leak was the smallest of the past four accidents, but it
was the first time that people were reportedly exposed to
radiation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 700,000-kilowatt number three reactor started commercial
operation last year as South Korea's first pressurized heavy water
reactor, which is modeled after Canada's CANDU reactors.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear leak occurred five days after a disastrous nuclear
accident in Japan in which at least 49 people were exposed to
radiation.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's GDP Expected to Increase 5 Pct This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's GDP is likely to reach
about 390,000 billion Vietnamese dong (28.5 billion U.S. dollars)
this year, a rise of 5 percent over last year, local English daily
Vietnam News Wednesday quoted Vietnam's General Department of
Statistics figures as saying.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was based on the data of the country's economic
performance in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was also judged by economists to be an average
growth rate compared to other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production value is expected to increase 10.5
percent over last year, a lower increase than in past years.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the industrial production value of the
country was 12 percent in 1998, 13.8 percent in 1997 and 14
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1999, the foreign invested sector
of the country reported a rise of more than 19 percent; the
non-state sector nearly 8 percent; and state-owned enterprises 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Low-quality, high-priced products unable to compete with
imports because of poor technology were said to be the main cause
for lower growth rates in the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, forestry and marine production are expected to
achieve an increase of around 8 percent, while a 2.5 percent rise
is forecast for the service sector.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment slowed down in the past nine months
though the Vietnamese government has implemented various
encouraging policies. A total of 269 projects worth almost 1.4
billion U.S. dollars in registered capital received licenses
during the period. This marks a 12 percent decrease in the number
of new projects and a 37 percent reduction in registered capital
when compared with the first nine months of last year.

LISBON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Finnish Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen on Tuesday urged the European Union (EU) member
countries to strengthen judicial cooperation in order to better
fight organized international crime.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal at a joint news conference after discussing

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 50 in Bus Accident in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in bus accident
in West Java, Indonesia, had risen to 50 on Tuesday, national
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on Monday midnight in Cianjur, about 100
kilometers south of Jakarta, when a bus plying the Jakarta-Bandung
route struck a cliff wall.
</P>
<P>
At total of 45 passengers died on the spot, and other five died
in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 28 passengers, who were severely injured were
being treated at the intensive care units of Pacet and Sayang
hospitals, both in Cianjur.
</P>
<P>
Cianjur Police chief Lt. Col. Fadjar Purnomo said police were
undertaking a preliminary investigation, but were already able to
cite two likely causes.
</P>
<P>
"our provisional suspicion is that the driver was driving
recklessly or the brakes were damaged," Fadjar was quoted by the
Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said this was the worst road accident during the last
two years in his region.
</P>
<P>
One of the injured survivors Dodo said the bus was traveling
quickly, but steadily on its way until it reached a corner in the
Lembah Hijau area in Puncak.
</P>
<P>
He said as the bus rounded the corner, it swayed to the left
and hit the cliff wall.
</P>
<P>
The bus had a capacity load, and was perhaps overcrowded, with
78 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The hilly area of Puncak, filled with tea plantations, becomes
crowded and its traffic jams during weekends as many Jakarta
inhabitants spend their weekends out of town to relax.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, Russia Form Common Front to Combat Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and Russia will work
hand in hand in the international arena to fight terrorism in the
future, diplomats here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Victor Zotin said that
countries like Sri Lanka and Russia should form a common
international front to eradicate the menace of terrorism and the
United Nations could actively participate in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lanka had suffered for the past 16 years in its
fight against separatist Tamil rebels from this scourge which
Russia is facing today.
</P>
<P>
Russia, plagued by recent spate of terrorist bombings which
have so far killed nearly 300 people, blamed the bombings on an
Islamist group in Chechnya in the north Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan officials also showed sympathy and understanding to
Russia's situations.
</P>
<P>
"We in Sri Lanka, who are confronted by terrorism, share the
anguish and the pain of the Russian people who are victims of
these atrocities," said Sri Lankan Deputy Minister of Foreign
Affairs Lakshman Kiriella in a letter to his Russian counterpart
Karasin late last month.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the recent incidents of terrorism in the Russian
Federation have highlighted the urgency for greater international
cooperation in combating this menace."
</P>
<P>
Zotin said that foreign countries should not harbor terrorist
organizations nor should they allow terrorists to get involved in
activities to finance their organizations in foreign soils.
</P>
<P>
He added that the world community should stem any separatist
manifestations firmly and consistently to protect the principles
of sovereignty, territorial integrity of states and the
inviolability of borders.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Increases Military Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the first time the US has increased its defense
spending since the "cold war" ended.
</P>
<P>
The national defense authorization bill, signed by Clinton
during a special Pentagon visit, includes a 4.8 percent pay raise
for the 1.4 million men and women on active duty, plus a host of
other financial incentives aimed at filling the military ranks.
</P>
<P>
The bill also directs a reorganization of the U.S. Energy
Department to create a largely independent nuclear weapons agency
within the department.
</P>
<P>
The 4.8 percent pay raise is the highest since a 14.3 percent
boost in 1981 during the Reagan administration's military buildup.
The Clinton administration has proposed a 4.4 percent increase for
2000.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was joined in the ceremony by Defense Secretary William
Cohen and the uniformed service chiefs and civilian service
secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Defense Department said earlier Tuesday
that the army, navy and marine corps each met their force goals in
the fiscal year that ended last Thursday thanks to anticipated
increases in troops pay and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
But the air force, trying to retain and recruit in a booming
civilian market for commercial airline pilots, fell 10,308 short
of its authorized strength of 370,882.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led international
peacekeepers in Kosovo (KFOR), with the help of helicopters, tanks
and armored cars, Tuesday cleared road blocks placed by Serbs
along a major highway in Kosovo Polje.
</P>
<P>
KFOR Commander Michael Jackson noted that the troops removed
the roadblocks to keep open the route from Pristina to Pec, a city
in the west of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But the media said the move indicates the international force
in the province uses double standards because it had not taken
similar actions when ethnic Albanians blocked Russian peacekeepers
in their march into Orahovac in late August.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Serbs placed blockade recently along the major highway
to protest a bomb attack on September 28, which killed two people
instantly and injured 36, on a market in Serb-populated Kosovo
Polje. They demanded an explanation from KFOR and the United
Nations mission in Kosovo on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo has remained tense as the international
troops and the U.N. mission adopted an approach of appeasement and
nepotism toward Albanian separatists.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Help Ecuador: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's President Jamil Mahuad
Tuesday confirmed that his government and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached an agreement that will allow
Ecuador to pay only half the interest due on the Brady bonds and
the balance will be borne by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
On September 30, Ecuador became the first country to default on
Brady bonds. Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, were created in 1989 to refinance the
debt burden then crushing developing nations. Ecuador's PDI (past
due interest) and discount bonds were issued in 1995 as part of
its Brady Plan to restructure debt.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agreement with the IMF, the Ecuadorian
president said, in an interview with reporters, that the
international financial organization is very aware of what is
happening to the Ecuadorian economy and thus still willing to help
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will permit the country to collect up to 1.25
billion U.S. dollars of credit to be used in increasing the
foreign currency reserve, updating productive equipment and
performing social projects.
</P>
<P>
However, these credits hinge on the Ecuadorian National
Congress passing the government's budget for the year 2000, in
which there are plans to increase taxes and raise the price of
fuel, which most lawmakers oppose.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Mahuad has urged the legislators to approve
the budget reforms for the year 2000, and above all, to pass the
planned Value Added Tax (VAT) increases by 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad is also harboring the hope that he will gain a line of
credit of 900 million U.S. dollars from the Andean Development
Corporation (ADC).
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, in its worst economic crisis in decades, has said it
cannot repay its 13 billion-dollar foreign debt, which takes up
more than half of its budget each year.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins Opener in Swiss Tennis Indoors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Top-ranked Andre Agassi won his
opener to advance to the second round of the Swiss Indoors in
Basel, Switerland on Tuesday, beating Jan Siemerink of the
Netherlands 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Tim Henman, the defending champion, also booked his
second round berth by beating Swiss wild-card entry George Bastl 7-
5, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the French and U.S. Open champion, took just 61 minutes
to dispatch Siemerink with his powerful serve from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
The loss was another blow to Siemerink, who crashed out in the
opening round for the fourth consecutive year after reaching the
final in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Henman, seeking his first title this season, needed
two hours to overcome Bastl.
</P>
<P>
From 2-4 down in the opening set, the fourth-seeded Briton
managed to regain his serve, taking the next three games to go up
5-4 and was overtaken again as Bastl forged ahead 6-5.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Henman broke the Swiss player's opening
serve to take a 3-0 and recorded three consecutive love service
games before breaking at 5-2 to take the set.
</P>
<P>
He continued to establish his authority in the third, winning
the first eight points in the set to go up 2-0, then jumping to an
insurmountable 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
In other first-round play, Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev, who lost
to Agassi in the French Open final, came back from a one-set
deficit to defeat Russia's Marat Safin 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).

<HEADLINE> Australian Govt Rejects Opposition Inquiry Call on E Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Wednesday rejected an opposition call for a public inquiry into
its handling of the East Timor crisis.
</P>
<P>
Opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton Wednesday
cited diplomatic records showing the government argued against a
peacekeeping force in February as cause for a formal public
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
It comes amid a barrage of criticism from the opposition Labor
Party sparked by comments by former prime minister Paul Keating
and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Minister Alexander Downer denied Australia sent
high level officials to Washington earlier this year to argue
against peacekeepers in East Timor and he rejected an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
However, Downer told ABC Radio: "Obviously no government in the
world - in Australia or anywhere else - is going to destroy its
relationships with other countries by making public all diplomatic
correspondence and discussions."

<P>
BERLIN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Jana Novotna, the 1998 Wimbledon
champion, ended her 12-year professional career in a lose as she
was defeated in the first round of the Porsche Grand Prix in
Filderstadt, Germany on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, 31, lost her final match on the tour to Silvia Farina
6-3, 6-4, as she has dropped to No. 18, her lowest ranking in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked player in 1997 was sidelined for a long time
after spraining an ankle and partially tearing ligaments in June.
</P>
<P>
After losing in the third round of the U.S. Open, Novotna said
she would quit at the end of the year. But a first-round loss to
Magdalena Maleeva in Luxembourg two weeks ago persuaded Novotna to
play only one more tournament.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who was born in Brno, Czech Republic, won 24 titles on
the WTA Tour after turning professional in 1987.
</P>
<P>
But she had only one title this year, in February in Hanover,
Germany, when she beat Venus Williams in the final, apart from 73
doubles titles.
</P>
<P>
Novotna was honored at the end of her match and received a

<HEADLINE> ILO Report: Asia Makes Progress in Improving Women Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis has
inflicted serious economic pain and suffering on women in terms of
unemployment and loss of pay, but failed to derail their long-term
progress toward greater economic empowerment, an international
organization said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, the International Labor Office (ILO)
Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific said that although women
suffered disproportionally from the financial crisis, countries in
the region have made "progress toward achieving the goals set out
at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in September
1995."
</P>
<P>
In some economically and socially advancing countries, the ILO
said, "women have succeeded in gaining greater access to training
and employment and increased economic autonomy and social status."
</P>
<P>
It said that home-based and self-employed women workers in
Thailand have benefited from the establishment of Home Net in
terms of improved labor rights and social protection.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the ILO said, an integrated plan for gender
and development has resulted in new emphasis on data gathering,
training of women and increased budgeting for gender issues.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, new efforts to collect data on women's work indicated
a growing acknowledgment of women's economic contribution, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it said, much remains to be done before realizing
the Beijing Platform for Action's calls for protection and
promotion of women's rights, eradicating poverty, elimination of
violence against women, and promoting their economic autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"A majority of women, such as agricultural laborers, home
workers, traditional artisans, weavers, and vendors... have more
likely been particularly hard hit by the Asian financial crisis,
due to their primary responsibility for providing for their
families' basic needs," said the ILO.
</P>
<P>
It said that the loss of jobs had pushed many women back into
informal sector or agricultural households, where they have had to
cope with less income and higher burdens for themselves, their
children and parents.
</P>
<P>
The ILO called for essential protective legislation in the
region to protect women and girls and strengthen women's status in
the world of work.
</P>
<P>
The ILO report, entitled "Towards Gender Equality in the World
of Work in Asia and the Pacific," was prepared for the Asian
Regional Consultation on Follow-up to the 1995 Fourth World
Conference on Women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The three-day regional meeting opened here Wednesday morning,
and was being attended by 80 policy-makers, employers and labor
leaders from 24 Asian and Pacific economies.
</P>
<P>
The participants will review country situations and exchange
experiences on gender issues in the world of work.

<HEADLINE> Vieira Charged by English FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal's Patrick Vieira has been
charged with misconduct by the Football Association for "improper
behaviour", which included an alleged spitting incident, during
Sunday's game against West Ham.
</P>
<P>
The French star, who has since apologised, reacted furiously
after he was red-carded by referee Mike Reed in the 84th minute.
</P>
<P>
Television evidence appeared to support Neil Ruddock's claim
that Vieira spat in his face, but Reed said that would not be in
his report because he did not see it.
</P>
<P>
After being dismissed, Vieira returned to argue with referee
Mike Reed and was also involved in an incident with a police
officer in the tunnel at Upton Park.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Frenchman said: "My behavior after being sent
off was inexcusable."
</P>
<P>
"Although I was subjected to provocation, I am ashamed of my
action.
</P>
<P>
"Spitting at a fellow professional is something I sincerely
regret. It was a reaction in the heat of the moment and I
apologize to everyone involved in the incident."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Arsenal said it would take action against the
French international.
</P>
<P>
"Although Patrick Vieira was severely provoked during the game
and at the time of the incident, his response to being sent off
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Patrick's reaction was unacceptable and is something that
Arsenal Football Club does not condone. The matter will be
addressed by the Football Association and dealt with internally by
the club."
</P>
<P>
The FA had earlier released a statement which read: "Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira has today been charged with misconduct for improper
behaviour - including alleged spitting - immediately following his
dismissal during yesterday's Premier League game at West Ham.
</P>
<P>
"Vieira has 14 days to respond to the charge and request a
personal hearing if he wishes.
</P>
<P>
"The FA has been informed that a police investigation is being
held into a separate incident in the players' tunnel after Vieira'
s dismissal.
</P>
<P>
"The police have indicated their inquiries will continue until
the end of this week, after which they will forward a report to
the FA for consideration."
</P>
<P>
Vieira hit the headlines last season when he was awarded a then-
record 20,000 pounds fine after his V-sign to the crowd during the
infamous game at Sheffield Wednesday, when Di Canio pushed referee

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Athens 2004 Olympic Games
organizers said Tuesday that they hoped to raise more than 100
billion drachmas (about 328 million U.S. dollars) from the sale of
more than 3,000 official products bearing the Athens 2004 emblem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the presentation of the Athens 2004 games
marketing program, Athens 2004 managing director Costas Bacouris
said that the organizing committee expected to make around 6
billion drachmas (about 19 million dollars) from the sale of
licensed merchandise.
</P>
<P>
The large Greek communities abroad would be central to the
marketing of official 2004 Olympic products.
</P>
<P>
Marketing General Director Giorgos Bolos said that the 2004

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Have Difficulties in Finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Finding and keeping skilled
workers is the number one issue facing American business today,
according to a survey report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the report said, more than half of businesses in 11
western and midwestern states said finding and keeping skilled
employees is a bigger issue for them than satisfying or meeting
customer needs, controlling costs or keeping up with competition.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by state-by-state coalitions or business
associations in the 11 states, was released at the International
Telework Association &AMP; Council (ITAC) conference in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
As many as 83 percent of businesses find it somewhat to very
difficult to find people with the skills to do the required work
of a specific job vacancy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that letting employees work at home --
telework -- is gaining in popularity as one of the best ways to
attract and keep skilled people. In fact, more than three-quarters
of all employees who telework today are happy to have this
employment option.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted ITAC co-chairman Jim Miller as saying that
traffic congestion is not the major reason for telework's
popularity, although it does have the added benefit of reducing
traffic. "It's a lifestyle issue," Miller said, adding that "the
old myth that employees who work at home don't produce as well as
their colleagues back in the office just isn't true according to
data."
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 75 to 95 percent of teleworkers are
satisfied with their remote working option. Company-provided
computer, modem and wireless capability such as cell phones and
pagers are the most popular tools employers provide their
teleworkers.
</P>
<P>
While some companies say they can't let employees telework due
to the nature of their business, other companies in the same
industries are finding ways to allow telework for specific jobs or
tasks, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Urges EU to Set Up Food Safety Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Commission, Romano Prodi, said Tuesday that one way to solve the
crisis of confidence on food safety in the European Union (EU)
could be to set up an independent European Food Agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plenary session of the European Parliament, Prodi
said several EU member states have already taken similar
initiatives by setting up their own independent food safety
authorities. "The idea is that such agencies are more flexible and
better equipped to ensure food safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A European Food Agency could, perhaps, be modeled along the
lines of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). This
agency has no decision-making power of its own: it takes purely
technical action but does so with notable swiftness and
efficiency. If anything goes wrong in connection with a drug, the
source of the problem can be traced within hours - whereas in the
case of a food scare it can take weeks," said Prodi who took his
office last month.
</P>
<P>
He also offered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
"another potential model". The American model with much more
far-reaching powers of decision "would enable action on safety to
be taken very rapidly, independently of the intervention of
political institutions," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem, of course, would be to how ensure democratic
accountability. Nor am I sure that such an agency could be set up
under the Treaty (of Amsterdam)," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
The new EU executive president also persuaded members of the EU
parliament to choose the alternative for Europe's food safety
mechanism. "I have no preconceived ideas about which model to
follow: I want to listen to your views. The main thing is to get
it right: whichever model we adopt, it must win back citizens'
confidence that their interests are being protected."
</P>
<P>
Noting recent trade disputes with the United States and others,
the president said such disputes have to be settled within the
World Trade Organization (WTO), and EU needs to push for the
establishment of credible international food standards in the
Millennium Round of WTO talks.
</P>
<P>
"Should any conflict arise between consumers' health and
producers' interests, health must take precedence," Prodi
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The food safety issue has worried Europeans for a long time
since discovery of "mad cow" disease in Britain three years ago.
The Europeans has also been scared by dioxin contamination in food
chains and some troubles in soft drinks this year. Therefore,
Prodi said the European Union has on hands "is a major challenge
in ensuring that such crises of confidence are not repeated".

<HEADLINE> Superstar Pavarotti No-show for Divorce Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Superstar tenor Luciano Pavarotti
was a no-show for the first hearing in his divorce case in his
home town of Modena Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pavarotti, 63, was engaged on the Australian leg of highly
successful world tour but his long-time wife, Adua Veroni, was in
court on schedule.
</P>
<P>
If Pavarotti had turned up the judge's first move would have
been to try to achieve a reconciliation, as is normal practice
under Italian law.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Veroni is reportedly seeking some 200 billion lire (about
108 million U.S. dollars) from the super-tenor, who recently
settled his account with the German tax man via a hefty fine but
is under investigation in Italy for allegedly conducting the bulk
of his business in Italy while declaring residence in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, Pavarotti is offering
considerably less than the sum demanded.
</P>
<P>
When Pavarotti went public on his long-running affair with his
then-26-year-old personal assistant Nicoletta Mantovani in 1996,
the ensuing divorce proceedings were described by both sides as
"amicable".
</P>
<P>
Things appeared to have soured a little since, at least for Ms
Veroni, who like her estranged husband is in her sixties. She was
married to Pavarotti for more than thirty years.
</P>
<P>
Mantovani, who features regularly with her companion in Italy's
most popular magazines, has declared it is her and Pavarotti's
dream to get married.

<HEADLINE> American Countries Approve Mechanism to Confront Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The countries of the
Organization of American States (OAS) Tuesday approved the
"Mechanism of Multilateral Evaluation (MEM)" to confront the
trafficking and consumption of drugs.
</P>
<P>
This control mechanism in the fight against drugs was approved
within the frame of the 26th ordinary period of sessions of the
Inter-American Commission for the Control of the Abuse of Drugs
(CICAD) in the OAS.
</P>
<P>
A declaration issued during the meeting, signaled that the
creation of this new mechanism is based on the respect of rights
of sovereignty, territorial jurisdiction and the internal judicial
order of the states, as well as the reciprocity, shared
responsibility, integrity and equilibrium in the treatment of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism is applicable to all the states, individually and
collectively and will be governmental, unique and objective with
the participation of specialized representatives of the
governments.
</P>
<P>
It will also exclude sanctions of any nature and respect the
confidentiality of of the deliberations and of the information
received.
</P>
<P>
According to the explanation of the new president of CICAD,
Alberto Scavarelli, the MEM implies that a group of 34 experts
representing each member country of the OAS will elaborate reports
on the anti-drug policies in each of the different countries,
based on 61 indicators.
</P>
<P>
The states will not perform auto-evaluation, but participate in
the reports made by the other states. The MEM establishes that
"all the countries evaluate and they will all be evaluated".
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are three thematic fundamental ideas
for the elaboration of the reports from each of the countries: the
reduction of the drugs market (the fight against the drug
trafficking and organized crime), a reduction of the demand
(campaigns of education and rehabilitation) and the international
cooperation performed by each state.
</P>
<P>
Up until now, the U.S. government has performed an evaluation
on a unilateral basis, over the fight against drugs performed by
each of the Latin American countries, and placed sanctions on the
non-approved countries. The actions of the U.S. government were
considered as an intervention of internal matters and strongly
criticized by the countries of the region.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock ended mixed
Tuesday in a cautious response to the Federal Reserve's decision
to leave the interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.64 at 10,400.59,
erasing all the 105-point gain in the trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 3.25 at 1,301.35 but the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 3.70 at 2,799.67.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index turned negative after the Federal Reserve
announced that it decided not to raise interest rates but moved
its policy directive from neutral to one tilting toward a rate
increase in the coming months. The blue chip index surged in the
early trading as investors expected the Federal Reserve to leave
the rates alone.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors made a nervous response to the Federal
Reserve's announcement because the decision did not clear the air
of uncertainty on the rate future.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.29 at 599.30 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 5.18 at 784.65. The Russell 2000 index of

<HEADLINE> PC Magazine Names 100 Most Influential Companies in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft was ranked as
number one among the "100 most influential companies" for the
third consecutive year by PC Magazine in its 1999 analysis of the
U.S. technology industry.
</P>
<P>
America's leading technology magazine said Tuesday that for the
ratings, its editors considered such factors as revenues, market
share, profitability, products performance and subjective
assessments.
</P>
<P>
On the 10 top-ranked list following Microsoft are America
Online, Intel, IBM, Cisco Systems, Amazon.com, Yahoo, Oracle, Dell
and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the months-long process of developing the list, the
magazine quoted its editor-in-chief Michael Miller as saying that
the huge impact that big Internet firms are having on the
technology industry played a large role.
</P>
<P>
Success in this new era will come to those companies that are
the most effective at producing the hardware, software and
networking infrastructure products and services that get people
online at work and at home and enable them to be productive in
both environments, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"Survival of the fittest hinges on a company's ability to adapt
to the Internet, not an ability to withstand it," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Microsoft as number one, the magazine said that
it continues to set the agenda for personal computing. The
company, which dominates in operating systems and office
applications, has been a strong competitor in providing Internet
service or Internet content.
</P>
<P>
Would Microsoft's influence go down some day? The magazine
quoted Miller as saying: "It seems to me the things that pose the
great threats to Microsoft's influence are the rise of the
Internet as an application platform, the development of many
'appliances' that perform specific functions without the need of
Windows or Microsoft applications, and any restrictions or changes
in the company's business practices that come out of the
Department of Justice antitrust case."

ROME, October 5 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of a recent crime wave
throughout Italy, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema pledged
that the government would step up crime-fighting measures in a bid
to ensure that Italians once again feel safe in their streets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual assembly of the retailers association,
Confesercenti, the prime minister underlined the fact that
sentences handed out to criminals must be more effective and that
prison terms need to be carried out to the full.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's comments came in response to public outrage in recent
weeks over crimes committed by persons supposedly under house
arrest or out on parole.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent, much-publicized survey, only about one
fifth of terms are actually served, at the end of a lengthy
process of trial and appeal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, D'Alema pledged that new electronic bracelets for
those under house arrest would be introduced by the end of the
year and said a unified national anti-crime unit would be
operational within six months.

<HEADLINE> Italy Ready to Recognize East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy is ready to officially
recognize East Timor as soon as the island sets up a government,
Italian Foreign Undersecretary Valentino Martelli said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Martelli's comments to the Senate were echoed by Senator Giulio
Andreotti and Foreign Commission President Gian Giacomo Migone,
who said Italy intended to recognize the island's independence as
soon as possible so as to remove any room for uncertainty which
could lead to further violence.
</P>
<P>
"By sending a multinational peacekeeping force to the island
Italy has in effect already recognized East Timor's independence,
but before it can officially recognize East Timor, a government
must be established there," Martelli said.
</P>
<P>
Martelli, who will travel in November to Indonesia and Dili,
the East Timor capital, reiterated that Italy wanted perpetrators
of crimes against the Timorese population to be punished and
recalled that it had voted in favour of a United Nations
commission to investigate the crimes.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the military role of Italy's 600
troops currently stationed in East Timor, Martelli said soldiers
participating in the UN peacekeeping mission were authorized to
attack first in danger, unlike in Bosnia where the peace
contingent could only open fire in self-defense.

<HEADLINE> More Wind Energy For Electricity Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Wind energy could provide 10
percent of the world's electricity requirements by 2020, create
1.7 million jobs and reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by
more than 10 billion tons, a report released Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Findings of the report indicate that a total of 1.2 million
Megawatts (MW) of wind power can be installed worldwide by 2020,
producing more than the total electricity consumption in Europe
today. "In Europe, one fifth of this total capacity would be
installed, creating a quarter of a million jobs," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 million MW represents one fifth of 1998 worldwide
electricity consumption, highlighting the conservative approach
taken in the report of a business-as-usual world that doubles
electricity use by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The report, commissioned by Greenpeace, the European Wind
Energy Association and the Forum for Energy and Development,
unveiled their global energy blueprint at the Financial Times
World Renewable Energy Conference in Brussels, "the first major
business summit on renewable energy".
</P>
<P>
The three organizations called on all countries at next month's
UN Climate Convention meeting in Bonn to ensure that the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM), outlined in the Kyoto Protocol
adopted in December 1997, promotes renewable technology transfer
and excludes nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the 10 percent target, the report also
calls on world's governments to establish firm targets to remove
inherent electricity sector barriers, halt fossil fuel and nuclear
subsidies, and introduce a range of legally enforced mechanisms to
promote wind energy.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the Kyoto Protocol signalled to the energy
industry the beginning of the phaseout of fossil fuels," said
Corin Millais, Greenpeace Renewable Energy Campaigner.
</P>
<P>
"Governments must now act to establish the regulatory framework
and set legally binding targets for renewables. There's no excuse
for inaction because wind power is an affordable, feasible,
mainstream global energy force that is able to substitute for
conventional fuels," Millais added.
