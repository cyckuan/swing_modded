<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- With seven days left for the visit
of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Bangladesh, all preparations,
including security measures, are now being scrutinized, a foreign
office spokesman said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While the foreign office officials of the country are preparing
the itinerary and agenda of the official talks between President
Clinton and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, the
advanced security team from the United States visited the probable
places where President Clinton is likely to go.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen Sunday, the foreign office spokesman said the
members of the U.S. advanced team comprising White House Liaison
Officer Terry Bish and Chief of Security Eric Shombora Sunday
visited all the probable places that Clinton plans to visit.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, the spokesman said President Clinton
will arrive Dhaka on March 20 between 10 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. and
leave here in the night after attending a banquet to be hosted by
Bangladesh President Shahabuddin Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Bangladesh News Agency, though the
agenda of the official talks have been kept open, Bangladesh might
request the U.S. president to enhance the existing quota of ready-
made garments by another 30 percent and allow zero tariff to
Bangladeshi exports.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will also request President
Clinton to regularize the stay of Bangladeshis in the United
States. According to official estimates, 50,000 Bangladeshis are
living in the United States.

STOCKHOLM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- German Sven Hannawald kept his

<P>
Martin Schmitt, another German who has already clinched the
World Cup title, placed fourth.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Sabotaging Immunization Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Britain are trying to
sabotage a campaign against poliomyelitis in Iraq by blocking
vaccine contracts it signed with foreign countries, a senior Iraqi
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak said the U.S. and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee deliberately blocked such
contracts for importing vaccines against polio, a kind of
infectious, virus-caused disease often resulting in physical
disablement.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has launched a two-phase nationwide immunization campaign
against polio for its 3.5 million children below the age of five.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will begin on March 28 and the second on April
25, with each phase lasting five days, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Iraq would have to rely on private transport for
the immunization campaign as the committee had not approved
delivery of vehicles ordered by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Iraq's deteriorating environment on the 1991 Gulf War,
during which the U.S.-led multi-national forces attacked Iraq's
electricity and drinking water systems and the sewage treatment
facilities, resulting in the spread of infectious diseases with
polio as an example.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that the radioactivity from the depleted
uranium bombs used by the U.S. and British forces during the Gulf
War was the main cause for the surge of cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad condemned the U.S.-led allies for dropping hundreds of
tons of depleted uranium bombs in Iraq which cause harm to the
health of Iraqi people and contaminate the environment.
</P>
<P>
Iraq can do little to help the cancer victims of the depleted
uranium bombs, as the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee put on hold contracts Iraq signed to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that 11,236 people, mostly children, died last month
due to the decade-long U.N. sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, now in its seventh phase,
Iraq is allowed to sell oil and use part of the revenue, under the
U.N. supervision, to buy food and medicine to ease the impact of
the sweeping U.N. sanctions.

<P>
NICOSIA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
left here Monday for Paris for a four-day working visit, during
which the Cyprus issue and the Cyprus' accession process to the
European Union (EU) will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and
government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou, will hold meetings with
French President Jacques Chirac and members of the French National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the island have already completed two rounds of
proximity talks under U.N. auspices in an effort to find a final
solution to the Cyprus issue. The third round is scheduled to start
in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus began applying for EU membership in 1990 and started
substantive accession talks with the EU in November 1998. It hopes
to be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Defence Works on Missile Shield, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's National Defence
Department has started work on a project of 637 million Canadian
dollars (about 437 million U.S. dollars) in the proposed U.S.
ballistic missile defence system, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Senior defence leaders have given the go-ahead to begin work on
a project to put a military surveillance sensor into space, the
first major portion of the Canadian forces Joint Space Project,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Citing "a recent Defence Department report", the newspaper said
one of the roles of the Joint Space Project is "to make an
asymmetrical contribution to BMD (Ballistic Missile Defence)."
</P>
<P>
The document describes the project as being able to provide
defensive measures against space-related threat under " U.S.
leadership".
</P>
<P>
Sixteen months ago, senior U.S. and Canadian officials met in
Washington to discuss Canada's involvement in the missile plan,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, U.S. and Canadian officials worked out plans
for research and development "ultimately leading to a Canadian
asymmetric contribution" to the missile defence shield.
</P>
<P>
The American plan is to protect North America from ballistic
missiles, or in case of "accidental launches of rockets by Russia,
" said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Russia's NATO Accession Impossible Unless Alliance Transforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin reaffirmed Monday that Russia will not consider the
possibility of joining NATO unless the alliance reforms and treats
Moscow as an equal partner.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia might regard its accession to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization as possible at some time in the
future if the alliance undergoes a serious transformation and
grants Moscow equal and full membership, Putin told an interview
published in the just-released book "In the First Person.
Conversations with Vladimir Putin."
</P>
<P>
Answering the author's question "Is not it appropriate to
review the idea of joining NATO?", the acting president replied, "
It is possible to review, but hardly at the moment. The question
is, which NATO is meant. If it is the one that took action in
Kosovo in violation of U.N. decisions, we are not interested in
discussing this, even in theory."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "if the question is about the serious
transformation of the bloc into a mainly political organization
prepared for constructive interaction with Russia, then we would
have a subject for discussion," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Here he stressed that in any case, he means "a distant outlook.
"

<HEADLINE> Drought Worsening in U.S. South, Part of Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Much of the South and parts of
the Midwest are in a drought that is likely to intensify this
spring, threatening crops and water supplies, the Clinton
administration said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the spring drought outlook, Commerce
Secretary William Daley said that "the drought of 1999 remains
with us in the new century and our data indicate drought
conditions are probably going to get worse before they get better.
"
</P>
<P>
"Droughts have hit our nation for the last three of the last
five years, and Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama just
experienced the driest February in 106 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who also attended the press
conference, said that it is too early to predict crop production
with an degree of certainty.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to be alert to the possibility that, if dry
conditions persist in certain parts of the country, there could be
a significant agricultural impact," he said.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said that two-thirds of winter wheat crop in Texas was
recently rated "poor to very poor" in large part because of dry
weather.
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame the dry weather on La Nina, the weather
pattern that is related to cooler-than-normal temperatures in the
eastern and central Pacific Ocean. La Nina is expected to linger
for several months at least.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit states are expected to be Arizona, Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida,
Georgia, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana.

JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki will leave for Maputo, Mozambique on Tuesday to attend
a Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit meeting to
discuss the recent floods ravaging the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss the impact of the floods on the
infrastructure and economy of the region, particularly on
Mozambique, South African Foreign Affairs Department spokesman
Ronnie Mamoepa was quoted by South African Press Association as
saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former South African President Nelson Mandela Monday
received from local and foreign businesses over 13.1 million rand
(about two million U.S. dollars) to assist Mozambican flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
The money will be given to the Mozambican Embassy in Pretoria
immediately, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure these businessmen that all this money will
get where it is supposed to. It will be guarded by my wife Graca
Machel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The floods have killed over 500 people and left hundreds of
thousands homeless in the southern African region since the
beginning of February.

<HEADLINE> Flood Death Toll in Mozambique Rises to Near 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of confirmed deaths
from the floods in southern and central Mozambique now stands at
492, said spokesman for the National Disaster Management Institute
(INGC) Antonio Macheve here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the death toll will continue to rise because
more bodies have been found as the waters gradually subsided, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the number of people housed in the 76
accommodation centres set up for flood victims has risen from
about a quarter of a million to 329,000.
</P>
<P>
The total number of people affected by the floods, in one way
or another, in the five provinces concerned is about two million,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the INGC, emergency food aid will this week reach
the 650, 000 or so people who, while not directly affected by the
flooding, had been cut off from their normal supplies of food by
the road network damage.
</P>
<P>
The distribution will be undertaken mainly by airlift, but in
some areas, repairs to the roads are now sufficient to allow
distribution by truck.
</P>
<P>
The government is urging people in the accommodation centres
not to return to their homes yet, even though the level of the
waters in all the flooded river valleys is falling, Macheve said.
</P>
<P>
They will receive not only food aid in the centres, but also
better health and sanitary conditions which cannot yet be
guaranteed in their zones of origin, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy Seen as Favorable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- With confidence back into
its economy and an expected boost in consumer spending in 2000,
South Africa's economic prospects for the year ahead are
favorable, former South African Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence has started to seep back and this, together with
better personal financial circumstances following the
demutualization of Old Mutual (South Africa's insurance giant) and
cuts in interest rates, will boost consumer spending in 2000,"
Liebenberg said.
</P>
<P>
He said the improvement in confidence and better domestic
demand could well spark a recovery in capital spending later this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, Liebenberg noted that the international environment is
of great importance to South Africa's economy and the country
still faces the challenge of unemployment, crime, education and
health care.

<HEADLINE> Israel Agrees in Syria Proposal on Druze Reunions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel has accepted in principle
a Syrian proposal on regular reunions for Druze Arab families long
divided by wars between the two countries, an International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A detailed plan must be made for the reunions between Druze in
Syria and their relatives living in the Israeli-controled Golan
Heights, ICRC spokesman Uriel Masad said.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC will now prepare a proposal to be presented to Israel
and Syria for approval on technical details such as location, time
and manner of the reunions, he said, adding that the meetings,
which would be under the ICRC and the United Nations auspices,
would take place at the border.
</P>
<P>
Acting as intermediary, the ICRC conveyed messages from Syria to

Israel for months about the idea. Israel and Syria have no formal
ties and are formally in a state of war.
</P>
<P>
There are about 18,000 Druze living in the Golan Heights which
Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War. Until now, the only
family reunions that have been allowed to the Druze from the Golan
have been during occasional U.N.-sponsored weddings which take
place in a no-man's land between the Israeli side and Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
Many of the brides move to their husband's village across the
border and do not have the chance to see their family again.
Families often communicate by shouting with megaphones across a
valley lying between the two villages.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed peace talks in December after a four-
year break. But the talks have been stalled again in January due to

differences over which issues should be discussed first.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Bomb Palestinian Bases in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Monday bombed
Palestinian guerrillas' bases in southeast Lebanon near the Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (People's Front) and Fatah Uprising, which
are opposed to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace deal with
Israel, were the first of its kind since 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli planes fired several missiles at the bases in four
sorties within 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
So far, there were no immediate reports of casualties. But
security source said some military facilities were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday morning, Israeli planes bombed suspected outposts
of the Syrian- and Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli intense bombardment came two days after Arab Foreign
Ministers' Conference was held in Beirut. The resolution of the
conference harshly denounced Israel's aggression and attacks on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-claimed aim of protecting its northern territories from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Though Israel has decided to withdraw its troops from south
Lebanon by July, the Hezhollah guerrillas, who are spearheading a
guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation forces and the pro-
Israeli South Lebanon Army, have not slacked in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking the full return of the Golan Heights
Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, insists on a simultaneous
progress in both the Syria-Israel and the Lebanon-Israel peace
tracks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns MKO Mortar Attacks on Northern Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday strongly condemned
the armed opposition group, Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO), for
launching mortar attacks on a residential complex in northern
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that these
hostile and violent acts are a proof of the MKO's terrorist and
anti-people nature, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We express our deep disgust at the MKO terrorist acts against
the defenseless people," he said, adding that those criminals are
reluctant to accept the fact that the Iranian society marches
toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
Four people were wounded after the MKO fired five mortar shells
into the Nour residential complex, west of the Mellat Park in
northern Tehran, on Monday morning, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the MKO agents are disappointed at the massive
turnout of the Iranian people in the key parliamentary elections on
February 18, in which Iranian reformists won a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on world countries to condemn the MKO
terrorist acts and not to allow the MKO agents to take refuge in
their territories to freely propagate their inhuman ideas and
continue their heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the state-run television accused "counter-
revolutionaries" of being behind the explosions.
</P>
<P>
It was the second mortar attack launched by the Iraq-based MKO
within two months. The MKO fired seven mortar shells on February 5
to an area close to Iranian government buildings including the
presidential office, killing one person and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
The MKO claimed that Monday's target was the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander Major General Rahim
Safavi and a number of IRGC soldiers were injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack came one day after Saeed Hajjarian, a reformist
advisor to Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was injured
in a shooting by unidentified gunmen in front of the Tehran
Municipal Council. The gunmen are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a member of the Tehran Municipal Council and the
managing director of the reformist Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning)
daily, is still in coma.
</P>
<P>
The MKO had been an active political and military group fighting
against former Shah's regime, but was declared illegal in 1981
following sharp wranglings with the ruling clergy. During the past
decades, the MKO launched series of attacks on Iranian interests
inside and outside the country. Iran retaliated by launching air
raids on the organization's bases near Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Urged to Further Regulate Online Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's federal commission
for consumer issues has urged the government to provide more
protections for people who shop online, requesting that e-commerce
customers have the same rights as those enjoyed by more
traditional shoppers.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers have a feeling of insecurity and mistrust towards
electronic commerce... Protection is indispensable to give
consumers confidence," the commission said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission holds that its recommendations are necessary
because many customers feel e-commerce is unreliable and risky.
With further protections built into the Code of Obligations, it
believes people will be more willing to shop online.
</P>
<P>
It added that, according to statistics from Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, one in four web-sites of
suppliers were unknown or unidentifiable. In one out of ten cases,
the buyer's credit card was debited but goods were never received.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it was asking for the reforms in order "to
strengthen international collaboration and co-operation regarding
e-commerce". It said that it was also proposing that the
government bring Swiss law into line with European Union rules.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations also include the sale of goods via
television,radio and fax. The planned changes are compatible with
guidelines worked out at the ministerial conference of the OECD in
Ottawa in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Commission is aware that e-commerce is in a stage
of rapid development. This is manifest in particular in the
purchase of goods and services, including books, records, clothes
or accessories and software," the statement said. It added that
most transactions are transnational.
</P>
<P>
In making the recommendations, the commission said it believed
it was not necessary to create a federal law specifically for e-
commerce.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes to See High-level DPRK Official Visit Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan looks forward to the forthcoming visit to Washington by
a high-level official from the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) and welcomes "the increasingly positive signs related
to the Korean Peninsula," a U.N. spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, made the statement at a
press conference here as the DPRK and the United States resume
their talks Monday in New York in preparation for the proposed
visit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief "looks forward to the forthcoming visit to
Washington D.C., by a high-level representative of the DPRK,"
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General welcomes the increasingly positive
signs related to the Korean Peninsula," the spokesman said. "While
the issues in question remain most challenging, he believes that
they can be successfully addressed through dialogue and
determination."
</P>
<P>
"He also notes that the ROK (the Republic of Korea) President
Kim Dae-jung has made, in his speech in Berlin on March 9, a
number of proposals on increased economic cooperation in the
Peninsula and on other issues," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General considers it to be of particular
importance the proposal that a dialogue be opened without delay
between these two Member States of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard made the statement in what he described as "a formal
response" to the press question on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations system is exploring ways of enhancing its
humanitarian and development effort in the DPRK," the spokesman
said. "The Secretary-General stands ready, if requested by those
concerned, to contribute to the efforts aimed at reducing tensions
and promoting mutual confidence in the region."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and the U.S. are resuming their talks in New York
Monday after the two sides ended their fourth day of high-level
talks to discuss the proposed visit to Washington by a high-
ranking DPRK official in April.
</P>
<P>
Charles Kartman, special for peace on the Korean Peninsula, is
leading the U.S. team, while the DPRK delegation is being headed

<HEADLINE> Dutch Interior Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Interior Minister Bram
Peper resigned on Monday, saying that he intended to focus on
fighting allegations that he had misused public funds.
</P>
<P>
Queen Beatrix accepted Peper's resignation on Monday, four days
prior to the scheduled release of a report on how the outgoing
interior minister had handled public funds while serving as mayor
of the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Peper said in a letter addressed to Dutch Prime Minister Wim
Kok that he would resign so he could fully devote himself to
fighting the criticism of how he had spent public money during his
tenure in the Rotterdam city hall.
</P>
<P>
Roger van Boxtel, Dutch minister of urban policy and
integration of ethnic minorities, took over the duties of Peper
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad reported while
citing unidentified Rotterdam City Hall sources that Peper had
allegedly spent municipal cash and credit cards on improving his
personal well-being.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that Peper had brought home some of the
gifts presented to the city by visiting foreign dignitaries during
his 16 years as Rotterdam mayor. Peper was mayor of Rotterdam
from 1982 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that Peper's wife and other top
city officials were also involved in the alleged embezzlement of
public funds to spend on purchases of luxury items, expensive
meals and vacation abroad.
</P>
<P>
Peper denied the newspaper reports and threatened to sue the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows to Improve Tax Laws, Investment Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President Vladimir
Putin said Monday that the Russian government will seek to improve
tax laws and investment climate in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government will eliminate turnover tax to make the
Russian bank activities more transparent and establish control
over the unconditional observance of all laws in the economic
sphere, Putin told a meeting of the Consultative Council on
Foreign Investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The government attaches significant importance to this. In the
next two years, we hope to shift over completely to the
introduction of a profit tax," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed that the Russian banks' activities must be
transparent and the judicial system strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Putin called for more foreign investment in Russian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Increasing foreign and Russian investment in the country's
economy will raise people's living standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The unconditional guarantee of property rights in the Russian
Federation" is needed to boost the inflow of foreign capital and
repatriate Russian money spirited out of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia would strictly stick to these guarantees through"clearer
tax law, better performance out of the banking system and equal
conditions for all market players," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that no forces in Russia want to put the country
back on the path of isolationism.
</P>
<P>
The results of the March 26 presidential elections will not
worsen Russia's relations with foreign investors, Putin predicted.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, presidential elections are an important event in
the country's history. But regardless of who wins, the concept of
Russia's relations with foreign investors will not change. None of
the presidential candidates is interested in breaking off our
relations with Western investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin sees the fight against corruption as one of the crucial
tasks facing his country. To this end, the state "must overcome
the weakness and inefficiency of its organs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Diamond Dealers Refute U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian diamond dealers on
Monday refuted a United Nations report to be released soon to make
known sanction-busting individuals and countries.
</P>
<P>
RTBF, the radio and television service for the French-speaking
community of Belgium, quoted the Antwerp Diamond Superior Council
as labelling the U.N. report as "false".
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report, to be out on Wednesday, was prepared by the U.
N. Security Council's sanctions committee on Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Antwerp council of diamond dealers said that Belgium had
stopped importing diamond from UNITA last October.
</P>
<P>
RTBF quoted Peter Meeus of the Antwerp Diamond Superior Council
as saying that local dealers believed that it was not possible to
be sure about the origin of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is "in fact very difficult to determine the
origin of diamonds" in that diamonds get mixed up to acquire added
value and that it is impossible for people to truly decide the
origin of diamonds on each ring and wrist watch.
</P>
<P>
"This is truly impossible and it is as difficult as to
determine the origin of the milk one is to pour into the coffee to
be drunk," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council in 1993 imposed an arms and fuel
embargo on UNITA rebels in an effort to end a 25-year civil war in
the former Portuguese colony and five years later it placed bans
on UNITA's diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
But UNITA members were alleged to have travelled around Africa
and Europe to exchange diamonds for weapons.

<HEADLINE> Fiat's Alliance Deal With GM Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Fiat, the Turin-based and world No.6
auto multinational, Monday unveiled a radical change of direction
with a share swap deal and joint European investment agreement
with the world's biggest carmaker, General Motors.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which gives GM 20 percent of Fiat and Fiat 5.1
percent of GM at the same price of some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars,
represent a deep change in the traditional structure of Italian
industry.
</P>
<P>
As the terms of the accord started to filter out, it emerged
that Fiat's purchase of 5.1 percent of GM will cost 2.522 billion
U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fiat Chairman Paolo Fresco called the deal "historic," and said
that "We want to grow and we will do so in control of own destiny,
"answering fears of foreign "colonization" expressed in some
quarters.
</P>
<P>
But the deal envisages the possibility of transferring control
of Fiat's car division to GM within five years.
</P>
<P>
Fresco described this as a "theoretical guarantee," adding that
"Fiat and GM have structured the accord with a put option that
consists of a sort of parachute for shareholders."
</P>
<P>
Fresco said a joint-venture structure would be ready within
three months, one of these would jointly develop engines and
transmission systems, containing all GM's European and Brazilian
activities in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
The deal will enable GM to get footholds in key emerging
markets while the two groups will collaborate on parts and
development and Fiat will be able to use GM's business-to-business
e-sales network.
</P>
<P>
But while creating joint ventures to produce parts and
engineering for their cars, the two companies will maintain their
independence in assembly, trade-mark management and commercial
strategy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's HIV Carrying Population Ranks Second in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's estimated 2.6 million
adult population living with HIV, the cause of the deadly disease
of AIDS, has been rated the highest in West Africa and the second
after Ethiopia in Sub- Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The country's HIV carrying population may hit some 4.9 million
by 2003, The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Monday quoted
a recent government survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released by the Ministry of Health, warned that
"unless there is significant increase in the response to the
epidemic, the disease will either directly or indirectly affect
the lives of every Nigerian family."
</P>
<P>
While there are zonal variations, the survey shows that HIV is
prevalent in all the six geo-political zones of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Youths, the future of Nigeria, are the worst affected," the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
"In some zones, HIV prevalence in the 20-24 year age group is
almost 10 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Disease and death caused by HIV/AIDS will inhibit the
development of the country and make individual families and
communities poorer," the survey warned.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings of the survey, Health Minister Tim
Menakaya said that "the essence of this report is not just to
paint a picture of the extent of the AIDS problem, but to mobilize
all sectors of the country -- education, health, information,
economy, security -- into actions aimed at presenting a united
front in the battle against it."

LUSAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) is ready to help the Zambian government deal with cholera
which has broken out in some parts of the country following heavy
rains, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Karin
Holmgrunn sham Poo as saying that the body is willing to give any
assistance it could afford to halt cholera and improve health in
the African country.
</P>
<P>
"You can call on UNICEF if you need any help. Emergency
supplies can be organized to beef up stocks of drugs and equipment
to deal with cholera," Poo said while meeting with Zambian
Communications and Transport Minister Nkandu Luo.
</P>
<P>
Suspected cholera cases in the Zambian capital city of Lusaka
have risen to 21 with more cholera centers created to curb the
deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Central Board of Health spokesman Ben Chirwa
said all the eight up-graded clinics in the city will be used to
screen diarrhoea related diseases in view of the outbreak of
cholera in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged people with diarrhoea related diseases to report to
health centers for medical checkup and treatment to ensure that
cholera is not given a conducive environment to spread.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Doctors Reject SADC Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian doctors have rejected the
recently signed Southern African Development Community (SADC)
protocol barring erring doctors from practising in member states,
the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such a scheme is unworkable, the report quoted Canisius Banda,
general secretary of Resident Doctors Association of Zambia, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said such kind of protocols had been tried before in the
SADC region and had failed.
</P>
<P>
The signing of protocols would not improve the health standards
in Zambia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the SADC protocol, doctors in the region facing
disciplinary action could not drift from their country to other
member states to train or to work.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambian Health Minister David Mpamba, the protocol
was already in force at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Zambian doctors had to be cleared by the Medical Council of
Zambia (MCZ) to work elsewhere in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Zambian government has already started
ordering medical supplies and repeatedly asked the doctors who
have stayed away from work since last December to resume work.
</P>
<P>
The doctors were given up to February 10 to re-apply for their
jobs or consider themselves dismissed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors have refused to re-apply because their initial
contract with employers are still in force and binding.
</P>
<P>
Sources said about 30 junior doctors had left Zambia to seek
employment in other countries and more are also planning to leave.

<HEADLINE> PNA to Ban Jewish Settlement-Manufactured Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) will ban products manufactured in Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories, said a Palestinian official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known when the ban will take effect and if
that means all settlement-made goods will be barred from entering
into Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Supplies Abdul Aziz Shaheen said his
ministry has begun to search Palestinian shops for goods made in
those Jewish settlements and confiscate them.
</P>
<P>
He said there will be no presence of settlement-made goods in
Palestinian markets. Thousands of tons of products made in Jewish
settlements flocked into Palestinian markets every year, bringing
millions of U.S. dollars to Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
The PNA imported goods worth 4 billion dollars from Israel in
1999 while its exports to Israel was less than 5 percent of that
value.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian move comes just days before the two sides are
due to resume their stalled peace talks in Washington, in a bid to
strike a final peace treaty by September 13 that will also decide
the future of those Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
There are about 170,000 Jewish settlers in 145 settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians say those settlements,
as one of the thorniest issues to be resolved by both sides, should
be removed as part of a final-status agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been striving to keep most of the settlements intact,
even under its own sovereignty after forging a permanent peace with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the past years the expansion of Jewish settlements has
repeatedly led to bloodshed and suspensions of peace talks between
the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia to Cooperate More in Regional Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia are keen on
strengthening cooperation in various fields to safeguard regional
security and counter foreign interference in regional affairs, said
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Enemies of peace and stability in the region are at work for
their illegitimate interests, so cooperation between Russia and the
regional states will help guarantee security, stability, growth and
development in the region, Kharrazi told visiting Russian Minister
of the Federal Affairs and Nationalities Alexander Blokhin.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the current situation requires that Iran and
Russia, as two neighbors, carry out strategic and comprehensive
cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields as well as
in coping with regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Blokhin, who is also special envoy of Russian acting President
Vladimir Putin, said Russia regards Iran as a friendly neighbor and
important long-term political and economic partner, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We believe Iran is an important country in the region and no
security arrangement will work in absence of Iran," Blokhin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Moscow is willing to continue consultations with
Iran to help maintain security and development in the region and
prevent interference by foreign powers in regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also stressed the importance of contacts on
bilateral relations as well as on issues concerning the Caucasus
and the Caspian Sea.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Demand Israel to Release More Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Palestinians
demonstrated here Monday afternoon demanding Israel to release more
of Palestinian prisoners from its jails.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was held as Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators were holding a meeting on interim issues, including the
fate of jailed Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, most of whom were women and children, marched
to the Unknown Soldier Square and the Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) to urge the Palestinian negotiators to press Israel
for the release of up to 1,500 detainees from its jails.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the photos of some prisoners and the national
flags, they marched to the office of the International Association
of the Red Cross to seek international attention to the plight of
the Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian-Israeli talks held between Saeb
Erekat and Oded Eran failed to achieve any progress on implementing
the relevant provisions of Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed in
September.
</P>
<P>
Eran was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that the Israeli side
would make greater efforts to release another batch of Palestinian
detainees on the eve of the Greater Bairam (on Thursday).
</P>
<P>
"Even if the move took place after the Muslim feast, it would be
a sign of good will, showing our desire to make peace with the
Palestinians," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of Sharm el Sheikh memo, Israel has released
383 Palestinian prisoners in several batches, including two batches
as good gesture in last Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting.

<HEADLINE> No Headway for Israel-Palestinian Interim Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators failed to reach any agreement on the interim issues
after meeting here again on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran told reporters after the
meeting that he discussed with his Palestinian counterpart Saeb
Erekat over the issues of Israel's release of Palestinian
prisoners, the opening of the northern "safe passage" route linking
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Ramallah and Israel's
third troop redeployment in the West Bank under the Sharm el Sheikh
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The talks failed to narrow their gaps over which areas of the
West Bank to be transferred to the Palestinians and this issue will
be further discussed during the Washington talks later this month,
Eran said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants Israel to hand over villages east and
north of Jerusalem during the next redeployment, but Israel refuses
to do so.
</P>
<P>
The third phase redeployment on 6.1 percent of the West Bank
territories, which should have been carried out on January 20 under
the Sharm el Sheikh memo signed last September, has been stalled
due to differences over which areas to be covered by the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side will continue to discuss the release of
Palestinian prisoners with the Palestinian side in an effort to
have them freed before the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, or the
Feast of Sacrifice, starting on March 16, Eran said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants Israel to release 150 to 200
Palestinian prisoners before the holiday in order to let them spend
the holiday with their families. Israel has released 383
Palestinians under the new peace deal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the northern "safe passage" issue, Eran said that Central
Commander Maj.-Gen. Moshe Yaalon will hold another meeting with
Jamil Tarif, minister of Civil Affairs of the Palestinian National
Authority, Monday evening, to finalize the location of the eastern
checkpoint.

<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey reacted on Monday against a
Syrian map to be handed out in the International Tourism Fair of
Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Syria prepared a map to be distributed in its stand in the fair,
including in its own territory, Hatay and Iskenderun, two towns
within the borders of Turkey, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Erkan Mumcu, the Turkish tourism minister who led a delegation
to attend the fair, said that "even Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
cannot enter into Hatay without passport."
</P>
<P>
Asim Temizgil, the Turkish consul general in Berlin, said that
they warned Syria regarding the maps, adding that they would warn
Syria once again.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Turkey and its neighboring Syria have been tense
over disputes on territory, water resources and the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara accused Damascus of
supporting behind scene.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in the southeast of Turkey.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Fund Structural Reforms in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has agreed to
provide Turkey with a loan of 750 million U.S. dollars to help the
government carry out economic reforms, the Anatolia News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Board of the World Bank is expected to discuss the Economic
Reform Loan (ERL) on April 11, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The money will go to restructuring programs in public
expenditure management, agriculture, energy, social security and
privatization.
</P>
<P>
It will finance the implementation of pilot schemes in four
regions of Turkey this year, including the planned restructuring of
state-owned enterprises in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
In the energy sector, the loan will help the sector realize a
transit to the market-oriented model and rationalization of energy
projects so as to meet Turkey's energy generation and distribution
needs under a privatized structure.
</P>
<P>
It will also support the establishment of regulatory bodies for
energy and telecommunications, and the implementation of
privatization program in such sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the area of social security, the loan will support the
introduction of a private pension pillar, rationalization of
accounts of pension systems and improvements in pension management.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the World Bank have also reached an agreement in
principle on a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) of 750
million dollars to help Turkey conduct planned reforms in the
banking system, including the proposed establishment of the Banking
Board and the initial steps towards privatization of the state
banks.
</P>
<P>
The FSAL is due to be presented to the Board of the World Bank
for approval in May.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will send teams to review these projects in April
to prepare for their implementation this year.

<HEADLINE> hke031362 --U.S. Govt Urged to Join Vietnam in Humanitarian Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai said Monday that he hoped the United States would join
Vietnam in humanitarian efforts to overcome the war consequences.
</P>
<P>
Khai made the remarks during a meeting with visiting U.S.
Secretary of Defense William Cohen here.
</P>
<P>
Khai said that so far hundreds of thousands of families in
Vietnam have not yet found the remains of their relatives who fell
in the war and millions of people had been affected by Agent
Orange sprayed by U.S. aircraft during the war.
</P>
<P>
As a result, said Khai, many families have three to four
children born with deformities. The Vietnamese government has
decided to grant allowances to these Agent Orange victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khai briefed the U.S. defense secretary on
Vietnam's socio-economic situation and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that during the visit the U.S. defense
secretary would better understand Vietnam's economy and help the U.
S. government make right decisions in line with the two countries'
relations and international relations.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese prime minister asked Cohen to convey his regards
to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Cohen spoke highly of the positive cooperation and assistance
given by the Vietnamese government in searching for the remains of
the U.S. MIA (missing in action) from the war.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past five years, the two countries'
relations have been improving step by step.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that after his visit, the two countries'
relations would be developed, especially in economic and
commercial fields.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Vietnamese Defense Minister Pham Van Tra and
his U.S. counterpart William Cohen also held talks.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and his entourage on Monday also visited an excavation
site for U.S. servicemen's remains in Dong Phu commune, Chuong My
district, Ha Tay province.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here Monday morning on an official visit to
Vietnam from March 13 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is the second leg of Cohen's Asian tour. Before his
visit to Vietnam, the U.S. secretary of defense visited Hong Kong.
Cohen will also visit Japan and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets to Hear Briefing on Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday met in a closed-door session to hear a briefing of the U.N.
Secretariat on recent unrest in the disputed territory of Western
Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, one of the Council's African members, had requested
closed-door consultations on the situation in the territory
following recent clashes between demonstrators and Moroccan troops
and police.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council failed to hold planned consultations on
the latest development in the territory because "there was no
consensus among Council members for a briefing on that subject
today," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan largely controls Western Sahara, a former Spanish
colony, while the Algeria-backed Polisario Front is campaigning
for the territory's independence.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for more than eight years
to organize a referendum to decide whether Western Sahara should
be incorporated into Morocco or become independent. The vote has
been repeatedly postponed due to differences over who should be
allowed to take part.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara,
comprising some 300 military observers, troops and civilian police,
has been trying to organize the vote, originally set for January
1992. It has also been monitoring a cease-fire between Morocco and
Polisario since September 1991.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report last month
that it was still impossible to set a deadline date for the
referendum and raised the possibility that it might no longer be
possible to hold one.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was asking his personal envoy for the
territory, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, to consult
with the parties on possible next steps.

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes Revised Government Deficits, Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union confirmed on
Monday the downward trend of government deficits and debts ratio
against the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The deficit ratio decreased from 1.5 percent of GDP in 1998 to
0.7 percent in 1999 among the 15-nation bloc while the deficit
ratio also decreased in the 11-nation euro zone, from 2.0 percent
in 1998 to 1.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Seven EU member states had enjoyed government surpluses as
against the gross domestic product in 1999. These countries were
Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The government debt ratio to GDP decreased in the European
Union from 68.9 percent in 1998 to 68.1 percent in 1999 and
decreased in the euro zone from 73.4 percent in 1998 to 72.2
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has set a reference mark of government debt
ratio to GDP at 60 percent for countries participating in the
single currency mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Yet Belgium and Italy, both in the euro zone from the
inauguration of the euro on January 1, 1999, had government debt
ratio to GDP at 114.4 percent and 114.9 percent respectively,
though both were on a downward path compared with the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Greece, that has just announced its timetable for joining the
euro zone by 2001, had a government debt ratio to GDP at 104.4
percent.

<HEADLINE> Civil Registration Ready to Start in Kosovo: U.N. Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A major step in the
reconstruction of Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, is being taken with
the launch of civil registration by the U.N. Civil Administration
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
U.N. officials said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A civil strategy is essential in providing public services to
all residents and in building an accurate voter registration list,
" a press release from the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),
comprising of both U.N. Civil Administration and OSCE
representatives for the reconstruction in Kosovo, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Registration will take place during this spring and summer at
400 locations across Kosovo, and it is obligatory for residents
for Kosovo to be listed on the civil registry. In the initial
phase, everyone over the age of 16 will be registered.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade last Monday lodged "the strongest protest" over the
intention of the Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. Special Representative
for Kosovo and the head of the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), to
issue travel documents for Kosovo residents, saying that the plan,
if carried out, would "amount to yet another flagrant violation"
of the relevant Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter from Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations,
to the president of the Security Council. The letter was published
here as official Security Council document.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the contention of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) that they will issue '
special travel documents,' and not 'passports', which does not
infringe the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
there is no evidence in the history of issuance of such documents
by United Nations representatives to citizens of countries in the
territories of which operations have taken place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of this intention, one in a series of
arbitrary actions taken by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations in contravention of his
mandate, would amount to yet another flagrant violation" of the
June 10, 1999 Security Council resolution "in wanton disregard for
the Security Council and the Charter of the United Nations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIK press release went on to say that to be listed as a
Kosovo resident and to receive an identity card, applicants must
meet one of the following criteria:
</P>
<P>
-- They must be born in Kosovo or have at least one parent
born in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
-- They must prove they have lived in Kosovo for a continuous
period of at least five years;
</P>
<P>
-- It can be determined that they were removed by force from
Kosovo and were unable to meet the residency requirements;
</P>
<P>
-- They are dependent children of adults who qualify and are
in full-time attendance at a recognized educational institution.
</P>
<P>
"For people not living in Kosovo, the process offers them an
opportunity to register to vote, but they must show that they were
resident in Kosovo on or before January 1, 1998," the press
release said. "They must also prove their identity and residency
through documentation."
</P>
<P>
The Joint Registration Task Force is setting up Municipal
Documentation Centers to assist those who have no official papers
or documents. At these centers, staff check claims of lost or
confiscated documents against archives. People whose applications
for registration are denied will have the right to appeal their
cases to a Civil Registrar.

<HEADLINE> Four of Five Proposals Rejected in Swiss Referenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Swiss people rejected four of the
five proposals put to vote in nationwide referenda on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The justice reform proposal put forward by the government was
the only one supported by the voters. Under the proposed plans, a
panel of judges will be allowed to decide whether a case merits a
hearing in the federal court. The government, meanwhile, will be
empowered to adopt uniform legal procedures to apply across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In what is being seen in some quarters as an endorsement of
Swiss Justice Minister Ruth Metzler, the plans were approved by
all 26 Cantons. In addition, over 85 percent of voters were in
favor.
</P>
<P>
The proposal on speeding up democracy was rejected by a
majority of the 26 cantons, and attracted little public support.
Under the Swiss system, approval is needed from both. The plan was
aimed at reducing the time it takes to put proposals to a national
vote. The organizers wanted the current limit of 39 months reduced
to 12.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to halve traffic on Swiss roads within three years
was also given short shrift by voters and the cantons. Its
supporters had argued that current traffic levels cost the economy
around one billion Swiss francs (about 600 million U.S. dollars)
annually in terms of noise, congestion, accidents and pollution.
Fewer than 20 percent of voters supported the plan.
</P>
<P>
Also rejected was a proposal for a total ban on medically-
assisted procreation, including sperm donation and in-vitro
fertilization. It was widely opposed across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Another proposal, which sought to fix quotas for women in
parliament and the cabinet, was rejected by an even larger margin.
Fewer than 20 percent of voters were in favor, despite a high
profile campaign by its supporters, and in Canton Appenzell-
Innerrhoden the figure was a mere seven percent.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Prefers to Settle Sharia Issue Politically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The festering crisis over the
contentious issue of Islamic Sharia law can only be solved through
political action as against legal option being canvassed by some
people, the Nigerian government has said.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Monday quoted the president's
spokesman Doyin Okupe as saying in the country's capital Abuja
that "a legal solution may wake chaos, pandemonium and further
communal hostilities."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "a properly packaged and transparently honest
and sincere political solution will end up without any victor or
the vanquished. "
</P>
<P>
Plans to introduce the Islamic code of Sharia in some Moslem
dominated northern states sparked violence last month between
Christians and Moslems in the northern city of Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
The violence spread to other parts of the country, leaving at
least 1, 000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent adoption or intent of adoption of Sharia
in the country's states of Zamfara, Niger, Kano and Sokoto, there
were calls for the government to seek judicial interpretation of
the Islamic code to determine its legality.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo considers a political process far
higher and more desirable than the legal based on his belief that
the federal government should "maintain its fatherly role to all",
Okupe said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no basis whatsoever for legalism to arise over
the matter as the last National Council of State meeting has ended
on a consensual note.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held last month at the end of Kaduna crisis decided
to suspend the implementation of Sharia. But some northern
governors soon went back on their promises at the meeting by
announcing their resolves to go ahead with Sharia.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Awaits U.N. Report on Sanctions Against Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is still
waiting for a copy of a United Nations report on alleged sanctions
busting in support of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), South African Press Association
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet received a copy," said spokesman for the South
African Foreign Affairs Department Daniel Ngwepe in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"It will be premature to comment before we have had an
opportunity to study the document," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is expected to release the report on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to international news agencies, the U.N. document
shows that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi is still able to move his
envoys quite freely through African and European countries to
exchange diamonds for weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council in 1996 placed bans on UNITA's diamond
trade, travel for its leaders and a freeze on its funds and
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. reportedly cited several countries and individuals for
violating these sanctions in the report compiled by the Security
Council's sanctions committee on Angola.
</P>
<P>
On South Africa, the report found that there is lax control at
airports and a selective application on travel bans for UNITA
officials.

MOSCOW -- Chechen rebel commander Salman Raduyev, one of
Russia's most wanted men for his role in two Chechen wars, was
captured in a special operation on Sunday and has been brought to
Moscow, acting Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting
with his deputies Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most odious bandit leaders. He is currently
in prison and that is where he belongs. I want to believe that it
is just the beginning," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian news agencies reported that Raduyev's staff
said the leading Chechen warlord had been killed in fighting last
month and buried in an undisclosed location in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev was in charge of the Chechen militants who took
hostages in Kyszlyar and the village of Pervomaiskoye in January
1996, Putin said, cited by the Interfax news agency. (Russia-

<HEADLINE> Egypt Committed to Settle Foreign Debts: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is committed to settle its
foreign debt of about 28.5 billion U.S. dollars in annual
instalments of 1.2 billion dollars, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would borrow annually within the range of one billion
dollars in easy terms from regional organizations and Arab funds,
Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
Studies are underway to seek loans for a number of economic
projects and will soon be submitted to the People's Assembly, or
parliament, for approval, Ghali told told a meeting of the economic
committee of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP).
</P>
<P>
A timetable has been set for paying government arrears and for
rescheduling them as soon as possible at a rate of one billion
Egyptian pounds (289.9 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
A draft law for real estate mortgage is ready in coordination

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Passes Controversial Telecom Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Parliament, the Lok
Sabha, passed here Monday a controversial bill to strengthen the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and set up a tribunal
to settle all disputes.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the TRAI would have powers to fix tariff
besides regulating and giving recommendations on new
telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal
would be created for adjudicating disputes between a licensor and
a licensee, the service providers and the consumers, so as to
reduce the burden on the TRAI.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition in the Indian parliament had charged the
government with rushing through the bill and "bypassing and
ignoring" the parliament while promulgating an earlier ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The bill was adopted by a voice vote, amid a walk-out by some
Opposition parties after their plea for raising further objections
was rejected by the parliament chair, the Press Trust of India
reported.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a debate on the bill in the parliament, Indian
Communications Minister Ramvilas Paswan revealed an ambitious plan
of the government to introduce Internet connections to all
district headquarters across India by June, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The government also planned to start a rural areas development
fund to strengthen the communication network across the country,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Wife Falls Victim to Cult Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian woman has fallen victim
to her husband's desire to become a cult leader, the Calgary Sun
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eda Diane Lee, 26, died in cult fast five months ago on a
mountain plateau 80 kilometers west of Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
She and her husband Jason Samuel Lee, 30, were fasting for 40
days and nights, believing that God had forbidden them to eat
because food was "an instrument of Satan".
</P>
<P>
Jason Lee believes he's a cult leader and prophet, being guided
by God as to where he'd go and what, if anything, he'd eat,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The couple hitch-hiked to Canmore and then hiked high onto a
mountain plateau, where they began their fast.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the day Eda died, Lee said God spoke to him
again, and gave him permission to fetch water and give Eda a drink.
</P>
<P>
"He went down to the creek to fetch it, and when he returned,
Eda was deceased," a police officer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"He dressed her in religious clothing they had with them,
wrapped her in a sleeping bag, and placed her in a natural crevice
on the mountain side," said Calgary police Dept. Scott Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
The few people who knew the couple became suspicious when Lee
returned alone. Police launched an investigation and eventually
interviewed Lee about Eda's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
Jason Lee has been charged with the unlawful disposal of human
remains after the five-month-old remains of his wife were found in
a shallow grave.
</P>
<P>
The couple were expelled from the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints three years ago because of their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Their former friends became scared of them as the friends
feared the couple were using their religious fervor to recruit
disciples to follow Jason Lee as a cult leader.
</P>
<P>
"He had no use for society, or authority, or money, or work,
believing God would provide him with all he needed in life,"
police said.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss multi-national
company, Nestle is carrying out a risk-free cattle breed
improvement program in Cambodia, the Cambodian state news agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ten out of 60 cattle owners in the Preak Thmei commune in Kien
Svay district of Kandal province have been selected to take part
in the project. Under the plan, their cows will be inseminated
with imported semen from superior bulls, mainly from Jersey and
Friesian bulls from Australia, Agence Kampuchea Press (AKP) said.
</P>
<P>
The cows would give birth between nine and 10 months after
being impregnated and the calves would mature to milking age in
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a cross-bred cow could provide between 6,
000 to 7,000 liters of milk annually.
</P>
<P>
The program would be expanded gradually, not only to improve
Cambodia's cattle industry, but also to provide the needs of
Nestle's milk processing facility to Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Capital Facing Breakdown of Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan capital Luanda, one of
the most densely populated cities in Africa, is now facing water
shortage at any time as its water supply system has been seriously
damaged owing to civil war, experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
A recent check found that many sections of the
30-kilometer-long pipeline between the urban area of Luanda and
Bengo River, a key part of the water supply system, could collapse
at any time and lead to water supply cutoff in the city.
</P>
<P>
Journal de Angola on Monday quoted Elvino Pimentel, manager of
Geotecnica Company which underwent a thorough examination of the
pipeline, as saying that the government should put in a large
amount of money to overhaul the system and replace those sections
that cannot be repaired owing to bombings.
</P>
<P>
Luanda, with nearly 3.5 million residents, is the third most
populous city in Africa following Cairo in Egypt and Lagos in
Nigeria.

JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-Cola Company
announced on Monday it will donate 1.5 million U.S. dollars to
help Mozambique rebuild its economy after the recent devastating
floods.

<P>
"Following the tragedy in Mozambique, it is very necessary and

Daft also said Coca-Cola is currently investing six million
dollars to build a factory in Napula in northern Mozambique, which
will be completed in October.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola's main plant in Mozambique is located in Maputo,
producing 40, 000 cases of the beverage everyday. However, the
factory has been closed for more than a month as a result of
severe flood damage.

<P>
CAIRO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- American trading sources said Saudi Arabia managed to
turn the deficit in its trade balance with the United States to
surplus last year due to the rising oil prices and the increase in
its exports to the U.S. markets, while Saudi imports from the U.S.
witnessed a noticeable decline as compared to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Arab daily Al Hayat said on Monday the statistics issued by
the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that the Saudi balance of
trade with the U.S. has changed into a surplus of 335 million U.S.
dollars in 1999, against a deficit of 427 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the surplus was achieved despite the
decline in the volume of trade between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia in
1999, when it dropped by 3.5 percent from 16.7 billion dollars to
16.13 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Transport Minister Ibrahim Metwalli el-Demiri
said his country has completed the studies related to the railway
line connecting Egypt and Libya, saying that Libya signed an
agreement with China to complete the project inside its
territories.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies quoted el-Demiri on Monday as saying the private
sector will undertake the operation of the railway stations under
government supervision.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Egypt has signed a contract with the Arab Fund
for Development. Under the contract, the fund will grant Egypt a
53-million-dollar soft loan to finance the renovation of 60 trains.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Italian company Edisson decided to inject new
investment estimated at some 5 million U.S. dollars in Egypt, and
to choose the U.S. Chase Manhattan bank as its financial consultant
in the Egyptian market.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian economic daily Al-Alam El-Youm quoted on Monday the
bank's executive manager in Egypt and the Arab region, Mahmoud
Abdullatif, as saying the new investment of Edisson will be
directed to oil and gas drilling, manufacturing and liquefying gas
and preparing it for exporting or for domestic use.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has earned some 75 million U.S. dollars in
valued added tax (VAT) from Iraqi diesel oil brought through the
southeastern Habur border crossing over the past five months,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 48,000 trucks and lorries trading diesel
through the Habur border crossing. A computerized system has been
installed at the Habur border post in order to regulate truck
traffic.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities have sought to discipline the diesel oil
trade on the Iqaqi-Turkish border, which was out of control for
quite some time.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey will send up to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
exports to Iraq in return for its crude oil exports under the U.N.-
sponsored oil-for-food program, reported Turkish Daily News on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iraq have recently signed a framework agreement to
increase trade to the pre-Gulf War level in 1991.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The two bridges spanning the Bosporus Strait, namely
the Istanbul Bosporus Bridge and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge,
brought in 76 million U.S. dollars in tolls to state coffers in
1999, reported Turkish Daily News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 65 million vehicles crossed the Bosporus Bridge
and 57 million crossed the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge last year,
according to data released by the Highway General Directorate
lately.
</P>
<P>
The two bridges linking Europe with Asia were built in 1973 and1
988 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Four Wounded in Mujahedin Attack in Northern Tehran by Rong Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Four people were wounded on Monday
when the armed opposition group Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO)
fired mortar shells into northern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Police said five mortar shells were fired by the MKO to the Nour
residential complex, west of the Mellat Park, also damaging 18
vehicles, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a police official at the scene told Xinhua that only
two people were wounded, with a pedestrian losing a leg in the
Seoul Street outside of the residential complex and a woman inside
the complex slightly injured in the face.
</P>
<P>
He said that perpetrators fired six 60mm mortar shells around
1330 local time (1000 GMT) into an area near the state-run
television center and the headquarters of the security forces and
the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).
</P>
<P>
Four shells fell into the Nour residential complex and two
others exploded in the Seoul Street, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, branded as a terrorist group by Tehran, has claimed
responsibility for the attack. Earlier the state-run television
accused "counter-revolutionaries" of being behind the explosions.
</P>
<P>
It was the second mortar attack launched by the MKO within two
months. The MKO fired seven mortar shells on February 5 to an area
close to Iranian government buildings including the presidential
office, killing one person and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
The MKO claimed that Monday's target was the IRGC Commander
Major General Rahim Safavi.
</P>
<P>
The attack came one day after Saeed Hajjarian, a reformist
advisor to Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was injured
in a shooting by unidentified gunmen in front of the Tehran
Municipal Council. The gunmen are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a member of the Tehran Municipal Council and the
managing director of the reformist Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning)
daily, is still in coma and a team of doctors are sparing no
efforts to save his life.
</P>
<P>
The MKO had been an active political and military group fighting
against former shah's regime, but was declared illegal in 1981
following sharp wranglings with the ruling clergy. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, Mujahedin launched a series of attacks
on Iranian interests inside and outside the country. Iran responded
with air raids on the organization's bases near Baghdad.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Education growth in the southern
Philippine province of Maguindanao was retarded in past four years
due to constant skirmishes between government troopers and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels, Philippine News Agency
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a study conducted by non-government organizations, the
agency said that in war-torn areas of Maguindanao, hundreds of
school children both in elementary and high school, have failed to
move higher in their school level due to constant suspension of
their classes brought about by armed fightings.
</P>
<P>
With the existing educational predicament in the province, town
mayors in the province have called on peace negotiators between
the government and MILF to include the matter in their agenda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local education officials have started doling out
incentives to the children in an attempt to encourage them to
finish their education.

<HEADLINE> More Arrests Made in Sri Lanka as Probe Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan investigators on
Monday arrested another three suspected Tamil Tiger rebels in
connection with a failed attempt to ambush a ministerial motorcade
here last Friday, state radio said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests brought the total number of Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebel suspects to nine, the radio said in its
night broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the officials of the Colombo Crime Detection
Bureau were currently questioning the nine suspects who were
residents of the island's war-torn north and east.
</P>
<P>
Police detained the suspects after recovering documents from
LTTE suicide bombers who were involved in the bombings and shoot-
out Friday evening along a strategic highway leading to parliament
where Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and other
ministers and political leaders were attending a meeting.
</P>
<P>
At least 29 people, including eight LTTE suicide bombers, were
killed during an overnight orgy of violence, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the suicide bombers had apparently intended to
ambush the motorcade of Ratwatte who was in charge of Sri Lanka's
war effort against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that they were investigating how so many
heavily armed rebels had managed to set up an ambush on the road
where security was tight as it was frequented by lawmakers and
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year-old war to carve out a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east, have been blamed for dozens of bomb explosions and suicide
bombings in Colombo and other cities over the years.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Prefers to Settle Sharia Issue Politically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The festering crisis over the
contentious issue of Sharia can only be solved through political
rather than legal option being canvassed by some people, Nigerian
President's spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
"It stands to reason that a legal solution may wake chaos,
pandemonium and further communal hostilities," the News Agency of
Nigeria Monday quoted Doyin Okupe as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, "a properly packaged and transparently honest and
sincere political solution will end up without any victor or the
vanquished," said Okupe.
</P>
<P>
Plans to introduce the Islamic law of Sharia in some Moslem
dominated northern states sparked violence last month between
Christians and Moslems in the northern city of Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
The violence spread to other parts of the country, leaving at
least 1, 000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent adoption or intent of adoption of Sharia
in the country's states of Zamfara, Niger, Kano and Sokoto, there
were calls for the government to seek judicial interpretation of
the Islamic code to determine its legality.
</P>
<P>
But Okupe said in the country's capital Abuja that the
president considers a political process far higher and more
desirable than the legal one based on his belief that the federal
government should "maintain its fatherly role to all".
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said there was no basis whatsoever for legalism to
arise over the matter as the last National Council of State
meeting ended on a consensual note.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held last month at the end of Kaduna riot decided
to suspend the implementation of Sharia. But some northern
governors soon went back on their promises at the meeting by
announcing their resolves to go ahead with Sharia.

<HEADLINE> EU President Meets Austrian Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres met here Monday Austria's new Chancellor Wolfgang
Schussel on the issues including preparation for the European
Union (EU) Lisbon Summit.
</P>
<P>
Guterres, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency for
the first six months of this year, told reporters that his meeting
with Schussel "was a very good working session with the Austrian
government in the preparation for the Lisbon summit."
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to transform Europe, the European Union, into
the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy of the
world" with high levels of growth, employment and social cohesion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been the nice opportunity to discuss the different
measures, the coordination methods and additional decisions we
would like to take in Lisbon in relation to these process, and
like to thank the contributions by the Austrian government for
that," Guterres said.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese presidency of the EU will represent the other 14
EU member countries as intended, Guterres said, to have "a very
clear position, very coherent position" if the situation in
Austria were still "ambiguous".
</P>
<P>
However, he said Austria can express its own opinion at the
Lisbon Summit to the 14 EU partners since it is still in the EU's
working framework.
</P>
<P>
At another press conference, Schussel said his country hopes
that the sanctions of freezing bilateral ties with Austria imposed
by the other EU partners "will be lifted as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
"The longer the measures take, the more difficulties for the EU
to face," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first foreign trip by Schussel since he accepted
the far-right Freedom Party into his coalition government early
last month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Guterres refused to go to Vienna from his tour of EU
capitals in preparation for the Lisbon Summit. Instead, he met the
Austrian chancellor in Brussels Monday as a gesture that this was
not a bilateral meeting but a working relation within the EU
procedure.

<HEADLINE> Public Investment Decides China's Future Economic Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts believe that the primary
goal of China's economic policy should be to stimulate public
investment, which will decide the country's future economic
situation, the China Economic Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the positive financial policy since 1998, China's
economy has maintained rapid growth. But public investment had far
less effect on prodding domestic demand than government
investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China's fixed asset investment increased by 14.1
percent in total. The increase of non-government investment was
only 8 percent while the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) invested
19.6 percent more money than the year before.
</P>
<P>
The situation saw no improvement last year. In the first nine
months of 1999, SOE investment increased 8.1 percent over 1998,
personal investment grew 7.5 percent while that of the
collectively-owned enterprises was just 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the weak public investment is attributable to
lack of market demand, high production costs stemming from the
rise of interest ratio, higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that increased spending on infrastructure
construction will not be enough to stimulate the public desire to
invest.
</P>
<P>
One way is to direct more investment to the production
enterprises, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Should Be More Competitive for WTO Entry, Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enterprises should
enhance their competitiveness to welcome the opportunities and
meet the challenges that will come with China's expected admission
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), according to an article
carried in today's People's Daily, China's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The signed article points out that a correct understanding of
these challenges and opportunities forms the basis by which
enterprises can formulate their decisions.
</P>
<P>
"For Chinese enterprises, China's entry into the WTO offers a
precious chance for them to equally participate in competition and
strive for development amid this competition," the article says.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the world's largest multinational trade
organization is conducive to the introduction of foreign capital,
advanced know-how, and management expertise into Chinese
enterprises, it says, adding that all these combined will give
impetus to technical innovation and structural adjustment in
Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, a marked decrease in tariffs after
China's WTO entry will bring down the cost of imports, providing
advantageous conditions for exported-oriented enterprises to lower
costs and increase competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
With China becoming a WTO member, the article says, Chinese
enterprises can improve their cooperation with multinational
corporations and make use of the sales channels and marketing
networks of multinationals to enter the global marketplace.  (

<HEADLINE> China's Imports Grow in First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's import volume was 28.7
billion US dollars for the first 2 months this year, a dramatic
rise of 54.1 percent compared with the same period in 1999,
according to information released today by the General
Administration of Customs (GAC).
</P>
<P>
General trade import volume, which hit 12.6 billion US dollars
during the past two months, an increase of 69.8 percent, was a
major contributor to the growth of total import volume.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China's processing trade imports hit 12.2
billion US dollars, and facilities and goods imported by foreign
businesses for the purpose of investing in China recorded 1.64
billion US dollars in value for the period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Should Be More Competitive for WTO Entry, Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article also reminds Chinese enterprises to "soberly see
the difficulties." China's WTO entry requires that the country
adopt more bold non-tariff measures, further open up the domestic
market, and soften the terms and open more fields for market
access, thus lowering the threshold by which overseas enterprises
can enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Whether an enterprise can grow and prosper under fierce
competition or not will depend on its competence and
competitiveness, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It also urges Chinese enterprises to speed up construction of a
modern enterprise system, take resolute measures to reform the
management mechanism, and expand business operations to an
appropriate scale in order to win competition in the international
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
More effort also should also be put into promoting technical
innovation, improving technical creativity, and increasing market
exploration.
</P>
<P>
To that end, the article says, the government and all of
society should support China's enterprises and help them to meet
these challenges. Their long-standing problems such as redundant
workers and heavy debt burden must be resolved. More laws and
regulations also should be promulgated to maintain a sound market
order and create an environment of fair competition, the article
concludes.

<HEADLINE> 101 Commercial Streets To Eliminate Shoddy, Fake Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Jianguomenwai Street in eastern
Beijing, home to foreign embassies and many large hotels, is
striving, along with 100 other well-known commercial streets
across China, to become free of shoddy and fake products.
</P>
<P>
China has selected 101 streets in large- and medium-sized
cities this year where customers can be sure of satisfactory goods
and services, Ji Zhengkun, an official with the State Bureau of
Quality and Technical Supervision, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The business establishments on these streets must thoroughly
inspect their stock to ensure quality, standard gauges must be
used, and there must be no fraud. At the same time, after-purchase
services must be guaranteed, and complaints should be dealt with
in a timely manner, said Ji.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the streets should be maintained as tidy and
beautiful places to shop, and sales personnel should treat all
customers courteously, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first group of streets taking part in this campaign are in
96 large and medium-sized cities across China, including Yuyuan
Street in Shanghai, Taiping South Road in Nanjing, the capital of
east China's Jiangsu Province, and Huaqiang North Street in the
city of Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The selection of streets were based on evaluations by customers
and examinations of the quality conducted by supervision
departments. The result will be announced in September.
</P>
<P>
China plans to select 101 streets free from shoddy and fake
products this year, and the number will increase to 300 next year,
and to 500 streets in 2002.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies from Grassroots Units Active in Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deputies from rural villages, industrial enterprises,
schools and other basic units at the grassroots level, have
unbosomed their minds and set forth many candid suggestions and
good ideas. They bring the aspirations of the people to the NPC
and integrate the major principles of the Party and state with the
interests of thousand upon thousand of families.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chun, a deputy township head from Guizhou Province,
southwest China, has submitted a proposal on enforcing compulsory
education among children in outlying mountainous areas, which is
based on opinions she has canvassed from her fellow folks during
her field trips. "Possible difficulties may be involved in the
course of implementing state policies at grassroots sometimes,
though there is nothing wrong with the relevant policies
themselves," she said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Deming, a cancer patient with an amputated left leg from
Sheyang County in the northern part of east China's Jiangsu
Province, often visited his fellow farmers and looked into the
real situation in villages before he comes to Beijing for annual
NPC sessions every year. At the current session, he suggested
adopting feasible methods of brining technologies to farmers at
doorsteps to their benefit.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies at the grassroots are taking the advantage of
their acquaintance of the people's real life to advise on the
government on matters of vital importance, such as economic
restructuring, government-initiated strategy of developing the
west, state enterprise reform and social security reform.
</P>
<P>
Shuai Jingao, 43, a deputy from a mountainous township in east
China's Fujian Province, noted that the key to expanding domestic
demand lies in the growth and expansion of rural market, which in
turn calls for increasing farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Reducing deficit in the State-owned Enterprises (SOE) is also a
topic of common concern. Li Xiulin, an entrepreneur from northeast
China's Jilin Province, acknowledged that China's SOE reform
should have higher goals set for themselves instead of soly
eliminating deficits in the wake of China's impending entry to
World Trade Organization (WTO). The large- and medium-sized
enterprises should sharpen their competitive edge through
improving management, introducing competent personnel, and
developing more new products of their own, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The major function of NPC deputies from the grassroots, however,
is to air general views at the nation's highest-level organ of
state power.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongli, an 80-year old deputy from Shanghai and an
adviser to the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, has tabled 48
motions during the past decade. As a deputy whose proposals have
led to the enactment of a law on protection of the elderly and a
securities law in the nation, he said, "I try to address issues
that are most concerned, and the government attaches great
importance to the views of the people and propositions from the
NPC deputies."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Calls for Showing Greater Solicitude for People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
urged government officials at all levels to show greater
solicitude for people and do a good job of handling matters that
having a bearing on people's immediate interests, instead of
engaging in empty talk.
</P>
<P>
At a group discussion attended by Anhui deputies to the 9th
National People's Congress (NPC), in session here since early
March, Zhu said: "Government officials at all levels must remember
that they are servants of the people and that they should do their
best to help people overcome their difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee's Political Bureau, urged
governments at all levels to pay attention to safety in production
and to timely finding and removing hidden troubles that lead to
accidents.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that agriculture, the rural area and the
question of farmers are always basic issues in the process of
reform and economic development. To realize a sustained
development of the rural economy and social stability in rural
China, it is necessary to put reducing farmers' burden high on the
agendas of governments, especially at a time when farmers' income
has increased at a slow pace, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a tax-for-fee reform in rural areas is a major
measure to reduce farmers' burden. The premier called on Anhui to
do a good job of implementing the tax-for-fees reform on a trial
basis and accumulate experience for the reform's nationwide
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called on continuing to speed up the construction of water
conservancy and control projects, saying investment in this sector
must increase.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, the banks of the Yangtze River should be
consolidated to reach designed flood-control standards so that
people along the river will no longer suffer from flooding, he
said.

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has
stressed the importance of improving grass-roots governments,
calling it a systematic project and an important foundation for
implementing the strategy of developing the western region.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the
remarks today in a panel discussion with deputies to the National
People's Congress (NPC) from Jiangxi Province, in east China.
</P>
<P>
If these grass-roots governments are strong and powerful enough,
they will be able to well implement the principles and policies of
the central leadership in accordance with their local conditions,
so as to boost the enthusiasm of the masses and lead them on the
road to prosperity, Li said.
</P>
<P>
If so, there will be no room for evil forces like the Falun
Gong cult, he said. Li is the head of a leading group in charge of
dealing with the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also calling for choosing young people to the
leading positions of grass-roots governments, saying that it is
helpful for fostering a large number of well-trained officials who

<HEADLINE> Feature: Countries Worldwide Eying Iraq's Lucrative Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq in reconstruction, a 200
billion U.S. dollars market, is attracting flocks of world trade
officials and businessmen to establish a beachhead here despite the
crippling U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has become dilapidated after fighting an eight-year war
with Iran from 1980 to 1988, nearly 10 years of U.N. sanctions and
regular U.S.-British air raids in the north and south since the end
of 1998. It needs smart investments for its reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
The profit-seeking countries currently are vying for a slice of
the lucrative market by gaining contracts under the U.N. oil-for-
food program and look to get a firm foothold once the crippling
sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of companies from around the world are selling their
products and services to Iraq through the U.N.-permitted oil-for-
food program that allows Iraq since 1996 to export limited amount
of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods for its 22 million people. The program is now in
its seventh phase.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a traditional ally of Iraq, has expressed readiness to
launch joint ventures with Iraq and provide it with spare parts,
equipment and machinery, which are in dire need in Iraq for its
dilapidated industries, Iraq's official newspaper Al-Jumhuriya
reported late February.
</P>
<P>
The willingness was expressed during a meeting between Russian
foreign minister's envoy Nikolai Kortosov and Salah Yousuf, head of
Iraq's electricity authority.
</P>
<P>
Russia is now waiting for approval from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee of a deal it signed with Iraq to resume construction of
Iraq's largest power station, which was interrupted by the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Russia has shown special interests in helping rehabilitate
Iraq's war-battered power system, Al-Jumhuriya said. The capital
Baghdad suffers a six-hour outage per day in winter and a 12-hour
blackout in torrid summer, and the power cut in other provinces
averages 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
France, another important trading partner of Iraq before the
1991 Gulf War, sparked off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
has been urging its firms to make larger investments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Oil is the key area that France is eyeing as it upgraded its
representation in Iraq last year, sending a diplomat to run an
interests section in Baghdad for the first time since 1990, besides
the already-opened trade center in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was once a major market for French goods before the U.N.
trade embargo that was imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
and figures show that Iraq still owes France some 5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's neighboring Turkey does not want to be left behind.
Turkish companies have secured 477 million dollars worth of
contracts on detergents, medical equipment and various spare parts
in the first six stages of the oil-for-food program, which put
Turkey as the ninth largest exporter to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, Turkish State Minister Edip Safter Gaydali,
heading a 200-member business delegation, arrived in Baghdad for
closer trade ties with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Gaydali held talks with Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan and ministers of finance, trade, oil and
industry, on ways of developing and strengthening bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has claimed that the U.N. trade embargo has made Turkey
suffer a loss of 30 billion dollars in trade with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In addition, large business delegations from India, Pakistan,
Austria, Poland, Algeria, Tunisia, Malaysia, Mexico and other
countries also arrived in Baghdad one after another.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Iraq, it hopes that by enhancing exchanges and
trade relations with other countries, especially its Arab
neighbors, it can alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and
mount more pressure on the U.N. to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to mend fences with other Arab countries and walk out
of isolation in the Arab world, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
said recently that Iraq should give preferential treatments in
developing trade ties with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, over half the contracts were signed
with other Arab countries. Iraq now has developed trade relations
with all Gulf states but Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, a close ally of
the U.S., stands at 100 million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Other Gulf and Middle East Arab countries, including Jordan,
Syria and Egypt, have benefitted from doing business with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign companies that signed contracts with Iraq have
often complained that they have to wait for a long time before
their contracts getting approval in the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the signed contracts
to buy food, medicine, the badly-needed spare parts and equipment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recently called on the U.
N. Sanctions Committee to quicken the process of examining and
approving the contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries within
the framework of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that due to the U.N. sanctions, Iraq's inflation
was once as high as 65,000 percent. Before the Gulf War, an Iraqi
dinar was worth 3.2 dollars, now a dollar can buy 1,970 dinars.

On the part of Iraq, it hopes that by enhancing exchanges and
trade relations with other countries, especially its Arab
neighbors, it can alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and
mount more pressure on the U.N. to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to mend fences with other Arab countries and walk out
of isolation in the Arab world, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
said recently that Iraq should give preferential treatments in
developing trade ties with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, over half the contracts were signed
with other Arab countries. Iraq now has developed trade relations
with all Gulf states but Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, a close ally of
the U.S., stands at 100 million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Other Gulf and Middle East Arab countries, including Jordan,
Syria and Egypt, have benefitted from doing business with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign companies that signed contracts with Iraq have
often complained that they have to wait for a long time before
their contracts getting approval in the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the signed contracts
to buy food, medicine, the badly-needed spare parts and equipment.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recently called on the U.
N. Sanctions Committee to quicken the process of examining and
approving the contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries within
the framework of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that due to the U.N. sanctions, Iraq's inflation
was once as high as 65,000 percent. Before the Gulf War, an Iraqi
dinar was worth 3.2 dollars, now a dollar can buy 1,970 dinars.

ISLAMABAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister Abdul
Sattar Monday said that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit later
this month will provide a welcome opportunity to discuss bilateral
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in southern Pakistani city of
Karachi, the foreign minister said Pakistan shares U.S. concerns
about terrorism and narcotic trafficking and will be glad to
discuss intensification of international cooperation against these
scourges.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear restraints may also figure in the talks, he was
quoted as saying by News Network International, a private news

</P>
<P>
The United States has long been urging Pakistan and India, both
of whom exploded nuclear devices in May, 1998, to retract from any
further development plans in the nuclear field.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf will be happy to apprise Clinton of his government's
vision for establishment of genuine democracy in the country, said
Sattar.
</P>
<P>
The current military government in Pakistan was set up after a
bloodless coup in October last year.

Sattar said the Pakistani side will also discuss with President
Clinton the promotion of purposeful dialogue on the long-standing
Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India.
</P>

LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were feared
dead in an ethnic clash on Sunday at Seme, a Nigeria's border town
with Benin, said the Guardian newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trouble was reportedly started when a commuter questioned
the rationale of paying toll at the ''Alhaji Garuba garage" at the
town and charged the collectors to go to their "home states" to
collect such tolls.
</P>
<P>
In the clash that follows, about 200 shops and 19 commercial
vehicles were torched.
</P>
<P>
The two groups of rioters divided by different ethnic
backgrounds used machetes, bows and arrows to attack each other.
</P>
<P>
To stop a possible spillover, the neighboring Benin shut its
border with Nigeria's Lagos State, while the latter sent large
number of policemen to the troubled spot.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's HIV Carrying Population Hits 2.6 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has an estimated 2.6
million adult population living with the Human Immuno-deficiency
Virus (HIV), which may lead to the deadly disease of AIDS, The
Guardian newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A recent government survey predicted that HIV carrying
population may hit some 4.9 million by 2003 in Nigeria, Africa's
most populous country with a total population of more than 100
million.
</P>
<P>
The survey report released by the country's Ministry of Health
also warned "unless there is significant increase in the response
to the epidemic, the disease will either directly or indirectly
affect the lives of every Nigerian family".
</P>
<P>
While there are zonal variations, the survey shows that HIV is
prevalent in all the six geo-political zones of the country.
"Youths, the future of Nigeria, are the worst affected. In some
zones, HIV prevalence in the 20-24 age group is almost 10
percent," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings of the survey, Health Minister Tim
Menakaya said that "the essence of this report is not just to
paint a picture of the extent of the AIDS problem but to mobilize
all sectors of the country -- education, health, information,
economy and security -- into action aimed at presenting a united
front in the battle against AIDS."

<HEADLINE> Russian FSB Gives Details of Seizing Raduyev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federal Security Service (
FSB) director Nikolai Patrushev on Monday revealed some details of
capturing Chechen rebel commander Salman Raduyev, one of Russia's
most wanted men for his role in two Chechen wars.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev was seized in a special operation conducted by the FSB
Sunday morning in the village of Novogroznensky in southern
Chechnya, said Patrushev.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no loss of life among the FSB servicemen
participating in the operation. Now Raduyev and his three
companions have been brought to Moscow and are being held at the
Lefortovo prison of the FSB.
</P>
<P>
Patrushev said the operation was thoroughly prepared with no
weapons fired, adding that "it took some time to prepare the
operation, considering the fact that up to 10,000 men were at
different periods under the command of Raduyev. He had some 100
bodyguards."
</P>
<P>
"Raduyev did not offer any resistance during the arrest. At
first he was in a shock and kept silent," said the FSB head.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that "Raduyev's guards knew nothing about the
operation. Had we not announced it today, they would have known
nothing about it even now."
</P>
<P>
The other three arrested men included the head of Raduyev's
personal guard service and a financier, who provided funds to
Raduyev's rebel groups and other bandits, Patrushev said.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev, used to be in charge of up to 10,000 militants, is Now
under question by the Russian law enforcement servicemen, said
Patrushev.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Raduyev's arrest was not a final operation of
FSB for the capture of Chechen warlords. "Other such operations
should be prepared most perfectly," he said, vowing to capture all
the other rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev, born in 1967, was seized during the tragic incident of
January 9-18, 1996, when Chechen terrorists attacked a city
hospital in Kyzlyar, Dagestan, in demand of a ceasefire in
Chechnya, killing around 100 servicemen and civilians.
</P>
<P>
After he was released from Kyzlyar, Raduyev was blockaded in
the border village of Pervomaiskoye, which Russian troops failed
to capture.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev was a leader of the Young Communist League while
studying in a vocational training school, and worked for the
Chechen-Ingush Young Communist League Committee.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev was a strong supporter of former Chechen President
Dzhokhar Dudayev, who was killed by a Russian mobile-phone-
searching missile strike during the first Chechen war in the early
1990s. He married Dudayev's daughter.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev was put in charge of the Gudermes district in June 1992
and appointed to command "the sixth brigade of the Chechen armed
forces" since November 1992.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, he has been the commander of the so-called "
General Dudayev's Army", one of the major illegal Chechen armed
units. Interpol has announced an international search for Raduyev.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev, who has repeated his intention to wage an
irreconcilable struggle against Russia by using terrorist methods,
has survived at least four assassination attempts and suffered
serious wounds including a head injury.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Prosecutor General's Office on Monday said it will
charge Raduyev of bandit activities and terrorism crimes,
including organizing terrorist blasts.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Raduyev will face up to 20 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Writer's Wife Visits Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The wife of renowned Argentine
writer Jorge Luis Borges today visited Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, to promote sales of a collection of
works by her husband.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, works by Borges (1899-1986) had a far-reaching
influence on European and American literature. His writings were
introduced to China in the early 1980s, winning acclaim from
Chinese readers.
</P>
<P>
The author's wife, Maria Kodama, signed her name on Borges'
books for Chinese readers at the city's largest bookstore, Bell
Tower.
</P>
<P>
She also posed for a photograph with two college students
majoring in computer science at Xi'an Jiaotong University and told
them with a smile, "You'll benefit from the works of Borges."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Kodama visited the terra-cotta warriors dating
back to the time of Qinshihuang, China's first emperor, who ruled
China from B.C. 221 to B.C. 206.
</P>
<P>
Kodama said her husband, who was interested in Chinese history
and culture, had longed to visit the terra-cotta warriors, one of
the wonders of the world.
</P>
<P>
Kodama arrived here yesterday evening from Beijing. She is
visiting China at the invitation of the Zhejiang Literature and
Art Publishing House, which published the Complete Works of Borges
in Chinese. It is comprised of five volumes of poems, short
stories and prose.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 linguisticians translated the 2.2-million-word
collection from Spanish into Chinese.

<HEADLINE> China to Strike at Fake Products with Iron Fist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- In view of the unceasing
production and sale of fake and shoddy products in China, the
State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision will strike out
against phony goods with an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Mingxian, deputy director of the bureau, said today that
the bureau will launch, according to law, crackdowns on the making
and selling of shoddy products in some key areas in the coming
three years to eliminate the goods which are endangering the
national economy and people's livelihood and safety.
</P>
<P>
Those markets selling fake products will be brought under
control, and the rampant producing and selling of inferior goods
by criminal gangs should be basically checked within three years,
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, over 224,600 cases involving
producing and selling fake products, including 4,528 serious cases,
were investigated by the quality and technical supervision
departments across China last year.
</P>
<P>
Phony products worth 3.543 billion yuan (about 427 million U.S.
dollars) were seized last year. More than 8,200 production and
sales sites of fake products were shut down and 1,677 gangs
dealing in fake products were disbanded, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the diversified fake products are
distributed on a large scale. Last year, over 140,000 cartons of
fake cigarettes in 32 varieties, worth 11 million yuan, were
seized in Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi Province in north China.
</P>
<P>
The quality and technical supervision bureau of Jiamusi City in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province seized 660 tons of
inferior potash fertilizer in one case last year, which may
otherwise cause economic losses up to more than 1,300 hectares of
farmland.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the production and sale of fake products is
concentrated in certain regions. In 1999, about 100 small
fertilizer factories in Haizhou Prefecture, east China's Jiangsu
Province, were found making poor-quality fertilizer, with a total
annual output of 80,000 to 100,000 tons. The shoddy fertilizer was
sold to Heilongjiang, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning and other
regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu noted that currently the fake goods are mainly agricultural
production materials, construction materials, gas stoves,
household appliances and food, which threaten people's health and
safety.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty in striking out against fake products is
increased, for the criminals are sneaky, and some have even
resorted to violence to resist law enforcement," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics revealed more than 30 cases last year where quality
and technical supervision departments were prevented from carrying
out their law enforcement duty.
</P>
<P>
Recently, two officials from the Heilongjiang Provincial
Quality and Technical Supervision Bureau died in a fire, set by
criminals, when closing down an illegal oil refinery in Tailai
County of the province.
</P>
<P>
"Fake and shoddy products bring great harm to the country and
society," said Zhu, adding that to strengthen the strike on fraud
products is an important task facing the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only an economic issue, but also a serious social
and political issue. Indulging in fake and shoddy products will
make China weak," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the campaign to wipe out fake products, more
support will be given to producing high-quality goods. China also
plans to designate 100 streets that are free from shoddy and fake
products this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Underlines Agriculture, West Development, SOE Reform (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the large-scale development of the west is a gigantic
project, he noted, efforts should be made to comply with the new
situation in the growth of socialist market economy, objective
laws should be followed, and overall planning be implemented
steadily and stage by stage, he added. The central government will
allocate proper input while urging developed eastern areas to aid
and assist the west through various forms.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, he noted, is that the west should deepen
reforms, open itself wider and adopt new mechanism and methods to
attract qualified professionals, funds and technology from
elsewhere in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the western areas should give full scope to its own
advantages, strengthen the infrastructure construction, develop
science, technology and education, and step up environmental
protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang also spell out his views on the retooling
of state-owned enterprises which, he stressed, is the core of the
entire economic restructuring and represents the most vital job
for the country in 2000, the last year for the three-year
government program to bring the majority of loss-making firms out
of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang listed the major tasks for the state sector as
follow:
</P>
<P>
-- To accelerate the establishment of modern corporate system
and transform the managerial mechanism of these firms;
</P>
<P>
-- To make strategic readjustment of the layout of the state
economy and regroup state-owned enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- To advance technological and innovation progress of state-
owned enterprises, and;
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen the building of leadership for state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, President Jiang called for appropriately handling the
relations the retooling and development of enterprises as well as
relations between reform, development and stability in general.
Moreover, he asked old mining and defense departments to pay
special attention to the life of their workers, so as to maintain
social stability.

<P>
It must be clear that the harvests and sufficient grain
supplies do not necessarily mean that the agricultural base has
been consolidated, he said.
</P>
<P>
There have been no fundamental changes in farming conditions in
quite a few localities, he said, adding that the country's
agricultural sector has not freed itself from dependence on the
nature. Once there are severe calamities, serious problems may
arise.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture will remain a hard issue for China, at least for
dozens of years to come, Jiang said. He pointed out that the
country should strategically readjust its agricultural structure
as China's agriculture enters a new period of development.
</P>
<P>
Only by improving and optimizing the structure of agriculture
can China further enhance the productivity, competitiveness and
efficiency of its farming sector, and increase the farmers' income,
Jiang said. This is an arduous task which calls for redoubled
efforts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Top priority must be given to agriculture in developing the
national economy, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen agriculture, the president said, efforts must be
made unremittingly to accelerate construction of agricultural
infrastructures with focus on irrigation networks and ecological
improvement with priority on afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must also be made to protect arable land and the
farmers' enthusiasm and promote the advancement of agricultural
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to deputies from northwestern Gansu Province, Jiang
said the government-initiated strategy to develop the vast western
areas is of great importance to China.

Speaking at plenary meetings of two delegations to the on-going
Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), Jiang
said the strategic restructuring in agriculture is a central task
of agricultural development in the new stage; a comprehensive plan
must be mapped out to promote development of the western region;
concerted efforts must be made to achieve the three-year goal of
lifting most loss-making SOEs out of difficulties by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Meeting deputies from northeastern Jilin Province, the
president said bumper harvests during the past five years and
sufficient grain supplies prove that China has remarkably boosted
its comprehensive agricultural production capacity and enabled the
people to have enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
This is "a marvelous achievement" the Chinese people have
dreamed of for hundreds of years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the problems that came along with the bumper
harvests, including difficulties for farmers to sell grain,
declining prices of farm produces, and a slow rise in farmers'
income, are the ones occurring in the country's development
process and on the way towards a well-off nation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Asks for Advanced U.S. Spy Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel is asking for direct
access to advanced U.S. spy technology as a substitute for Israel's
maintaining an early warning station on the Golan Heights after its
withdrawal from the plateau.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Military Intelligence head Amos Malka visited
Washington last week to discuss with his counterparts in the United
States the possibility of Israel's acquiring long-range early
warning technology for intelligence gathering, the Ha'aretz daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a diplomatic source in Jerusalem as saying
that the Americans held such technologies, which could provide
necessary warning without having to maintain an early warning
station in the field.
</P>
<P>
The military intelligence are gathering information to submit a
professional opinion summary to Prime Minster Ehud Barak, which
will express the hope that the access to U.S. technology should be
without any guidelines and limitations during crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington views the opening up of those sensitive
technologies as a part of the overall peace package to Israel once
it reaches a final peace agreement with Syria. Thus, the Americans
don't want to reply Israel's demands at this time.
</P>
<P>
In past negotiations with Syria, Israel demanded the control of
an early warning station on the Mount Hermon for at least 10 years
as a security arrangement measure in exchange for Israel's pledge
to pullout from the Golan, which it occupied in the 1967 Middle
East War.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria had been ruling out any possibility of such an
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, an Israeli government source
reportedly said that Israel will offer Syria an exchange of
territory as the basis for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, Israel would retain a narrow strip of
land on the northeastern bank of Lake Kineret, or Sea of Galilee,
and in return the Syrians would get Hamat Gader, a Palestinian Arab
villages east of the lake.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 1967 Middle East War, Syria governed these
areas on the lake bank. Israel hopes to adjust the borderlines to
allow it hold all the lake areas to secure its water and security
needs.
</P>
<P>
Syria, though, insists that Israel should fully withdraw to the
June 4, 1967, lines as the precondition for the resumption of talks
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which resumed last December after a 45-month break,
hit a snag again earlier this year only after two rounds of talks
due to differences over Israeli troop withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.

TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Several people were injured in
explosions on Monday noon near the Mellat Park in northern Tehran,
Iran's state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
Several explosions occurred around 1330 local time (1000 GMT) in
an area close to the television center and a military headquarters,
the television said, giving no more details.
</P>

The explosions came one day after Saeed Hajjarian, a reformist
advisor to Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was injured
in a shooting by unidentified gunmen in front of the Tehran
Municipal Council.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a member of the Tehran Municipal Council and the
managing director of the reformist Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning)

Hajjarian, who was former deputy intelligence minister, is a
member of the central council of the reformist Islamic Iran
Participation Front (IIPF) led by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the
younger brother of President Khatami.
</P>

<P>
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Two people were wounded, one
seriously in the leg and the other slightly in the face, after the
military opposition Mujahedin fired mortar shells into northern
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded near the Mellat Park in the north of the
capital city Monday noon was a woman, a police official at the
scene told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that perpetrators fired six 60mm mortar shells around
13:30 local time (1000 GMT) near the television center and a
headquarters of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
Four shells fell into a residential area in the region, and more
than 10 vehicles were damaged in the explosions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based Mujahedin, branded as a terrorist group by
Tehran, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier the
state-run television accused "counter-revolutionaries" of being
behind the explosions.
</P>
<P>
The explosions came one day after Saeed Hajjarian, a reformist
advisor to Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was injured
in a shooting by unidentified gunmen in front of the Tehran
Municipal Council. The gunmen are still at large.

<P>
The Mujahedin Khalq Organization had been an active political
and military group fighting against former shah's regime, but was
declared illegal in 1981 following sharp wranglings with the ruling
clergy.  During the past decades, Mujahedin launched series of
attacks on Iranian interests inside and outside the country. Iran
responded with air raids on the organization's bases near Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Protect Forest Against Climate Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania should take
deliberate measures to conserve natural forests in order to stem
the impact of global warming, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Mwakifwamba, a researcher with the Dar es Salaam-based
Center for Energy, Environment, Science and Technology, warned
that most of the forests across Tanzania will become drier due to
higher temperature, increasing the possibilities of fire
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
Other impacts include disappearance of forests from some areas
and changes in the distribution of plant species and vegetation
types that millions of people depend for daily use.
</P>
<P>
Mwakifwamba said efforts should be made to conserve the
remaining natural forests and woodlands and promote a national
reafforestation program.
</P>
<P>
Official data indicate Tanzania has an estimated 44.5 million
hectares of forests and woodlands cover.
</P>
<P>
Most bare lands in Tanzania today were covered with thick
evergreen forests between 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Increasing population pressure, felling of wood for charcoal,
fires and development of industries like tobacco have made the
country lose 300,000 to 400,000 hectares of forests a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Suzhou Industrial Park in
Jiangsu province, a joint development project between the
governments of China and Singapore, has been making major headway
since construction began six years ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the park had approved the
establishment of 174 overseas-funded enterprises, including 148
industrial enterprises, 86 of which are now in operation.
</P>
<P>
By 1999 the park had introduced 6.68 billion US dollars of
contractual overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the overseas-funded enterprises in the park are
involved in hi-tech areas like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and
fine machinery.
</P>
<P>
The operation of a customs office in the park together with
last year's establishment of an administration for entry-exit
inspection and quarantine have further improved the local
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The park is situated in eastern Suzhou. Infrastructure
construction on the first-phase eight-sq-km developed land in the
park has been completed. In the next three years, an additional
two square kilometers of land will be developed for the project.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The China Pacific Insurance
Company today pledged to provide 155 million yuan in personal
accident insurance to 738 non-local cadres and people who work in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Each of them will get an insurance policy valued at 210,000
yuan, according to an agreement signed today between the insurance
company, with headquarters in Shanghai, and the Xinjiang regional
government.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has branches in 40 major cities throughout
the country, also pledged to provide emergency aid for these non-
local people working in Xinjiang within the term of insurance
should they be in accidents anywhere in China.
</P>
<P>
This move is seen by observers as an echo from the financial
and insurance circles to the national campaign of developing the
country's western region, which will help encourage personnel in
the coastal areas to go to work in the vast west.

longest rivers, and Taihu Lake, is just part of the environmental
monitoring network under construction here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent national environmental protection meeting,
Xie said 30 automatic data collection stations will be set up to
register water quality at specific spots in the country's major
rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Many leading cities in China already have set up an air
monitoring system to collect information on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
This system is available in 18 of the 47 cities listed by the
SEPA for environmental protection review, enabling cities like
Beijing and Shanghai to issue daily reports on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China will step up its efforts this year to form a
unified national ecological monitoring network, incorporating the
Rapid Reaction Center at the State Nuclear Safety Administration
and part of its monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
Procurement and installation of satellite communications
facilities for SEPA's environmental information center and
information centers for 60 key cities in China is also expected to
happen this year, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
"A state-of-the-art environmental monitoring and processing
network will enable both the policy-makers and the general public
to be better informed of the environmental situation at local or
national levels in China, and help raise public awareness about
environmental protection," the director said.
</P>
<P>
The automatic monitoring system will outsmart the practice of
some plants to dodge unannounced inspections by environmental
protection officials by halting production during the day and
resuming it at night, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring machines, unlike the inspectors, are not off
duty at night," Xie noted.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Keep Adjustments of Border With Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unilateral border
adjustments along the international boundary with Lebanon will be
effectively preserved in the event of Israel's unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon, according to a pullout plan of the
Israel Defense Forces(IDF).
</P>
<P>
Under the plan prepared by the IDF's General Staff's Operation
Branch, Israel will, after pullout, leave several outposts just
across the international border in place and set up a new buffer
zone immediately to the north of the border.
</P>
<P>
The plan, codenamed Morning Twilight, was presented to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the IDF will remove at least ten outposts deep
inside the security zone into Israel in any event, but leave
another eight outposts a few hundred meters from the border in
place, according the local daily Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised to withdraw Israeli troops from the security zone
by July this year and on March 5, the cabinet endorsed the
forthcoming withdrawal, with or without a peace agreement with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The border adjustments, which the IDF implemented for years,
have been aimed at overcoming the topographical inferiority of
Israel's border settlements, which were vulnerable to attacks from
inside the security zone, said the plan.
</P>
<P>
A previous pullout plan, also prepared by the IDF and named as
New Horizon, called for dismantlement of all IDF outposts inside
the security zone and the restoration of the border fence to its
original locations.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, with the IDF preparing for a possible withdrawal
without a peace agreement with Syria, the alternative entails
leaving the outposts just across the international border in place.
</P>
<P>
The buffer zone, about 500 meters wide immediately to the north
of the border, is meant to thwart effective use of light arms and
of light antitank missiles, according to the latest plan.
</P>
<P>
To control this buffer zone, the IDF will make use of advanced
observation and firing methods, and probably declare the buffer
area a no-entry zone.
</P>
<P>
If negotiations with Syria are not resumed by May, the IDF,
under the plan, will begin preparations for a unilateral pullout
at the government's instructions.

<HEADLINE> Pak GDP Projected to Increase by 4.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP is projected to increase by 4.5 percent during the
current fiscal calendar with upbeat performance in agriculture and
manufacturing sectors, according to a report released on Monday by
the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is estimated to grow by 4.3 percent during 1999-
2000 following bumper cotton and rice crops and bright indications
of good wheat crop," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the fiscal deficit of the current fiscal year,
which was targeted at 3.5 percent of GDP, is now likely to be
around 4.0 percent to 4.3 percent of GDP in view of the current
difficult economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The report said the exports, which remained stagnant around 8
billion U.S. dollars over the last three years, are projected to
be 8.5 billion dollars in 1999-2000, 9.3 percent higher than the
last year's 7.779 billion dollars. During the first seven months
of the current fiscal calendar, exports amounted to 4,740.4
million dollars which is 8.6 percent higher than last year's
exports of 4,366.4 million dollars in the similar period. The rise
in exports is attributed to the higher exports of primary
commodities (9.7 percent), textile manufactures (10.5 percent) and
other manufactures (11.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the imports are projected to surge by 8.7 percent (
10,254 million dollars) in 1999-2000 over the level of 9,432
million dollars of the last year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Holds Regional Seminar on Juvenile Delinquents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A Regional Seminar on Assessment
and Classification of Adult Offenders and Juvenile Delinquents was
opened here Monday by the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
The seminar, part of an ESCAP project, is aimed at providing a
forum for an exchange of information, views and experiences,
identifying major issues related to the assessment and
classification of offenders and recommending policy measures to
address the issues at the national and regional levels, according
to an ESCAP press release.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, non-governmental organizations and
academics from 10 Asia-Pacific countries as well as
representatives from the U.N. agencies and institutions concerned
took part in the three-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is expected to strengthen integrated policies and
programs for crime and juvenile delinquency prevention and
treatment, with emphasis on the assessment and classification of
incarcerated criminal offenders and juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
Crime and juvenile delinquency are serious social issues in
Asia and the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty, rising unemployment, rapid and unplanned urbanization
and family breakdown provide an environment conducive to juvenile
delinquency and criminal behavior," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will generate a better understanding and social
reintegration of the young persons who come into conflict with the
law in the Asia-Pacific region and will contribute to preventing
the growth and spread of crime and juvenile delinquency, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
At present, in the field of crime prevention and criminal
justice administration, the assessment and classification of
criminal offenders, adult and juvenile, prior to their treatment,
is widely seen as a key to the effective management of the whole
crime prevention and criminal justice system.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military: Chechen Commander Raduyev Captured, Gelayev Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military Monday
confirmed that Chechen rebel commander Salman Raduyev was captured
and brought to Moscow, but another key warlord Ruslan Gelayev has
escaped out of federal grip.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev, one of Russia's most wanted men for his role in two
Chechen wars, was seized in a special operation conducted by the
Federal Security Service (FSB) on Sunday morning in the village of
Novogroznensky, said Nikolai Patrushev, director of the FSB.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that there was no loss of life among the FSB
servicemen participating in the operation and there was no
shooting during the action.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian news agencies reported that Raduyev's staff
said the leading Chechen warlord had been killed in fighting last
month and buried in an undisclosed location in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the criminal procedure code, Raduyev was
arrested, brought to Moscow and put into an investigation prison,
said Russian acting President Vladimir Putin at a cabinet meeting
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that Raduyev is now being
held at the Lefortovo prison of the FSB in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chechen field commander Ruslan Gelayev has escaped
from the embattled village of Komsomolskoye to southern mountains,
said Valery Gerasimov, acting commander of the Central Grouping of
the Russia's federal forces in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
He said Gelayev's escape was confirmed by a tapped radio
exchange of rebels, whose major force is trapped in Komsomolskoye
in the Urusp-Martan district and has been fighting federal troops
for over a week.
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said fierce fighting in Komsomolskoye had moved from
its central part to the southeastern edge earlier in the day.

<P>
Mayor Liu Dianli said at a news briefing here today that
visitors from all over the world will attend the event April 15-25,
and that this will be the best since the first one in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day fair is themed "Spurring Domestic Demand and
Developing Tourism," and focuses on trade and technical exchanges,
said Dong Pinghai, deputy secretary-general of the city government.
</P>
<P>
"The peony fair has helped the city improve investment
environment and speed up opening up," said Dong. Last year, China
operated 64 special trains from its major cities to Luoyang,
carrying crowds of tourists.
</P>
<P>
This year, 100 trains will be available, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the country's campaign to develop the west, the
city will do more to revive flagging State-owned enterprises and
boost economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city will also host an economic and trade fair during the
peony fair. The city plans to invest 44.6 billion yuan this year
on nearly 60 key projects in the fields of infrastructure, water-
conservancy, agriculture, forestry, technology, transportation and
energy, Dong added.
</P>
<P>
A number of other activities will be held in conjunction with
the flower show, such as art performances, a relics exhibition, a
photo contest and a lantern festival.
</P>
<P>
The peony has been a favorite flower in China for more than 1,
500 years, but the Luoyang variety is the best known. The city is
more than 5,000 years old, and its tradition of enjoying flowers
goes back to the Sui Dynasty (581-618).
</P>
<P>
The city has had over 35.6 million visitors from all parts of
the country and overseas for its previous 17 fairs. Deals signed
at the fairs were worth some 17.2 billion yuan (2 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Luoyang peonies are exported to over 20 countries and regions
worldwide.

<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom) :
</P>

Telephone tapping without the permission of prosecutor or judge
will be punished. Legal basics in this respect will be concluded
soon."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National) :
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey will be the biggest exporter of water in the world by
its Manavgat project which came to its last stage and will be
handed over by the contractor after the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Calls for Direct Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said that European Union membership for Cyprus and Turkey will help
in reaching a resolution to the Cyprus issue, calling for direct
talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks in an interview with the Turkish Daily
News, which was printed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cyprus's and Turkey's accession of the EU will
promote the settlement of the Cyprus issue as both Turkish and
Greek Cypriots will feel more secure.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since Turkey sent troops to
the northern third of the island in 1974 after a short-lived coup
by Greek Cypriots supporting a union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway state in the north in
1983, only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
International efforts to reunited the island have made no
tangible achievements due to Turkish Cypriots' insistence that no
direct talks with Greek Cypriots will take place before their
breakaway state is recognized.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held two rounds of indirect talks under the
auspices of the United Nations and a third round is expected to be
held in May.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that only by holding direct talks can it be seen
whether he and Turkish Cypriots leader Rauf Denktash have the
intention of resolving the conflict over the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that it is possible to solve the Cyprus
problem," Clerides said, stressing that Turkish and Greek support
for such a drive is also required.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the Cyprus issue has bedeviled relations
between Turkey and Greece for 25 years. The two countries have been
at odds over Aegean Sea for a long time as well.
</P>
<P>
It is believed, however, that the warming of Turco-Greek ties
that began last year after both countries suffered earthquakes and
rushed to aid each other will be helpful to resolving these
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Despite earlier reports that he had told Western diplomats that
he will not object to signing a state-to-state deal with Turkish
Cypriots, Clerides said that "we can't have two states first and
then create a new state."

<HEADLINE> China Taps Potential for Hydropower Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China expects to add an annual
installed hydropower capacity of 5 million kw, on average, between
2000 and 2010, to usher in a booming decade of hydropower
development.
</P>
<P>
China will develop a total hydropower capacity of 70 million kw
by the end of this year, and by 2010 the figure will rise to 125
million kw, or one third of the country's exploitable hydropower
resources, said Jiang Shaojun, director in charge of the strategic
studies and planning under the State Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China is among the countries in the
world that have the richest hydropower resources, with exploitable
water energy resources estimated at 376 million kw.
</P>
<P>
However, much still needs to be done to exploit these enormous
hydropower resources, he said, adding that the country's total
hydropower generating capacity amounts for only 13.8 percent of
the exploitable potential, a figure lower than the world's average.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country's annual hydropower electricity output has
risen to 186.8 billion kwh, ranking third in the world in
hydropower production.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for China's Foreign Trade Expected to Be Better in 2,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The 3-percent foreign trade
growth rate China has set for this year is attainable, as the
situation involved in foreign trade both at home and overseas is
probably better than last year, said Shi Guangsheng, minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the sponsorship of the Press Center of
the ongoing 3rd Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), Minister Shi said demand on the world market has increased
and commodities' prices are on the rise, and economies in those
countries hit by the Asian financial crisis, in particular, have
embarked on a faster track of recovery, with exports and imports
also going up.
</P>
<P>
Sustained economic growth and the expected 7-percent rise in
gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year guarantee a solid
foundation for China's foreign trade, the trade minister said,
adding that performance of state-owned enterprises has been
improving, with foreign-trade-related businesses gaining a
considerable competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic environment for foreign trade will be further
improved due to continuous efforts to implement the proactive
fiscal policy and expansion of domestic demand, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Shi also listed some factors affecting and restricting
China's foreign trade, pointing to some uncertainties in the field,
aggravated trade protectionism, still delicate and fragile basis
for economic growth in the Asian countries hit by the financial
turmoil, un-optimized mix of China's exported-oriented products
and inadequate competitiveness on the world market.
</P>
<P>
China ranked the ninth in the world in term of its total export
and import volume in 1999, as against 11th in 1998, according to
statistics available from the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
And the country's total foreign trade volume in the January-
February period of 2000 reached 60.26 billion U.S. dollars, up 47.
1 percent over the same period of last year. But Shi said that the
drastic increase is largely attributable to the decline during the
same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Tightened Supervision to Promote Judicial Honesty: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator called for
efforts to intensify supervision over governments, courts and
procuratorates at all levels in a bid to guarantee lawful
administration and judicial honesty.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (CPC), in session here since early
March, made the call here today when attending group discussions
of Shandong and Henan deputies to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
People's congresses at all levels must exercise their right of
supervision under the leadership of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), but they must not actually exercise judicial and
prosecuting powers, he said.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies should play an active role in collecting
suggestions for and complaints about governments,courts and
procuratorates at all levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic election for villagers' committees is a good form
for grassroots democratic building, Li said, calling for more
efforts to safeguard just elections and open village affairs, and
encourage villagers to run their own affairs according to law.
</P>
<P>
"Communities in urban areas will play an increasingly important
role with further economic and social development and reform. And
the NPC Standing Committee will organize inspections on
implentation of the organic law concerning neighborhood committees
in urban areas, in order that these grassroots organizations can
play their role to the most in reform, development and stability,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged localities to seize opportunities available at a time
when the central government initiated the strategy to develop the
western areas, map out feasible development strategies and
increase efforts to promote economic growth in less developed
areas.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Put 14 Suspected Terrorists on Public Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen suspected terrorists will
be put on public trial within the coming two weeks after police
foiled their plans to sabotage new millenium celebrations in the
kingdom, the semiofficial Jordan Times Reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects have been under custody since last December, when
they were arrested after entering Jordan on forged passports in a
bid to launch attacks on American and Israeli targets in the
kingdom during the new year period, police said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian State Security Court Prosecutor Mahmoud Obeidat
will prepare the final bill and formally charge the defendants on
11 counts during a public trial, including illegal possession of
arms and explosives.
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects, including 12 Jordanians, one Iraqi and
one Algerian, were believed to be linked to Afghanistan-based
Saudi-expelled billionaire Osama Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden had been wanted by the United States for allegedly
masterminding bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that
claimed dozens of lives in 1998.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, some of the suspects may be hanged though no
terrorist attacks were reported during the new millenium period as
police had beefed up securities across the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has taken peace as a strategic option
in dealing with regional and international affairs after it signed
a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second Arab country after
Egypt to seal such a treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Amman said it would not tolerate any terrorism attempts or
conspiracies on its soil, both against its own security and
stability or against the interests of any other countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Planes Bombs Hezbollah's Outpost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli planes bombed Hezbollah's
outposts in south Lebanon Monday morning hot on the heels of the
guerrilla group's attacks on Israeli positions, a security source
said.
</P>
<P>
The security source said that two Israeli planes launched two
missiles at 07:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Hezbollah outposts near the
Hadasha village that is located in the middle part of the Israeli
occupied security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli planes made the second sortie shortly and fired two more
missiles on the region. But there were no immediate reports of
casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment came soon after Hezbollah claimed responsibility
for attacks on positions of Israeli troops and their allied South
Lebanon Army earlier in the day in Shagefu on the edge of the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Fire tradings between Israeli occupation troops and Hezbollah
have escalated since the start of this year following the breakdown
of peace talks between Israel and Lebanon's powerbroker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Though Israel has decided to bring its troops home by July,
ending a 18-year occupation of south Lebanon, Syrian- and Iranian-
backed Hezbollah never slacked in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking the full return of the Golan Height
Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, insists on the simultaneity
in solving the Syria and Lebanon issues.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad reportedly sent out word that
he believes a peace treaty with Israel will be signed, and the only
question is when.
</P>
<P>
The message was relayed by Rashid Fahim, a special messenger, to
Spehardi Chief Rabbi Eliahu Bakshi-Doron at a wedding in New York
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Bakshi-Doron said in a telephone interview that the Syrian envoy
asked to relay the message that they are interested in peace, real
peace and Assad is looking to making peace.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The papal request for forgiveness published Sunday has been
met with criticism and disappointment from Jewish and Israeli
quarters, for its failure to make specific mention of the Holocaust
or the sins of Church as an organized body.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Pope John Paul II asked for God's forgiveness for the
sins of Roman Catholic over the ages, including those against Jews,
women and minorities, in a Day of Pardon Mass at St. Peter's
Basilica at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Although the Pope did indeed allude to the Inquisition, there
was no specific mention of it or other major historical events such
as the Crusades or the Holocaust, in which the Church can be said
to have played at least a passive role in oppressing Jews.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The future of Jerusalem was at the center of Sunday's cabinet
meeting, with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak stressing that
anyone who hints that the government intends to divide the city is
gravely misleading the public.
</P>
<P>
Barak indicated that words spoken by his top aide Danny Yatom
last week that certain lands in the Jerusalem vicinity would
eventually be transferred to the Palestinians as part of a
permanent agreement had been misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres said
Sunday that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu never ruled
out the idea that Abu Dis, a Palestinian town just outside
Jerusalem, would become the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Police investigators Sunday questioned Transportation
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai's driver and his office administrator
for almost seven hours on suspicion that they tried to dissuade the
woman who accused Mordechai of sexual assault from going to the
police.
</P>
<P>
If Mordechai asked the two to approach the woman on his behalf,
then the charge of obstruction of justice could be added to those
of sexual assault and sexual harassment. Obstruction is a much more
serious charge than sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a ministry worker complained to the police that
Mordechai sexually assaulted her on several occasions at his Tel
Aviv office.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Establish Human Right Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Indonesia would
establish a human right court within three months after the bill
is passed by House of Representatives (DPR), a senior official
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If the deliberation of the draft of human right court bill
could be completed within three months from now on, so that the
human right court could be established soon after the validation
of the bill," Minister of Law and Legislation Yusril Ihza Mahendra
told reporters before attending a plenary session deliberating on
the draft of the country's human right court.
</P>
<P>
He also said that human right abuse cases would be brought to
justice after the court have been established.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia now has been underfire following an allegation of
human right abuse in East Timor before, during and after the
territory voted in favor of independence in a U.N.-sponsored
direct ballot in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra said that the court could try cases of human right
abuse which have took place before the validation of the bill.
</P>
<P>
"So that cases of human right abuse which have took place in
East Timor, Aceh and Irian Jaya as well as in other parts of the
country will be tried in this court," he added.

Last month, the National Commission on Human Right (Komnas HAM)
recommended at least 33 names, who were allegedly involved in
human right abuse in the breakaway province of East Timor in 1999,
including former Indonesian Military (TNI) Chief Gen. Wiranto.

NAIROBI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Burundi and Rwanda planned to
build direct railway link to Tanzania's Dar-es-Salaam port as an
alternative route to the sea, The East African weekly newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two land-locked countries now depend mainly on Kenya's
Mombasa Port for import and export through Uganda.

Burundi wants to extend the existing railway terminal at Rusumo
on the border with Tanzania to the Burundian capital Bujumbura and
other towns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwanda plans to link its capital Kigali to
Tanzania's Isaka terminal, a border point between the two
countries. The rail link from Isaka to Kigali will be about 500
kilometers and could cost more than three billion U.S. dollars.

and delays caused by the customs procedures in Mombasa, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the funds for the railway project have not been

<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebel commander Salman
Raduyev, one of Russia's most wanted men for his role in two
Chechen wars, was captured in a special operation on Sunday and
has been brought to Moscow, acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin said at a meeting with his deputies Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most odious bandit leaders. He is currently
in prison and that is where he belongs. I want to believe that it
is just the beginning," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian news agencies reported that Raduyev's staff
said the leading Chechen warlord had been killed in fighting last
month and buried in an undisclosed location in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev was in charge of the Chechen militants who took
hostages in Kyszlyar and the village of Pervomaiskoye in January
1996, Putin said, cited by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
These crimes resulted in the deaths of civilians, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Raduyev confessed to an attempt to kill Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze, he said. "The investigation and the court
will determine if it was bluff or if it is really so."
</P>
<P>
Raduyev's unit robbed railway trains, taking away 600,000 to
700,000 rubles (21,000 to 25,000 U.S. dollars) being transferred
to pay teachers' wages, and "extorted payment from several
villages near Gudermes," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Raduyev should take responsibility for explosions
in Armavir and Pyatigorsk railway stations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yao and Wang Raise Chinese Basketball's Sky Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shan Lei
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's basketball enters an era
of giant centers as Yao Ming and Wang Zhizhi clash each other for
the first time in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league
finals, which started on Sunday as Wang's Bayi Rockets beat Yao's
Shanghai Sharks 116-94 in the first outing of a best-of-five
series.
</P>
<P>
With most of other 10 teams in the CBA recruiting pivots from
the United States and Europe, the 19-year-old Yao, 2.25 meters (7-
5 feet), and Wang, 22, 2.15 meters (7-1 feet), still turned out as
the leading favorites in the CBA's Most Valuable Players' campaign
after both led their sides to the 1999-2000 CBA finals.
</P>
<P>
Yao debuted in the CBA at 16 and used only three seasons to
lift his team to their first CBA finals.
</P>
<P>
Yao scored 21 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in 45 minutes in
his first final game on Sunday in Shanghai. But his most
domination under the basket came from no statistics.
</P>
<P>
Midway into the tough first quarter, Yao narrowly missed an
astonishing powerful slam which never done by any Chinese center
when the 2.25-meter giant leaped off from 10 feet away for a
flying dunk over the 2.21 Wang. That would be a perfect in-your-
face jam but Yao's ball bounced off the back rim of the basket
into the courtside audience rows.
</P>
<P>
He also had three blocks, one on Wang's fade-away jumper, and
three assists in the first game of their best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
Yao's blocking power over the rim forced Wang, who was drafted
by Dallas Mavericks last summer but failed to make a trade away
from the Rockets, stood outside of the lane for the most of the
game.
</P>
<P>
Yao won the titles of rebounding, blocking and dunking in this
year's CBA regular season and undoubtedly he could be a prominent
challenge to Wang, who also came in the league at 16 and anchored
his team for all the five championships in as many years' history
of the CBA, China's first professional basketball league.
</P>
<P>
Yao is still young and his Shanghai Sharks are yet to match
with the balanced five-time defending champion Bayi Rockets, who
is targeting an another 3-0 sweep of the Finals when they host
game 2 and 3 at home in Ningbo of Zhejiang Province this week.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year old Wang underscored his status as the best current
center in Asia with a game-high 37 points, 14 boards and five
steals against Yao.
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Mavericks first pick-up in the 1999 NBA draft
displayed his all-around talents with experienced moves, better
footwork, middle range shootings and defense power, which gave his
team a comfortable 58-43 lead at the interval in Sunday's game one.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who could have been the first Asian hoopster to play in
the NBA, even snapped three 3-pointers out of seven attempts
behind the arc.
</P>
<P>
Most domestic media doubled their bets on Wang to win the Most
Valuable Player award this season after the first game.
</P>
<P>
With the 2000 Olympic Games in sight, Wang and Yao, jointly
nicknamed as "the Walking Great Wall", will team up to face the
NBA's Dream Team in their first group match in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese young centers have no fear to test their play with
those NBA stars and revive China's Olympic glory among the top-
eight from the Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Chinese Sturgeons Released into River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 artificially-
bred young Chinese sturgeons are being released into the Zhujiang
River in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
It's the first time China has put such a large number of young
Chinese sturgeons, measuring more than 20-30 centimeters, into the
river in the ongoing effort to protect the endangered migratory
species.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon is one of the oldest vertebrates in the
world and is called a "living fossil."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the province has put over 20,000
Chinese sturgeons into the river and taken effective measures to
crack down on illegal fishing.
</P>
<P>
To save the rare species, China has set up a large fish-
breeding center in Sansui City in Guangdong, and so far thousands
of young Chinese sturgeons from the base have been released into
rivers. Local fishermen have reported seeing some of the rare fish.
</P>
<P>
The fishery bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Guangdong provincial department of aquatic products are working
together on the project.

SHANGHAI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China has started to overhaul
the Shanghai-Nanjing railway, one of the busiest lines in the
country, to improve speed and transportation capacity of the
trains which travel on it.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to lay a 232.2-kilometer seamless steel railway
track, the longest in the country, between two economically
developed cities in east China, Shanghai and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The railway has been renovated several times to meet the
demands of transportation. On April 1, 1996, China's first fast-
speed trains were put into operation on this line.
</P>
<P>
The track will be laid at night and the project is expected to
be completed within the year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Railway Administration, which is in charge of the
project, had also renovated the Shanghai-Hangzhou line and others.

<HEADLINE> Top Supervisor Urges Confidence in Anti-Corruption Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Head of China's top supervisory
body Wei Jianxing urged here today for a good assessment of the
current anti-corruption situation and confidence in the success of
the anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
Wei, secretary of the Central Commission for Dicipline
Inspection under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China, made the call at a group discussion of Henan deputies to
the Ninth National People's Congress, in session here since March
5.
</P>
<P>
"A good evaluation of the current anti-corruption situation is
a prerequisite for correct policy-making and a basis for
confidence in the success of the anti-corruption drive," Wei
pointed out, adding that the CPC Central Committee's anti-
corruption guidelines, principles and policies should be first
evaluated as a decisive factor in assessing the current anti-
corruption situation.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that our decisions and measures for battling
corruption are correct and effective," he said. "They provide a
sound basis for us to have our own way of fighting corruption with
Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee has adhered to the general principle
of centering anti-corruption on economic development, adopted
strategic stage-by-stage planning in fighting corruption, improved
a supervisory system and strengthened education to check
corruption from its sources, and come up with a well-coordinated
anti-corruption system which calls for participation of the
general public, he said.
</P>
<P>
When evaluating the future trend of the anti-corruption drive,
Wei said that the focus of the campaign has been shifted to
checking corruption from its sources and that the campaign is
deepening and intensifying. While corruption has eased in some
areas due to effective anti-corruption work, the intensified drive
is also gradually exposing some deep-rooted problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei warned of the gravity and urgency for corruption
elimination, calling it "a long-term, complicated, and arduous
struggle".
</P>
<P>
"We should be cool-headed to see that we still face a grim
situation in fighting corruption: corruption is still not
effectively checked; the results we have achieved still do not
live up to the expectations of our people; and we still have
onerous and arduous tasks ahead," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the grim picture, Wei called for full confidence in
the future of fighting corruption in his speech, saying the
majority of Party officials are good and urging intensified anti-
corruption efforts to achieve new and greater results.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Genetically Modified Crops Lead to Reduced Export Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Because of overseas
resistance to genetically modified organism (GMO) crops, U.S.
farmers are losing overseas markets, the American Corn Growers
Association (ACGA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"American farmers are facing historically low prices because of
overproduction," the association said. "Yet U.S. grain exporters
continue to insist that GMOs be sold despite the desire by
overseas customers for non-GMO products."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of giving the customer what they want, the attitude
and arrogance of U.S. exporters and some domestic farm
organizations is forcing overseas buyers to turn their backs on U.
S. corn and soybeans."
</P>
<P>
In marketing year 1997-1998, according to ACGA, U.S. corn
exports to Europe stood at 2 million tons. But the figure dropped
to 137,000 tons during marketing year 1998-1999. Soybeans dropped
from 11 million tons in 1998 to 6 million tons last year. American
farmers have lost over 1 billion U.S. dollars in lost sales, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of accepting the fact that the customer is always
right and deserves to receive whatever they demand, supporters of
GMOs are costing American farmers important markets for our
surplus," ACGA said. "That puts downward pressure on corn prices."
</P>
<P>
The association said that whether the United States believes
the products to be safe or environmentally friendly is not the
issue. "The issue is what the foreign and domestic customers ask
for."
</P>
<P>
ACGA said that many of its members would like to have the
opportunity to plant GMOs in the future as part of their farming
options. But they will not grow a product they cannot sell because
of the uncertainty over marketability. GMO planted acres in the
United States will drop by 16 percent, according to a recent ACGA
survey.

greater authority to local governments in the country's western
areas to encourage a flow of direct foreign investment into the
areas, a top Chinese trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, noted that local development zones with tax exemption
for foreign investors set up in capitals of provinces and
autonomous regions in western China, can be turned into national
development zones with approval of the relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Unlike local development zones, the national development zones
guarantee still better and more preferable, consistent policies
for investors from overseas according to laws.
</P>
<P>
Shi made the remarks at a press conference sponsored by the on-
going Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also resort to five other measures
to encourage direct foreign investment in western China, he said,
and it is drafting a category of businesses using foreign funds in
the west, so as to channel flows of overseas investment into local
industries and projects with market potentials.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the categories of foreign-funded enterprises
being encouraged by the state, firms in western and central China
will enjoy 15-percent tax rate for three consecutive years after
the expiration of the preferential policies granted to them. If a
foreign businessman re-invests in another project in the west
with the money earned and his investment ratio exceeds 25 percent,
the project will receive the corresponding preferential treatment
as a foreign-funded project.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, foreign-funded firms in eastern China will be
allowed to take over under contract the operation of both Chinese
and foreign firms in the west.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will, in principle, allow the related
policies and projects concerning foreign investment to be
experimented in the western areas simultaneously as in the east,
Shi said, adding that the government will also set forth more
policies of encouraging foreign investment in the western areas
step by step.

<HEADLINE> China's Bilateral WTO Negotiations Enter Concluding Stage: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral negotiations between
China and members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have
entered the concluding stage with only 10 WTO members left for a
bilateral agreement, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi told a press conference held by the 3rd Session of the 9th
National People's Congress (NPC) that China has already reached
bilateral agreements with 27 WTO members. A total of 37 WTO
members have requested to hold bilateral talks with China.
</P>
<P>
"The process of China's entry into the WTO is being accelerated,
" Shi said. "Of the remaining 10 WTO members with which China is
to reach an agreement, most have concluded or almost concluded
negotiations with China, and are waiting for the signing of
agreements."
</P>
<P>
Pascal Lamy, trade commissioner of the European Union, will
come to Beijing in the week beginning March 27 and hold talks with
Shi to finalize a China-EU agreement, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"China pays great attention to the talks with the EU," he said.
"We hope that the two sides can in the coming round of talks
complete negotiations on the basis of equality, mutual
understanding and mutual accommodation, and reach an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, China and the EU held two rounds
of WTO talks in Brussels and Beijing respectively. Shi said those
talks have resulted in "important progress." There are now few
remaining issues to be resolved between the two, except what China
cannot promise to any WTO member.
</P>
<P>
China's bid to enter the WTO and its predecessor has lasted 14
years. It reached a bilateral agreement with the United States
last November, and since then with many other WTO members over the
past several months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has yet to vote on giving China a Permanent
Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status. Shi said that a PNTR without
any conditions is the basis and prerequisite for carrying out the
China-U.S. WTO agreement, the China-US agricultural agreement
included, and what the U.S. has promised.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. failed to do so, it would mean that it has lost a
huge market and given the chances to its competitors," Shi said. "
The U.S. and its companies will suffer the most."

<HEADLINE> Thais Urged to Donate to Save Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thais are urged Monday to
contribute to the well-being of elephants, the symbol of their
country, by donating just one baht (0.026 U.S. dollars) by
everyone.
</P>
<P>
As Monday is Elephant Preservation Day of Thailand, Alongkorn
Mahannop, a senior official of the Zoological Organization,
invites every Thai to donate one baht to governor of the
northeastern province of Surin, who has undertaken to make the
province a real home for the great animals.
</P>
<P>
Alongkorn was quoted by The Nation newspaper as saying that
Surin,long being viewed as home for elephants in Thailand, should
be rehabilitated and promoted as an elephant reservation.
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later Surin will be a place where various elephant-
related activities take place, he said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of a project to banish elephants from Bangkok.
The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) started its
crackdown on elephants roaming the streets of the capital last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Surin will be rehabilitated as a home
for elephants.
</P>
<P>
Alongkorn pointed out that the implementation of the plan
requires a lot of money because many plants have to be grown to
feed the giant mammals and mahouts will be hired to do the job.
</P>
<P>
However, if every Thai donates one baht to the project on
Elephant Preservation Day, about 65 million baht (1.73 million
dollars) will be available to carry out the plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
A report conducted by a Thai government agency said that there
are approximately 3,000 elephants in Thailand last year and that
their death rate has outstripped their birth rate.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 30 to 50 roaming elephants were injured in
accidents every month last year and that this figure had almost
doubled during the past two months.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian teenager Lleyton
Hewitt continued his strong start to the ATP Tour season on Sunday,
sweeping past fifth seed Tim Henman of Britain to capture the
Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic title in Scottsdale, Arizona,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Seeded sixth, Hewitt disposed of Henman 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) to
improve his ATP Tour-leading season record to 20-1. He claimed his
fifth career title after winning twice in his homeland in January.
His lone match loss this year came against Sweden's Magnus Norman
in the fourth round of the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of last season, Hewitt has compiled the third-
best record in the ATP Tour at 64-19, trailing only Andre Agassi
and Pete Sampras of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Australian claimed the 46,000 U.S. dollars
winner's check.
</P>
<P>
Henman, 25, had not dropped a set before today's defeat. He
fell short of a fifth career title and remained winless since
Basel, Switzerland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Henman also was a finalist in Rotterdam last month. His 2000
record fell to 14-6.

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Davenport, Serena Williams Advance at Indian Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Seven of the top eight seeds
advanced to the third round of the two millions U.S. dollars
Tennis Masters Series of Indian Wells Sunday in California, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Americans Lindsay
Davenport and Serena Williams headed the list of second-round
winners, but American Jennifer Capriati suffered a disappointing
setback in her attempt to climb back into the top 10 in the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
Hingis needed just over an hour to dispose of American Amy
Frazier 6-3, 6-3, while Davenport crushed Irina Sirlea of Romania
6-0, 6-1 in 39 minutes. Williams seeded third, had a tougher time
as she opened defense of her title by struggling past childhood
friend and 1999 Wimbledon semifinalist Alexandra Stevenson 7-5, 3-
6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The 12th-seeded Capriati, who reached the Australian Open
semifinals in January, suffered a 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 loss to Cara Black
of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Hingis leads Davenport by only 373 points in the latest WTA
Tour rankings and it could have been even less had Davenport won
their championship match at last week's State Farm Women's Classic
in Scottsdale, Arizona. However, that clash never took place as
heavy rain Sunday and Monday in the area canceled the match.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss teenager's third-round opponent will be Japan's Ai
Sugiyama, who rallied past Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus 3-6, 6-
4, 6-3. also on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In other second-round action, fourth seed Nathalie Tauziat of
France downed countrywoman Anne-Gaelle Sidot 6-2, 6-4, fifth seed
Mary Pierce of France romped past Sonya Jeyaseelan of Canada 6-1,
6-3; and sixth seed Conchita Martinez of Spain dispatched
Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Anna Kournikova of Russia, a semifinalist in her
last two events, began her bid for her first singles title by
beating Denisa Chladkova of the Czech Republic 7-5, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Also, ninth seed Julie Halard-Decugis of France got past
Angeles Montolio of Spain 2-6, 6-2, 6-2; No. 11 Sandrine Testud, a
semifinalist last year, held off Sarah Pitkowski 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 in
an all-French battle.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Go Up First Time in 22 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer prices, which
has been declining for a consecutive 22 months since 1998,
reported a year-on-year 0.7 percent growth in February this year.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly half of the provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions still registered a price drop, mainly in
northeastern and northwestern regions, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the bureau attributed the growth to sharp
increase in prices of fresh vegetables and services during the
month, as the nation celebrated its traditional holiday -- the
Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Prices of grains, meat, and aquatic products as well as most of
the prices of industrial products remained lower than those of the
February of last year.
</P>
<P>
The consumer prices of last January reported a stronger
increase of 1.9 percent as a result of the higher school fees in
the new semester and the exorbitant food prices during the lunar
new year.

<HEADLINE> Defense Cooperation to Figure During Clinton's Visit to Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The issue of defense cooperation
between Dhaka and Washington will figure prominently during
President Bill Clinton's visit to Bangladesh on March 20, the
Daily Star disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report on Humanitarian Assistance Need Assessment (HANA)
and the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which Dhaka had
rejected earlier,will also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
HANA and SOFA, proposed by the United States, will provide
legal cover for the movement of U.S. armed force personnel and
military hardware and supplies to Bangladesh in times of
emergencies,particularly during relief operations after natural
disasters. If the agreements are signed, Bangladesh would be the
first country in South Asia to have access to U.S. defense support
services which are seen as very useful for meeting the country's
need during an emergency situation.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star quoted reliable sources as saying that
discussions between Clinton and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will
also focus on training programs for the Bangladesh military and
joint military exercises between the two countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Murder Cases Drop to 10-Year Low in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing Philippine National Police crime statistics, the
newspaper said last year's murder figures marked a big drop of 3,
588 cases or 40 percent since 1990 when a total of 9,291 murders
were reported.
</P>
<P>
The figure was also down by 3.5 percent compared to the 5,913
murders reported in 1998, the press report added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior lawmaker wanted Congress to find out
whether or not the death penalty had something to do with the
welcome news.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker Erico Aumentado was quoted as saying: "It is
possible that capital punishment helped sustain the decline in
murder cases over the last decade."
</P>
<P>
Aumentado pointed out that the biggest year-on-year drop in
murder cases -- 18.5 percent -- was in 1994, when there were 6,322
murders reported compared to 7,758 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was January 1994 that the Death Penalty Law took effect in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Initiate Bilateral Negotiations  with SAARC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jalil said his ministry has taken a decision to start
negotiations with the nations comprising the South Asian
Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in order to sign
separate accords on free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
"For the interest of our trade, we will have to initiate
discussions with these countries at the bilateral level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the governments of the seven-member SAARC nations had
agreed on principle to launch the South Asian Free Trade Agreement
(SAFTA), but there has so far been no progress in this regard due
to various complications.
</P>
<P>
India and Sri Lanka, two members of the SAARC, had already
signed a bilateral free trade agreement, which prompted
Bangladeshi authorities to go for similar arrangements with the
South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister said he had already held discussions with
India, Sri Lanka and other countries on the possibility of signing
similar free trade arrangements with these nations.

With 100 percent of the votes counted, Aznar's party got nearly
45 percent and won 183 seats in the 350-member Congress of
Deputies, up from 156 in the last legislature, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Spain has a population of about 39 million and 34 million

The results were a surprise as pre-election polls had given
Aznar around 170 seats.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, a 47-year-old former tax inspector, sought re-election
to another four-year term based on the strength of an economy that

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP Down 1.4 Percent in October-December Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product (GDP)
contracted a real 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, or an
annualized shrinkage of 5.5 percent, the Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bigger-than-expected contraction, following a 1.0 percent
drop in the July-September period, marks the second consecutive
quarter of decline, the EPA said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
With the latest quarterly GDP growth rate, Japan's economy in
calendar 1999 grew 0.3 percent in real terms for the first annual
rise in two years, following a 2.8 percent contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese government to achieve its goal of 0.6 percent
growth in fiscal 1999, which ends March 31, the GDP would have to
grow 2.0 percent in the January-March term, or an annualized
growth rate of 8.2 percent, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
Following the release of the GDP data, Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Mikio Aoki said the government believes it can basically
attain its goal of 0.6 percent growth for fiscal 1999 despite the
second straight quarterly shrinkage in the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Japanese economy is basically following the
path mapped out in the government economic forecast," the top
Japanese government spokesman told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
GDP is the total value of goods and services produced
domestically. Real GDP data are adjusted for inflation and
seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of
Japan's GDP, contracted 1.6 percent from the previous quarter,
down for the second straight quarter.
</P>
<P>
Corporate capital investment expanded 4.6 percent, the first
upturn in three quarters, but housing investment fell 5.8 percent,
down for the second consecutive quarter.
</P>
<P>
Public investment dropped 5.4 percent in the October-December
period for the second straight quarter of decline, following the 8.
5 percent decline in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the October-December quarter, Japan's exports grew by 0.4
percent, and imports by 4.4 percent, the EPA said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Urge Standardizing Sex Goods Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), in session here since March 5,
have proposed enacting a law to help people "legally sell and
correctly use sex goods" and "improve the quality of sex life."
</P>
<P>
Such a law, lawmakers say in their bill, should standardize
mushrooming sex goods shops across the country.
</P>
<P>
For decades, sex had remained a mysterious and prohibitive
topic in China, but things have greatly changed since the country
began implementing reform and open polices in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, people have been increasingly critical of the
business practices of some sex goods shops such as the selling of
sub-standard or illegal products. Some sex goods shops have even
appeared near primary and middle schools. The employees of most
sex goods shops have had no professional training at all. Some sex
goods stores have even become porn shops, the lawmakers complain
in their bill.
</P>
<P>
Believing that sex goods are special commodities, the NPC
deputies propose strict administration over the sales of such
goods. Moreover, they suggest a zoning measure that locates sex
shops far away from downtown areas, a measure found in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to enhance public awareness on safe sex,
while medical departments and clinical services should provide sex
education, the bill says.
</P>
<P>
According to International Conference on Population and
Development, which was held in Cairo in September 1994,
governments of all nations should provide quality services on
healthy reproduction including family planning and sex health.

"Reports indicates that many Filipinos have been afflicted with
various illnesses because of the various toxic substances left in
the former U.S. military base," Villar said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States should not wait for more people to die from
these deadly wastes," he said, adding: "It would be sheer
hypocrisy on their part to be so concerned with the environment
while they leave this bid mess that is a potential environmental
time bomb right in our backyard."
</P>
<P>
American forces left the former Clark Air Base in Angeles city,
Pampanga province in 1992 shortly after the explosion of Mt.
Pinatubo.
</P>
<P>
Reports disclosed that as early as 1994, people in the area had
already been complaining of skin irritation after bathing or
washing up. Some acquired bloated stomachs the size of a
basketball, while incidences of miscarriages and abortions have
risen believed to be due to toxic exposure.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent study on toxic substances left by the United
States in some of its former military bases overseas, Greenpeace
campaigners said high levels of dieldrin, a toxic substance found
in pesticides,were found in four water wells inside Clark.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have be seeking U.S. government assistance in
cleaning up the waste but the issue was never raised officially
with the U.S. government.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Ethnic Albanian Leaders Blamed for Not Curbing Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. state department spokesman
James Rubin Sunday blamed ethnic Albanian leaders for not curbing
violence against non-Albanian residents in Kosovo, reported the
Yugoslavia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Rubin arrived in the provincial capital of Pristina Sunday on a
three-day visit to Kosovo. He held talks with Hashim Thaci, leader
of the illegal Kosovo Liberation Army, and President of the
Democratic Union Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Rubin criticized ethnic Albanian leaders for
not curbing effectively or even unwilling to stop ethnic violence
and growing criminal activities, the report said. The
determination of western leaders to aid Kosovo was being weakened,
Rubin warned.
</P>
<P>
The escalating ethnic violence in Kosovo, especially in the
northern city of Kosovoska-Mitrovica, has caused more than 100
injuries this year, including some 30 French peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav official statistics, so far about 910
civilians have been killed and more than 800 injured in 4,354
terrorist activities since the international peacekeepers entered
Kosovo in June last year.

<HEADLINE> Rally against Racism Staged in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Germans gathered in
central Berlin Sunday to counter-demonstrate against a neo-Nazis
rally in the city that marked the anniversary of the 1938 Nazi
annexation of Austria.
</P>
<P>
Many people joined voluntarily in the demonstration on the east
side of the Brandenburg Gate to show resentment and indignation at
the 500 supporters of the extreme-right National Party of Germany,
who marched Sunday through a Turkish neighborhood in central
Berlin chanting anti-EU and anti-foreigner slogans.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary President Wolfgang Thierse and other politicians
addressed the "Europe without Racism" rally, calling for "the
ostracism of racism and intolerance" and urging the German
government for tougher measures to combat neo-Nazis forces.
</P>
<P>
Neo-Nazis march organizers claimed that they wanted to protest
against the European Union sanctions imposed on Austria because of
the inclusion of Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party in its new
government.
</P>
<P>
The march ended on the west side of the politically charged
Brandenburg Gate, where Hitler's troops once staged their
torchlight parades on the same day in 1933.
</P>
<P>
Police reported more than 15 arrests, including several radical
leftists who threw stones at the marchers and police. No serious
disturbances or injuries were reported except one officer was hit
in the head and taken to a hospital with a possible concussion.
</P>
<P>
The city sought to ban the neo-Nazis march, but the appeals
court did not uphold it out of free speech grounds.
</P>
<P>
Under German law, it is illegal to spread or propagandize Nazis
thoughts, but neo-Nazis forces have never died in the country,
where more than 100 extreme-right organizations currently
affiliate about 50,000. Some extreme-right parties have entered
local parliaments.
</P>
<P>
On January 29, about 500 neo-Nazis were allowed to march
through the gate to protest against plans to erect a national
Holocaust memorial nearby, triggering a storm of media criticism.
It was believed to be the first neo-Nazi march through the gate
since the end of World War II.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Increasing Demand for Household Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's demand for major
household appliances this year will continue to grow, according to
the State Administration of Internal Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
The demand will maintain the annual growth rate of more than
ten percent since 1996, Monday's China Daily quoted an estimate
by the All-China Commercial Information Center of the SAIT.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of household appliances in China will get
close to 140 billion yuan (16.9 billion U.S. dollars) by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Performance of color TV sets and air conditioners will stand
out among all household appliances with a rapid increase in sales,
said Liu Xiumin, a director with the center.
</P>
<P>
The market potential for air conditioners is great, for few
Chinese urbanites have air conditioners, compared to washing
machines and color TV sets, she explained.
</P>
<P>
The demand for air conditioners will reach eight million this
year, the estimate showed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's demand for color TV sets is
expected to climb to 30 million, and new styles such as liquid
crystal display TV and digital TV will gradually become popular.
</P>
<P>
The center also estimated China's demand for video compact disk
(VCD) players at four million this year and that for super VCD
players at six million.

<HEADLINE> West-Development Strategy to Boost Tibet Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of Tibetan ethnic group
to the on-going 3rd Session of the 9th National People's Congress
(NPC) said today that the strategy of large-scale development of
western China has provided their autonomous region with an
unprecedented opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan
Autonomous Regional People's Congress, said the people in Tibet
should emancipate their minds, renew their concepts and do away
with their conservative ideas, so as to boost economic growth,
promote stability and open themselves wider still to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Tibet boasts abundant natural resources, and it has scored
marked improvements in environments in for foreign investment,
including infrastructure projects including communications, energy
and telecommunications, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, "We sincerely welcome foreign and domestic
investors to Tibet for cooperation and development."
</P>
<P>
Legqog, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, noted that
Tibet must open itself wider to the outside world in an
unprecedented manner and, in order to realize its development in
great leaps, Tibet has to integrate its economy with both domestic
and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is expected to hold a investment fair in Hong Kong with a
large batch of construction projects to be listed for public
bidding in an effort to double the foreign investment this year,
he noted. Tibet would take active measures to open and invigorate
its traditional trade markets in frontier areas.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate its leap in the new century, Legqog said, Tibet
will prioritize the development of its communication and energy,
and list them top on its development agenda. Tibet is planning to
build, among other projects, the China-Nepal Highway, Tibet-
Xinjiang Highway, as well as roads from Lhasa, capital of Tibet,
to other major cities in Ali and Chamdo prefectures on the
Highland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Tibet is currently working hard to have the
construction of its first rail rout get approval and the project
launched.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region will invest 6 billion yuan (723 million
US dollars) this year on the construction of infrastructure
projects, more than in any previous years. Meanwhile, he added, it
will work hard to accelerate the progressing of projects involving
the development of optical fiber telecommunications and satellite-
to-earth telecommunications, growth of water-saving agriculture
and animal husbandry, and processing of farm and livestock
products as well as traditional Tibetan pharmacies.

<HEADLINE> Living Standards of Liaoning Urban Citizens Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey showed that the
living standards of urban citizens in Liaoning Province in
northeast China are improving steadily.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that the per capita income of city dwellers
in Liaoning, one of China's old industrial bases, stood at an
average 4,924 yuan in 1999, up six percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, city residents' average per capita consumer spending
was 3,989 yuan, an increase of 2.5 percent over 1998. Most of the
expenditure went to telecommunications fees, medical care,
entertainment and education, according to the study, which covered
3,250 urban households in the province.
</P>
<P>
The living conditions of urban citizens also took a turn for
the better, with the average per capita living space of urban
citizens rising 2.4 percent to reach 8.5 sq.m.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the improved living standards of urban
citizens to the country's 20-year reform which has helped increase
people's income.
</P>
<P>
However, it also showed that the income of city residents in
the province still lagged behind that of urban citizens in
economically developed areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Arab Solidarity Needs Further Efforts by Huang Ling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers wrapped up
their meeting here ahead of schedule on Saturday evening with a
resolution denouncing Israel and urging Arab countries to reassess
their relationship with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
However, it fell short of forging the highly-expected Arab
solidarity, a goal that seemed not easy to come by.
</P>
<P>
The 18-point final resolution of the meeting, read out by Arab
League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid, reprimands
Israel's continued aggression against Lebanon and affirms the
organization's support for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It gives backing to the legitimate Lebanese resistance against
Israel and recognizes the simultaneity of the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks in peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Lebanon and its main power broker
Syria have gained the lion's share from the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also calls on Arab countries that have diplomatic
and economic relations with Israel to reconsider their ties with
the Jewish state which had fought five wars with the Arabs since
its creation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
It also urges countries involved in multilateral negotiations
with Israel to reconsider their participation until bilateral peace
talks achieve substantial results.
</P>
<P>
Those two items covered Lebanon's proposal to the secretariat
without any modification.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that it was these two items that triggered
controversy among the participants and finally led to the early
conclusion of the meeting which was originally scheduled to last
until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources disclosed that Egypt and Jordan, which have
diplomatic ties with Israel, suggested changes in the wording.
</P>
<P>
"This relationship (with Israel) has benefited my country and
also the whole Arab world in peace negotiations," Jordanian
representative said at a closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, whose country first
normalized ties with Israel in 1979 and was once evicted out of the
League, proposed to replace "reconsider" with a softer word. His
proposal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
This Arab foreign ministers' meeting was held here at a time
when the Middle East peace progress entered the "moment of truth".
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians on Wednesday agreed to resume peace
talks later this month in Washington. The move has obviously put
pressure on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks that insist on resorting
to one Arab voice in dealing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that one Arab voice and Arab solidarity could only
be achieved through intensified efforts from Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Government Defeats No-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- As expected, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's government defeated a no-confidence motion in
the Knesset (Parliament), as the other was withdrawn, Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Radio reported the voting of the first motion was 42
for and 47 against, with three abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The motion was submitted by the opposition Likud party as a
response to Education Minister Yossi Sarid's decision to introduce
the works of Mahmoud Darwish into Israel's school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Darwish is a controversial Palestinian writers known for his
poems about the suffering of displaced Palestinians and their
longing for the Palestinian statehood. 
</P>
<P>
Likud parliamentarians accused Darwish of anti-Zionism and
calling for the destruction of Israel. The poet was also said to be
opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sarid contended that Israelis have to know more about Arabs and
ignorance is not the best means for creating a better neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The second no-confidence motion was sponsored by the Israeli
Arabs' Hadash Party, the other end of Israel's political spectrum
against the Likud. It was reported that the sponsor withdrew the
motion before it was put to vote.
</P>
<P>
The motion was put forwarded over the announced early release of
Yoram Skolnick, who murdered a captured and bound Arab terrorist
suspect seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
In March 1993, the Palestinian man named Abu Sabah was picked up
hitchhiking by two Jewish settlers who later claimed he attacked
them with a knife. The settlers subdued him and tied his hands and
feet.
</P>
<P>
After heard about the news, Skolnik drove to the area, pulled
out his Uzi submachine gun and shot the helpless Arab man cold-
bloodedly, who was lying face down on the ground at that time.
</P>
<P>
Skolnik was later convicted of murder and sentenced to life
imprisonment for the killing.
</P>
<P>
His sentence was commuted to 15 years by President Ezer Weizman
in 1997, and then reduced again to 11 years in 1999. A Prison
Parole Board decided last week to grant an early release to him
because of "his contrition and his good behavior in prison."
</P>
<P>
The controversial release immediately prompted the objection
from the State Attorney's Office and the Arab parties, who
satirized that the life of an Arab is worth very little, especially
if the one who takes it is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
The motion was reportedly withdrawn before the vote after the
sponsors became aware that Skolnick's release on parole was a
function of the judicial system and had no relation with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, any no-confidence motions against the
government should be approved by at least 61 of the 120 members of
Knesset (MKs). Thus, Monday's motions are expected to pose no
serious danger to the Barak government.
</P>
<P>
However, there were warning signals to Barak as three of his six
ruling partners decided to cross party lines to vote against him or
abstain in the vote.
</P>
<P>
MKs of the ultra-orthodox religious party Shas, the third
largest party in the Knesset and the biggest ruling partner of
Barak's coalition, and the National Religious Party reportedly
voted along the opposition in the first motion.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and deputy ministers from their parties abstained or
were absent from the vote since voting against the coalition is a
ground for dismissal from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Yisrael Ba'aliya party, another junior ruling partner who is
angry over noises in the coalition to expel its members, also
ordered its MKs to abstain or be absent.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest of a series of events showing that Barak's
majority in the Knesset was eroding because of his peace moves with
the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts fear that at the critical point of Middle
East peace process, any inviability of the government will damage
Barak's peace efforts.

Erekat over the issues of Israel's release of Palestinian

the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Ramallah and Israel's
third troop redeployment in the West Bank under the Sharm el Sheikh
memorandum.

The ICRC will now prepare a proposal to be presented to Israel

The attacks on the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the

are opposed to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace deal with
Israel, were the first of its kind since 1998.

The Israeli planes fired several missiles at the bases in four
sorties within 45 minutes.

So far, there were no immediate reports of casualties. But

<HEADLINE> SLA Shellings Kill Two in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Two people was killed and two
others seriously wounded in south Lebanon in a shelling by pro-
Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA), security sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Mansouri, a
village eight kilometers south of Tyre, a Lebanese soldier and a
civilian were killed immediately in the barrage of shelling, the
Voice of People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Two Lebanese soldiers were badly wounded in a blast in another
checkpoint several kilometers away from Mansouri, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army denied that Israeli battleship fired the Lebanese
army checkpoints in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel admitted that its warplanes attacked two
Palestinian guerrillas' base and suspected Hezbollah's outposts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday morning, Israeli planes bombed suspected Syrian
and Iranian-backed guerrilla Hezbollah's outpost in south Lebanon
and Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(People's Front) and Fatah Uprising, which are opposed to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli's dense bombardment came two days after Arab Foreign
Ministers' Conference held in Beirut. The resolution of the
conference harshly denounced Israel's aggression and attack on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Though Israel has decided to bring its troops home by July,
ending an 18-year occupation of south Lebanon, Hezhollah never
slacked in their attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking a full return of the Golan Heights
Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, insists on the simultaneity
in solving the Syria and Lebanon issues.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Trade Charges on Health, Campaign Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Governor George W. Bush, de facto presidential
candidates from the Democratic and Republican parties, traded
charges Monday on health care and campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
Gore charged Bush with lack of a health care agenda because he
is beholden to campaign donors interested only in a tax cut. Bush
attacked that Gore compromised himself for campaign cash. "This
guy will say anything to get elected," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
The two nominees for presidential candidates campaigned in
Southern states which will hold another round of primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to Gore's charge that Bush is not ready to lead,
Bush said, "If America is pleased with what Clinton-Gore has done
to the spirit of America, I'm not the right person."
</P>
<P>
"But if America wants somebody not of Washington, if America
wants somebody who trusts people, not the government, if America
is interested in somebody who knows how to lead, come and join
this campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
On health care, Gore, who campaigned in Miami, said he wants to
expand CHIPS, a federal-state health insurance program, to all
children and low-income parents, and allow seniors between ages 55
and 65 to buy into Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Gore said Bush "has no plan to expand access to health care, no
plan to have a national 'patients bill of rights,' no plan to give
seniors help with prescription drugs."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush, campaigning in Louisiana, said he favors
expansion of CHIPS, making it less expensive for employers to
provide health insurance, and encouraging states to develop basic
health care safety nets that "trust people to make decisions for
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Primaries will be held in Tennessee, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas Tuesday, awarding 341 Republican
and 566 Democratic convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
Gore won uncontested votes in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and
Nevada over the weekend, picking up 182 delegates. That brought
his delegate total to 1,679, with 2,170 needed to win nomination
of presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Cooperation of Former Sierra Leonean Rebels With Government, U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China Monday called for
the cooperation of the former Sierra Leonean rebels to
unconditionally honor a peace accord signed in July last year and
urged them to cooperate with the government and the U.N. Mission,
known as the UNAMSIL in a bid to promote the peace process in the
West African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Chen Xu, councilor of the Chinese
Mission to the United Nations, took the floor at the Security
Council open briefing on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Although the general situation in Sierra Leone had been
improved, many elements of instability remain in the country, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Revolutionary United Front (RUF), particularly the
performance of its leader Mr. Foday Sankoh as well the non-
cooperation with UNAMSIL became the major road block to the peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are gravely concerned at the slow process of the
disarmament, demobilization and rehabilitation of ex-combatants"
in the country, Chen said. "We are also deeply disturbed by the
serious humanitarian situation and cases of human rights
violations which occurred from time to time."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the RUF must "unconditionally implement
the obligation undertaken in the Lome Peace Agreement, and put an
end to its hostility against the government and UNAMSIL."
</P>
<P>
"The international community should continue to support the
peace process in various ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his March 9 report to
the Security Council, criticized Sankoh for hampering peace in
Sierra Leone, saying Sankoh and his RUF fighters are hostile to U.
N. peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL, which is helping to monitor the Lome Peace
Agreement, has an authorized strength of 11,100 troops, but only
about 7,500 are deployed.

<P>
HAVANA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of 25 Mexican young people
arrived Monday to this capital to study at Latin American School
of Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
These newcomers will start next Monday a premedical course of
leveling for half a year, so as to begin coming September classes
at the school, where currently are taking free the first year of
this specialty about 2,000 students from 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
The premedical leveling course is being done also by another
968 young people from Argentina. Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Equatorial Guinea, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Situated on Havana's outskirts, Latin American School of

during the 9th Ibero- American Summit.
</P>
<P>
The center, unique in its kind in the world, arose as solidary
answer from Cuba to countries affected by hurricanes Mitch and
George, but scholarships were later extended to other Latin
American and African nations.

<HEADLINE> Looted Nazi Picture Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A painting looted by the Nazis was
handed over at a British art gallery Monday to the descendants of
the original owner.
</P>
<P>
The Three Stages of Life, painted in 1898 by Count Leopold von
Kalckreuth, was left by Elizabeth Gotthilf in Vienna in 1938 when
she fled Austria with her husband and children in the wake of the
Nazi takeover.
</P>
<P>
The picture has been on display at London's Royal Academy, on
loan from the Neue Pinakothek in Munich.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, more than 60 years after it was looted, a
representative of the German authorities handed the picture over
to Mrs Gotthilf's descendants, Ernest and Marietta Glanville, from
London.
</P>
<P>
It is the first work being exhibited in Britain to become the
object of restitution by The Commission for Looted Art in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The painting was obtained in 1942 from a private Viennese
collection by the Bavarian State Collection of Paintings, which
was unaware of the identity of the original owner.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how much the painting is worth at today's values
but the family has made it clear it has no intention of selling it.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Extends 1995 Order Banning Iran Oil Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Monday that he had extended an executive order banning oil
development contract with Iran under the ground of Teheran's
continuing "to threaten the national security" of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that he had extended the ban he first
signed in March 1995 "Because of the actions and policies of the
government of Iran continue to threaten the national security,
foreign policy, and economy of the United States."
</P>
<P>
The 1995 executive order prohibits U.S. citizens from entering
into contracts for the financing of or the overall management or
supervision of the development of petroleum resources in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has to decide annually whether to extend the 1995 order
or have it automatically lapse.
</P>
<P>
the extension of the order comes as the Clinton administration
is gesturing to improve relations with Iran after a reformist
victory in Iran's parliamentary elections and when both the Senate
and the House have passed a bill punishing foreign firms investing
in Iran's energy industry.
</P>
<P>
The White House has threatened that the president would veto
the Congress bill but also indicates that Washington was impatient
over Iran's refusal for any official dialogue between the two
countries, which have severed relations since 1979.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Parties Fail to Make Progress in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's conflicting
political parties held further fruitless talks Monday to bridge
the gap between them that has left the province's peace process on
the rocks and its agreement in tatters.
</P>
<P>
The moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP)
held separate talks in Belfast with the Irish Republican Army's
political ally, Sinn Fein, and the pro-British Ulster Unionists as
political leaders made preparations to fly to Washington for the
March 17 celebrations of St Patrick's Day, Ireland's national day.
</P>
<P>
The province was plunged into crisis last month when Britain's
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson suspended the home-rule
government of pro-British Protestants and Roman Catholic
nationalists over the failure of the IRA to hand in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
The London and Dublin governments are seeking compromises from
the Northern Irish parties to end the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said he believed real business could be done in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"There had better be some serious discussions to make the visit
and the meetings worthwhile," Reuters quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties to "stretch themselves" a bit more and go
that extra mile for the sake of a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
However, both Sinn Fein and the Unionists were gloomy.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very difficult now to see how anybody can expect
May 22nd (the date in the agreement for disarmament to be complete)
as a target date to be achieved," said Sinn Fein's Mitchel
McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
The meetings took place against a backdrop of recent shootings
and attacks.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's Protestant leader David Trimble said: "It is
difficult to see how this can be resolved because Republicans have
not come forward and the Irish government doesn't seem to have a
clear position on things."

<P>
MAPUTO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany has announced a 13 million
U.S. dollar grant to Mozambique for relief operations and
infrastructure rehabilitation in the flood-hit southern and
central parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made over the weekend by visiting German
Minister of Economic and Development Cooperation Heidemarie
Wieckzorek-Zeul, a press release made available by the German
Embassy here said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the rehabilitation of destroyed roads, the money
will be used for the rebuilding of schools and health centres in
rural areas," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Wieckzorek-Zeul also announced the writing off of 30 million
U.S. dollars of debt owed by Mozambique to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany had already granted 4.6 million U.S. dollars for the
Mozambican flood victims.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the German government had provided
two planes, seven helicopters and 275 tons of emergency relief
goods for the relief operations in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The German minister also visited Beira, the capital of the
central Province of Sofala, and the districts of Machanga and
Govuro, in the flooded valley of the Save River.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Wieckzorek-Zeul had talks with President
Joaquim Chissano, Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao and the governor
of Sofala, Felisberto Tomas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Support Koehler as IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton will
support Europe's new candidate, Horst Koehler, to head the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that Clinton had spoken to German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder in the afternoon and "the president told
Chancellor Schroeder that the United States was prepared to
support Mr. Koehler as the new head of the IMF."
</P>
<P>
"The president and Schroeder agreed that Mr. Koehler should
come to Washington to meet with the IMF board, particularly with
the developing countries," Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The president and Schroeder also agreed that Koehler should
retain the talented management team at the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
The post of IMF managing director traditionally goes to a
European, while the job of World Bank president traditionally goes
to an American, and Washington has made clear it does not want to
break with that tradition.
</P>
<P>
Europe's first nominee, Caio Koch-Weser, pulled out of the race
last week after the United States made clear it would not support
him.
</P>
<P>
Koehler, a former German finance ministry official who now
heads the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, will be the third candidate in the race to head the
IMF. Several groups of developing countries want the job to go to
Stanley Fischer, the fund's American acting managing director,
while Japan has nominated Eisuke Sakakibara, a former Japanese
finance ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board has said it is looking for consensus in its
struggle to find a successor to France's Michel Camdessus, who
quit last month.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Voices Optimism over Athens' EMU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou late Monday convinced that the European Union's Lisbon
summit in June would ratify Athens' application for the economic
and monetary union (EMU) membership.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic regarding the decision on our entry into
the euro zone, and we are also optimistic that the present
government will win the April 9 elections and will continue to
work hard,"Papandreou said after talks with his visiting
Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama, who is also EU Council of
Ministers President.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Gama, who arrived here Monday, said that when a
country like Greece joined the euro zone, this was of great
importance not only for the country but for all of Europe as well.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that this issue was not only an economic
one,since Europe wanted to progress economically to be able to
occupy a strong position at a global level.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Greece has made remarkable economic progress,
and has met all the five criterion for the entry into the EMU.
</P>
<P>
On March 9, Greece had formally applied for its accession to
the EMU, and the EU Lisbon summit will make the last decision.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, EU Council of Finance Ministers
President and Portuguese Finance Minister Joakin Pina Mura Monday
reportedly welcomed Athens' EMU application and stressed that
Greece would surely become the EMU's 12th member in June.

<HEADLINE> U.S. High-Tech Sector Sets Export Record in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 13 (Xinhua) -- High-tech companies in the
United States sold a record of 181 billion U.S. dollars in
manufactured products overseas in 1999, accounting for more than
one-quarter of all the U.S. exports, according to report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The leading destinations for U.S. high-tech exports in the year
were Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and South Korea, said the
market and industry report from the America Electronics
Association (AEA) and the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
Among the fastest growing U.S. high-tech export markets between
1993 and 1999 were the Philippines, South Korea, Ireland, Brazil,
Mexico, China and Malaysia. These countries each absorbed over 1
billion dollars in U.S. electronics.
</P>
<P>
The AEA found that countries that have a thriving technology
industry, like Canada, Singapore and the Netherlands, share some
characteristics with the United States. These include high
Internet, computer and phone penetration rates; a vibrant venture
capital markets; access to skilled labor, significant research and
development outlays; low telecommunications costs; and an emphasis
on innovation and risk-taking, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Iceland, Finland, Sweden and Norway lead in
Internet and computer use per capita. But computer usage in the
Asia-Pacific region will surpass both the United Sates and the
European Union by 2005, according to the report.

Sankoh and the RUF, to engage in "full cooperation" with the U.N.
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and with the U.N. team as a
whole, "and by instructing the RUF membership to disarm and to
surrender all weapons, including their heavy weapons, mines and
anti-aircraft equipment."
</P>
<P>
"Council members urge Member States to enforce strictly the
travel ban imposed by the Council and remind concerned Sierra
Leone leaders of the obligation to obtain exemptions before
traveling abroad without exception," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members welcome the upcoming donor conference in
London on March 27 and urged U.N. Members to participate and
contribute generously to the peace process and development efforts
in Sierra Leone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his March 9 report to
the Security Council, sharply criticized Sankoh and his RUF
fighters for hampering peace in the West African country, saying
that "I continue to be very concerned about the often negative and
confusing approach taken by Mr. Sankoh to key elements of the
peace process and the role entrusted to the United Nations."

<HEADLINE> Worldwide ASP Spending Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide spending on
application service provider (ASP) services will grow 92 percent
annually between 1999 and 2004, according to a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ASP spending is expected to reach 7.8 billion U.S. dollars
by 2004, from 296 million dollars in 1999, said the report from
the U.S. market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Also called a "commercial service provider," ASP is an
organization that hosts software applications on its own servers
within its own facilities. Customers access the application via
private lines or the Internet. With the advent of the Web browser
as the universal client interface, the ASP market has been
expected to grow rapidly but in reality the spending quiet limited.
</P>
<P>
Factors that contributed to the limited spending in 1999 were
the immaturity of ASP offerings and low customer awareness, IDC
said. However, throughout the year, ASPs announced an increasing
number of customer acquisitions. Also, the ASP concept has been
endorsed by several of the information technology industry's most
influential players, including AT&AMP;T, IBM, Microsoft and Sun. Their
commitment is resulting in the applications, infrastructure and
services needed to drive growth in the market.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, another factor contributing to the ASP market
's growth is the emergence of the collaborative and personal
segments. In 1999, spending on enterprise applications, which
include industry-specific and analytical applications, dominated
the mix of ASP services, accounting for about 66 percent of ASP
spending. Combined, collaborative applications, which include
groupware, document management, and email, and personal
applications, accounted for the remaining one-third of ASP
spending. By 2004, their combined share will jump to 50 percent.
