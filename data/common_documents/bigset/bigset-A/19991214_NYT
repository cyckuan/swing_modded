ITEMS ON KLEINFIELD'S COURTING PATRICIA LOTT, TIFFANY DUBIN LEAVING
SOTHEBY'S FOR INTERNET IPO, AND GIFT GIVING IN THE FASHION
INDUSTRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patricia Lott, the wife of the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, is not known in Washington circles as an
omnipresent social force. This seems of little concern to the new
owners of Kleinfeld's, the Brooklyn wedding-gown emporium, which
has asked her to become a paid consultant to the company.
Kleinfeld's, which specializes in bridal wear and has long
attracted the great cross-section of those about to wed _ from
teenage Hasidic girls in Williamsburg to late-marrying lawyers
occupying TriBeCa lofts _ is seeking to expand to the nation's
capital and wants Mrs. Lott to help them to better understand the
city's evening-wear scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of knowledge of special-occasion dressing,''
said Mara Urshel, Kleinfeld's president and a partner in the KBC
Operating Co., which owns the business. Mrs. Lott was introduced to
Kleinfeld's by another member of the partnership, Clay Hamner, a
North Carolina-based real estate developer. ``Through Clay, we've
met a lot of the Republicans,'' explained Ron Rothstein,
Kleinfeld's chief executive. (Another partner in the venture is the
actor Wayne Rogers.)
</P>
<P>
   John Czwertacki, the senator's press secretary, said that Mrs.
Lott is seriously considering the offer and that she may well begin
her duties in January. A few weeks ago, she toured Barneys New York
on Madison Avenue with one of the store's buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Fran DeWine, the wife of Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio and a good
friend and former neighbor of Mrs. Lott, said that Mrs. Lott has
``always had a real flair for fashion.'' Mrs. Lott used to make
porcelain dolls and dress them, Mrs. DeWine recalled, adding that
Mrs. Lott has some retail experience: she sells dressy suits, of
the sort a Washington spouse might wear, out of her home. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHIFT AT SOTHEBY'S  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Tiffany Dubin, whose tenure as the first head of
Sotheby's fashion department helped to confer a new status on
clothes once simply thought of as old, has abandoned her post. Ms.
Dubin, the stepdaughter of Sotheby's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman,
has taken a job as a vice president of the Auction Channel, a
planned cable television channel that, as its name suggests, will
hold auctions. The channel is an offshoot of an existing Internet
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has chic IPO potential,'' Ms. Dubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin, who resigned from Sotheby's last week, raised
$140,000 in her last sale of vintage cocktail wear.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin, who was given no advertising budget to promote her
sales and used what she called ``guerrilla tactics'' to gain
attention for them, said that Sotheby's will now give the fashion
department such a budget. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOLIDAY GIFT-GIVING  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This week messengers who work the orbit of the
fashion world may find themselves especially busy. In the coming
days, fashion houses will begin sending their holiday gifts to
select fashion editors, ``a chance,'' as one publicist put it, ``to
say thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Rowley, who in the past has sent gifts like cashmere
sweaters, is sending editors Champagne and horseshoes (for good
luck, evidently). Last year, Michael Kors sent silk sweaters, but
he is keeping this year's gift a secret. Jil Sander, as she did
last year, is sending donations on behalf of the editors to a
German children's charity.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion editors invariably say that the industry's lavish gift
giving, with items often valued at $100 or more each, has no
bearing on future news coverage. (The New York Times' policy for
reporters and editors is that gifts valued at more than $25 are to
be returned.)
</P>
<P>
   The trend for sending charitable contributions as opposed to
liquor or clothing was popular earlier in the 1990s, a publicist at
a major fashion house said, but has since fallen out of favor. ``It
is my general perception that people aren't into it,'' she added.
``They want trinkets.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada is one company that does not indulge in holiday
gift-giving, on the grounds that the company displays its
generosity throughout the year, said Jennifer Pinto, a spokeswoman.
After its spring show in Milan a few months ago, it presented some
editors with handbags from the new line. &QL;

LEAKS HAUNT ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GONDERINGER  
 and CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaks from more than 3,000 underground gasoline storage tanks
continue to haunt Arizona, despite years of work and an investment
of $127 million in taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Suspected or known causes of cancer have found their way into
Arizona's groundwater in at least 600 cases, but rarely have they
contaminated the state's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   So Arizonans face the question: Is the cleanup worth even higher
taxes? The state auditor general is calling for the Legislature to
raise a tax on gasoline to hasten the effort. At the same time, a
governor's committee is looking at whether the taxpayer-funded
cleanup program should even remain in existence.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Quality says it is making
steady progress, and is drastically reducing the chances that more
leaks will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Leaking underground storage tanks are an American legacy of the
automobile. They're near homes, schools, restaurants, lying beneath
gas stations and auto shops, even dairies and orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has confounded state agencies from California to New
York. So far, few lives have been threatened, causing some critics
to question the need for so many cleanups. But other experts worry
that so many leaks have affected so much groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is tremendous,'' said Joseph Gonzalez, appointed
several years ago to then-California Gov. Pete Wilson's committee
on underground storage tanks. ``You don't know where it is, where
it goes. I think the agencies are just overrun. I was flabbergasted
at the amount of chemicals out there contaminating potential
sources of drinking water.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider metropolitan Phoenix: At Indian School and 40th Street,
contamination lurks below three corners of the intersection.
Similar plumes were found beneath a Unocal station on West Broadway
Road in Tempe. &QL; 
OTHER HAZARDS FOUND &QL; 
Other hazards were found years ago, yet still haven't been removed.
In Mesa, for example, contaminants seeped into the groundwater at a
city service yard near Mesa Drive and Sixth Street in 1990 and
1991, eventually spreading at least 800 feet to the east.
</P>
<P>
   A state audit released in November says the backlog of unpaid
claims for cleanups rose to $55 million at the end of June 1999
from $48 million in October 1997 _ suggesting the Department of
Environmental Quality is falling farther behind in its effort to
fix the mess. The audit urges legislators to increase an existing 1
cent per gallon tax on gas that has raised money to pay for the
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' reported in 1988 that at least 200
underground storage tanks and pipes had leaked more than 700,000
gallons of gasoline, oil and other petroleum products into the
Phoenix area's soil and groundwater. Since then, the number of
known leaks has increased steadily _ partly because of better
methods of detection and partly because tanks continued to leak. &QL; 
COMPLEX, COSTLY PROBLEM &QL; 
In Arizona and other states, dealing with the problem has turned
out to be more complex and costly than anyone could have predicted.
Arizona officials initially thought they'd have the problem under
control by Dec. 31, 1999. But hundreds of leaks continue to be so
severe that several feet of gasoline float atop groundwater.
Sometimes, it's the same groundwater tapped by wells for drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that, new research shows that chemicals in gas can
``evaporate'' through the ground and penetrate concrete,
potentially leading to a health risk in the air inside a building
that sits over contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes a trace amount over a long period of time to
constitute an unacceptable health risk,'' said Patrick Wilson, a
toxicologist for the EPA in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   RISK STILL SLIM &QL; 
The good news is that the chances of coming in contact with the
dangerous chemicals remain small.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of MTBE, gasoline spills don't move as fast
or spread as far as other hazardous chemicals. Also, gas floats, so
even a sizable spill can sit atop groundwater and not taint water
tapped by a well a bit deeper. It also makes gas easier to clean
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as nasty substances that leak into the environment go,
gas is very forgiving,'' said Phil McNeely, manager of the
Department of Environmental Quality's program that works to clean
up underground storage tank leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean it's safe. In Fountain Hills, one benzene
and MTBE-filled leak seeped into the groundwater and into a
neighborhood wash where children played.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, an underground garage at an office building at
Central Avenue and Camelback Road became flooded with water that
emitted noxious fumes. Builders didn't realize a gas station that
occupied the site before them had left a legacy of contaminated
soil and groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   Near Tuba City, in northeastern Arizona, residents of a Hopi
village worry that a creeping spill threatens sacred springs and
other water sources they rely on for survival and religious
ceremonies. &QL; 
CONTAMINATED WELL &QL; 
In the central Arizona community of McGuireville, Dave and Virginia
Womack turned on their kitchen faucet in 1997 to make tea. They
stopped when they noticed a funny smell and taste. Turns out the
well they'd been drawing drinking water from for 20 years had
become contaminated by leaking tanks at two nearby convenience
stores. Tests found unacceptably high levels of benzene.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither got sick, they worry someday they might.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows whether we drank any of those chemicals before they
got so bad we could smell them,'' Womack said. The couple is suing
for $500,000 in Yavapai County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   McGuireville is the only place in Arizona where drinking-water
wells have been shut down over contamination. But with the sheer
number of leaky tanks, it might not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Water Resources estimates there are
50,000 drinking-water wells across the state, mostly in rural
areas. Permits for 3,500 new ones are expected to be issued next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Underground tanks became such a problem because for decades,
they were made of steel, which corrodes easily. Spills sat
unchecked for years. It wasn't until the mid-1980s that the EPA
began requiring states to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we can't see something, we often don't know about it
until it becomes a severe problem,'' said Lester Kaufman, chief of
the underground storage tank program for the EPA's regional office
in San Francisco. &QL; 
TANKS REGISTERED &QL; 
Arizona began the laborious task of registering the 26,860 tanks in
the state, and began making inspections every few years. Tank
owners were asked to report any leaks and start costly cleanups.
They then would be reimbursed for some of the costs _ today, as
much as 90 percent _ with money generated mostly from the gasoline
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, there have been 7,500 reported leaks in the state.
About 4,400 have been cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   That's about 58 percent, close to the national average, Kaufman
said. He applauds the work of the Department of Environmental
Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their program really is a good one, especially on the
prevention side. They have some of the best inspectors around,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's environmental groups have not rallied to the cause of
cleaning up underground storage tanks. The risks pale next to more
sinister problems, such as state Superfund sites and air pollution,
said Sandy Bahr, conservation outreach coordinator for the local
chapter of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bigger public health threats out there. But still,
you don't want to be drinking gasoline,'' she said. &QL; 
MANY INEFFICIENCIES FIXED &QL; 
And despite the auditor general's criticisms, the report last month
says many inefficiencies in the underground storage tank program
have been fixed. New rules are in the works that will ensure less
money is spent on sites that don't pose as much of a threat. Sen.
Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, estimates that a third of cleanups in the
state haven't really been necessary to protect human health.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the sheer number of these leaks, you just can't monitor
every single one, clean up every single molecule,'' the EPA's
Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tank owners around the country were required to
upgrade their equipment to more leak-proof standards as of Dec. 22,
1998. Arizona has checked on 775 tanks so far, and has found 95
percent in compliance. The agency ruled 900 leaks officially
cleaned up this year, but 450 new ones were added to the stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, we dramatically decrease the likelihood that
future leaks will happen,'' said Al Johnson, ombudsman for
Arizona's underground storage tank program.
</P>
<P>
   That's welcome news to Dave Womack, who hasn't enjoyed hauling
water ever since he and Virginia were forced to close their
contaminated McGuireville well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that you just take for granted, that
you turn on your faucet and good water will come out.'' &QL;

DUNGY AND BUCCANEERS KEEP THEIR COOL, AND KEEP ON WINNING

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It was the third quarter in the Detroit
Lions-Tampa Bay Buccaneers battle here on Sunday and John Lynch was
on the bench, gasping for air, squelching the pain. Lynch injured
his left knee two games earlier, against Seattle, and it had nagged
him since. Now it seemed ready to blow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing with it hurting for a while, but then I got
caught in a pile and twisted it and it hurt so bad,'' said Lynch, a
persistent playmaking safety now in his seventh Bucs season. ``I
did not have the full range of motion for a minute. They were
checking me to make sure it was just a strain. I really didn't
know, but I did know I had to get back out there. There was so much
at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   First place in the National Football Conference Central was at
stake. So was a chance to earn a 9-4 record and trail only the St.
Louis Rams (11-2) in the NFC/ It was a chance for Tampa Bay to win
six straight in the regular season for the first time in team
history. An opportunity to gain respect, confidence, momentum, all
of the ingredients that a team yearning to make a playoff sprint in
January must exhibit in December.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch would play through the pain. His team crept within range.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs trailed Detroit, 16-9, early in the fourth quarter.
Then the offense scored a touchdown. And then Lynch, with 5 minutes
7 seconds left, made an interception and returned it 28 yards to
the Detroit 24 to set up the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay won, 23-16. No, actually, in trailing for all but the
final 4:18, Tampa Bay persevered. Kept in range. Then overcame.
</P>
<P>
   That was the theme that helped save the Bucs' season _ keep in
range and stay in view. After their first seven games, they were a
3-4 team apparently heavy on defense, light on offense and in a
confused state at quarterback, where Trent Dilfer had labored. They
opened the season with a loss at home to the Giants, beat
Philadelphia and Denver, and then lost consecutive division games
at Minnesota and at Green Bay. They beat Chicago, lost at Detroit
and _ it seemed to happen so quickly, so suddenly _ they were an
ugly 3-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year Minnesota was 15-1 and nobody in our division could
catch them,'' Tony Dungy, Tampa Bay's head coach, said. ``This year
was not like that. Everybody was close and we felt like after
starting 3-4 that if we could just get in range that it would pay
off later. We knew that the teams ahead of us in our division _
Minnesota, Detroit and Green Bay _ would all have to come to our
place in December. We took the mind-set that the next game was the
most important game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy did not panic. He could have benched players, cut players,
thrown out schemes and ripped his team to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said: ``A lot of times you take on the personality of your
leader. Rather than complicate things, coach simplified things,
emphasizing what we do well. When you see the leader not panic and
just chip away at being successful, you follow that. Personally,
this season I concentrated on my abilities, on my confidence, and
then tried to make that jump from being a good player to becoming a
great one by just trusting my instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay trusted its instincts as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer returned from a benching before Week 8 to start the
winning streak with better play, but then he was injured in the
Seattle game. Shaun King, the rookie quarterback from Tulane,
entered, helped beat Seattle and then in the last six days, in his
first two pro starts, beat Minnesota and Detroit. Both games were
against teams that entered tied with Tampa Bay for first place in
the NFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept grinding through the rough spots early in the
season,'' King said. ``We were 3-4, but we knew among ourselves
that we had a good team. Coach Dungy has a quiet confidence about
him, and it is easy to buy into the fact that he knows what it
takes to win. He said: `Follow our system, do what we do, don't
worry about the outside. Keep all 58 on the ship, nobody hanging on
a rope overboard.' He was right.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tampa Bay is now ripe. King gives the Bucs a winning
presence and more athleticism at quarterback. The defense is nasty,
sometimes dominating. ``It is hard not to excel in this defense
because so many guys are making plays and you want to be a part of
it,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay plays at Oakland on Sunday, then plays host to Green
Bay and ends at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year late in the season we had to win and hope somebody
else would lose so we could make the playoffs, which we didn't,''
Dungy said. ``This year we can win a playoff spot if we beat
Oakland. We can win the division if we win our last three games.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from being a sour 3-4 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an electric atmosphere in the organization and in
the community over what has taken place, but we are keeping our eye
on the ball,'' Lynch said. ``During this winning streak, something
different but good has happened to us every week. We're winning
games with different people and in a different style from week to
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning instinctively. &QL;

COMPUTER CONSULTANT TO BUY USWEB IN A STOCK SWAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whittman-Hart Inc., a computer consulting
company based in Chicago, said Monday that it has agreed to acquire
USWeb/CKS, a company based here specializing in Internet design and
marketing strategy, in a stock swap valued around $5.87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they would create the largest Internet
professional-services concern in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street reacted negatively to the deal, sending the
stock of both companies plummeting. Shares of Whittman-Hart closed
at $54.50, down $24.75, or 31 percent, in Nasdaq trading. Shares in
USWeb also fell, if less starkly, closing at $43.8125, down
$7.0625, or 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rooney, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
reduced his rating on Whittman-Hart's stock to market perform from
buy, while Gary Dean of J.C. Bradford lowered his recommendation to
buy from strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts said the deal made strategic sense.
Although Whittman has built a large, profitable business managing
computer systems for midsize companies, primarily in the Midwest,
it has only lately added Internet-related services. USWeb was one
of the first companies to specialize in Web site creation, and with
the acquisition last year of CKS, added expertise in marketing and
strategy. Buying USWeb gives Whittman strong Internet services,
these analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Whittman, which earned $18.8 million, or 35 cents a
share, in 1998 on revenue of $307.6 million, USWeb had a loss of
$188.3 million on revenue of $228.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that much of USWeb's growth has come through
a series of acquisitions and may not be sustainable. The company
has acquired about a dozen consulting firms since it was founded in
1995 by a group of former Novell executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the deal, each share of USWeb/CKS will
be exchanged for 0.865 share of Whittman-Hart stock. After the
merger, USWeb/CKS stockholders will own roughly 57 percent of the
combined company and Whittman-Hart stockholders, roughly 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bernard, the chairman and chief executive of Whittman,
will be chief executive of the new company. Robert Shaw, USWeb's
chief executive, will be chairman.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb experienced a degree of incredulity when its original
chief executive and co-founder, Joseph P. Firmage, was forced to
resign in January after publishing accounts of his meeting with an
alien from outer space. Firmage, 29, remains a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Another co-founder, Sheldon Laube, left in August to create
Center Beam Inc., a company offering personal computers, wireless
networks and software by subscription. But USWeb still has clients
such as Harley-Davidson and Apple Computer.

INDICTED HEAD OF THE IBF STEPS ASIDE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The International Boxing Federation said Monday
that its president would take a leave of absence to attend to his
ailing heart and his indictment on corruption charges, a move that
the sanctioning body hoped would let it avoid federal monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The president, Robert W. Lee Sr., was among four federation
officials indicted Nov. 4 on charges that they took $338,000 in
bribes in exchange for advancing fighters' rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The other indicted officials were Lee's son, Robert Lee Jr., the
federation's liaison to his father; Donald William Brennan,
chairman of the federation's ranking committee; and Francisco
Fernandez, an international commissioner who lives in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   After the indictment, the U.S. attorney's office in Newark,
which brought the criminal charges, sued the federation under
federal anti-racketeering laws and sought to install a
court-approved monitor over the organization. That would be the
first instance in which a monitor oversaw a sports organization. A
hearing is scheduled for U.S. District Court in Newark on Dec. 22.
The government has asked to install Zachary Carter, a former U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn, who is now in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   In granting Lee a leave, the federation's acting president,
Hiawatha Knight, said the organization was moving to lift the cloud
of suspicion from its daily operations, and therefore there was no
more need for the government to seek a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office can run without an overseer,'' said Knight, a
federation vice president normally based in Detroit, who arrived at
the sanctioning body's headquarters in East Orange on Monday. The
federation's board of commissioners voted to grant Lee leave last
week, said James Cecchi, a lawyer for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Robert J. Cleary, the U.S.
attorney for New Jersey, said Lee's leave had no bearing on the
monitoring issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed in our minds,'' Drewniak said. ``The
motion for the monitor is still pending before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer representing the elder Lee in the
indictment, said his client had an operation Monday at Beth Israel
Hospital in Newark to unclog an artery in his heart. He said Lee,
65, who lives in Fanwood, has a history of heart disease that
included a triple-bypass operation eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fine,'' Krovatin said of Lee Monday. ``He's resting.''

INVESTORS BUY XEROX DESPITE ANALYSTS' DOWNGRADES AND PRICE
INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As shares of the Xerox Corp. regained a modicum of what they
lost late Friday, a market truism was reaffirmed Monday: investors
are simply contrarians these days.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the market closed on Friday, Xerox dropped a
bombshell, warning that fourth-quarter earnings, which it had
already said in October would be poor, would be even worse. Xerox's
shares continued to fall in after-hours trading after closing at
$20.0625, down 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, analysts flooded First Call/Thomson Financial with
downgrades. They reduced their estimates for Xerox's fourth-quarter
earnings to 40 cents from 66 cents, and they lowered their
estimates for next year's earnings to $1.91 from $2.29.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went from estimating a 3 percent rise in earnings next
year to a 3 percent decline,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of
research at First Call. ``Clearly, the analysts see some
long-lasting problems at Xerox.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither Xerox nor investors were acting as though the
company was in serious trouble on Monday. Conventional wisdom
normally dictates that a company fight an upstart competitor by
dropping prices. Although Xerox has been steadily losing market
share to Canon, which has introduced a slew of new digital products
this year, Xerox announced price increases Monday of 3 percent to 5
percent on some of its highest-end and lowest-end digital products.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are products where we can still sell everything we
build, and that makes a price increase sustainable,'' said Jeffrey
J. Simek, a Xerox spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, despite their reaction late Friday, had calmed down
by Monday. Instead of plunging further in response to the analysts'
downgrades, Xerox's shares rose $1.0625, to $21.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox has a tremendous customer base, and those customers will
give them time to get their act together before they switch to
competitors,'' said Hadley Reynolds, director of research for the
Delphi Group, a document processing industry consulting firm in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday whether investors were simply bargain
hunting or whether they agree with Reynolds rosy prognosis. If it
is the latter, it is based more on hope than on tangible signs of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Xerox's problems are beyond its control, of course.
Brazil, once Xerox's hottest growth market, is besieged with
economic trouble. And the strong dollar has damped the numbers
Xerox can report from still-healthy sales in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the United States that Xerox is suffering the most.
It still derives 75 percent of its sales from slow, low-margin
copiers whose markets grow less than 10 percent a year. Sales
remain disappointing for Xerox's most profitable product line, the
high-speed copiers used by publishing houses for print-on-demand
applications and by corporations in their central copier
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox attributes the shortfall to jitters over potential Year
2000 computer problems. But if that were the case, both the company
and analysts would be predicting a big bounce from pent-up demand
during the second quarter of 2000. No one is making such
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Year 2000 seem to be an industrywide problem. Canon
USA, which is emerging as Xerox's hottest competitor for high-speed
digital copiers, insists its sales continue to boom. To be fair,
Canon does not yet offer the kind of super-expensive high-speed
copiers that Xerox says were the hardest hit by Year 2000 problems.
But, the company intends to offer its first 110-page-a-minute
digital copier in January, which means it will be approaching
potential customers just as their Year 2000 fears are abating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies really are holding back on purchases because of
Y2K, then we're going to have one real blowout first quarter,''
said a Timothy Andree, a Canon vice president. Six months ago,
Canon was ranked fourth in the copier industry, behind Xerox, Ricoh
and Sharp. Now, many analysts say Canon may well end the year as
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hottest products win the day, and Canon's products are the
hottest right now,'' said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst at
PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox's sales people are in poor shape to fight back. They are
grappling with a reorganization, effective in January, that makes
them responsible for specific industries and companies, not
geographic territories. On top of that, Xerox recently cut its
administrative staff, figuring that it could easily consolidate 36
administrative centers into three.
</P>
<P>
   The result was chaos. Billing errors and uncollected receivables
skyrocketed, and sales people spent their time placating angry
customers instead of cultivating new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've bungled this entire restructuring at a time when there
are just too many copier companies chasing too little business,''
Reitzes said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Xerox has not lost all its fans. Gibboney Huske, an
analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, is sticking with her buy
recommendation on Xerox stock. In fact, she predicts the share
price will hit $41 within the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox is still a good buy from the perspective of
risk-return,'' she said. ``Granted, in the last month you've seen
all the risk and none of the return, but ultimately these are
short-term issues that will be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Simek said that Xerox already had a senior management task force
working on ``more than 25 countermeasures to help us heal more
quickly and sustain earnings growth.'' For now, Simek offers no
details, other than to say the countermeasures range from
generating demand to reducing costs. He promised greater detail on
Jan. 25, when Xerox will announce its fourth-quarter earnings.

`POONA THE ... DOG': BEWARE IF SMART DOG GETS LONELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trust the Adobe Theater Company to drive from mind
any inkling of how oppressive these official holidays can be. If
you can make it to their new play at the Ohio Theater by Saturday,
its last day, the fix should hold you right through Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It is called ``Poona the ... Dog and Other Plays for Children
(Not a Play for Children).'' Not only is the full title not
printable here; neither are the names of a couple of characters.
But there are in fact two children in it, and it is impossible to
imagine that they come out of the experience scandalized or jaded.
</P>
<P>
   If the off-Broadway plays ``Duet! A Romantic Fable'' and ``Maybe
Baby, It's You'' represent high-minded good humor uptown, this is
its lowdown downtown mode, and it is irresistible. The playwright,
Jeff Goode, uses the technique of children's stories to send up
children's stories, advertising, politics, religion, runaway
capitalism, television, the Internet, the news media and a lot
more, including waiters in New York restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   He's not always right on target, but that hardly matters: Jeremy
Dobrish, the artistic director of Adobe, who is in charge here,
appears to direct by simply unleashing the unruly imaginations of
the 15 actors and certainly that of Bernard Grenier, whose costumes
include startlingly beautiful giant realizations of seldom-seen
body parts.
</P>
<P>
   It is characteristic of the humor of this group of entertainers
that there is only a single rude word in the entire dialogue and
not one obscene gesture. If you come away with lurid thoughts, you
know whose fault that is, and it is unlikely many people leave
feeling a trace of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Quinn Purcell, who starred in ``Duet,'' is a wonderful naif
as the title character, a dog who is lonely until it learns what
everyone expects from it, learns so well, in fact, that it gets a
Heisman trophy. Ms. Purcell, a veteran Adobian, may have met her
match in Peter Dinklage as the Handsome Prince Poona falls for. A
newcomer to Adobe, Dinklage, letting the audience know he is an
important figure, stirs waves of laughter before he says a word; in
fact, the sheer force of his stage presence excites some of the
mirth, and he knows how to exploit it with every gesture.
</P>
<P>
   There are no lame performances, although a couple of angels seem
a bit pale next to the vivid dragons, animals, human television
sets and computers, not to mention God, who inhabit this odd
excursion. But in retrospect Vin Knight as a children's storyteller
who goes berserk when a story happens without his telling it,
Arthur Halpern as a frog maitre d' leading a hapless diner to a
restaurant table and Arthur Aulisi as a self-doubting philosophical
shrub that in James Bond fashion outwits two pruners bent on a
chain-saw massacre are so vivid they keep popping up in the
imagination for days.
</P>
<P>
   As for action, there is plenty: the nuking of an entire nation,
revolutions, Super Bowls, volcanic dragon eruptions, family murders
and the machine-gunning of children by runaway cigarettes. The fact
that virtually every movement by every actor gets loud audience
approval says a lot about how light heavy things are in the hands
of this company.
</P>

SALLY TIMMS: A SWEET, LONELY SADNESS, BOTH PAINFUL AND ARTFUL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Sometimes I flap my wings like a hummingbird just
to remind myself I'll never fly,'' Sally Timms cooed at Maxwell's
on Friday in a song written by her fellow Chicago-based urban
rustics, the Handsome Family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Timms was the first artist on a bill representing that
tight-knit community, and right now, she's the most exciting
member. Her new album, ``Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments for Lost
Buckaroos'' (Bloodshot Records), flawlessly expresses her lonesome
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Timms blends rapture and disenchantment in a way that
recalls those old cliches about why caged birds sing. Her voice, a
secretive murmur refined by her native English accent, is the stuff
of lullabies. But her knowing stance pulls back from that intimacy
with a sweet sadness.
</P>
<P>
   At Maxwell's, singing ``Down from Dover,'' Dolly Parton's stark
tale of a stillbirth all alone, and ``In Bristol Town One Fine
Day,'' a contemporary Celtic ballad written for her by Robbie Fulks
(another Chicago luminary), Ms. Timms made the music painfully
immediate and artful. Her band was equally subtle. Jon Rauhause,
playing Dobro and mandolin, and Chris Mills, on acoustic guitar,
carved out their parts like latticework, never obscuring her voice.
The fiddler Andrew Bird gracefully bowed in step with her soft
croon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Timms broke the music's spell with the sarcastic onstage
patter that she has perfected in the veteran rock band, the Mekons.
She joked about turning 40 and needing to retire to folk music
because ``I can do it until I'm extremely old.''
</P>
<P>
   With typical self-deprecation, she declared, ``You're seeing the
pinnacle of my musical career.'' The funny thing was, so far that's
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Bird played next with his own band, Bowl of Fire. The quartet
showed off its skill at the rock-influenced swing, also explored by
the better-known Squirrel Nut Zippers, with whom Bird often
performs.
</P>
<P>
   The players, especially the drummer Kevin O'Donnell, approached
the music athletically, stressing speed and force. Bird sang in a
deadpan Hoagy Carmichael-style slur, but the band's best twist on
history evoked a different era. The new song ``Go Down Slow''
sounded like 1960s surf music, and watching Bird play power chords
on his violin was the set's high point.
</P>
<P>
   Well past midnight, the Waco Brothers clambered onstage and
turned the evening into a real blowout. The six-man band features
the singer-guitarist Jon Langford and the drummer Steve Goulding,
also Mekons members turned Chicagoans, alongside assorted
Englishmen and Midwesterners, playing raging honky-tonk.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing Marxist cowboy songs like ``Plenty Tough Union Made''
with country classics like Roy Acuff's ``Wreck on the Highway,''
the Waco Brothers showed that Americana can be as hot as whiskey
going down the throat.

EXCERPTS FROM GOP DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a candidates forum on Monday night
in Des Moines for those seeking the Republican Party's presidential
nomination, Gary Bauer, Gov. George Bush of Texas, Steve Forbes,
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, as recorded by The New York Times. Posing the questions
were Tom Brokaw of NBC News and John Bachman.
</P>
<P>
   BACHMAN: Governor Bush, you're directing a question to Senator
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: You've been talking a lot about pork in Washington. I
appreciate that. Here's my view. If you want to get rid of pork in
Washington, stop feeding the hog, that's why I have proposed a $450
billion plus tax plan, tax cut plan which you called excessive. One
of the features in my plan, John, says to the single mom with two
children making $40,000 a year, you get a 53 percent tax cut. For
single moms with children who make less than $40,000 year, get
bigger tax cuts. My question to you is, in reviewing of your plan
that's single mom with two children making $40,000 gets no tax cut,
and I'm wondering why.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Well, I think it's something that's worthy of
consideration. But I also believe that if you raise the 15 percent
tax bracket to singles or couples who make $70,000 a year that
would go a long way in that direction. It's funny you mention about
pork, because really what the American people need is their money
back. And not going to get it back until we get it out of the hands
of the special interests. These huge six- and seven-figure
donations, the $100,000 checks, the $200,000 checks that are
basically taking the government away from the people and put it
into the hands of the special interests. And it's made all these
young people so cynical and even alienated. I'll tell you what, in
all due respect to my friends here, you and I can stop that
tonight. We can commit as nominees of the party that we will have
nothing to do with soft money with these huge $100,000 checks. We
can stop it now, we commit that to that and we can get the special
interest money out of American politics. We can give the government
back to the people. I hope you make that commitment right here
tonight in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   BROKAW: You want to talk about it any more right now or you want
to wait? . ..
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I'd love to talk about it. Here's my worry with your plan:
It's going to hurt the Republican Party, John. And I'm worried for
this reason __ Let me finish.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN
</P>
<P>
   How did Ronald Reagan get elected in 1980? There's no such thing
as soft money, then.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: May I finish? The Democrat Party is really the Democrat
Party and the labor unions in America. And my worry is that you do
nothing about what's called paycheck protection. We do nothing
about saying to the labor, You can't take a laboring man's money
and spend it the way you see fit. There's a lot of laboring people
who are Republicans and conservatives. And yet, under the vision
you've got or I guess you've got, or people in Washington have,
it's O.K. that they just take their money and spend it the way they
want to spend it. I don't think it's fair. And I think that's
unilateral disarmament. I agree with you we ought not to have
corporate soft money and labor soft money. But there better be
paycheck protection. Otherwise our Republican Party and our
conservative values don't have a shot.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: I still don't know how we won in 1980, the Senate and
the presidency of the United States __
</P>
<P>
   BROKAW: May I futilely try to get control here for just a
moment. We're going to get to you. You get a question coming up in
a few moments. Then you, promise, Alan __
</P>
<P>
   KEYES: But you say _ well one brief remark though. Because if
we're going to have a colloquy we ought to all have all options on
the table. These folks actually deal with irrelevant things. The
government does not have the right to restrict our freedom of
association, which should include the right to associate our money
with the causes we believe in. And I think that this whole idea _
the whole idea that everybody here subscribes to, that they should
be regulated contributions, it's very simple: no dollar vote
without a ballot vote and publicity for all contributions. We don't
need the rest of it. We can regulate the system through our ballots
if we have the freedom to do what we should as individual voters
with our money.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The winter meetings will have come and gone
without the Astros making a deal, but plenty of groundwork will be
in place by the time general manager Gerry Hunsicker boards a
flight back to Houston this morning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A proposed trade with the Boston Red Sox involving center
fielder Carl Everett is still alive, although it may have hit a
snag Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the Astros would receive top shortstop
prospect Adam Everett and at least one other player, probably a
pitching prospect, in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the Red Sox would like to be able to negotiate a
long-term contract with Carl Everett before acquiring the
27-year-old switch hitter, who can become a free agent after the
2000 season. However, they would need the Astros' permission to
talk financial terms with Carl Everett's agent _ otherwise it would
be considered tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, who has been tight-lipped on the subject, declined
comment on any matters regarding specific trade speculation,
although his policy generally is to deny other teams permission to
negotiate with any of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes any sense for the club to do that,'' he
said. ``It gives the player all the leverage. The player has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. The team has everything to
lose and nothing to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Major League Baseball rules, a team can't talk to a player
on another team who is under contract unless a deal already is in
place and the negotiating team has written permission from the team
holding the contract.
</P>
<P>
   If permission is granted, the negotiating team has 72 hours to
strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not involved in such a situation at this time,''
Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Carl Everett nor his agent, Larry Reynolds, was
available for comment. Carl Everett spent most of the day at a
hospital with his wife, Linda, who gave birth to a baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, teams don't like to allow other clubs to
negotiate with their players when a trade is in place because it
potentially could be a deal-breaker if the negotiating club
concludes it won't be able to secure the player's services for a
long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners have taken a similar stance in their trade
discussions involving Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if permission is granted and the negotiating
club reaches an agreement with the player, the trading club might
be able to get more value in return.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Red Sox's apparent inability to negotiate with Carl
Everett, there still is a chance the deal will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are desperate for a run-producing outfielder, and
Carl Everett fits the bill. It's conceivable the Red Sox could pull
the trigger on the trade and take their chances on re-signing Carl
Everett prior to the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the ball still appears to be in the Red Sox's
court.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade does go down, it clearly would be a move aimed at
the future from the Astros' perspective. No one will argue that
trading Carl Everett _ he hit .325 with 25 home runs and 108 RBIs
in 1999 _ makes the Astros a better team in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But shortstop is a weakness in the organization, and many
baseball observers believe Adam Everett is the real deal _ his
defense, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox can afford to part with the 22-year-old shortstop,
who likely needs another year in the minors, because they are set
at shortstop with Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   One player who surfaced in speculation as a possibility to head
to Houston in the trade is lefthanded pitcher Greg Miller, 20, who
was 10-6 with a 3.10 ERA and 146 strikeouts in 137 innings last
season for the Red Sox's Class A affiliate in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is the fact the Astros eventually hope to
make room in their outfield for younger players such as Richard
Hidalgo, Daryle Ward and Lance Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's important for the club to keep an eye on the budget,
especially since Moises Alou and Derek Bell will tie up almost $12
million in 2000 and the arbitration-eligible Carl Everett could
make as much as $5 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Astros are considering trade possibilities for
players such as Carl Everett and Cy Young Award runner-up Mike
Hampton speaks more to the economic state of the game than it does
the club's evaluation of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker is quick to point out that both are key players for
the three-time defending National League Central Division
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy when you have to make personnel decisions based
on factors other than baseball talent,'' Hunsicker said. ``But
that's the nature of our business. In our present situation, the
worst thing that could happen is to have three quality players
leave us (Everett, Hampton and Bell can be free agents after the
2000 season) and we get nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not get anything back for them is not a pleasant thought.
The flip side is when you're trading players of this quality, while
you may not get players back that make you better the next year, it
might make you better in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the flip side of the Randy Johnson trade. You have to
evaluate trades like that based on the goal of the team at the
time.''
</P>

   As for his final day of work at this year's annual gathering of
baseball officials, Hunsicker said: ``I had some very interesting
conversations that could eventually lead to a trade, but we're not
there yet.''

   Here are some books that young readers will enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAT: THE HEDGIE GIFT BOX'' &QL; 
Jan Brett &QL; 
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

BIG BOOKS

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

DR. SEUSS CHARACTERS COLORED HIS EDITORIAL CARTOONS

 (STORY also moved in ``E'' category) 
 TITLE: ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War: 
 The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel''  
 Text by Richard H. Minear  (The New Press, $25)
 &HT;     By DAVE WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat's red-and-white-striped leaning tower of a
stove-pipe has become an American icon only slightly less
recognizable than the Disney mouse ears,'' contemporary cartoonist
Art Spiegelman (author of ``Maus'') writes in the introduction to
this eye-opening picture book for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the slightly battered lid on the Seuss bird that
represents the United States,'' Spiegelman writes, ``is
disorienting enough to bring on an epiphany: the prototype for the
cat's famous headgear is actually an emblem deployed in countless
political cartoons: Uncle Sam's red-and-white top hat! The Cat in
the Hat is America!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked ``Seuss bird'' is everywhere in this collection
of political cartoons, and so are prototypes of nearly all of the
other familiar Dr. Seuss characters, including Lorax and Yertl the
Turtle, the circus fish and the ubiquitous whale, but here they are
pressed into service as characters in single-panel political
satires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss, it turns out, began his career as a cartoonist for
the famous experimental daily newspaper of New York in the 1940s,
``PM,''perhaps the last left-wing paper in the country of any
circulation before it turned toes-up in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known, as we read these books to our kids and
grandkids through the decades of the Cold War, that the long-necked
Seuss bird probably made his first appearance on Sept. 22, 1941,
with a sign, ``I am part Jewish'' hanging from his beak! For it
turns out that Theodor Seuss Geisel, son of German immigrant
Republicans, was an ardent anti-fascist and critic of
America-Firsters, anti-Semites and non-interventionists of every
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember America First, it was a group of
both conservatives and liberals who opposed getting into the war in
Europe, and among its leading members was Charles Lindbergh,
against whom Seuss directed volley after withering volley, as in
the cartoon of July 16, 1941, that featured the familiar whale with
the big eyes. Here the whale is presented as a fish out of water,
an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITOR: QUOTED LINES:) Said a whale, ``There is so much commotion,
</P>
<P>
   Such fights among fish in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my scalp
</P>
<P>
   Living high on an Alp . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Dear Lindy! He gave me a notion!)''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

YEAR ENDING WITH MORE $100 MILLION MOVIES THAN EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES --Hollywood's penultimate year before the end of the
millennium was supposed to be dominated by ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _
The Phantom Menace,'' but the box office has instead sizzled due to
a wide array of unexpected hits.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ``The World Is Not Enough'' became the 17th movie to
hit $100 million in domestic ticket sales this year, underscoring
an unexpectedly powerful performance at the nation's multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   As many as five more 1999 movies could join the $100 million
club, easily beating last year's record of 18.
</P>
<P>
   And final 1999 grosses should hit a record $7.5 billion, up an
impressive 8 percent over 1998 and 18 percent over 1997, according
to Paul Dergarabedian, president of the Exhibitor Relations Co.
tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   This year's receipts have already surpassed last year's $6.95
billion even before the heavy moviegoing periods surrounding
Christmas have started.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year, I never thought we'd top the record so
easily, but now I'm no longer surprised,'' Dergarabedian said
Monday. ``The key has been the momentum that was created last
spring from `The Matrix,' `The Mummy' and `Phantom Menace.' People
have gotten increasingly interested and excited about moviegoing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' grossed nearly $430 million, or less than $50
million short of what ``Titanic'' took in during 1998. The prequel
had been expected to obliterate the competition, but it instead
served as a launching pad for Hollywood's most powerful summer
ever, generating $3.2 billion in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Phantom'' won three consecutive weekends, eight
different movies won the next eight weekends before ``The Sixth
Sense'' opened and posted spectacular results in the late summer
and early fall.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of summer releases _ ``The Blair Witch Project'' and
``The General's Daughter'' _ both topped the $100 million mark
despite never finishing in first during a single weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Fall business also topped expectations with ``Sixth Sense''
becoming the 12th overall highest grosser to date, ``Double
Jeopardy'' becoming an unexpected hit and ``Toy Story 2'' headed
for $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Media analyst Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum said,
``1999 has turned out to be a fantastic year. There have been major
turnarounds for MGM and Universal after coming off horrendous
years; animation has done well, and consumers are spending.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``The World Is Not Enough'' becoming the 199th film to pass
the $100 million milestone, Dergarabedian said the strongest
remaining possibilities for joining the club are Warner Bros.'
``The Green Mile,'' Disney's ``Bicentennial Man,'' Sony's ``Stuart
Little,'' DreamWorks' ``Galaxy Quest'' and Paramount's ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Green Mile,'' which opened last weekend to $18 million, and
``Ripley'' are contenders for Academy Awards recognition, so much
of their total grosses will likely come during 2000. ``American
Beauty,'' which has nearly $70 million, could also benefit from an
Oscar push in coming months and take in enough to top $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian noted that at this point last year, only 11 films
had topped the $100 million mark. ``That shows how strong this year
is,'' he added. ``I expect there will be another three or four from
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said the booming popularity of state-of-the-art megaplexes
_ with stadium seating, clear sight lines, bigger screens,
staggered start times and massive snack bars _ has enabled the
industry to continue increasing revenues and should continue to do
so in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors' profits have suffered because of the expense of
building new facilities, costing $1 million per screen, in order to
remain viable in terms of continuing to attract customers who now
carry much higher expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting a metamorphosis of what theaters look like, and
that's enabled entertainment to fight off the attraction of the
Internet,'' Hyman said. ``So long as that trend continues and the
economy stays strong, all Hollywood needs to do is keep releasing
quality films.''
</P>
<P>
   Increases in ticket prices do not appear to be deterring
moviegoing, Hyman said. Exhibitors raised the average price 2.4
percent last year to $4.70 and that figure is likely to have
increased this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several New York City theaters are now charging $9.50, and the
$10 ticket is just a matter of time,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian said he believes overall business can increase
again next year and noted that trailers now playing for several
year 2000 films, including ``Mission: Impossible 2,'' ``Dinosaur''
and ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' have already generated significant
excitement among customers.

   Hyman said the booming popularity of state-of-the-art megaplexes
_ with stadium seating, clear sight lines, bigger screens,
staggered start times and massive snack bars _ has enabled the
industry to continue increasing revenues and should continue to do
so in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors' profits have suffered because of the expense of
building new facilities, costing $1 million per screen, in order to
remain viable in terms of continuing to attract customers who now
carry much higher expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting a metamorphosis of what theaters look like, and
that's enabled entertainment to fight off the attraction of the
Internet,'' Hyman said. ``So long as that trend continues and the
economy stays strong, all Hollywood needs to do is keep releasing
quality films.''
</P>
<P>
   Increases in ticket prices do not appear to be deterring
moviegoing, Hyman said. Exhibitors raised the average price 2.4
percent last year to $4.70 and that figure is likely to have
increased this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several New York City theaters are now charging $9.50, and the
$10 ticket is just a matter of time,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian said he believes overall business can increase
again next year and noted that trailers now playing for several
year 2000 films, including ``Mission: Impossible 2,'' ``Dinosaur''
and ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' have already generated significant
excitement among customers.

STARS GET CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dan Marino. Charles Barkley. Ted Williams. Brett
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, this had been the core membership of the elite
fraternity of The Best Players Never To Win Rings.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can scratch Hull's name off the membership list. Hull
and the Stars received their Stanley Cup championship rings in a
private ceremony Monday night at Las Colinas Country Club, 161 days
after winning the Cup in a not-so-private, triple-overtime, Game 6
thriller against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the ring) is the symbol of it. But actually winning
it, they kind of go hand in hand,'' Hull said. ``You've got the
ring. You're a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   The ring has come to symbolize the ultimate achievement in pro
sports. Fans and players alike talk in terms of rings, not
championships. As in, does he have a ring?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Champio) is only a word. The ring is definitely the thing
that makes it official,'' said Stars forward Guy Carbonneau, owner
of three Stanley Cup championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars general manager Bob Gainey: ``The ring has become
just that, a symbol of team success, of a group of players, of a
season.''
</P>
<P>
   So how much does a little symbolism cost nowadays?
</P>
<P>
   Stars owner Tom Hicks spent just under $1 million on the almost
175 rings given to players, coaches and staff. There are three
varieties of rings. The one the players received Monday night has
five interlocking green diamonds in the middle of a gold star
surrounded by 100 pave diamonds. The players, coaches and
management also received pendants like the tops of the rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it was, I'd spend twice as much,'' Hicks said. ``I
would spend twice as much to do it again. This is a celebration,
but this is also closure. ... They're warming up. I'm really
confident the guys will be more like Detroit was than New Jersey or
the Rangers or Colorado. We may not win it this year. I think we'll
give it a tough run. We're going to be in the thick of things. They
are going to play like the defending Stanley Cup champs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, while the ring is nice, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said he didn't plan on wearing his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come over to the house, you can come look at it in the drawer.
I don't need to show off with it. I don't need people to say `Wow,
what did you win that for?' I don't need it,'' Hitchcock said. ``I
already have all of the feelings that happened. To me, nothing is
ever going to take place of watching a team come together. No
money, no ring, no trophy, no picture, nothing. The feeling of what
it was like, it is going to stay with me the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the players from that team aren't around
anymore. Wingers Pat Verbeek and Dave Reid signed with other teams
during the off-season. But 16 of the players from that team were in
attendance Monday night, and for them there was nothing quite like
the ring _ for memories, for validation but mostly for what it
symbolized.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are with you the rest of your life, and nobody
can take it away from you,'' Stars' Conn Smythe winner Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ``It's a great reminder of what special bond you
have with 24 other guys. Those are the things you take with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars forward Mike Modano said as good as holding the Cup was,
the ring was better. ``The Cup comes and goes, but the ring always
stays,'' Modano said. nn

COWBOYS REGROUP AFTER INJURIES TO ELLIS, SMITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Somewhat sobering the mood at Valley Ranch on
Monday, the day after a 20-10 victory against the Philadelphia
Eagles, was the realization that the Cowboys must finish the season
without blossoming defensive end Greg Ellis and the uncertain
status of star running back Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who suffered a fractured tibia when teammate Alonzo
Spellman rolled over his leg in the first quarter, underwent
surgery Sunday night to place a rod in his leg. Not only will he
miss the final three games _ starting Sunday against the New York
Jets _ but he is expected to be sidelined through training camp
next year. The Cowboys are targeting his return for the start of
the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Ellis, the team's top pick in
1998 and sack leader this season with 7.5, was playing at a Pro
Bowl level and his play and attitude will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was having an exceptional year,'' Gailey said. ``He was a
guy that gives you everything he has. We will lose some intangible
factors not having him on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who strained his groin on the first play of the game
against the Eagles, is listed as questionable for the Jets. Gailey
doesn't know if Smith will be able to practice this week, saying
his status will be evaluated daily.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gailey and Cowboys are confident in backup Chris Warren,
who replaced Smith on Sunday and gained 92 yards on 25 carries,
they are looking at the final three games as must-wins. And they
need Smith, the league's third all-time leading rusher and second
all-time leading touchdown scorer, in the lineup. Gailey said he
has no idea if Smith will be able to play against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait and see how he feels in the next two
days,'' Gailey said. ``It will depend how much he can do on the
practice field.'' Allen could return No matter who is running the
ball, the Cowboys could be boosted by the possible return of
All-Pro guard Larry Allen, who has missed the past four games with
a sprained knee. Allen is listed as questionable. Chan Gailey said
the team will get a better idea of Allen's status in practice
Wednesday and Thursday. NOW AT LEFT CORNERBACK ...
</P>
<P>
   It continues to be a revolving door at left cornerback. Kevin
Mathis, who started Sunday against the Eagles, suffered a sprained
knee on a kickoff return and is expected to be sidelined at least
one game.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis was starting in place of Kevin Smith, who missed the past
three games with a strained hamstring. Smith, who has started seven
games at the position, is expected to return Sunday. Reserve
cornerback Charlie Williams, who has started three games there,
will start if Smith can't. REPLACING ELLIS
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman seems to be the logical choice
to replace Greg Ellis at end.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman played end for the first six years of his career before
being moved to tackle in training camp to replace Leon Lett, who
was suspended for the first eight games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With Lett seemingly returning to his Pro Bowl form, the Cowboys
are considering moving Spellman to end. However, Chan Gailey said
its not an easy decision because Spellman is playing at a Pro Bowl
level at tackle and they are hesitant about moving a player who is
dominant at one position to take a chance on him not being dominant
at another.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also like the production they are getting from their
standout tackle rotation of Lett, Spellman and Chad Hennings and
are reluctant to disrupt it.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cowboys have gotten solid production from backup
tackles Brandon Noble and Michael Myers, and the need is greater at
end, where rookies Ebenezer Ekuban and Peppi Zellner are the other
possible choices to replace Ellis and start opposite Kavika
Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys will make a decision on Spellman before
practice Wednesday but admitted they might not reveal their plans
this week in attempt to keep the Jets guessing. COWBOYS VISIT
HOSPITALS
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case all season, the Cowboys get an extra day
off after a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys players spent their free time after Sunday's victory
against the Eagles visiting children at several area hospitals,
namely Children's Medical Center, Parkland Memorial Hospital,
Scottish Rite Hospital, Medical City Hospital, all in Dallas, and
Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Raghib Ismail, linebacker Dat Nguyen and defensive end
Ebenezer Ekuban were among a group of 20 players who visited the
children's hospital in Fort Worth. Community relations director
Emily Robbins said the hospital visits, which also include the
Cowboys Cheerleaders, are an annual event for the Cowboys. She said
the players signed autographs and presented the children with
stockings stuffed trading cards, pictures and other gifts. nn

DR. SEUSS CHARACTERS COLORED HIS EDITORIAL CARTOONS

 (STORY also moved in ``K'' category) 
 TITLE: ``Dr. Seuss Goes to War: 
 The World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel''  
 Text by Richard H. Minear  (The New Press, $25)
 &HT;     By DAVE WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat's red-and-white-striped leaning tower of a
stove-pipe has become an American icon only slightly less
recognizable than the Disney mouse ears,'' contemporary cartoonist
Art Spiegelman (author of ``Maus'') writes in the introduction to
this eye-opening picture book for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the slightly battered lid on the Seuss bird that
represents the United States,'' Spiegelman writes, ``is
disorienting enough to bring on an epiphany: the prototype for the
cat's famous headgear is actually an emblem deployed in countless
political cartoons: Uncle Sam's red-and-white top hat! The Cat in
the Hat is America!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-necked ``Seuss bird'' is everywhere in this collection
of political cartoons, and so are prototypes of nearly all of the
other familiar Dr. Seuss characters, including Lorax and Yertl the
Turtle, the circus fish and the ubiquitous whale, but here they are
pressed into service as characters in single-panel political
satires.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss, it turns out, began his career as a cartoonist for
the famous experimental daily newspaper of New York in the 1940s,
``PM,''perhaps the last left-wing paper in the country of any
circulation before it turned toes-up in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known, as we read these books to our kids and
grandkids through the decades of the Cold War, that the long-necked
Seuss bird probably made his first appearance on Sept. 22, 1941,
with a sign, ``I am part Jewish'' hanging from his beak! For it
turns out that Theodor Seuss Geisel, son of German immigrant
Republicans, was an ardent anti-fascist and critic of
America-Firsters, anti-Semites and non-interventionists of every
stripe.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't remember America First, it was a group of
both conservatives and liberals who opposed getting into the war in
Europe, and among its leading members was Charles Lindbergh,
against whom Seuss directed volley after withering volley, as in
the cartoon of July 16, 1941, that featured the familiar whale with
the big eyes. Here the whale is presented as a fish out of water,
an ``isolationist'' whale who lives way up on top of a mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(EDITOR: QUOTED LINES:) Said a whale, ``There is so much commotion,
</P>
<P>
   Such fights among fish in the ocean,
</P>
<P>
   I'm saving my scalp
</P>
<P>
   Living high on an Alp . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Dear Lindy! He gave me a notion!)''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight years after his death, Dr. Seuss still has more than 50-plus
titles still in print, and, in fact, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is said
to be the third-largest selling book in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This collection, with commentary by Richard H. Minear, is an
illuminating look at the politics of the early 1940s from an oddly
familiar voice, and it may even provide some clues to the deeper
meanings of the good doctor's less obviously political children's
tales. &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IN theory, the guy who changed his mind was a perfect fit for the
University of Houston. Bob Pruett had the coaching credentials and
the right demographics in his corner. At 57, he already was much
too old to use UH as a stopover en route to a more prestigious
posting.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, so much for theory. Pruett held the Cougars job for just
long enough to, no doubt, finagle a sweeter deal for himself at
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   It's always risky business to attempt to steal a man from his
alma mater, where blood runs thicker than Gatorade. However, since
Chet Gladchuk left his _ Boston College _ to tackle the many
challenges UH presents, the Cougars' athletic director had no
qualms about giving it a go. Fortunately, he was ready with a Plan
B. (A Plan C and a Plan D, too, but no matter now.)
</P>
<P>
   Dana Dimel comes to us from that well-established cradle of
coaches nestled among the Rocky Mountains _ the University of
Wyoming _ with an impressive resume he's not bashful about
reciting. The most salient fact is that Dimel won 11 more games
than he lost in three seasons while recruiting about as many kids
out of Texas as Kim Helton persuaded to play for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   If Dimel can survive the culture shock of moving from Laramie _
he resided in Manhattan, Kan., before that _ to the Big City, he
should do fine by the Cougars. He promises a wide-open, exciting,
points-galore offense, although it's hard to imagine a new coach
anywhere admitting he intends to be dull and plodding.
</P>
<P>
   He also promises to sell tickets, and considering his new town
has about 10 times as many people as his previous state, you can
see whence his boundless optimism springs.
</P>
<P>
   The former goal is achievable from the get-go, with
strong-armed, clear-headed Jason McKinley returning for his senior
season and bubbling over with enthusiasm after hearing how Dimel
intends to ``spread the field.'' The latter objective, alas, will
prove far more problematic, certainly at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel may set the Cougars on a course for national prominence.
He may put a sufficient number of fannies in the Robertson Stadium
seats to justify his five-year, $3 million deal. But it's rather
unlikely to happen overnight, a la Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Osborne or perhaps Dimel's former boss at Kansas State, Bill
Snyder, the glam rumors du jour of last week, might _ might _ have
induced Drexleresque hysteria, but Dimel will find Houston to be
very much a ``show-me'' kind of place. It's impossible he will
generate more fireworks than Jugular John Jenkins did a decade ago,
and remember how poorly attended most of those games were.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are nobody woke up Monday morning, saw the Chronicle
headline ``Dimel takes UH coaching reins'' and immediately pulled
on a scarlet sweatshirt, then headed to the telephone to order
season tickets. Rather, most folks asked, ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   Although a known commodity in football circles, Dimel will have
to prove himself, something Helton never fully accomplished. And in
the process of doing so, odds are he will attract the attention of
other universities with higher profiles, more imposing stadiums and
deeper pockets. At 37, he is exactly what Pruett wasn't _
figuratively and, as things turned out, literally.
</P>
<P>
   A coach who's going places.
</P>
<P>
   Should Dimel prove as solid a choice as the university needs him
to be, he probably won't be here long. He left Wyoming two seasons
before his contract expired there, costing Houston $200,000 for the
buyout. If he can't cut the Cougars' mustard? That's not to be
cheered either, obviously, because UH is about out of opportunities
to make its program viable.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk is banking heavily on college football coming to its
senses and instituting a playoff system three or four years down
the road. In same, Conference USA would have guaranteed entree,
meaning its champion could compete on equal footing with the ``big
boys,'' at least in the sense that its dreams could be dashed only
on an actual playing field, not by some geek's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Dimel spoke of whupping TCU, SMU and Rice while at Wyoming and
coaxed a loud rise out of the packed house of boosters attending
his news conference Monday by saying he intends to add a Bevo skin
to his collection next season. Toward that end, his mission is
clear: He has to convince the local high school heroes they need to
stay here instead of going to Austin or College Station.
</P>
<P>
   While you're tempted to say, ``Fat chance,'' he somehow lured 18
Texans to Laramie, which never has been confused with Maui.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk should be commended for making his decision with an
open mind, and for having options after Pruett's bizarre U-turn.
After Drexler, there was tremendous pressure on him to stay ``in
house'' with this hire, giving rise to the ludicrous speculation
that either Andre Ware or David Klingler would land the job, never
mind their conspicuous lack of coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   The AD insists he got a man he really wanted, even if the man _
or men, assuming the Osborne-Snyder talk had an iota of validity _
he most wanted got away. ``I don't know anything but winning,''
Dimel bragged, adding he fully expects the trend to continue
despite this latest drastic change of scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Except, as they say, it ain't bragging when you do it, and Dana
Dimel has.

AKERS ENSHRINED IN ``SEATTLE WALK OF FAME'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MEREDITH BAGLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The lines to see Santa got a little shorter at
Nordstrom Monday afternoon as World Cup and Olympic champion soccer
star Michelle Akers was inducted into the store's ``Seattle Walk of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers joins 28 other notable Seattle figures, from Jimi Hendrix
to Bill Gates, whose footprints have been bronzed into the sidewalk
outside the downtown store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of ties in Seattle,'' Akers said. ``The fans here
have been incredibly supportive and excited about my success, and
this award is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers, who was recently named the CONCACAF 1999 Female Player of
the Century, is a 1984 graduate of Shorecrest High School. Akers
attended the University of Central Florida, where she was a three
time All-America selection.
</P>
<P>
   Akers is the all-time scoring leader in Women's World Cup
history and one of only four players, male or female, to score more
than 100 goals in international competition. She scored two goals
in the 1999 World Cup and had to be helped off the field after her
effort in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the World Cup was beyond my wildest dreams,''
said Akers, who also played on U.S. teams that won the inaugural
women's World Cup and the 1996 Olympic gold medal. ``It's just been
a whirlwind since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Sports Illustrated named Akers and her teammates
Sportswomen of the Year. The award is for those who symbolize in
character and performance the ideals of sportsmanship. They are the
first female team to win the award in its 45-year history and join
the 1980 men's Olympic hockey team as the only teams so honored.
</P>
<P>
   Akers was not scheduled to take part in the World Cup team's
Victory Tour games due to a chronic knee injury that required
physical therapy. She was released for play in early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 12 or 13 surgeries on that knee,'' Akers said. ``It's
pretty thrashed, and my release was contingent upon me not being
stupid out on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers has had to deal with serious family illness since the
World Cup. In August, her father was diagnosed with colon cancer
and underwent surgery. Akers was on vacation at the time, but flew
back to Seattle to be with her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned to have some rest time, but I really haven't had a
break yet,'' Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the original members of the U.S. National Team, Akers has
said she will retire after the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   As for her future, Akers has many ideas but no firm plans. One
thing she is sure of is that soccer will continue to be a part of
her life. Akers is the founder of Soccer Outreach International, a
program that works with youth teams to help develop leadership
skills through service projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with kids who are underprivileged or sick, and giving
them hope and something real to base their life on, that's what I
love to do,'' Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   Akers also has dreams of buying land for a ranch, and recently
purchased her second horse. She also is considering coaching and
wants to stay involved with the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Olympic gold is great,'' Akers said. ``But you've got to
look at what's really important and base your life on that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sonics center Horace Grant is almost always content.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are NASA will hear from Mars before you see Grant in a
cranky mood. It took a strained ligament in his left knee to change
Grant's disposition the past week, somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   However, Grant is apparently off the emotional roller coaster
he's been riding lately.
</P>
<P>
   While Grant's knee is not 100-percent healthy, the 6-foot-10
center will take the court Tuesday night against the Denver Nuggets
after sitting out three of the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Grant is more certain he can be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Grant did not play last Saturday in the Sonics' 92-88 win
against Miami. The day before, Grant took himself out of a loss at
Utah after playing the first quarter _ the knee was weak and left
him ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting treatment twice a day, and I went out and
tested it (Sunday),'' Grant said. ``Dwight (Daub, the team's
strength coach) took me through some good drills. There's a little
pain still there. But it's nothing I can't play with. ... Against
Utah, there were things I couldn't do, like jump off my feet
quickly and cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I went up and down (the court) with the guys (Monday). I
had some contact. I was able to twist and turn. I'm still not 100
percent, but I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the Sonics have resembled Grant: Up and down.
</P>
<P>
   They lost at home to Charlotte, beat Minnesota, dropped a game
at Utah, then beat the Heat last week. Suddenly, the factors that
helped the Sonics throughout their 15-6 start are working against
them.
</P>
<P>
   On average, opponents are shooting and rebounding better than
the Sonics. Opposing teams have fared better at the foul line and
beyond the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics have yet to lose two games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's competitiveness ... finding a way to win games. That's
the No. 1 statistic. The rest of them are clues,'' Sonics coach
Paul Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics must play fast and tenacious basketball. Rebounding,
running and scoring in transition are key, as is exhibiting a
decent defensive presence down low with or without Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Against Miami, the Sonics took advantage of mismatches in the
lineup to prevent Alonzo Mourning from dominating the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets (10-10) are a much-improved team, well-known to the
Sonics because Seattle struggled _ losing two of four _ against
Denver last season. Forwards Antonio McDyess and Ron Mercer and
guards Chauncey Billups and Nick Van Exel make up as talented a
group as any other in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest difference in Denver can be seen away from
the Pepsi Center. The Nuggets are no longer a bargain-basement
bunch. They finished last week's five-game East-Coast trip with a
3-2 record, including wins against the New York Knicks and
Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had won just two road games in each of the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dangerous,'' Westphal said. ``They're starting to get
wins on the road this year. They have a lot of balance and creative
players when everything breaks down. They've got a lot of players
capable of keeping you from doubling their stars because they can
hit the 3. They're just a real dangerous team that can score from a
lot of different positions.''
</P>
<P>
   One could make the argument that the Sonics are just as
dangerous, because recently it is difficult to figure them out.
</P>
<P>
   With Grant on the floor, the team at least should find
equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of (the inconsistency) was Horace being out. He's such a
consistent player that played a big part,'' Westphal said. ``The
other part is some of these teams are pretty good. If they're
having a hot game when we're not having a good game, we can get
beat. That's what happened in the Lakers game (Nov. 30), the
Charlotte game (Dec. 5). ... Not having Horace, we didn't adjust
right. And the same thing in Utah (Dec. 10). The Miami game and the
Minnesota game (Dec. 8), we hit on a way that we can play and be
effective. That's how we have to play all the time.''

SKIDDING SEAHAWKS SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Chad Brown wore the Seahawks' three-game
losing streak like a hair shirt Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the team's leading tackler entered the locker room, his eyes
were fixed on the floor. His face was sullen. His gait was
deliberate. He looked as if he hadn't slept well, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he was perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not a good day,'' Brown said. ``Three in a row at
this point in the season when we need to try and separate ourselves
from the rest of the AFC West opponents and seal up this playoff
thing. December is when you want to play your best football.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his anger is obvious. The once 8-2 Seahawks have
lost three in a row to squander their three-game lead in the AFC
West and allow themselves to be caught by the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a three-game season. The Seahawks still control their
destiny. They're still in first place. Win two straight, and they
win the division.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic words flowed from the players' mouths again
Monday, less than 24 hours after they had dropped a disheartening
and potentially disastrous 19-16 decision to the San Diego Chargers
at the Kingdome. They were the updated assessments of what had been
offered after the losses to the Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the looks on the players' faces and their body language
while reiterating the party line betrayed them.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are blowing an opportunity that this franchise has
longed for during 10 playoff-less seasons, the past eight without
so much as a winning record. Their three-game lead with six to play
is now a no-game lead with three to play _ starting with their game
against the Broncos in Denver this week and then the Dec. 26
rematch with the Chiefs at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Three consecutive losses, each worse than the previous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still right there for us to take, but we've definitely
dug ourselves a deep hole that we've got to get out of,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kind of exposed ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That they have. Opponents now know the way to beat the Seahawks
is to stop the run and blitz quarterback Jon Kitna, and do things
offensively that make it difficult for the defense to communicate
in the din of the Kingdome _ such as the no-huddle approach the
Chargers used Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to fix some things,'' Brown said. ``Because teams
are going to come in and do these things against us because we
haven't stopped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown says it's a matter of every player on the team looking in
the mirror and asking what he can do to improve and help the team
shake its slump. He said it after the game Sunday. He said it in
the locker room Monday. The last time he had used that analogy was
last November, after a tough-to-swallow loss to the Raiders at the
Kingdome. It was the game that marked the beginning of the end for
coach Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be a coaching change at the end of this season. But
if coach Mike Holmgren doesn't find a way to apply the breaks to
this skid, the season will end well short of everyone's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest problems that must not only be addressed but
corrected are the defense's sudden inability to pressure or contain
opposing quarterbacks and the offense's self-destructive tendencies
once it gets near the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   First, the defense. After collecting 30 sacks and 21
interceptions in their first 11 games, the Seahawks have one sack
and two interceptions in the past two games. Raiders quarterback
Rich Gannon and the Chargers' Jim Harbaugh have combined to
complete 66 percent of their passes while compiling a QB rating of
88.4 _ after the Seahawks had held their first 11 opponents to 53.8
percent completions and a 62.6 rating, among the lowest in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says it's a matter of being aggressive. Or in the case of
the defense the past two weeks, a lack of aggressiveness. Holmgren
points out that aggressive is tied to the secondary being able to
play man-to-man coverage, and to do that the defensive backs must
he healthy. That was not the case Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you force the offense to think about what you're going to
do, instead of focusing on what they are trying to do to you, it's
a different mindset,'' Brown said. ``It's a different mentality
when they're reacting to you instead of you reacting to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like teams to watch film and look at our defense and
go, `Wow, what are we going to do with those guys? How are we going
to stop those guys?'''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case earlier this season, when the Seahawks were
among the league leaders in forcing turnovers and creating big
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people are watching film and probably saying, `We can do a
lot to these guys,''' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the offense, the Seahawks turned the ball over only twice
against the Chargers _ after having 10 in the losses to the Bucs
and Raiders. But each was costly, for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna threw a pass in the first quarter that was intercepted at
the Chargers' 12-yard line to waste both a 42-yard kickoff return
by rookie Charlie Rogers and another scoring opportunity inside the
opponents' 20. Ricky Watters lost a fumble in the fourth quarter at
the Seattle 26 to set up John Carney's game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it's been turnovers,'' Holmgren said when asked for
the difference between the team's five-game winning streak and
three-game losing streak. ``You could make a strong case that
turnovers cost us all three games.''

COWBOYS' MOTTO DOWN STRETCH: DON'T LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 RUN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dave Campo has cut to the chase.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys' defensive coordinator has reduced the
``goals'' posted in the team's locker room from a dozen categories
to one:
</P>
<P>
   ``Win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken all the goals off our board. All we're doing now
is turning the opponent's helmet belly-up when we beat 'em,'' Campo
said. ``We've stopped keeping track of all that other stuff like
rushing average, passing average, getting at least two turnovers
per game, holding (the opposition) to 17 points or less ...
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're doing now is bellying-up the other team's helmet
whenever we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo uses 3-inch magnetic helmets to depict wins and losses
across a metal board. The Philadelphia Eagles' helmet was
ceremoniously turned upside-down Monday morning at Valley Ranch
after the Cowboys' 20-10 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys found out late Sunday night (as soon as Minnesota
lost to Kansas City, 31-28, on the final play of the game) that if
they can turn the remaining three helmets on their schedule
belly-up, they are in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Cowboys control their own destiny in terms
of advancing as an NFC wild card, just not in terms of making the
postseason as the NFC East champion.
</P>
<P>
   With three games remaining, Washington (8-5) leads the division.
The Cowboys and the New York Giants are tied for second at 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal: St. Louis (11-2) has the best record in the
conference. Tampa Bay is next is next at 9-4, followed by Detroit
and Washington at 8-5. Four other teams, including the Cowboys, can
also win 10 or more games by winning out.
</P>
<P>
   But because of two remaining games that involve four teams
currently 7-6 _ Green Bay at Minnesota on Monday night and Giants
at Cowboys on Jan. 2 _ two of the four are assured of not finishing
with 10 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the list of possible 10-game-or-more winners is
reduced to six, matching the number of playoff teams (three
division winners and three wild cards) from each conference.
</P>
<P>
   In Campo's way of thinking, defense is the best way to count on
getting the job done down the stretch because of the nature of
must-win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs, and even down the stretch, just about every
play of every game is a potential difference-maker,'' Campo said.
``So coaches tend to be more conservative, and scores tend to be
lower. (Offensive) coaches are a little more reluctant to take a
shot downfield on third-and-two or third-and-one than they are
earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the teams that have a better defense have a better chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey approaches the New York Jets game at Texas
Stadium on Sunday as ``must-win,'' just as he will approach the New
Orleans road game Christmas Eve and the Giants game Jan. 2 the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I believe we are (taking each of these remaining games
as must-win),'' Gailey said. ``That may not necessarily be the
truth, but we're playing it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense showed improvement Sunday in attacking
downfield in the passing game with six pass plays of 16 or more
yards. The Cowboys also scored as two offensive touchdowns in a
game for the first time in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey acknowledged that Sunday was merely a step in the right
direction for the offense. Penalties must be eliminated. The
passing game must function on a more consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been outperforming the offense most of the
season, evidenced by the fact that the Cowboys have lost four games
this season in which the opponent was held to 13 points. The last
time that happened _ three weeks ago at Arizona (13-9) _ Campo
chucked all the goals except for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find a way to win,'' he said. ``All we're talking about now is
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys can still win the division title. In the case of a
tie between two or more teams within the same division, the first
tiebreaker is head-to-head results. The Cowboys own that tiebreaker
against the Redskins, having defeated them twice, just as the
Redskins own that tiebreaker against the Giants (2-0), while the
Giants (1-0) and Cowboys have a second meeting Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The second tiebreaker involving two or more teams from the same
division is best divisional record. The Redskins are 5-3 against
NFC East opponents, the Cowboys 4-3, and the Giants 3-4.
</P>
<P>
   Only the NFC East and AFC West do not have a team that can
clinch a playoff berth this week.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty four of the NFL's 31 teams are in contention for a
playoff spot with three weeks remaining. Only Atlanta, Cincinnati,
Cleveland, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco
have been elimininated. nn

MAVERICKS' FINLEY PUTTING TOGETHER ALL-STAR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Michael Finley is in a zone. Maybe even ``the'' zone.
</P>
<P>
   During the past seven games, the Mavericks' leading scorer is
averaging 23.7 points, 9.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 1.9 steals
per game. In the Mavericks' three victories during that span,
Finley is averaging 31.6 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   And he's playing hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching staff expects all three of those categories to be
high on the stat sheets every night for me, and I like that
responsibility,'' Finley said. ``Confidence comes with hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the type of hard work that I put in this summer to put me
in game conditioning and put me in game situations where I know
what to do and what my strengths are. I'm just stepping up to the
plate and doing those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditioning seems to have helped Finley overcome plantar
faciatis _ inflammation in his right foot. That's the same injury
that has ruined many careers, and the same injury that sidelined
Phoenix Suns guard Penny Hardaway last week.
</P>
<P>
   Finley hurriedly ices his foot after every game, and said his
foot feels ``all right.'' But those that know him know better and
know of Finley's high tolerance for pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept the intensity going,'' Cedric Ceballos said of
Finley's game Saturday against Phoenix, which included 33 points,
14 rebounds and 10 assists. ``We'd have dropoffs and relax, but he
just kept going and kept playing and doing everything for us.
That's what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley scored 30 points in a victory at Chicago on Dec. 2 that
followed a triple-double (14 points, 11 assists and 12 rebounds) in
a loss to Cleveland on Nov. 30, the start of the seven-game hot
streak. He had 32 in a victory at Minnesota on Dec. 4 and 29 in a
loss to Milwaukee the next night.
</P>
<P>
   Ever humble, Finley tries to downplay his importance to the
Mavericks. But they'll likely need another All-Star-like
performance from the Chicago native when they play host to the
defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs on Tuedsay night at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately for me my shots were falling down,'' Finley said
of his dominating output against the Suns, who drafted him No. 1 in
1995. ``I had good opportunities to rebound, and I was doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I was getting guys the ball they were knocking down
shots. It was just whatever it took for my team to win.''
</P>
<P>
   What Finley has accomplished the past two weeks is what the
Mavericks need in their go-to guy. And he said he still has a ways
to go to be the player he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game is improving,'' Finley said. ``My game is still not to
a point where I want it to be. The coaching staff is putting the
ball in my hands and giving me opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson has been basking in
the glow of Finley's all-around game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been playing well lately, and we really need that from
Fin,'' Nelson said. ``He's been playing like an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's numbers are coming at a time when opponents know he's
going to get the ball. He also is facing all sorts of gimmick
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams try to play me one-on-one, and some teams would
rather go to a double-team situation,'' Finley said. ``They try to
mix it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they double-team me I'm unselfish enough to find the open
teammates. And when they're knocking it down, it just makes us an
even tougher team.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's effort coincided with the end of the coaching reign of
Danny Ainge, who resigned as the Suns coach Monday. After
Saturday's curtain-closing loss to the Mavericks, Ainge said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael hurt us bad. I think his eyes light up when he plays
against Phoenix sometimes. The basket got big and he was knocking
down things from everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said he doesn't worry about the added minutes he's
playing, which included the full 48 minutes four times the past two
weeks. He also is not concerned that he leads the NBA in minutes
played at 41.6 per game.
</P>
<P>
   More important for Finley is to get the Mavericks pointed in the
right direction. And he points out that there's no better time than
this five-game homestand, which finishes with games against the
Spurs, New York, Minnesota and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to win games at home,'' Finley said. ``Coming off the
grueling road trip that we had _ with the losses _ our confidence
may have been shaken up a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to come here and play the way we did at home (against
Phoenix), it sets a good tone for our homestand. When we usually
come out of the box good early, it's a good indication that things
are going to go our way.'' nn

TRENT SET FOR DEBUT TONIGHT VS. SPURS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A familiar face will be on the Reunion Arena court for
the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward Gary Trent will play in his first regular-season
game of the season against the San Antonio Spurs. Trent has not
played since tearing his left hamstring during an Oct. 21 preseason
game against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said: ``He's probably
going to play, but limited minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson doesn't want to rush Trent because the 6-foot-8,
250-pounder is still rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a leg injury, you're not allowed to run or
play,'' Trent said. ``So it's easy to get rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to rebound and run, and the other things should
come naturally. I want to let the game come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent averaged 16 points and 7.8 rebounds last season and
finished third behind Orlando guard Darrell Armstrong and
Philadelphia guard Eric Snow in the NBA's Most Improved Player
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have been using a more full-court style without
Trent, but his style is more suited to half-court strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just going to have to find his niche,'' guard Michael
Finley said. ``I think he's an intelligent basketball player who
knows it's not going to come overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to come in his first game back and give us 48
minutes, and we know that. We're just going to have to groom him
into playing in game conditions, but I don't think he's going to
affect us negatively.'' FINLEY'S STREAK
</P>
<P>
   An injury forced Chicago guard Hersey Hawkins' ironman streak to
end this past weekend at 527 consecutive games played.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley is No. 3 on the active list of consecutive games
played. Finley will play in his 320nd consecutive game Tuesday
against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavericks forward A.C. Green _ now with the Los Angeles
Lakers _ is the overall leader with 1,050 consecutive games played.
San Antonio's Terry Porter is second with 352 consecutive games
played.
</P>
<P>
   Finley will participate in an on-line chat tomorrow at 2 p.m. on
NBA.com.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Todd Zeile is gone and Aaron Sele is unsigned
but the Rangers did accomplish one goal before leaving baseball's
winter meetings.
</P>
<P>
   They picked up a fourth outfielder and possible leadoff hitter
when they acquired World Series hero Chad Curtis from the New York
Yankees on Monday for minor-league pitchers Brandon Knight and Sam
Marsonek.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gritty type of player,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``He gives us versatility and depth. He also brings a
personality to our ballclub. He's got a couple of championship
rings, hopefully that will rub off on our ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, taking over Roberto Kelly's role, gives the Rangers a
veteran backup for rookie center fielder Ruben Mateo and right
fielder Gabe Kapler. A right-handed hitter, Melvin said Curtis
should also see time as a designated hitter against left-handed
pitchers, particularly while batting leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he had a .400 on-base percentage against
left-handers,'' Melvin said. ``That's a role we're looking to fill.
He's batted at the top of the order before, we know he can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, 31, hit .262 with five home runs and 24 runs batted in
in 195 at-bats for the Yankees last season, playing 72 games in
left field, six in center and three in right. He also stole eight
bases, giving him 202 in his eight-year major-league career. He had
21 in 1998 and a career-high of 48 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He also has some power as he showed in Game 3 of the World
Series this year. The Yankees were trailing 5-1 in the fifth inning
when Curtis started the comeback with a home run off Braves pitcher
Tom Glavine. He also finished it with a 10th-inning game-winning
homer off reliever Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial response was looking at what I was leaving,''
Curtis said. ``I had a pretty good time in New York. We won a
couple of championships, and I established relationships with some
good people. My first reaction was I will miss those things. But if
I was going to list the top-10 teams I wanted to go to, Texas would
have been among them. And probably at the high end.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was a starter for the first five years of his career with
the California Angels and Detroit Tigers before being used as a
fourth outfielder with the Yankees. He has wanted the opportunity
to be a regular again but said he understands that he will be a
reserve with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going in there to try to win as much playing time as
possible and help the team win,'' Curtis said. ``If there are three
guys out there who have a better chance of helping the team win,
I'd like to have them out there. But I'm still going to try and
show the manager that I want to play as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis is signed for two more years at $1.9 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Marsonek, 21, was one of two first-round draft picks for the
Rangers in 1996 but his progress was slowed considerably by
injuries. He needed reconstructive elbow surgery in 1998 and
appeared in just four games. He was 3-9 with a 5.54 earned-run
average in 15 games for Class-A Port Charlotte this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the toughest part of the deal,'' Melvin said. ``A
first-round pick could come back to haunt you. He's someone we feel
could pitch in the big leagues but he's a little farther away. He
wasn't going to help us immediately and we needed a fourth
outfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, 24, was 9-8 with a 4.91 ERA for Triple-A Oklahoma last
season and wasn't expected to compete for a major-league job in
spring training. But Melvin heard the Rangers might lose him for
$50,000 in Monday's Rule V draft and pressed to get the trade done.

PITCHERS FIND FREE-AGENT MARKET SLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Greg Vaughn, the best hitter on the free-agent
market, signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, the best pitcher on the market, continues to look
for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's winter meetings were supposed to produce a flurry of
activity, with agents shopping their players to the assembled
general managers. The setting did land new jobs for Vaughn, who
received a four-year, $34 million deal from Tampa Bay, and Todd
Zeile, who got $18 million over three years from the New York Mets.
But there has been absolutely no movement among free-agent
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been less activity this winter on the free-agent
market front than I've seen in years,'' Indians general manager
John Hart said. ``I don't remember it being this slow.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely to speed up before the meetings wrap up Tuesday.
Some general managers left town Monday night, and most of the rest
are departing Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, Randy Johnson had signed with the
Arizona Diamondbacks and Kevin Brown with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
This year, Finley, Aaron Sele, Kenny Rogers and the rest of the
pitching class of '99 remain unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to shed any tears. They won't be showing up on
the welfare rolls or in the soup kitchens. Eventually, the will all
get their millions.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, just maybe, they won't get the millions they want.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the GMs aren't playing the game. That would be the
game where the agent says I want $10 million a year for my client,
and the GM says no one day, maybe the next and OK the third.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, though, and not for these pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is slow, it's because of the lack of available
superstars on the marketplace,'' said agent Jeff Moorad, who
doesn't represent any of the unsigned pitchers. ``There are a
number of quality players available; however, this class lacks
luster. As a result, you're not going to have the bang-bang-bang
signings right out of the chute.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: teams aren't willing to spend superstar money for
non-superstar talent.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame the agents for asking. After all, Moorad
engineered the trade between the Dodgers and Blue Jays for two of
his clients, right fielders Shawn Green and Raul Mondesi, and then
got LA to sign Green to a six-year, $84 million extension. The
Yankees gave David Cone a one-year, $12 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers gave out that $14 million contract and the Yankees
gave out that $12 million contract, so everyone is going `Fine, I
might not be worth $15 million, or $12 million, but $10 million is
looking pretty good,' '' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   It looks pretty good to Finley's agent, Tim Shannon. That's what
he wants for each of the next three seasons for his client.
</P>
<P>
   But although Finley generally is considered the best pitcher
available, he's also 37 years old, and he's not seen as a player
who can take a team to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon spent the past four days working the hotel lobby and
meeting with GMs, telling everyone who listened that his client was
prepared to sign with the first club that produced the magic
number. He tried to force the issue with a campaign of
misinformation, saying the Yankees, the Dodgers and the Rangers are
interested. They're not, at least not at anything close to the
asking price.
</P>
<P>
   He did receive offers from the Mariners, Orioles and Indians
that, according to the rumor mill, began at $22 million for three
years and crept closer to $27 million. No one, though, hit the
magic number, and Finley remains unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be any day now,'' Shannon said. ``It could take a
day, it could be a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the rest of the free-agent pitchers remain on hold,
waiting for a Finley signing that could ignite bidding wars for
their services.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the GMs refuse to play the game, it could be a long
wait. nn

CLIPPERS END LOSING STREAK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers' lottery positioning was
horribly sabotaged Monday night when they were goaded into a 102-90
victory by the high-draft-pick hoggin' Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   As the showcase event of the NBA's evening (it happened to be
the only game scheduled opposite ``Monday Night Football'' and
``Ally McBeal''), two of the best 4-16 teams the league had to
offer reinvented the sport in front of 9,303 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reactionary cartwheels were preempted when guard
Derek Anderson limped off the court with 16 points and a bad ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The signature culprits in helping end the Clips' convincing
nine-game losing streak were point guard Troy Hudson (18 points, a
season-high 11 assists), center Michael Olowokandi (16 points, 10
rebounds) and power forward Maurice Taylor (a season-high 26
points, 8 rebounds), who admitted his team's recent trail of woe
prevented looking ahead to tonight's house party with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go out and get a win first,'' said Taylor, who made
9 of 12 field-goal attempts in the first half. ``If I knew what was
wrong with us, I'd have told everybody a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody already knew. The Clips didn't pass the ball, rarely
moved without the ball and offered scant resistance when the other
team had the ball. And the schedule faced by the league's youngest
team has been a bit sinister.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, they finally were picked on by somebody their
own size. For ailing teams, the Grizzlies are the antibiotic of the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting thumped in an earlier trip to Vancouver, the
Clippers realized that _ on paper _ the Grizzlies represented a
nice opportunity for victory.
</P>
<P>
   So, with Hudson resurrected as the starting point guard, they
shared the ball enough to finish the first half with 17 assists and
a field-goal percentage of 60 percent. (They average an
unreasonably cold 41 percent.) Against the slacker defense of
Vancouver's Mike Bibby, Hudson had 11 points and 8 assists by
intermission. While Hudson demonstrated signs of life, rookie Lamar
Odom was behaving as the altruistic decoy. Odom responded to his
recent slump by only squeezing off only 3 field-goal attempts in
the first half (he made 2), while picking off 4 rebounds and
handing off 3 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's 3-pointer at 3:33 in round two gave the Clips a 49-36
advantage, their largest of the half. The Grizzlies trimmed that to
8, but Tyrone Nesby's swooped in for a dunk to end the half in a
59-49 Clipper lead.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson had 14 for Vancouver, which was treated to a
3-point half by point guard Mike Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim went to work (nine points) in the third
quarter, but Olowokandi had 7 for the Clips, whose margin was nine
(84-75) entering the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: During the Clippers' 9-game march of doom, they only
managed to outscore the opposition in 8 of 36 quarters. ...
Olowokandi, who averaged 18 points and 12 rebounds during last
week's 3-game road swing, admits he feels a lot more comfortable
playing away from Staples Center. ``There's no doubt about it,''
Olowokandi, the first pick in the 1998 NBA Draft said of his
comfort level away from the scrutiny of the home crowd. ``And
that's a shame.''

DODGERS SAY THEY AREN'T DONE YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Southland, and baseball, continued to
shake their heads Monday about the Los Angeles Dodgers' unloading
of salary the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But before everyone is done piling on and saying the Dodgers
were absolutely robbed in the trade that sent pitcher Ismael Valdes
and second baseman Eric Young to the Chicago Cubs for reliever
Terry Adams and a pair of minor-league pitchers, general manager
Kevin Malone wants everyone to understand the offseason moves
aren't completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have no natural leadoff hitter, but by April 3 when
the season begins in Montreal they may. They have no solid
major-league second baseman, but by April 3 they may. The Dodgers
may need another starting pitcher, or help in the bullpen, but they
have time.
</P>
<P>
   The dumping of Young's and Valdes' combined $10.5 million
contracts next season put the Dodgers in position to make other
moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're saying, `This is the team,''' Malone said.
``We're in the middle of a process. Opening day is not tomorrow,
it's months away. We have a few more things to do. This trade puts
us in better position to strengthen our club and be able to make
other moves. Opening day is not today.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers brass doesn't dispute the financial implications of the
deal. The Dodgers claim to have lost close to $20 million last
season, and they had to slice from somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dodgers are already committed to approximately $80
million of salary, and that's expected to escalate to $86-$89
million by spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Malone points out the Dodgers went 77-85 with the group that
included Raul Mondesi, Young and Valdes. He also said this isn't
the first move, but rather the latest in a series of moves that
began with the acquisition of Shawn Green for Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, we think we can get better without (Valdes and Young),''
Malone said. ``Two, we created some financial flexibility to
address our bullpen and bench weakness and, three, we think we can
improve the overall makeup and chemistry of the club. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The public may be waiting for the Dodgers to sign or trade for
another marquee player, but that's not the plan. Instead, they are
looking into signing second- and third-tier free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore free agent Arthur Rhodes remains a long shot, but
Malone talked with his representatives Sunday. Rhodes wants a
four-year contract, a major deterrent for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The club is also looking into signing either Steve Avery or Jeff
Fassero to fill the left-handed void in the bullpen and perhaps
challenge for the lefty spot in the starting rotation. While
sources said Malone spoke with representatives for both players,
two sources said the Dodgers would prefer to sign both players to
minor-league contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also looking to strengthen their bench, and
utility player Shawon Dunston is a possibility. Dunston, a close
friend of Dodgers center fielder Devon White, said, ``I wouldn't
mind coming to Los Angeles, I'm not going to lie to you.'' But
Dunston, who can play shortstop, third base or outfield, said he
thought he would wind up back with the Mets or in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Malone is slated to talk to Kurt Abbott's
representatives today, though an offer for the former Colorado
infielder isn't expected.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much of the Dodgers' plans remain on hold while the
Adrian Beltre saga drags on. A source familiar with the talks said
the decision would be announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
for the Office of the Commissioner, said the fact-finding portion
of the investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``His potential free agency has not been a factor in the pace of
this inquiry,'' Alderson said. ``The fact that the possibility
exists has been a burden on both the player, reportedly, as well as
the club. That's unfortunate in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do, from a conceptual standpoint, I think
aside from this case ... we have to make sure there's an interest
on the part of everyone involved to comply with the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The case could leave Beltre, and the Dodgers, in limbo until
late January. If Beltre isn't declared a free agent and a grievance
is filed, it could take more than a month to sort out.

FLYERS COACH GETS SKY-HIGH NIELSON RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During Saturday night's game in Toronto, the Maple
Leafs paid a simple but poignant tribute to Philadelphia Flyers
coach Roger Neilson, who learned the day before that he has bone
cancer. Each player tapped their sticks on the ice in unison when
Neilson's image came up on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It is hockey's universal sign of affection and there was not a
dry eye in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the nicest things that has ever happened to me
in my life,'' Neilson said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater sign of respect on an emotional night might have
come later, when both teams began a monster fight that delayed the
game almost a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers and Maple Leafs are the two best teams in the East
and expect to play each other in the conference finals in late May.
Neilson, who has coached seven teams in his NHL career, would be
the first to say that while sympathy is fine, so is a good body
check.
</P>
<P>
   But the outpouring for the 65-year old coach has been wonderful.
When he reached the team hotel Friday there already were 30 phone
messages waiting. When Neilson got back to Philadelphia, there were
35 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been such an emotional time for me,'' Neilson said.
``You get on the phone and people are crying, and I seem to end up
being the one who's trying to comfort them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson began chemotherapy Monday. Once treatment begins,
Neilson said he has four consecutive days of it. He believed the
program would involve an intravenous pump in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also said Neilson could expect four to five years of
remission.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, he is in the final year of his contract and
though the Flyers lost 6-4 to Toronto, the team is having an
outstanding season. When they began 0-5-1, knee-jerk Philadelphians
wanted his head. Since then they have gone 17-4-1.
</P>
<P>
   It is so close in the East that Saturday's victory moved the
Maple Leafs one point ahead of the Flyers in the conference
standings.
</P>
<P>
   With so much on the line, the fight was not a surprise. After
Gary Valk scored two goals in the first 1:43 of the second period
to give Toronto a 3-2 lead, Flyers big man Eric Lindros went at it
with defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev. Nine second later, everybody
got into it, including goalies Curtis Joseph and Brian Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   In all 12 players on the ice were involved, resulting in 96
penalty minutes and three game misconducts.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Neilson spent much of Saturday playing Santa
Claus for kids at the team hotel. But afterward, as he discussed
the fight, Neilson did not make a friend of Leafs coach Pat Quinn.
He questioned why Quinn had only one goon on the ice for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the last line change, and he didn't answer the
challenge,'' Neilson said of Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's still coaching in the '70s,'' Quinn responded.
``Are we playing hockey or are we having the '70s scrum crap we've
already been through? If you're sitting there and you've got one
scrapper on your bench and they've got a half dozen, what do you
do? Do you send out two to fight a half dozen? To me, that's a
stupid statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But one that should remind people that Roger Neilson is still
very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks make a hire: On Sunday, the 7-19-4 Chicago Blackhawks
officially hired Mike Smith to be the team's manager of hockey
operations, giving him the day-to-day duties of turning around a
team that has not won a Stanley Cup in 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, fired as associate GM in Toronto after last season, was
living in semi-retirement on Martha's Vinyard. But to him, the good
life is building a hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   We have a challenge ahead of us,'' Smith said Sunday. ``But
that's the attraction of being in sports _ the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 54, replaces Bob Murray, who was fired Dec. 2. He was the
only candidate interviewed by club president Bill Wirtz and his two
sons, Rocky and Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith played a large role in the rebuilding of the Maple Leafs,
including the hiring of Quinn and the signing of free-agent Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Pulford, the Blackhawks' longtime GM, only confused a bad
situation by coming out of a consultant role to co-coach with Lorne
Molleken. Players didn't know who was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first act Sunday was to meet with Molleken, who is still
making game decisions, but has been given no guarantees beyond this
season.
</P>
<P>
   His second could be trying to acquire Phoenix's holdout
goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WATCH OUT FOR AVALANCHE &QL; 
Colorado's 3-2 victory Sunday night against Vancouver was more than
Patrick Roy's 424th career win, which tied him for third all-time
with Tony Esposito. It extended the Avs' Northwest Division lead
over the Canucks, who are in the midst of a free fall. Colorado has
gone 3-0-1 against the Canucks this season, and two more games
remain in Denver. In the past two seasons, the Avalanche has gone
7-0-3 against Vancouver. The Avalanche is 4-0-2 against former
coach Marc Crawford, who is now behind the Canucks bench. Vancouver
opened the season 9-5-3, but has won just twice in the past 14
games. &QL; 
TOUGH NIGHT &QL; 
After recently tying Montreal to end a 14-day trip, the Calgary
Flames turned out to be big losers. After they left Molson Centre,
bused to the airport and boarded the plane, the Flames had to wait
50 minutes for Air Canada. By then it was 12:02 when they taxied to
the runway. Problem: Dorval Airport has a midnight curfew, which is
strictly enforced. The pilot was forced to turn back to the gate.
The team got back on the bus and, since all the airport hotels were
booked, went back downtown, checked in for three hours, got back on
the bus and flew home. Luckily they were playing Vancouver next.
The Flames won 3-2. &QL; 
HASEK GONE? &QL; 
Less than a year after getting the Buffalo Sabres to the Stanley
Cup Finals, goalie Dominek Hasek announced this would be his last
season and then seriously injured his groin. Now it appears when
the former league MVP returns, he probably will be traded to a
Stanley Cup contender. Since Hasek went down, youngster Martin
Biron has taken over and done an admirable job. The Sabres are
going nowhere this year and would like to get something in return
for Hasek. And if Hasek likes the team he is traded to, he could
decide to unretire after the season. &QL; 
BAD IDEA &QL; 
Three weeks ago, Florida thought it would be good to sign playmaker
Ray Sheppard, pair him with high-flying Pavel Bure and march off to
the playoffs. The Panthers lead the Southeast Division, but have
pretty much written off Sheppard after just eight games. Instead of
getting his usual 22 minutes, Sheppard is down to 14 and was a
healthy scratch last week against Phoenix and Dallas. Sheppard and
Bure have not meshed and Sheppard, when he plays, is skating with
the second line. Interestingly, Bure now has 26 goals in the 29
games he has played since joining the Panthers, but the first of
his three goals Wednesday against the Coyotes was his first
game-winner. &QL;

EDMONDS MAY NOT BE AN ANGEL FOR LONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ As of Monday night, Jim Edmonds was still an Angel.
But how long that remains true could be counted in days, even
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels and Oakland A's are on the verge of making a
deal that would send the 29-year-old center fielder, a one-time
American League All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner with a .290
career batting average, to the A's for a package of minor-leaguers
and possibly second baseman Scott Spiezio.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the deal would be pitcher Brett Laxton, a 26-year-old
right-hander who went 13-8 with a 3. 46 ERA in 25 starts for
Triple-A Vancouver last season. He also pitched in three games for
the A's, going 0-1 with a 7.45 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The others expected to be involved in the deal are outfielder
Mario Encarnacion and third baseman Adam Piatt. Both players split
time last season between Double-A Midland and Vancouver. Piatt hit
.345 with 39 homers and 135 RBIs in 129 games for Midland.
Encarnacion hit .309 at Midland.
</P>
<P>
   If he's involved in the deal, Spiezio would likely become the
Angels' starting second baseman, but he's hardly the leadoff-type
hitter they've been looking for. Last season, Spiezio, 27, hit .243
with 8 homers and 33 RBIs in 89 games for the A's, and also played
28 games for Vancouver, where he hit .390. It's possible the Angels
prefer a second baseman from the A's minor league system instead.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams were believed to be close to finalizing the trade
Monday afternoon, but Oakland GM Billy Beane checked out of his
room at the Anaheim Marriott, site of the Winter Meetings, before
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stoneman awaited word from the A's, and set a 7 p.m.
deadline - when he left to attend a baseball dinner function.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' agent, Paul Cohen, was in touch with Edmonds all
afternoon, keeping his client up to date on the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a good place for him,'' Cohen said of Oakland. ``He
loves hitting in that ballpark and he likes the guys on that team.
He's torn by the fact he's from here. But if the Angels decide to
move him, that's a place he'll like playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds is eligible for free agency after the 2000 season and
has a list of nine teams he said he will not sign an extension with
if traded. The A's, Cohen said, are not one of those teams. But
whether or not the A's could afford Edmonds - who could command
anywhere from $6 million to $9 million per season - remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at it logically you say one year and out,'' Cohen
said. ``But I don't necessarily know that to be the case. It's my
understanding that with new ownership coming in, they can get
creative. And they don't come any shrewder than Billy Beane.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Edmonds is not talking to the media until a deal is
made, but said the former Diamond Bar High standout is feeling good
about his situation and is working out three to four hours a day
and getting in great shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mind is set now because of the way events have unfolded,''
Cohen said. ``He has a 10-month window that will determine his
future. Last year at this time, he was anxious. Now, it's a relaxed
curiosity. He believes he's going to have an MVP-type season.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman was typically tight-lipped about the situation and
would not mention names or even the team involved. But he admitted
he expected something to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything else, it's just a matter of making things
work,'' he said. ``There's an offer there that should make things
work. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Edmonds deal will be consumated, Stoneman
said he'll continue to talk with a number of teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dealt with a lot of things today and there are still
other possibilities,'' he said. ``We've had some very productive
discussions. We know a lot more now than we did coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman will check out of his hotel room this morning and
conduct business from his Edison Field office. He came into the
meetings hoping and expecting to get something done, but he said
Monday it wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a trading deadline tonight at midnight,'' he said.
``It's nice everybody's here, but phones still work.''
</P>
<P>
   If Edmonds is traded, it would end a bittersweet 12 years in the
organization, a time when many believe his potential for greatness
was overshadowed only by the perception of wasted talent.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' best season came in 1995, when he hit .290 with 33
homers, 107 RBIs and 120 runs scored. In 1997, he made what some
have called the greatest catch ever, making a diving, over-the-head
catch of a long drive hit by the Royals' David Howard in Kansas
City.

PERCIVAL TORN ABOUT WANTING TO LEAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Agent Paul Cohen had lunch with three of his
clients Monday, Jim Edmonds, Troy Percival and Mike James. Cohen
said Percival continues to ``welcome'' a trade to a contender, but
isn't necessarily in a hurry to leave the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where it stands right now is he's torn between playing at home
in front of the home fans vs. being in a situation with a team that
can win right away,'' Cohen said. ``He realizes it will be an
uphill struggle in Anaheim and he wants to pitch for a team that's
going to be in it at the end. In the past it was not even something
he would look at. But he's not 25 anymore. He's 30 and he's only
got so many years left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had conversations with Mr. Stoneman and expressed Troy's
issues. But obviously, it would take a tremendous trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival is signed through next season with club options for
both the 2001 and 2002 seasons. His 139 career saves is the most in
franchise history, with a single-season career-high 42 saves coming
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two picked: The Angels selected two players Monday in the Rule V
Major League draft, taking pitcher Derrick Turnbow, 21, from the
Phillies organization and catcher Jaime Escalante, 22, from the
Orioles organization.
</P>
<P>
   By rule, the two were placed on the Angels' 40-man roster. If
they are not on the 25-man roster on opening day, they must be
placed on waivers and be available to any team. If no team claims
them, the Angels must then offer them back to their original club.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman said he thought there was a good chance Turnbow, a
hard-throwing right-hander, could make the major league club as a
reliever next season even though he pitched at the Single-A level
last season, going 12-8 with a 3.35 ERA in 26 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's interesting,'' Stoneman said of Turnbow, who has a
fastball clocked at 94-95 mph. ``We did something different than
most teams did. We reached way down to Class-A to find a player,
and not even a high-A league. Our reports on this pitcher are that
he's a special pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also lost a player in the Rule V draft, as outfieder
Marcus Knight, who played at Double-A Erie last season, was
selected by the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Talks continue: Tim Shannon, agent for ex-Angels pitcher Chuck
Finley, continues to talk with a number of interested teams but is
in no hurry to get anything done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several teams want him real bad,'' Shannon said, adding that
he believes there will be a flurry of other free-agent signings
after Finley signs. ``I think everybody's waiting on us. He seems
to be the marquee player right now. Usually it behooves the No. 2-
and 3-tier guys to wait until the top tier guy goes.''

A WINNING MAKEOVER FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took Sandy Koufax eight seasons before he learned the
rudiments of his craft and became the most dominant pitcher of his
generation. He was 26.
</P>
<P>
   It took Michael Jordan seven seasons before he understood fully
the nuances of his sport, and his Chicago Bulls suddenly became
perennial NBA world champions. He was 27.
</P>
<P>
   It took Wilt Chamberlain eight season before he realized that
50-point games were meaningless if your team kept losing, and his
Philadelphia 76ers responded to his changed outlook during the
1966-67 campaign by winning a league-record 68 games and the NBA
title.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I went out to Staples Center the other evening, and saw a
similar transformation in the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, who put on
the kind of sterling clinical basketball exhibition that John
Wooden would have applauded.
</P>
<P>
   I kept rubbing my eyes thinking I was witnessing a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, Shaquille O'Neal played with a maturity, a purpose, a
resolve Sunday night against the Detroit Pistons that I've never
witnessed during his seven previous seasons in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, this wasn't the same Shaquille O'Neal I had become
accustomed to watching the past three years with the Lakers, the
plodding O'Neal who'd huff and puff listlessly up and down the
floor, content to grab a few rebounds, negotiate the usual gaggle
of rim-thundering dunks, expend modest amounts of energy, and do
absolutely nothing to enhance the play of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Pistons, O'Neal was a sight to behold, going
after rebounds with uncharacteristic abandon at both ends of the
court, swatting away Piston shots, and methodically taking command
of the entire proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it without a rest.
</P>
<P>
   He played the first 40 minutes of the game - Phil Jackson took
him out for good early in the fourth quarter when the Lakers had a
commanding lead - and never seemed to tire.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics reflected his dominance - 24 rebounds, 22 points,
four blocks - but they didn't reflect what an intimidating factor
he was throughout the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw out there tonight was a great player at the peak
of his skills,'' said an interested observer, Jerry West, the Laker
executive who was responsible for O'Neal signing with the team
during the summer of 1996. ``Actually, Shaquille has been playing
like this all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got himself in tremendous shape in the off-season, and he's
been totally committed from the first day of training camp. I know
he believes totally in Phil's system. I think without a doubt he's
been the best player in the league. No one's been able to handle
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, if only Shaquille O'Neal could shoot free throws.
</P>
<P>
   If he could, the Lakers would breeze to a world title.
</P>
<P>
   They'd never lose one of those close games they have so often in
the past because of O'Neal's shortcoming in this category.
</P>
<P>
   But such a deficiency might not make that much difference this
season because the Lakers figure to be holding commanding leads
late if O'Neal continues his ferociously effective work.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe how different O'Neal's approach has become on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets the ball, his first instinct now is to pass to an
open teammate instead of trying to score.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, he no longer lolls around the middle, but gets
actively involved in double teams and contests almost every shot an
opponent attempts inside.
</P>
<P>
   He would have lengthy moments of inertness in the past, but now
he never stops hustling.
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen a man of his immense size - he's listed at
7-foot-1 and 315 pounds but probably weighs closer to 350 - move
with such quickness and agility.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, I saw Wilt Chamberlain often, even covered him
full-time for a few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain could maneuver well also, but he'd have had serious
problems containing O'Neal, who simply can maneuver better.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as promising as this latest incarnation of Shaquille
O'Neal is, there are questions looming over the Lakers, who are
tied with Portland at 17-5 for the league's top record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a very favorable early-season schedule with most of
our games at home,'' says West. ``We still have to prove we can win
on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And Shaquille O'Neal and the abundantly exciting, vexingly
undisciplined Kobe Bryant still have to prove they can function
smoothly together.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant still might be five or six years away from reaching the
maturation level that O'Neal seemingly has attained.
</P>
<P>
   He led the Lakers with 26 points and elicited the usual oohs and
aahs from the fans against the Pistons, but he also threw up 24
shots in a mere 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant still doesn't have the foggiest notion of what
constitutes team basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But, if there is a coach capable of teaching him, it is Phil
Jackson, whom Jerry West credits for O'Neal's remarkable turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Jackson just has a terrific rapport with the players,''
says West. ``He has a presence about him, and the players seem to
have great confidence in him. He has a nice way with them. And he
doesn't care who he gets on. If a player needs scolding, Phil will
do it. And, most importantly, the players will listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is listening more attentively these days than Shaquille
O'Neal.

GONZAGA MORE AT HOME THAN WASHINGTON IN KEYARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After what took place on the hardwood in KeyArena last
March, it was inevitable what happened Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga won the opening tip from the University of Washington.
Axel Dench tapped the ball back to guard Matt Santangelo and before
you knew it, Casey Calvary was throwing down a two-hand jam.
</P>
<P>
   These names are familiar. The kind of basketball they play is,
too.
</P>
<P>
   And before you knew it, the Bulldogs were running off a lead,
fueled by their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Down 6-0, Huskies senior Deon Luton found himself trapped at
half court. A double-team forced a turnover that allowed an outlet
pass to Santangelo, who knew exactly what he was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo all but strutted unscathed to the basket, where he
delivered a 180-degree, midair spin that finished with a
back-handed, two-hand dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, it was Gonzaga 8, Huskies 0. Time out,
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After last March, something like this was to be expected _ all
the way down to the 76-66 Gonzaga victory that head coach Mark Few
called better than Gonzaga's win Saturday over 11th-ranked UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way (my team) executed.'' Few said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Coach (Bob) Bender would find a way for them to take us
out of our primary option, and they did. That we were able to go to
our third and fourth options and be successful is a sign of
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The college basketball season kicked off in earnest Monday with
the Huskies' home opener.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's home court for the Huskies felt every bit as
much a homecoming for the Bulldogs. At least that's how the
Bulldogs seemed to treat the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers before the opening tipoff were split between the two
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The logos on sweatshirts and ballcaps throughout KeyArena
boasted allegiance to both the Zags and the Dawgs, proof that what
went down in this town last spring was not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga became college basketball's newest darlings.
</P>
<P>
   And they were born here.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Bulldogs were a force to be reckoned with all last
season, when they scorched the West Coast Conference on a hell-bent
mission not to be denied an invitation to the NCAA tournament. The
Bulldogs were hot before setting a sneaker in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But essentially, Gonzaga's coming out party came to a rocking
crescendo right here.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that the Bulldogs knocked off Minnesota and Stanford
in the sub-regional of the 1999 NCAA tournament before rolling to
the Elite Eight and coming excruciatingly close to a trip to the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   If only Santangelo had hit one or two of those jumpers in
Phoenix, where the West Regional Final was within a fingernail of
the Bulldogs' possession ...
</P>
<P>
   If only UConn's Richard Hamilton weren't so silky smooth and the
Big East big dogs weren't on a mandate to win coach Jim Calhoun's
first national championship ...
</P>
<P>
   If fate had twisted a little more in Gonzaga's favor, then the
little school from the other side of the mountains would have been
dancing big at the big dance.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was inevitable what happened Monday, really, given this
bit of history.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that set up the inevitable question: Whose court
is this?
</P>
<P>
   The Zags had a right to stake a greater claim, beating the
Huskies as they should, considering their No. 22 national ranking
and their desire to repeat this season what they did last.
</P>
<P>
   The young Huskies and Bender understood what they were facing,
which probably explained the energy the Dawgs expended trying to
win back the bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they didn't like to come out as the underdogs against
us, being a Pac-10 team,'' Calvary said, understanding the Huskies'
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   And for a few flashes, the Huskies tried to bite back.
</P>
<P>
   Thalo Green stole the ball just before the first half ended and
went in for an underhanded scoop to pull the Dawgs within one.
</P>
<P>
   But Santangelo seemed destined to suck back any Husky momentum.
The senior guard nailed a long 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the
Zags a 37-33 lead _ which was challenged only once in the second
half when the Huskies tied it at 47.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that the Huskies were one of those college
basketball darlings. One year before the Zags almost blew into the
greatest show in college athletics, it was Bender's Huskies who had
their fun run to glory.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball relies on its darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga and Washington can both count on having seasons that
make the local college hoops loyalists swoon.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer scholarships being offered across the board by all
Division I schools and with more big-time programs losing top
recruits to the pros after one or two seasons, it is more and more
likely that schools like Washington and Gonzaga can lure impact
players to their programs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Luton is about all the Huskies have this season, with his
ability to elevate and score. But he needs a Donald Watts and/or a
Todd MacCulloch around him to make him as good as he can be. Bender
won't stop until he gets another solid squad to take the Huskies to
the dance again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Zags rely on Santangelo. He was the kid that got
away from Stanford, which made Arthur Lee a priority. Now look at
Santangelo. He was back in town Monday to put a little footnote on
what he and the Zags started.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect way to begin a season, perhaps even for Huskies
fans, who know a darling when they see one.

BULLDOGS WIN NORTHWEST DOG FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This is where the tale of the overachieving underdog
began, in KeyArena featuring Gonzaga in the 1999 NCAA tournament.
Unfortunately for Washington, Monday night looked like last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies battled until the final horn, but the Bulldogs
emerged with a 76-66 victory in what was supposed to be
Washington's first home game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't seem that way for two reasons. It was the Huskies'
first game in KeyArena, where they will be playing all season while
Hec Edmundson Pavilion is being renovated. Secondly, there were
plenty of Gonzaga fans in the crowd of 8,637, creating an
environment of mixed company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was wonderful,'' Bender said, referring to the
new home, not the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different,'' said UW point guard Senque Carey. ``It's
not Hec Ed, but at the same time, it has a roof over it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was his best line of the night. The one in the box score
showed 4-for-16 shooting and four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always found that Senque bounces back pretty well,'' said
UW coach Bob Bender. ``Tonight was a tough one for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey, who hit 7 of 7 threes in his last game at Old Dominion,
is just like the team he plays for, filled with potential and heart
but prone to inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, Gonzaga won, taking advantage of an
assortment of Washington mistakes. Missed free throws and field
goals resulted in a missed opportunity because the Bulldogs, for
all of their talent and experience, could have been had Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   For the past nine days, Gonzaga has ping-ponged across the
country from Cleveland and Spokane to Chicago and Spokane to Los
Angeles and Seattle. This was their fourth game on the road.
Compared to Cincinnati, Temple and UCLA, the Huskies could have
been lightly regarded. But they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, this was the state championship game for us,'' said
Richie Frahm, the smooth-shooting forward from Battleground who led
Gonzaga with 19 points. ``A lot of us weren't recruited by them.
We've all got chips on our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were motivated, too, realizing the caliber of the
competition after watching Gonzaga become one of the best eight
teams in the country last year. And then seeing the Bulldogs on TV
against the nation's elite this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of hype,'' said Michael Johnson, who scored 10
points and distributed eight assists. ``We all knew it was a big
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were out of sorts in the beginning, as if they felt
uncomfortable in this kind of company. Gonzaga bolted in front 8-0,
combining steals with jams and layins, running circles around their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Bender called a timeout and admonished the Huskies right after
sophomore guard Bryan Brown blasted his teammates himself.
</P>
<P>
   A blowout appeared imminent until Deon Luton showed up, giving
Washington stability and a remarkable dose of accuracy. The senior
shooting guard made his first five shots, from every angle on the
floor. Luton keyed an 11-0 run that put Washington ahead 18-14. He
scored 15 points in a little more than four minutes and finished
with 23.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga recovered, first getting a lift from its standout point
guard, Matt Santangelo, who will be running someone else's offense
on this floor next year at the next level. After making just one of
his first seven shots, Santangelo drilled a three at the first-half
horn, right when it appeared Thalo Green had given momentum to
Washington with a steal and a layin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the scrappiest team we've played this year,'' Frahm
said. ``Washington played a lot tougher than UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed, over and over again, the Huskies taking charges and
pursuing loose balls. The problem was, Washington hit the floor
more frequently than the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga appeared to be in control with a 66-52 lead with 6:40
remaining. But Luton, Carey and Johnson sliced the deficit to 68-64
after Johnson converted a 3-point play from the lane. A Johnson
banker kept Washington within 70-66 with 53 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The heroic ending never materialized, Gonzaga closing it out
with free throws in an appropriately ironic development. If
Washington had been more proficient at the line _ Luton was 4 for
11 unguarded, 8 for 12 with hands in his face _ the verdict could
have been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically just missed,'' Luton said. ``I'll be shooting them
in practice every day (this week).''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies feel like they're not that far away from being as
competitive as Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think we're pretty close,'' Johnson said. ``We're
getting used to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs know what it's like to be in Washington's position,
with doubters outnumbering believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people don't expect much from them,''
Santangelo said. ``That's good. It got us to where we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which fell to 3-4, will try to get back to .500 on
Friday when it hosts Wichita State.

THE DAY THE SUN LOST ITS WIND  
 
 

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ A mysterious disturbance in the magnetic forces
that link Earth and the sun has puzzled _ but also delighted _
space scientists who are still pondering the event more than seven
months ago when the sun virtually ran out of wind.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally, the sun's outermost corona sends out a constant,
violent ``solar wind'' of electrically charged particles that speed
in all directions at a million miles an hour or more, holding
Earth's magnetic field in check.
</P>
<P>
   Those particles _ mainly electrons, protons and the nuclei of
helium _ wash Earth constantly, causing the lovely auroras that
shimmer in the night sky near the poles when the particles interact
with gases high in the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   During a 24-hour period around May 11, however, the solar wind
suddenly and unexpectedly died away almost completely, leaving only
a sparse and gentle rain of particles to reach Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Without resistance from the solar wind, Earth's magnetic field
stretched as far as the moon. And the auroras, normally visible as
curtains of green and yellow light, instead turned into a steady
circular glow around the North Polar region.
</P>
<P>
   The event was witnessed, recorded and its details radioed to
Earth by no fewer than 10 orbiting satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at the annual fall meeting of the American Geophysical
Union at Moscone Center, dozens of physicists who study solar
phenomena and their effects on Earth's atmosphere confessed they
are still puzzled by the virtual disappearance of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also fascinated. Earlier satellites had seen
similar but far less conspicuous events over the past 35 years, but
never anything remotely like this sudden calm in a storm that is
normally most intense at Earth's poles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the satellites recorded a 99 percent drop in the density
of the wind's charged helium particles. The electrons, sparse as
they were, reached Earth at temperatures of a million degrees _ 10
times hotter than normal.
</P>
<P>
   To Keith Ogilvie, a space physicist at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center, the event gave him and his earthbound colleagues ``a
rare window to see the sun's corona directly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, our view of the corona from Earth is like seeing the
sun on an overcast, cloudy day,'' said Jack D. Scudder of the
University of Iowa. ``But on May 11, the clouds broke and we could
see it clearly. It was a very unusual opportunity, and it was very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Scudder and Don Fairfield of the Goddard center had predicted
that this kind of event might happen, and indeed it did, with the
rain of electrons producing a steady glow over the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists who discussed the May 11 event so heatedly Monday
could not offer an explanation for its cause, but as Ogilvie said,
``it strengthens our belief that we're beginning to understand how
the sun-Earth connection works.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Oh yes, Catch-23
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Heller is dead. Everybody dies. Catch-23.
</P>
<P>
   Heller put Catch-22 into our lexicon of ironies. Life, he told
us, was crazy and would always get you. ``Catch-22,'' Heller's
great novel, made enormous sense to the Vietnam generation. It
would make somewhat less sense to the generation about which it was
written, World War II.
</P>
<P>
   There is an episode in ``Catch-22'' in which the Germans and
Americans hire each other to bomb themselves in the name of some
greater efficiency. Funny stuff. I hate to be a spoilsport, but I
never thought World War II was much of a joke _ Holocaust and all
that, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   I thought _ and continue to think _ there are some good wars.
Armies are frequently crazy, and crazy things happen. But not all
wars are crazy. I always wanted to ask Heller about that. Now I
won't. Great book otherwise, though.

 &HT;    Political storm brews over affirmative action
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is a whispered urgency to the
conversation. A chat where the senior adviser to a black political
leader is so worried about what she is saying that, well, it just
can't get back to her boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jumped on his One Florida idea because it was the first
opportunity for blacks to jump on Jeb,'' she says. Privately, she
wonders whether they are doing the right thing. Publicly, she
questions the validity of Bush's plan to do away with affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   A bit more than a month has passed since Gov. Jeb Bush offered
his idea for getting rid of affirmative action in Florida
universities and in the awarding of state contracts, saying he
wants to replace those programs with ones that help the
disadvantaged regardless of race.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed responses are not uncommon among the state's black
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush announced his plan on Nov. 9, he tried to show that he
had significant minority support: He picked popular state Sen.
Daryl Jones of Miami, who is black, to lead the effort. University
Chancellor Adam Herbert, who also is black and a friend of Bush's,
heartily endorsed the plan. On that first day, Bush seemed to have
done what he has done best since taking office this year _ forming
coalitions comprising differing factions.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, some of Bush's support began to unravel. Jones, who
would like to run for Congress after he leaves the state Senate,
suddenly announced that he didn't understand what he was getting
into, had never committed to taking a leadership role and had
developed grave doubts about Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   While Herbert stuck with Bush, other black leaders, such as U.S.
Rep. Corrine Brown and most of the members of the state
legislature's black caucus, opposed One Florida. During a recent
caucus, some black lawmakers complained that Bush left them out of
the planning for One Florida and then dumped it in their laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to be overly critical of the governor on this,
but I think what he has done is insulting,'' says state Rep. Addie
Greene. ``He's doing this just to try and make us feel good, but
when you look at the nitty-gritty what is he really doing? I think
he's just trying to help his brother win the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he intended it or not, Bush wedged himself into the
middle of a raging controversy over one of the most difficult
social issues in the nation. A controversy that could have enormous
political consequences for Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was prodded to act, in part, because California businessman
and activist Ward Connerly is trying to pass an amendment to the
Florida Constitution that would eliminate all forms of affirmative
action. Bush told Connerly to stay out of Florida, but Connerly
ignored him. And even with a setback that means Connerly may have
to wait until 2002 to get his issue before voters, the debate is
certain to have an impact on next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is already acrimonious. Connerly, a black
conservative, said Bush's plan is a weak imitation of his. U.S.
Rep. Carrie Meek, the matriarch of liberal black Democrats,
condemned the plan, saying it is an attempt to take away the
hard-won gains minorities have made since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, the top 20 percent of students in each high
school will be guaranteed admission to one of Florida's
universities. Bush says his plan will increase the number of
minority students in college. He also promises to improve the
process for awarding state contracts to minorities, without using
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans fear that if Connerly's amendment manages to
get on the ballot this November, huge numbers of blacks and other
minorities would go to the polls in an effort to defeat it, and
while there they will vote for Democratic candidates. Among those
who could get hurt would be Texas Gov. George W. Bush, should he
become the GOP nominee for president. Polls have indicated the
Connerly's initiative would pass easily.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeb Bush remains undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the support we have received on the One
Florida initiative,'' Bush said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has a Mexican-American wife, worked hard in the 1998
campaign to win minority votes. Exit polls show that he got 61
percent of the Hispanic vote and 14 percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   That 14 percent shook the Democratic Party, which in past
elections could count on getting nearly 95 percent of the black
vote. After the election, Bush and the Florida GOP continued to
court black support, hoping to solidify their gains. Now, with
Bush's One Florida plan and Connerly's anti-affirmative action
amendment, Democratic leaders see an opportunity to bring black
voters back to the party. Connerly will address the Forum Club in
West Palm Beach on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans for the first time in this century controlling
the governor's office and both houses of the legislature, Democrats
are looking for issues that clearly separate them from the GOP.
Affirmative action is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the things the Republican Party has tried to
do over the years, I think it becomes very clear which party has
been there for minorities,'' says Charles Whitehead, state
Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For many black Democratic leaders, any changes to existing
programs, especially those suggested by Republicans, are suspect.
In their districts, they are reminding black voters that
Republicans do not have a history of looking out for their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure that you are doing the right thing by
your constituents,'' said Greene. ``That means you have to spend
time in my district getting to know the people before you try and
do things that might affect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to allay their fears, Bush appointed a 24-person
committee to evaluate inequities in Florida's schools. The
committee includes 12 blacks, including the chairman, Castell V.
Bryant, president of Miami-Dade Community College's north campus.
The only white man on the committee is state Sen. Jim Horne.
</P>
<P>
   ``More important than reaction to the plan is whether what we
are doing is right,'' says Bush. ``I believe improved opportunities
in purchasing and admissions is a good thing, and I will fight for
implementation of our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   With Meek, Brown and other leading black Democrats watching for
any misstep and ready to take him on, Bush could find himself in a
fight that lasts well beyond next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have just begun to fight on this issue, I promise
you,'' said House Democratic leader Les Miller of Tampa.

 &HT;    Mexican shoppers flowing across the border
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ Like millions of other visitors to San
Marcos, Araceli Trevino emerged from a day of serious shopping at
the outlet malls with a fistful of receipts and a car full of bags
to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes from Nike, dishes from Pfaltzgraff, clothes from Tommy
Hilfiger, Nautica and Liz Claiborne, assorted gifts from the Disney
Store.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of heading home to Austin or San Antonio, Trevino
drove more than five hours to Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. It's a
trip she has made twice a year for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   She's hardly unique, however. These days, more and more Mexicans
are coming to Texas to shop _ from Laredo to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   At Prime Outlets in San Marcos, Mexicans accounted for 22
percent of the mall's estimated 4 million visitors last year, up
from 17 percent in 1997. Mexican shoppers spend 2 1/2 times the
amount of the average customer at Prime Outlets, said Vicki Conley,
the center's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't come as frequently as our Texas shoppers, but they
stay longer and spend more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For some retailers, the percentage is even higher. Brands such
as Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and Mikasa are extremely
popular with Mexican shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably half our business,'' said Melissa Luera, a
manager at Lauren, the Ralph Lauren women's clothing store. ``It's
a prestigious name in the states, and shoppers want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, a homemaker, said she comes to San Marcos for the same
reasons as her Texas counterparts _ looking for a big selection and
bargains on clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is better, I think,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriella Leyva, a 34-year-old economist from Mexico City, has
been flying to San Antonio and coming to San Marcos to shop once or
twice a year for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Prime Outlets recently with her sister-in-law, niece
and mother-in-law, Leyva made her first stop at the Nike shoe
outlet, where the family bought seven pairs of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she travels more than 700 miles to San Marcos,
Leyva points to the price tag on the running shoes she's trying on.
</P>
<P>
   They sell for $9.99. The same shoes in Mexico City would cost
more than $20. The same is true of toys and many clothes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos is just one of several Texas cities that does a
steady business with Mexican shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Along the border, Mexicans can make up 30 percent to 80 percent
of a retailer's business, estimates the Texas Center for Border
Economic and Enterprise Development at Texas A&AMP;M International
University in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Galleria, the nation's fourth-largest mall, estimates
that about 20 percent of its shoppers come from Mexico and another
10 percent from elsewhere in Latin America, said marketing manager
Julie Cuenod.
</P>
<P>
   The Galleria shopping center in Dallas doesn't track Mexican
shoppers specifically. But marketing director Jane Robertson said,
``The Mexican national business is real good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Economic Development's Division of
Tourism reports that shopping was a top attraction for 83 percent
of the 3.3 million Mexicans who visited Texas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The average visitor stays about a week and may shop in several
cities. Trevino shopped at the Galleria in Dallas while visiting
her daughter in Plano and then drove down Interstate 35, stopping
in San Marcos for a day on the way back to Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and San Marcos are the prime
destinations for shoppers from Mexico. Specifics on Mexican
shoppers in the Austin area aren't available.
</P>
<P>
   Travel and tourism from Mexico has been rising steadily with the
recovery of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   When the peso was devalued in late 1994, Mexican travel to Texas
plummeted from 4.1 million to 2.95 million. In 1998, it recovered
to 3.27 million.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Mexican shoppers at Prime Outlets was negligible
in 1994, the first year the center began tracking such data, Conley
said. A year later, it was just 2 percent. But by 1997, it reached
17 percent. The number climbed to 22 percent in 1998 and is
expected to rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Galleria in Houston has made up the 5 percent of Mexican
shoppers it lost when the peso crashed, Cuenod said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who travel beyond the border to Houston, San
Antonio and Dallas are members of Mexico's upper class and growing
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different shopper that goes to Houston or Dallas than
goes to Laredo,'' said J. Michael Patrick, director of A&AMP;M
International's border economic center. ``They spend big bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   About 44 percent of the Mexican shoppers in San Marcos come from
Mexico City and 23 percent come from Monterrey, according to
research commissioned by Prime Outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City shoppers usually fly to San Antonio and drive to San
Marcos, Conley said. Visitors from Monterrey often make the journey
by car.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Mexican cities go nowadays, Monterrey has one of the
strongest middle-class components as any,'' Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Johnson, manager of Prime Outlets' Waterford/Wedgwood
crystal and china store, credits the North American Free Trade
Agreement with helping Texas outlet malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies went down there and opened factories, and hired
people who can now afford to come up here and shop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said there's ``some truth'' to the notion, but the
impact is limited to a few areas of northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had Mexican cross-border shoppers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and mall operators are aggressively courting Mexican
shoppers by advertising in local newspapers and working with travel
agencies to arrange special shopping packages.
</P>
<P>
   Mall operators say they attend tourism conventions in Mexico and
bring travel agents to visit their shopping centers. Some malls in
Houston have partnered with Continental Airlines, which has rapidly
expanded service to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican shoppers have long been important to Houston's retail
trade, said Pamela Miller, tourism director for Katy Mills, a new
1.3 million-square-foot mall west of Houston that opened in late
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're my top international priority,'' added Miller, who
spent nine years with the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau
before joining Katy Mills. ``The two major reasons Mexicans come to
Houston are shopping and medical care, so we try to partner with
the medical center.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour groups of hundreds of shoppers are common in San Marcos,
especially during Mexican holidays, such as the week before Easter
and the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   Malls and retailers try to make shopping easier by hiring
bilingual staff and printing coupon books in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Some stores, such as the Nike outlet, hold classes for staff to
learn more about Mexican culture and differences between
international and U.S. size measurements, said Pete Elizondo,
operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   During peak periods, many retailers hire students from nearby
Southwest Texas State University as extra interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing business with Mexico is very relationship-oriented,''
said Cuenod at Houston's Galleria. ``When you make them feel
welcome, they respond.''

<P>
   When the peso was devalued in late 1994, Mexican travel to Texas
plummeted from 4.1 million to 2.95 million. In 1998, it recovered
to 3.27 million.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Mexican shoppers at Prime Outlets was negligible
in 1994, the first year the center began tracking such data, Conley
said. A year later, it was just 2 percent. But by 1997, it reached
17 percent. The number climbed to 22 percent in 1998 and is
expected to rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Galleria in Houston has made up the 5 percent of Mexican
shoppers it lost when the peso crashed, Cuenod said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who travel beyond the border to Houston, San
Antonio and Dallas are members of Mexico's upper class and growing
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different shopper that goes to Houston or Dallas than
goes to Laredo,'' said J. Michael Patrick, director of A&AMP;M
International's border economic center. ``They spend big bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   About 44 percent of the Mexican shoppers in San Marcos come from
Mexico City and 23 percent come from Monterrey, according to
research commissioned by Prime Outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City shoppers usually fly to San Antonio and drive to San
Marcos, Conley said. Visitors from Monterrey often make the journey
by car.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Mexican cities go nowadays, Monterrey has one of the
strongest middle-class components as any,'' Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Johnson, manager of Prime Outlets' Waterford/Wedgwood
crystal and china store, credits the North American Free Trade
Agreement with helping Texas outlet malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies went down there and opened factories, and hired
people who can now afford to come up here and shop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said there's ``some truth'' to the notion, but the
impact is limited to a few areas of northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had Mexican cross-border shoppers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and mall operators are aggressively courting Mexican
shoppers by advertising in local newspapers and working with travel
agencies to arrange special shopping packages.
</P>
<P>
   Mall operators say they attend tourism conventions in Mexico and
bring travel agents to visit their shopping centers. Some malls in
Houston have partnered with Continental Airlines, which has rapidly
expanded service to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican shoppers have long been important to Houston's retail
trade, said Pamela Miller, tourism director for Katy Mills, a new
1.3 million-square-foot mall west of Houston that opened in late
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're my top international priority,'' added Miller, who
spent nine years with the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau
before joining Katy Mills. ``The two major reasons Mexicans come to
Houston are shopping and medical care, so we try to partner with
the medical center.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour groups of hundreds of shoppers are common in San Marcos,
especially during Mexican holidays, such as the week before Easter
and the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   Malls and retailers try to make shopping easier by hiring
bilingual staff and printing coupon books in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Some stores, such as the Nike outlet, hold classes for staff to
learn more about Mexican culture and differences between
international and U.S. size measurements, said Pete Elizondo,
operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   During peak periods, many retailers hire students from nearby
Southwest Texas State University as extra interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing business with Mexico is very relationship-oriented,''
said Cuenod at Houston's Galleria. ``When you make them feel
welcome, they respond.''

 &HT;    Strong social relationships important to good health
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even modern technology does not give without also taking away.
With every car, television and computer, humans have moved farther
away from the tribal societies and extended families that once gave
us a sense of belonging to a group.
</P>
<P>
   Every month, some medical researcher expresses astonishment at
how much a person's social support has to do with his health and
lifespan. This essential ``connectedness'' refers to both the
number of relationships and the satisfaction they bring, but it
boils down to how much we share our lives with others.
</P>
<P>
   Social connection is as important for doctors to measure as
weight, cholesterol and blood pressure, says Dr. Brooks S. Edwards,
medical editor of the Mayo Clinic Health Oasis Web site. ``The
strength of our relationships has great bearing on how well we age,
how well we deal with life's challenges and how well we survive
serious illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject most often involves the elderly, partly because
one-third of Americans older than 65 in private homes are living
alone and partly because the impact of connectedness is so dramatic
at their age. It's hard to ignore a five-year study of 1,400 heart
patients showing people who don't have a spouse or confidant are
three times more likely to die than those who do.
</P>
<P>
   But connectedness is also important for the young. When a
middle-school child's increased academic and peer pressures
converge with a torrent of hormones, stress levels soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling connected just makes people feel more at ease,'' says
Ray Messer, a Kettering, Ohio, psychotherapist. ``You're OK. You
don't feel as anxious or worried, or get angry as much because you
know you're OK. That in itself relieves stress, and there are
scientific studies that show relieving stress strengthens the
immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Vonnegut, the acutely observant novelist, uses the term
``folk society deficiency'' for the ongoing outbreak of people who
lack a sense of connection or belonging. He compares it to vitamin
and mineral deficiencies, saying people waste away from FSD as
surely as scurvy patients lacking vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he says, they ``become a member of an artificial extended
family.'' That isn't a huge problem if the symptom is wearing a
Cleveland Browns jersey to the fridge for the quick sandwich that
has replaced traditional Sunday dinners. But some artificial
extended families connect with each other by burning crosses on
front lawns or wearing black trench coats to school to conceal
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random violence occurs in part due to a lack of social
conscience,'' Messer says. ``Social conscience derives from social
commitment. Social commitment comes from the sense of belonging to
a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Messer got to thinking about the subject this fall, when his
seventh-grade daughter was moved out of the cluster of students who
had been grouped together in sixth grade and otherwise kept
together this year.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning the move unsuccessfully, he was bewildered that
the pleasant middle school officials he talked to had no apparent
idea they were discussing a significant problem with a simple
solution. Some kids naturally sink in the sink-or-swim environment
of large secondary schools, he says. ``But if kids are grouped with
teams of about 50 to 100 kids throughout their educational journey,
there is a stronger potential for interpersonal connection and
group loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence among older adults shows those with good social
support are more likely to have optimum blood pressure and lower
rates of common colds, mental illness and age-related memory loss.
The support is believed to lower stress levels and to give people
more motivation to live healthfully.
</P>
<P>
   Connectedness deficiency is not something modern medicine is
equipped to treat, however. Doctors often worry that technology is
usurping humanity in their field, even as Hollywood movies
substitute special effects for character development.
</P>
<P>
   Even among psych professionals, it's hard to get past the
reality that reaching out to others is often quite stressful for
those who most need to do it. If only there were organizations
designed to bring these people together.
</P>
<P>
   There are, it turns out. The Self-Help Clearinghouse at (937)
225-3004 refers people to more than 400 support groups. There's
also the organizations, such as the United Way, where volunteers
are always needed. Research is quite clear that what volunteering
takes, it more than gives back.

 &HT;    Pilot's protest justified
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Airline food has a history of being lousy. I
think it has to do with the fact that lukewarm casseroles were not
designed to be taken internally above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's been 40 years since I earned a meager living
pounding the carpeted aisles of a Martin 404 in three-inch heels,
I've never forgotten the mixed emotions elicited by an airborne
mealtime. Passengers were less sophisticated in those days and
still agog over the idea of dining in the clouds so they didn't
complain a lot. Crew members were less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently still are. Have you heard about the Northwest
pilot who held up a flight for an hour because he didn't like the
meal he was served? Walked off the airplane, past the airport
jiffy-junk food establishments, got into a cab and went to get
himself some real food.
</P>
<P>
   The airline had a little surprise for him when he got back. They
fired him.
</P>
<P>
   These days I'm no longer a crew member but I am a frequent
flyer, and I hate airplanes that run behind schedule just as much
as the folks at Northwest do. Too many times I've been stranded in
airports at odd hours when the bookstores are closed and coffee, if
available at all, has to be prodded from the pot.
</P>
<P>
   HOWEVER. . . In the case of this 22-year veteran of airline
abuse, I would have thrown my discomfort to the winds and cheered
the hero who risked it all to protest his company's practice of
serving food that, unless you've seen a third-world dumpster for
yourself, cannot be aptly described.
</P>
<P>
   This pilot deserves a medal for bravery for all of the years he
survived on airline food and still managed to pass a first-class
physical twice a year. And if I weren't holding a ticket on
Northwest for next Friday, I'd be organizing a protest against the
firing of this man and suggesting the airline be forced to erect
statues of him in major airports around the world. I see him done
in living-color bronze, fully uniformed and caught mid-stride as he
passes
</P>
<P>
   baggage claim, remnants of his crew meal spilling to the ground
from the tray in his lowered left hand as he hails a cab with the
right.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you folks, the sickest minds among us could never
envision food like the breakfasts Atlanta used to load on our
Constellations back in '59. Granted, it was only 14 years after the
end of WWII, but wasn't that a little beyond the sell-by date for
surplus powdered eggs? No foolin', these eggs were so green they
had to have been the inspiration for Dr. Seuss's best seller. When
we complained, the caterer got a little huffy and serviced our
flight with cold rubber pancakes for the rest of the month. We
asked if it would cost extra to vulcanize them so at least they'd
be hot.
</P>
<P>
   There were crew members who actually bid trips according to
where the airplane was to be catered. Atlanta and Miami were
definitely out. Chicago wasn't bad because we lived there and knew
where the ``slop-shop'' folks parked their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh-Durham, N.C. was the best place to lay over. Real nice
caterers there who'd let the crew stop in the kitchen and shmooz
with them over the next day's menu. Sometimes we had filet mignon
with mushrooms and real vegetables that never saw the inside of a
can. Once we had lobster.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before RDU layovers were first choice on crew bid
sheets. Senior captains who could have been flying San Juan and
earning over-water pay, flew Raleigh for the food. It was a dog
trip but we ate well _ at least until the company got the bill for
it and sent a nasty memo TO: All Flight Crews. FROM: Company. RE:
Surf 'n Turf.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, in protest, a couple of pilots showed up for work
with Batman lunchboxes strapped to their flight bags. It didn't do
any good. The company paid no attention and pretty soon their kids
wanted the lunchboxes back.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, Northwest got off lucky with just a ground
delay. What if the airplane had been at 30,000 feet when the pilot
got a gander at his crew meal and decided to take a hike?

 &HT;    Light breaks through tunnel of misdiagnoses
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tennis court lines are not supposed to
be wavy, so my wife's first reaction was, ``That's odd.''
</P>
<P>
   During a pause in a clinic she was teaching, she experimented,
closing each eye in turn. Slight problem in the left eye. Time for
an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered an ad for a free eye exam at an eye surgical
center and made an appointment for Oct. 29. After dilation and an
hour of charts and lights, the doctor offered this somber finding:
Cataracts in both eyes, beginning of glaucoma in both eyes, and a
``wet'' retina, indicative of bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, Nellie asked: ``What can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   The glaucoma, of course, was treatable, and cataract removal is
an outpatient procedure. The doctor's upbeat observation was that
for $2,500 an eye, Nellie could get corrective laser surgery, which
would, at the same time, take care of the cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't have to wear glasses anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, he added, she would want to get a specialist
to look at that retina.
</P>
<P>
   Our HMO pushed buttons and got her an appointment with an
ophthalmologist in three days. The new doctor was most reassuring.
He had trained at Yale, worked between two offices and had his own
surgical eye center. Like the earlier examination, the procedure
was very thorough. Different results, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first doctor was way off base,'' the HMO's doctor said,
evidently perplexed. He found no cataracts. As for glaucoma, the
readings were only ``suspect.'' And, he told Nellie, she did not
have a wet retina.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a macular hole in your left eye.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sound good. And it wasn't. The macula is the lining
of the retina that contains the photoreceptive cells necessary for
vision. ``You will slowly lose sight in that eye,'' the doctor
informed her.
</P>
<P>
   How could this happen? Bad luck, the doctor said. What about
drops, surgery, anything? How could she teach tennis?
</P>
<P>
   Even as the doctor shook his head, he saw that she was
panicking. ``You can still play your tennis,'' he assured her.
``Babe Ruth played baseball with one eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Nellie broke down. She didn't want to believe that there wasn't
at least some particle of hope of saving her vision. ``I'm going to
get another opinion!'' she blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get as many opinions as you want,'' he replied. ``But that's
the story.''
</P>
<P>
   It was raining as Nellie sat in her car and cried.
</P>
<P>
   Then she did seek another opinion, an opinion she paid for
herself because she wrongfully concluded that the HMO had taken her
as far as it would go. The next day she went to an optometrist,
desperate to hear someone, anyone tell her that she would not lose
vision in her left eye.
</P>
<P>
   The optometrist asked if she had seen a retina specialist. No,
she replied, she had seen the ophthalmologist on the HMO list, and
he had told her that it was pointless to go farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were my eye,'' the optician said, ``I would see a
specialist and get his opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Nellie went back to her primary care physician and insisted
that the HMO send her to a retina specialist. Dutifully, the HMO
obliged, getting her an appointment in three weeks. Nellie saw the
retina specialist, and this time the exam was exhaustive. She was
injected with dyes and dozens of pictures were taken inside her
eye. With his results spread before him, the doctor said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not have a macular hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Swear it,'' Nellie said, fervently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear,'' the doctor said. ``You do not have macular
degeneration,'' he pointed out. ``You do not have cataracts. Years
down the road you might have glaucoma. What you do have is a
membrane that's grown over the macula, a puckered film that
distorts your vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed her the pictures. She saw the wrinkled membrane that
explained the wavy lines on the tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   ``And something can be done?'' my wife wondered hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how bad is this problem?'' the doctor asked. ``Can you
live with it? There is a surgery that can remove the membrane, but
in 60 percent of the cases, a cataract forms within the year which,
of course, must be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the specialist assured her that the condition will not get
worse or affect her reading or driving, Nellie has decided that she
can put up with the occasional wavy line on the tennis court
</P>
<P>
   My wife is grateful. Grateful for the optician who said if it
were his eye, he would consult a specialist. Grateful for our HMO,
which moved on her request even though its own ophthalmologist said
it would be pointless. Grateful for a doctor who correctly
diagnosed her condition. Grateful enough to want their names known
_ optometrist Dr. O.K. Haugen for the referral, Health Options for
honoring her wishes, and retina specialist Dr. Randy Katz for going
the extra mile.
</P>
<P>
   I see no reason to name others who offered what I am sure were
defensible opinions, given their limitations. I'll leave the final
words to Nellie. ``When it's your health or your life at stake,
insist on a second or third or even fourth opinion. Remember that
doctors aren't Gods, they're fallible human beings.''

 &HT;    Crusade for clean language good fit for mean times
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Chick Lewis is doing everything in her power to
make Waco known worldwide for something other than an inferno on
the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   She's doing everything in her power from this base to make the
world something more than a spinning swirl of expletives and
put-downs.
</P>
<P>
   The world needs this. Regardless of what gaseous pollutants have
done to the atmosphere, the spewing of thoughtless words degrades
us all and raises global temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   We've become so casual about callousness. We have so
institutionalized the profane and perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the children _ lean, mean and obscene. They know not
what they do, what consequences words can carry. We must again
teach them to look before they bleep, and remind ourselves as well.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Chick Lewis' mission has been since she retired as a
nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   She was inspired to make it her cause while sampling the
language of female inmates in a jail ministry which she continues
weekly with a group called Nurses for Christ. She made it a point
to make inmates think about what they were saying, what it said
about them. Success in that venue encouraged her to ask everyone to
think about what they say.
</P>
<P>
   She's been mentioned on Paul Harvey and in lots of news stories.
She's distributed bumper stickers, T-shirts, ball caps. She speaks
to civic groups. Recently Waco Transit stuck her insignia on a bus.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a one-woman movement, but one woman's constant
motion can cause a swirl that unites, like the blades of an
ice-cream crank.
</P>
<P>
   In September two new elementary schools opened up in Waco.
Realizing this, and not wanting to miss an audience, Lewis hustled
over to Provident Heights Elementary to see if it would like to
post her decals. They were already up.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis isn't about playing censor or writing laws telling people
what they can't say. She's simply asking people to be more
thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 we've seen over and over the ravages of unkindness.
We've seen children so estranged from friends and the world that
they would take a weapon into a school and kill indiscriminately.
We've tossed social theories and zero-tolerance notions about. The
only thing that we know would have made a lick of difference is
what Chick Lewis is advocating. Just be nice to one another. Watch
what you say. Know that words hurt. Words degrade.
</P>
<P>
   Bullets only finish what words start. Chick Lewis did not
discover this. She's only reminding people of it, this
world-changing advice.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to help, write Lewis at 5831 Caldwell, Waco,
Texas, 76710.

 &HT;    MGM songbird takes flight again in movie, TV shows
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jane Powell, the ingenue songbird of the
golden era of the MGM movie musicals, doesn't mind talking about
the past, but she would much rather look ahead. After all, at 70,
the still perky Powell has a new movie waiting to be released and a
couple of television projects to be aired. ``Just a few things to
keep me off the streets,'' she says. And she is taking computer
lessons to get ready for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, she is in town to introduce a screening of 1954's
``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.'' Although virtually absent from
films since 1958's ``Enchanted Island,'' a movie Powell groans at
the mere mention of, she is anything but bitter about her
inactivity. ``Well, my life has just changed. I've done a lot of
plays and lectures and that kind of thing,'' she says by phone from
her New York apartment. ``Y'know, you have your moment in the sun
and then something else happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those were a Broadway debut in 1973 in ``Irene,'' filling
in for MGM colleague Debbie Reynolds, and a few Polident
commercials. She wrote her autobiographies (''The Girl Next Door''
and ``How She Grew'') in 1988, and, for the past 11 years, has been
busy enjoying life with her fourth husband, former child
star-turned-publicist Dickie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   While she once told interviewer Rex Reed, ``I didn't quit
movies, they quit me,'' you won't catch Powell spouting regrets.
``Well, there haven't been that many offered, because of my age and
because they think of me as just being a singer or a dancer,'' she
says evenly. ``And they stopped making musicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Of her classic musicals _ merry production number-filled romps
such as ``Royal Wedding,'' ``Hit the Deck'' and ``Nancy Goes to
Rio'' _ she says, ``It's just wonderful that people still remember
them and that they're still popular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' considered one of the best
movie musicals of all time, was made with low expectations by the
studio. ``Ours was a sleeper,'' concedes Powell. ``They even took
some of the budget away before they even made it,'' diverting the
money instead to Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly's ``Brigadoon.''
To widespread surprise, including Powell's, the lively Western,
about seven marriage-minded siblings who kidnap their prospective
mates and take them home to the avalanche-prone mountains, proved
far more popular and enduring.
</P>
<P>
   To Powell, it was just one more assignment. ``I was under
contract, so I just did what it was they told me.'' She singles out
``Seven Brides'' as the movie whose success surprised her the most,
finally sensing it had box office potential when it was booked to
open at Radio City Music Hall. ``That meant it was kind of a
shoo-in for it being successful,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   She gives prime credit to choreographer Michael Kidd, rather
than director Stanley Donen. ``He really made the movie what it
was. He was really the star of the show, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, viewers of the movie can see where the corners were cut.
``Because they cut the budget, we did not go on location. So we had
to use backdrops, and some of the backdrops are really terrible,''
Powell says with a laugh. ``They're just awful. They even chose
ones that weren't painted well.'' The avalanche scene is certainly
effective, but as she notes, ``That was stock footage. Even with
all that, it still surmounted all of its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell expects to reminisce today about her studio days, to drop
a few names of stars, answer audience questions and introduce
``Seven Brides.'' Just don't ask her to sit and watch it. ``I don't
watch my movies. They make me too nervous,'' she says. ``I don't
live in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, her present and future are so active. Still to come,
she's unsure when, is the release of the movie ``Picture This.''
``Oh, it's just a little vignette in an independent movie,'' she
insists at the mention of it. ``I'm just a visitor at the art
gallery. I just made her a very Chatty Cathy kind of character.''
</P>
<P>
   She enjoyed the experience, but feels that virtually everything
has changed in moviemaking since the '50s, whether for a low-budget
independent or a studio release. And not for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there's the protection that you had with
the studios, when you were under contract. There isn't the
protection for the producer, for the director, the writer, for
anybody,'' she says. Powell disagrees that the studio system was
needlessly restrictive to contract players. ``No, I think it was
very positive,'' she says. ``I'm sure people long for those days
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned for Powell on a couple of made-for-television movies
that she has already shot. ``One is called 'Sandy Bottom
Orchestra.' It's not a very good title, but it's taken from a book.
It will probably be out in the spring,'' she announces. ``And I
just did a part in the Jon Benet (Ramsey) epic that will be coming
out later. I play the dancing teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   As challenging as those roles were, they were a piece of cake
next to Powell's current task _ learning to use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Just to understand it,'' she replies. ``I don't know that
I'll ever use it, but I just feel so illiterate that I don't know
what people are talking about. I have no idea what I'm going to use
it for, but I really want to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell sounds ready for what lies ahead for her. She currently
has future film plans, but remains eager to see what will develop
from this recent burst of activity. ``You just never know,'' she
says brightly.

 &HT;    Scale back wedding, get jump on the nest egg
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 15 years ago, I got to attend one of those truly
astonishing weddings _ hundreds of guests, a generous open bar,
three kinds of caviar and flower arrangement 8 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   All that was before the wedding and the dinner dance that went
on until 2 a.m. That event in a posh Chicago hotel must have cost
more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   That blowout comes to mind as I look ahead to the next batch of
June weddings, only six months away now.
</P>
<P>
   I keep thinking there's a better way to do this. Not eloping,
but scaling back the monstrous costs of these affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of a wedding in 1997 was slightly more than
$19,000. That includes the reception, rings and some of the small
stuff. (Invitations and other correspondence averaged $327; the
bride's headpiece added another $166.)
</P>
<P>
   All this ceremonial profligacy takes place around a young couple
who may well be carrying college loan debt and who probably have no
way to buy a house or otherwise start moving their joined lives
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you rearrange your wedding budget? First you cut back on
things like the number of guests invited, the grandeur of the
reception and a few other costly items.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you divert the savings into a fairly aggressive stock
fund and leave it there for a long, long time. The chart indicates
some possibilities. Bear in mind that your investment return would
be much larger if you funneled the money into tax-deferred savings
programs, such as an individual retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the trade-off: less pomp now for more circumstance later.
Do you want a big party for hundreds of people now or, say, an
earlier retirement later for the two of you?
</P>
<P>
   There are other prudent alternatives, of course. A friend of
mine started preparations for his son's wedding by arranging the
down payment for the couple's first house. He put in several
thousand dollars, as did the bride's father and several other close
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Frugality at the altar is not a new idea. People are marrying
later these days, and it is more common for the bride and groom to
split expenses with their parents. That certainly encourages
careful budgeting and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that more people are appalled by the huge
costs involved. Annual spending on weddings now comes to about $45
billion a year. There's enough money involved that one wedding Web
site (www.theknot.com) has announced an initial public offering of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   I am told that there are at least 20 Web sites that sell
containers of live butterflies, to be released during the nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet also reflects growing interest in
cost-conscious wedding plans. There are dozens of sites that deal
with budgeting, inexpensive alternatives and tips on keeping down
costs. One good one is rachel.itgo.com. For numerous penny-pincher
stories, both newspaper and first-person, look at
weddings.about.com/home/weddings/msub29.htm.
</P>
<P>
   A good book on the subject is ``Bridal Bargains: Secrets to
Throwing a Fantastic Wedding on a Realistic Budget,'' by Denise and
Alan Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that we're talking about a two-step process. The first
is making an acceptably lean budget and sticking to it. The second
is seeing that the savings indeed go to investments or other
accounts that will serve the new couple's future needs.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process will be a lot easier if all the family members
agree to do it. An engaged couple will have a hard time controlling
expenses if her mom insists on a showy event or his dad must invite
tons of business associates.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the problem, then the question becomes one that a lot
of new couples must struggle with: Whose wedding is it, anyway? And
whose future?

   Stern looking forward to musical life after 79
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Passy
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Isaac Stern would love to talk, but he's
got a more pressing matter at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call me back in five minutes?'' the violinist asks,
speaking by phone from his New York apartment on a Saturday
morning. ``I'm just getting the shaving cream off my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a man who is unquestionably one of this century's
greatest musicians _ and musical advocates _ it seems a
particularly humbling remark. But, as Stern jokes, even legends
have to shave. ``Let's just say the daily routines are not changed
by age or place,'' he explains good-naturedly. ``They're necessary
to continue living.''
</P>
<P>
   And the art of living _ in all its mundane and majestic glory _
is the subject of Stern's newly released autobiography, ``My First
79 Years'' (Knopf), written in collaboration with novelist Chaim
Potok. The title says it all: No matter what the age, life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sense of being elderly,'' says Stern. ``I
have the same instincts I had 20 years ago. . . I see myself
continuing at the same pace that puts a lot of young people gasping
in the wake. I take it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My First 79 Years'' chronicles the fruits of Stern's
extraordinary labors, starting with the Russian-born violinist's
early years in San Francisco, where he made his recital debut in
1935 and his orchestral debut with the San Francisco Symphony a
year later. Friends and family pushed the prodigiously talented
teenager to perform in New York. When his first appearance was
greeted with critical jabs, he remained undeterred. ``I had
invested so much of my life in music, I couldn't quit now. I would
keep trying. I would give the career another year, another two
years. I would go back to San Francisco and practice, practice,
practice,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Practice indeed made perfect. By his 20s, Stern was under
contract with Columbia Records and playing concerts worldwide. His
circle of friends included the budding young conductor Leonard
Bernstein, veteran impresario Sol Hurok and cellist and
humanitarian Pablo Casals. His life is no less charmed today: His
discography has grown to more than 150 recordings and he's
considered one of a handful of musicians whose mere presence turns
a concert into an event. When the Kravis Center hosted its
inaugural gala in 1992, he was inevitably asked to perform. (He has
since been back several times, thanks in part to his friendship
with Palm Beach cultural philanthropists Leonard and Sophie Davis.)
</P>
<P>
   But the story of Stern goes far beyond the fiddle. In the 1960s,
he started a one-man crusade to save New York's beloved Carnegie
Hall from the wrecking ball _ a luxury apartment building was
slated to rise in its place _ and he still guides the hallowed
hall's programming and operations as president of its board. He's
also been a tireless champion of human rights, traveling to China
in 1979 for a series of highly publicized concerts (captured in the
documentary From Mao to Mozart) and donning a gas mask for a
special performance in Israel during the Gulf War. His friend and
colleague, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, once joked that ``when he (Stern)
thinks the world needs saving, it's hard to keep his mind on
practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   The autobiography dutifully captures both sides of Stern's life
_ as musician and global citizen _ and gives a tiny peek into his
private world. Stern insists he doesn't separate one aspect from
another. ``The music comes out of the total person,'' he explains,
noting that what might be seen as unrelated _ say, his return to
China this year _ is quite connected. ``It may seem political, but
it always revolves around the centrality of music to the art of
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern is the first to admit that the book wasn't an especially
labor-intensive project. He leafed through old papers and
correspondence _ ``We fortunately have a very large archive in my
office,'' he says _ and spoke his mind into a tape recorder. The
material was passed on to Potok, a prize-winning Jewish novelist
(''The Chosen,'' ``The Promise,'' ``The Gift of Asher Lev''). ``Out
of that would come 8 to 12 very pointed questions (from Potok), and
that triggered another opening,'' recalls Stern of the process.
While Stern credits Potok with making ``order out of the chaos of
our conversations,'' he insists it's still very much his book.
``It's my voice you hear, not his,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anecdotes Stern tells in the 306-page tome reveal a
great deal about the pleasure-loving man behind the music. There's
the lazy summer day he spent in the company of flutist Jean-Pierre
Rampal, scavenging for sea urchins on the island of Corsica. ``We
ate the fresh oursins with the small spoons and drank the Pernod in
the boat on the water. We were there for hours,'' he recalls
contentedly.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents speak of an individual of liberal conscience who
clearly feels the pain of the world. He describes how he learned of
the assassination of John F. Kennedy while he was waiting to make a
connecting flight in Dallas of all places. ``We looked across the
airfield from the window of the cafe where we were sitting, and
there was Air Force One . . . Only later did I learn that on it was
the president's body,'' he writes. (He concluded that night with a
concert in San Antonio, where he played the Bach Chaconne in place
of the Sibelius Violin Concerto in D Minor: ``I chose Bach because
there is in his music a pervasive sense of balance, a continuity of
deep belief.'')
</P>
<P>
   The book does stint on some details, including those involving
the breakdown of Stern's 45-year marriage to Vera, with whom he
fathered three children. (He has since remarried a younger woman,
Linda Reynolds, an arts administrator.) And it's hard to accept the
off-handed way he dismisses critics of his playing, which has been
notoriously sloppy of late. ``So I missed a few notes sometimes,''
he writes. ``Was that really a big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Stern's problem, however, has been physical. He's been
hampered by a disabling hand injury _ carpal tunnel syndrome _ in
recent years. He ends the book with something of a question mark,
noting that he's going for surgery to correct the problem, but he's
not sure how far it will take him.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Stern is happy to report that he's almost up to
speed _ and he's looking forward to ``one other small procedure
that would bring me back to 98-percent normalcy.'' He's been forced
to take a sabbatical from heavy-duty playing during the past year,
and he's eager to get back on stage for concerts in New York, San
Francisco and Los Angeles in February.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's got the next 79 years ahead of him.

   ``The only reason I'm alive today is because I was able to catch
the disease early enough to eradicate it,'' says Wade F.B.
Thompson, Thor's chairman and a prostate cancer survivor. He called
it ``the most difficult experience of my life'' and established
``The Drive Against Prostate Cancer'' to educate men and their
families about the importance of screening.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 180,000 American men are diagnosed each year with
prostate cancer and nearly 40,000 die. But it is virtually 100
percent curable if detected before it has spread from the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is targeting RV owners at RV shows and other public
forums, Thompson said, ``since so many RVers are over 40.'' Thor is
the second-largest manufacturer of RVs and largest midsized bus
manufacturer in North America.
</P>
<P>
   All men 50 and older will be offered the screenings, as will
those 40 and older who are black or have a family history of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-foot Airstream medical vehicle has two private screening
rooms, where the 10-minute process will include a digital rectal
exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test from trained
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's schedule of at least 15 cities is still being
assembled and has no announced date locally. Sponsoring partners
are the Cancer Research Institute, Endocare, Bayer Diagnostics and
UroCor.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Joseph Heller is dead. Everybody dies.
That's Catch-23. And I'd been meaning to ask him about World War
II. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LAMB-COLUMN _ Social connection is as important for doctors to
measure as weight, cholesterol and blood pressure, says Dr. Brooks
S. Edwards, medical editor of the Mayo Clinic Health Oasis Web
site. ``The strength of our relationships has great bearing on how
well we age, how well we deal with life's challenges and how well
we survive serious illness.'' (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ It has been a long dry spell, but finally
there's a juicy new lunatic right-wing conspiracy theory to
entertain us, and just in time to add to the general hilarity and
joy kicked up by the sundry agitated millennial hysterias. (Teepen,
Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ It used to be that to have a memento from a
famous or infamous person was to have something rare; a
conversation piece. In this last decade of the 1900s, however, it
is rare that someone isn't collecting mementos. Late last month,
for example, more than 350 people turned out in San Diego to bid
for the possessions of the Heaven's Gate cult whose 39 in-house
fanatics did away with themselves in a mass suicide. (Kleinberg,
Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ Have you heard about the Northwest pilot who
held up a flight for an hour because he didn't like the meal he was
served? Walked off the airplane, past the airport jiffy-junk food
establishments, got into a cab and went to get himself some real
food. The airline had a little surprise for him when he got back.
They fired him. In the case of this 22-year veteran of airline
abuse, I would have thrown my discomfort to the winds and cheered
the hero who risked it all to protest his company's practice of
serving food that, unless you've seen a third-world dumpster for
yourself, cannot be aptly described. (Schuett, Cox News Service)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Listen to the children _ lean, mean
and obscene. They know not what they do, what consequences words
can carry. We must again teach them to look before they bleep, and
remind ourselves as well. That's what Chick Lewis' mission has
been. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tennis court lines are
not supposed to be wavy, so my wife's first reaction was, ``That's
odd.'' During a pause in a clinic she was teaching, she
experimented, closing each eye in turn. Slight problem in the left
eye. Time for an appointment. After dilation and an hour of charts
and lights, the doctor offered this somber finding: Cataracts in
both eyes, beginning of glaucoma in both eyes, and a ``wet''
retina, indicative of bleeding. Stunned, Nellie asked: ``What can I
do?'' This is the story of what Nellie, her HMO and her doctors
did. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    Life for Cystic fibrosis kids a struggle, but it hasn't shaken
their parents' faith
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Every night, Bill and Jerri Chesney tap
their children's chests, over and over again, to keep them from
drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney, 8, and Taylor, 5, have cystic fibrosis, a disease that
tricks the body into producing excess mucus, which coats the
pancreas and the lungs, inhibiting digestion and breathing. The
phlegmy superflux must be expelled daily, or the children will be
left gasping for air, like fish on dry land.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people in the U.S. have the disease, which is
incurable, though its symptoms can be dramatically alleviated with
vitamins and enzymes to enhance nutrition, inhalants to clear the
lungs, as well as physical therapy, like the chest-tapping the
Chesneys perform each night, doctoring their children. The couple
have been married 12 years and live in Stuart, Fla. Bill, 37, works
at Florida Power &AMP; Light's nuclear power plant. Jerri, 34, works
part-time at a Christian bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have an evening out with another family, and they'll
call afterward and say: `We got home, put the kids in bed and had
two hours to ourselves.' That never happens with us. We've got the
inhaling and the tapping to do, every night,'' Bill Chesney grins
ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Faith and the fellowship of their church sustain them. The very
malady itself has strengthened the Chesney family, knit them
together with a powerful bond. The children themselves are
extraordinarily close to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in Philippians 4:13: `I can do anything through
Christ which strengtheneth me.' There's a reason God has given us
this opportunity. It may be a ministry for us to their lives,''
Bill goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the reason is for other children to see them and think:
'Those kids have CF and they've overcome it. If they can overcome
it, I can overcome whatever life sends me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The disease is drawing nationwide compassion and attention. This
Jan. 8, the 33rd annual ``65 Roses'' gala charity ball for CF will
be held in Palm Beach. Last year's event drew singer Celine Dion,
who performed for the audience at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Dion's
niece died of the disease, and she is the spokesperson for the
Canadian CF Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   CF used to mean certain death, often before the child's age
reached double digits. It is transmitted by a defective gene,
isolated and identified in 1989. The gene must be present in both
parents and even then, the disease afflicts only one child in every
four births. More than 10 million Americans _ one in every 31
adults _ have the defective gene and don't know it. Caucasians are
especially at risk: 28 of every 31 people who have the gene are
white.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers lead perfectly healthy lives, until they meet and marry
another carrier and have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no CF on either side of our family,'' Jerri Chesney
says. ``Bill and I both had the gene and didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, gene therapy and powerful new medicines such as
Pulmozyme, and ingenious delivery systems, via benign viruses and
tiny liposomes, have increased life expectancy to 40 and beyond _
by which time there may be a cure, perhaps through gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Jerri is a lively, cheery woman who nonetheless has a catch in
her voice as she recalls how her daughter was first diagnosed with
CF:
</P>
<P>
   ``She was 8 weeks old. She had a terrible cold, and her stomach
was hard, and she was crying all the time. She was so tiny! She
never gained weight easily. She coughed a lot. We took her to the
doctor on Christmas day, and he thought it was just a bad cold. He
said: `Babies' immune systems are very strong. She'll get over the
cold without antibiotics.' So we went home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she went into pneumonia. One lung collapsed, and the
other was full of congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent 10 days in the hospital, and they still didn't catch
it. They did CF tests, and it didn't show up. But they sent us down
to St. Mary's hospital in West Palm. They did a follow-up test.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught it. She tested positive. She had CF. I can still
remember us holding hands in the emergency room. We were just so
baffled by it. We don't know anybody on either side of the family
that has CF. We didn't know a thing about it. We'd never heard of
it, in either of our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, with one child already having CF, did the Chesneys choose
to have another child?
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed over it a lot, believe me,'' Jerri says. ``We wanted
a bigger family. The odds were three to one in our favor, that the
child would be normal. But we knew we were taking a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got pregnant with Taylor, we knew we were taking a
chance. But we did ultrasounds, and he seemed to be developing
normally. We didn't do amniocentesis, because we knew we would keep
him no matter what. We don't believe in abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was also this thought,'' Bill adds delicately, ``that if
we lost one child, we would still have another with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Taylor was born and was immediately diagnosed with CF.
</P>
<P>
   The Chesneys accepted the fact stoically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves: 'Why us? Why two? What's the deal here?'
'' Bill says. ``But our church family and our relatives have helped
us get through it. They've been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were better prepared the second time,'' Jerri says. ``In
some ways, it's almost easier to have them both having it. That way
one doesn't feel singled out. And we believe the Lord has a plan
for them to lead a wonderful life.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children, Courtney and Taylor, come bouncing into the
living room, giggling and only a little shy. They are remarkably
beautiful. Taylor is blond, Courtney is somewhat darker haired,
with a fine oval face and high cheekbones. The illness has
shortened their breath, but in return it has given them an almost
ethereal beauty, chiseled away pudginess and baby fat, modeled
their faces handsomely. They are active, cheerful and only very,
very slightly pale, because their lungs don't absorb quite as much
oxygen to redden their blood.
</P>
<P>
   They seem good children, sitting comfortably side by side in a
soft armchair, watching TV, with nebulizer masks on their faces,
inhaling Ventalin and Intol, two powerful anti-asthma medicines.
Quivering mists of vapor form and flee on the inside of the masks
as they inhale the cool, phlegm-loosening fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our daily routine,'' Jerri says. ``The kids take
multivitamin pills with every meal, every snack, and enzymes too,
to help them digest. Every morning and evening they do breathing
treatments with a nebulizer. They also take antibiotics and
steroids. Without Blue Cross, the pills would cost $2,500 every
three months. With Blue Cross, it's only $15.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be extra careful in the winter, with all the
northern visitors in the season. They bring down their colds and
flus with them, and you have to keep a sharp eye out for that and
jump on a cold the minute a red flag goes up,'' Bill says.
``Otherwise it can get really bad, really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most Courtney has missed is eight days of school. She had
a hard time with a cold this year and had to go on antibiotics for
15 days,'' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the percussion treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Daddy!'' Courtney exclaims and hops on his lap, lying
across his knees face up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Jerri does this far better than I do. I still have
to use this thing,'' Bill says, showing a doughnut-shaped rubber
O-ring he attaches to his fingers. Jerri needs no such aids; she
has mastered the percussion, cupping her hand just right so that a
soft ``pop'' of air gently explodes each time she taps Taylor's
chest. The young fellow looks dreamily peaceful, enjoying the
rhythmic, gentle blows, watching the television through eyes that
are getting sleepier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hit them, you sort of tap them with your hand
cupped, to set up a vibration. Sometimes they nod off while we're
percussing them. Sometimes they use it as an excuse to stay up
later. We say: `Time for bed!' And they say: `Oh no, mom! We've got
to do our treatments!' So they get an extra half hour up.
Rascals!''' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was at a ballgame giving Taylor a treatment, and
some man turned around in the bleachers and asked: `What's that
hammering noise? What are they building back there?' '' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! The tapping has to be done on the upper
and lower side, both lungs, four quadrants of the chest, in turn.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is not contagious. The children pose no danger to
their playmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because we have decided to raise them as normally as
we can and not leave them out, they've adjusted very well. When her
girlfriends come over, they'll ask: `Let me tap Courtney,' '' Bill
says.
</P>
<P>
   One day Courtney came home crying from preschool. Gently, her
mother asked if the other children were being mean to her. She
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the illness. I thought it was that she was
being set apart. I asked her what exactly was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it turned out she was having to take the pills in
applesauce, and the other kids thought that was babyish. So she
wanted to learn how to swallow pills without applesauce, and I
showed her. Now the two kids have this competition. Courtney will
swallow her medicine, and Taylor will challenge her. He'll say:
`Look: I can do two pills!' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the insidious mucus comes up, it looks clear and runny,
like thick saliva. The two children cough a bit more than other
children do, and have to carry tissues with them wherever they go.
Sometimes, they have a salt-ring around their forehead where
they've sweated. Salty skin is a symptom of CF.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the odd rewards of the malady is being able to eat
lots of fat and lots of salt. A CF child's body doesn't absorb fat
or salt as quickly as normal, so Courtney and Taylor can eat things
the rest of us can only look at longingly: rashers of bacon,
sizzling eggs, hamburgers, french fries, cake and ice cream _
practically as much as they like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even give them their own salt shakers and tell them to use
them. We also supplement their diets with Ensure,'' their mother
says.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline: ``Yes, we spank them,'' the father says. ``They
don't get off the hook just because they have CF. You've got to set
limits and let them know when you have gone beyond the limits, or
they will grow up with no idea of what the rules are. Sometimes I
just say: `Go to your room and we'll talk.' And that's enough, I
don't have to spank them.''
</P>
<P>
   The children enjoy Disney World and Six Flags over Georgia as
much as any children their age would. Taylor is crazy about Batman
and has a Bat-Plane in his room. Courtney likes kickball; Taylor
likes soccer and swimming. They are both looking forward to seeing
Toy Story 2. Buzz Lightyear is a favorite with both. The children
have arguments, mostly over who gets to sit up front in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the First Baptist Christian School,'' Courtney says.
And Taylor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go where she goes,'' Taylor says loyally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lifestyle as parents and children is pretty doggone
normal,'' Jerri Chesney insists. ``Neither one of them has ever
been hospitalized again. We've maintained them at home with
treatments. Every three months we go to St. Mary's. Our next visit
is in February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are really struggling with this thing. We consider
ourselves comparatively lucky. We're getting by. I've got a good
job, with good insurance. Our church family has backed us up
wonderfully. We have prayer chains, one praying for another who
needs it. We get a lot of energy from prayer,'' Bill Chesney says.
``Our hope is that one day, through science, or through the will of
God in a miracle, they will be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, the children say their prayers while their parents
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney prays to God to make her well, to cure her soon. She
has a lot of faith,'' her father continues. ``We actually learn a
lot from the children. Sometimes I hear their prayers at night and
they are so sincere, so confident, so faithful that I think to
myself, `I've got to learn from that.' ''

   ``They caught it. She tested positive. She had CF. I can still
remember us holding hands in the emergency room. We were just so
baffled by it. We don't know anybody on either side of the family
that has CF. We didn't know a thing about it. We'd never heard of
it, in either of our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, with one child already having CF, did the Chesneys choose
to have another child?
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed over it a lot, believe me,'' Jerri says. ``We wanted
a bigger family. The odds were three to one in our favor, that the
child would be normal. But we knew we were taking a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got pregnant with Taylor, we knew we were taking a
chance. But we did ultrasounds, and he seemed to be developing
normally. We didn't do amniocentesis, because we knew we would keep
him no matter what. We don't believe in abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was also this thought,'' Bill adds delicately, ``that if
we lost one child, we would still have another with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Taylor was born and was immediately diagnosed with CF.
</P>
<P>
   The Chesneys accepted the fact stoically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves: 'Why us? Why two? What's the deal here?'
'' Bill says. ``But our church family and our relatives have helped
us get through it. They've been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were better prepared the second time,'' Jerri says. ``In
some ways, it's almost easier to have them both having it. That way
one doesn't feel singled out. And we believe the Lord has a plan
for them to lead a wonderful life.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children, Courtney and Taylor, come bouncing into the
living room, giggling and only a little shy. They are remarkably
beautiful. Taylor is blond, Courtney is somewhat darker haired,
with a fine oval face and high cheekbones. The illness has
shortened their breath, but in return it has given them an almost
ethereal beauty, chiseled away pudginess and baby fat, modeled
their faces handsomely. They are active, cheerful and only very,
very slightly pale, because their lungs don't absorb quite as much
oxygen to redden their blood.
</P>
<P>
   They seem good children, sitting comfortably side by side in a
soft armchair, watching TV, with nebulizer masks on their faces,
inhaling Ventalin and Intol, two powerful anti-asthma medicines.
Quivering mists of vapor form and flee on the inside of the masks
as they inhale the cool, phlegm-loosening fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our daily routine,'' Jerri says. ``The kids take
multivitamin pills with every meal, every snack, and enzymes too,
to help them digest. Every morning and evening they do breathing
treatments with a nebulizer. They also take antibiotics and
steroids. Without Blue Cross, the pills would cost $2,500 every
three months. With Blue Cross, it's only $15.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be extra careful in the winter, with all the
northern visitors in the season. They bring down their colds and
flus with them, and you have to keep a sharp eye out for that and
jump on a cold the minute a red flag goes up,'' Bill says.
``Otherwise it can get really bad, really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most Courtney has missed is eight days of school. She had
a hard time with a cold this year and had to go on antibiotics for
15 days,'' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the percussion treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Daddy!'' Courtney exclaims and hops on his lap, lying
across his knees face up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Jerri does this far better than I do. I still have
to use this thing,'' Bill says, showing a doughnut-shaped rubber
O-ring he attaches to his fingers. Jerri needs no such aids; she
has mastered the percussion, cupping her hand just right so that a
soft ``pop'' of air gently explodes each time she taps Taylor's
chest. The young fellow looks dreamily peaceful, enjoying the
rhythmic, gentle blows, watching the television through eyes that
are getting sleepier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hit them, you sort of tap them with your hand
cupped, to set up a vibration. Sometimes they nod off while we're
percussing them. Sometimes they use it as an excuse to stay up
later. We say: `Time for bed!' And they say: `Oh no, mom! We've got
to do our treatments!' So they get an extra half hour up.
Rascals!''' Jerri says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was at a ballgame giving Taylor a treatment, and
some man turned around in the bleachers and asked: `What's that
hammering noise? What are they building back there?' '' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! The tapping has to be done on the upper
and lower side, both lungs, four quadrants of the chest, in turn.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is not contagious. The children pose no danger to
their playmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because we have decided to raise them as normally as
we can and not leave them out, they've adjusted very well. When her
girlfriends come over, they'll ask: `Let me tap Courtney,' '' Bill
says.
</P>
<P>
   One day Courtney came home crying from preschool. Gently, her
mother asked if the other children were being mean to her. She
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the illness. I thought it was that she was
being set apart. I asked her what exactly was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it turned out she was having to take the pills in
applesauce, and the other kids thought that was babyish. So she
wanted to learn how to swallow pills without applesauce, and I
showed her. Now the two kids have this competition. Courtney will
swallow her medicine, and Taylor will challenge her. He'll say:
`Look: I can do two pills!' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the insidious mucus comes up, it looks clear and runny,
like thick saliva. The two children cough a bit more than other
children do, and have to carry tissues with them wherever they go.
Sometimes, they have a salt-ring around their forehead where
they've sweated. Salty skin is a symptom of CF.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the odd rewards of the malady is being able to eat
lots of fat and lots of salt. A CF child's body doesn't absorb fat
or salt as quickly as normal, so Courtney and Taylor can eat things
the rest of us can only look at longingly: rashers of bacon,
sizzling eggs, hamburgers, french fries, cake and ice cream _
practically as much as they like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even give them their own salt shakers and tell them to use
them. We also supplement their diets with Ensure,'' their mother
says.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline: ``Yes, we spank them,'' the father says. ``They
don't get off the hook just because they have CF. You've got to set
limits and let them know when you have gone beyond the limits, or
they will grow up with no idea of what the rules are. Sometimes I
just say: `Go to your room and we'll talk.' And that's enough, I
don't have to spank them.''
</P>
<P>
   The children enjoy Disney World and Six Flags over Georgia as
much as any children their age would. Taylor is crazy about Batman
and has a Bat-Plane in his room. Courtney likes kickball; Taylor
likes soccer and swimming. They are both looking forward to seeing
Toy Story 2. Buzz Lightyear is a favorite with both. The children
have arguments, mostly over who gets to sit up front in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to the First Baptist Christian School,'' Courtney says.
And Taylor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I go where she goes,'' Taylor says loyally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lifestyle as parents and children is pretty doggone
normal,'' Jerri Chesney insists. ``Neither one of them has ever
been hospitalized again. We've maintained them at home with
treatments. Every three months we go to St. Mary's. Our next visit
is in February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are really struggling with this thing. We consider
ourselves comparatively lucky. We're getting by. I've got a good
job, with good insurance. Our church family has backed us up
wonderfully. We have prayer chains, one praying for another who
needs it. We get a lot of energy from prayer,'' Bill Chesney says.
``Our hope is that one day, through science, or through the will of
God in a miracle, they will be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, the children say their prayers while their parents
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney prays to God to make her well, to cure her soon. She
has a lot of faith,'' her father continues. ``We actually learn a
lot from the children. Sometimes I hear their prayers at night and
they are so sincere, so confident, so faithful that I think to
myself, `I've got to learn from that.' ''

   BELLSOUTH-KPN _ATLANTA _ BellSouth announced a clever deal last
week that will eventually give it a large stake in Dutch company
KPN Telecom _ without spending any money. The arrangement, praised
as savvy by analysts and the business press, was touted excitedly
by BellSouth as a way to boost its stock value. KPN stock has
soared, but investors stateside have yawned at BellSouth. Why? Did
BellSouth oversell this? Where does it leave the company? And where
does it lead? (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   CYSTIC-FIBROSIS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Every night, Bill and
Jerri Chesney tap their children's chests, over and over again, to
keep them from drowning. Courtney, 8, and Taylor, 5, have cystic
fibrosis, a disease that tricks the body into producing excess
mucus, which coats the pancreas and the lungs, inhibiting digestion
and breathing. The phlegmy superflux must be expelled daily, or the
children will be left gasping for air, like fish on dry land. Life
is a struggle for the Chesney family, but their faith is strong.

   NUTSNBOLTS _ The use of gas fireplaces and gas logs has
increased so dramatically in recent years that sales of gas
fireplaces now easily outstrip sales of wood-burning fireplaces,
stoves, fireplace inserts and pellet stoves. According to the
Hearth Product Association, sales of gas logs and fireplaces grew
from 149,000 units in in 1992 to nearly 800,000 in 1998. Sales of
wood-burning appliances were at 541,000 in 1998. It's not
surprising, then, that problems associated with gas-burning
fireplaces are increasing, too. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 27.

 &HT;    Prostate cancer screening targets RV owners
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Thor Industries has begun a national tour in a
custom-built recreational vehicle to deliver free prostate cancer
screenings to 10,000 men older than 40 in upcoming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I'm alive today is because I was able to catch
the disease early enough to eradicate it,'' says Wade F.B.
Thompson, Thor's chairman and a prostate cancer survivor. He called
it ``the most difficult experience of my life'' and established
``The Drive Against Prostate Cancer'' to educate men and their
families about the importance of screening.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 180,000 American men are diagnosed each year with
prostate cancer and nearly 40,000 die. But it is virtually 100
percent curable if detected before it has spread from the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is targeting RV owners at RV shows and other public
forums, Thompson said, ``since so many RVers are over 40.'' Thor is
the second-largest manufacturer of RVs and largest midsized bus
manufacturer in North America.
</P>
<P>
   All men 50 and older will be offered the screenings, as will
those 40 and older who are black or have a family history of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-foot Airstream medical vehicle has two private screening
rooms, where the 10-minute process will include a digital rectal
exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test from trained
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's schedule of at least 15 cities is still being
assembled and has no announced date locally. Sponsoring partners
are the Cancer Research Institute, Endocare, Bayer Diagnostics and
UroCor.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Joseph Heller is dead. Everybody dies.
That's Catch-23. And I'd been meaning to ask him about World War
II. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LAMB-COLUMN _ Social connection is as important for doctors to
measure as weight, cholesterol and blood pressure, says Dr. Brooks
S. Edwards, medical editor of the Mayo Clinic Health Oasis Web
site. ``The strength of our relationships has great bearing on how
well we age, how well we deal with life's challenges and how well

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ It has been a long dry spell, but finally
there's a juicy new lunatic right-wing conspiracy theory to
entertain us, and just in time to add to the general hilarity and
joy kicked up by the sundry agitated millennial hysterias. (Teepen,
Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ It used to be that to have a memento from a
famous or infamous person was to have something rare; a
conversation piece. In this last decade of the 1900s, however, it
is rare that someone isn't collecting mementos. Late last month,
for example, more than 350 people turned out in San Diego to bid
for the possessions of the Heaven's Gate cult whose 39 in-house
fanatics did away with themselves in a mass suicide. (Kleinberg,
Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ Have you heard about the Northwest pilot who
held up a flight for an hour because he didn't like the meal he was
served? Walked off the airplane, past the airport jiffy-junk food
establishments, got into a cab and went to get himself some real
food. The airline had a little surprise for him when he got back.
They fired him. In the case of this 22-year veteran of airline
abuse, I would have thrown my discomfort to the winds and cheered
the hero who risked it all to protest his company's practice of
serving food that, unless you've seen a third-world dumpster for
yourself, cannot be aptly described. (Schuett, Cox News Service)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Listen to the children _ lean, mean
and obscene. They know not what they do, what consequences words
can carry. We must again teach them to look before they bleep, and
remind ourselves as well. That's what Chick Lewis' mission has
been. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tennis court lines are
not supposed to be wavy, so my wife's first reaction was, ``That's
odd.'' During a pause in a clinic she was teaching, she
experimented, closing each eye in turn. Slight problem in the left
eye. Time for an appointment. After dilation and an hour of charts
and lights, the doctor offered this somber finding: Cataracts in
both eyes, beginning of glaucoma in both eyes, and a ``wet''
retina, indicative of bleeding. Stunned, Nellie asked: ``What can I
do?'' This is the story of what Nellie, her HMO and her doctors
did. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   BELLSOUTH-KPN _ATLANTA _ BellSouth announced a clever deal last
week that will eventually give it a large stake in Dutch company
KPN Telecom _ without spending any money. The arrangement, praised
as savvy by analysts and the business press, was touted excitedly
by BellSouth as a way to boost its stock value. KPN stock has
soared, but investors stateside have yawned at BellSouth. Why? Did
BellSouth oversell this? Where does it leave the company? And where
does it lead? (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

fibrosis, a disease that tricks the body into producing excess
mucus, which coats the pancreas and the lungs, inhibiting digestion

   NUTSNBOLTS _ The use of gas fireplaces and gas logs has
increased so dramatically in recent years that sales of gas
fireplaces now easily outstrip sales of wood-burning fireplaces,
stoves, fireplace inserts and pellet stoves. According to the
Hearth Product Association, sales of gas logs and fireplaces grew
from 149,000 units in in 1992 to nearly 800,000 in 1998. Sales of
wood-burning appliances were at 541,000 in 1998. It's not
surprising, then, that problems associated with gas-burning
fireplaces are increasing, too. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 27.

   WINE-LABEL (San Francisco) _ The federal government's decision
to temporarily halt a program that lets the wine industry tout the
health benefits of wine on its labels has left some in California's
powerful wine industry with a slight taste of sour grapes. Yielding
to pressure from Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for the time being put the cork on
the 10-month-old practice of permitting wine labels to allude to
wine's health benefits. The agency plans hearings on the labeling

   TV-WESTWING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The great American soap opera
that is ``The West Wing'' could never have made it post-Watergate

Frank Capra dreams are over. Even Bill Clinton's bar-lowering
antics in the White House failed to raise much of a ruckus among
the general population. The last 25 years have been a textbook
example of jadedness grown to exponential levels. Maybe that's why
``The West Wing'' is a hit, why it casts such a mysterious trance
over cynics. By TIM GOODMAN.

   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia _ Alongside a two-lane road that winds
through the hills in southern Kosovo sits a walled farmyard with a
cinderblock house at its center.
</P>
<P>
   The steep, forested hills rising all around could be mistaken
for those of north Georgia. Skender Rahimi couldn't get this place
out of his mind even while he was in the safety and relative
serenity of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The house by the road is Rahimi's home. By local standards, it's
no palace, but it's a good solid house and a cause for pride. It
pained Rahimi (pronounced: ``ra-HEE-mee'') to leave it eight months
ago to escape advancing Serb forces. With seven family members, he
made his way to neighboring Macedonia and a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   His story is a familiar tale of exile and return that is common
among the 800,000 Kosovar Albanians who fled their homeland last
spring during the brutal conflict between the Serb-led Yugoslav
military and ethnic Albanian separatists. The conflict came to an
end after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced the Yugoslav army,
police and paramilitaries to withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When Rahimi fled in April he left behind his parents, whose
memory haunted him for the months he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Parents hold a special place in Albanian society: Children,
particularly sons and their wives, are duty-bound to care for them.
The idea of sending parents off to a nursing home or even a
retirement village is an unheard of absurdity, particularly here in
the deeply traditional
</P>
<P>
   countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahimi's parents _ both in their 60s, an advanced age in
Kosovo _ were not up to the long journey south to Macedonia. Also,
it seemed unlikely that Serb soldiers would harm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived with them more than 40 years,'' Rahimi said a on
recent day in the house's sitting room over cigarettes and cups of
strong Albanian tea. ``I must care for them now.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to transfer refugees out of overwhelmed
Macedonia, Rahimi's family was airlifted to the United States and
ultimately to Atlanta. America wasn't his first choice _ he had
requested Sweden or Norway to remain closer to home _ but he was
intrigued when he saw the destination on a list in the refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is an odd fantasy to people in this part of
the world. Few have visited it, but America is always with them in
movies, sitcoms, music and endless stream of consumer products.
Yet, it remains a distant place. ``It is somewhere for other
people, that's what we always thought,'' he said. ``Before, I
couldn't have an impression. The biggest impression I had was that
Albright and Clinton were helping us to get freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, after a brief stay in New Jersey, the family arrived in
Atlanta and were housed in an apartment complex near Hartsfield
International Airport. Rahimi spoke not one word of English, and
his children had learned only a little more in school. None had
been to a city as big as Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they made a life. From some Bosnians he met, he learned
where he could get familiar food (he didn't care much for the
American fare he sampled, with the exception of pizza). From
Vietnamese emigrants he met at work, he learned survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   But his most powerful memory of Atlanta is a thousand little
generosities given by an American named Mike _ Rahimi can't recall
the odd sounding last name. ``I still think of Mike and walking
around Atlanta,'' Rahimi recalls, first with a smile and then with
a waver in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gaertner, a Catholic Social Services volunteer, assisted
the Rahimis in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking if I could ever help him as I was helped,''
Rahimi says, pausing without ending the sentence. ``They were very
good people in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he loves his native Kosovo deeply, Rahimi would have
liked to have stayed in America. He harbored a powerful desire to
see his five children educated _ a difficult challenge in the
uncertainty of a war-torn province. His younger son, Flamur, caught
the computer bug but has returned to a place where he has no access
to one.
</P>
<P>
   And at 41, Rahimi was prepared to embark on a new life in the
strange but promising land.
</P>
<P>
   Then he received a phone call. He was told that his mother was
sick, perhaps mortally ill. His father was despondent, perhaps
losing his mind. His house in Gnjilane has no telephone and it had
become virtually impossible to get reliable information on his
parents' conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In September he decided it was his duty to return to Kosovo.
However, his eldest son, Mentor, wanted to stay in America. Mentor
turned 18 on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me 'You're sending me to Kosovo. Where I can't
study, where I can't make a life,''' Rahimi recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife agreed to let their son stay. ``So, he will
finish school there (in Atlanta) and maybe he can work there.''
Rahimi says, smiling. ``Now Mike is his second father.''
</P>
<P>
   After saying this, Rahimi looks at his younger son and one of
the three daughters who returned with him to Kosovo and then to his
wife. Briefly, they seem to share in the emptiness of Mentor's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' Rahimi says after a minute or two. ``But now
he's grown up and he's living his life. It would be harder now to
have him here and to be unable to give him the school he needs now.
That would be too much for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home in September, Rahimi was overjoyed to find
the house undamaged. About 100,000 houses in Kosovo were damaged in
the fighting, half of them beyond repair. He had assumed the worst.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Bathie, will never forget his return. She was
standing on the front porch. ``I looked at the gate open,'' she
recalls. ``And then I saw Skender's face, the face I never thought
I would see again. I thought I was dead before and now I'm alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He was relieved to find his parents alive and reasonably
healthy. It was all he had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   While his home and immediate family was spared, things weren't
so good for everyone. Five cousins were dead. Many houses were
destroyed. The mosque down the road was a pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   And with winter coming on hard, there will be plenty of misery
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi thinks a lot about Atlanta and his son. He wonders if he
will ever see either again. When he wants to talk to Mentor, he
walks about five miles to use a telephone. But it's not the same.
</P>
<P>
   He hands a visiting American a handwritten note and a shopping
bag of cassette tapes to take to Atlanta. ``These are his
favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Kosovo doesn't allow much time for reverie. He and his
wife have four children and two parents to care for.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi says he's ready for winter. Firewood is stacked neatly
against the wall. The family tractor is parked near the chicken
coops on the front wall.
</P>
<P>
   It is cold the morning Rahimi's wife, Vahide, cooks ``fli-a'' _
a special dish with layers of yogurt and a pasta-like bread _ in a
pan over the open fire. She's in constant motion, stirring the
coals and adjusting the pan to get the heat right. She says very
little.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi sits on his haunches smoking and warming his hands on the
fire. His mother gazes at him from a few feet away. He wonders if
he was right to leave Atlanta, but he doesn't allow himself to
drift into regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to find the house and the tractor weren't
damaged,'' he says, squinting as the smoke stings his eyes. ``But
life is more important than anything else. This is what I think
now.''

so good for everyone. Five cousins were dead. Many houses were
destroyed. The mosque down the road was a pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   And with winter coming on hard, there will be plenty of misery
to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi thinks a lot about Atlanta and his son. He wonders if he
will ever see either again. When he wants to talk to Mentor, he
walks about five miles to use a telephone. But it's not the same.
</P>
<P>
   He hands a visiting American a handwritten note and a shopping
bag of cassette tapes to take to Atlanta. ``These are his
favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Kosovo doesn't allow much time for reverie. He and his
wife have four children and two parents to care for.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi says he's ready for winter. Firewood is stacked neatly
against the wall. The family tractor is parked near the chicken
coops on the front wall.
</P>
<P>
   It is cold the morning Rahimi's wife, Vahide, cooks ``fli-a'' _
a special dish with layers of yogurt and a pasta-like bread _ in a
pan over the open fire. She's in constant motion, stirring the
coals and adjusting the pan to get the heat right. She says very
little.
</P>
<P>
   Rahimi sits on his haunches smoking and warming his hands on the
fire. His mother gazes at him from a few feet away. He wonders if
he was right to leave Atlanta, but he doesn't allow himself to
drift into regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to find the house and the tractor weren't
damaged,'' he says, squinting as the smoke stings his eyes. ``But
life is more important than anything else. This is what I think
now.''

 &HT;    Flowers speak prayers if you know how to listen
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 16.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sally Ann Giray has lost control, and her life's all the better
for it.
</P>
<P>
   A poet, storyteller, playwright, actress and gardener, Giray
last year gave in to the pulls of words and flowers and
spirituality, combining the three to produce a book of poems,
``Prayers From the Flowers.'' She self-published the 63-page volume
soon after a friend who lay dying urged her to do so, to become the
way she had been as a child _ when she talked to flowers in her
native England. And listened to them.
</P>
<P>
   As a young girl, she says, she spent much time alone. And
flowers ``became my people. They gave me spiritual strength.''
</P>
<P>
   After her friend (he was married to her best girlfriend) died,
Giray, who also has lived 13 years in Jamaica, began writing the
poems, recalling the magic of her grandparents' Sussex garden, the
prayers she heard from the daisy, orchid, dogwood, morning glory,
sunflower, evening primrose and more.
</P>
<P>
   The poems ``just came,'' she said on a welcome wintry day, as we
enjoyed a lunch of homemade vegetable soup, salad and corn bread in
her Decatur home. ``As if someone was guiding my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, her guidance, her loss of control, is like
gardening itself. After a certain point, something beyond the
gardener takes over; there is a flow of energy between the plant
and the person that relies less on how well we work the garden than
on how well we connect with it.
</P>
<P>
   This guiding force has many faces, many names. And, just as
Giray notes that ``Prayer is like love; there are so many ways of
making it,'' and that she is still on ``the long journey toward
finding my own way to prayer,'' we all are seeking ways to get to
the garden of peace.
</P>
<P>
   During her journey, Giray has met and written about some
thoughtful, moving plants and the prayers they have uttered. Listen
to the rose:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Lord of all
</P>
<P>
   have You seen how
</P>
<P>
   here along my stem
</P>
<P>
   You have set thorns?
</P>
<P>
   Even my leaves
</P>
<P>
   are often prickly
</P>
<P>
   I am a mess!
</P>
<P>
   Dear Lord of all
</P>
<P>
   is this Your will
</P>
<P>
   Your secret blessing
</P>
<P>
   to have this thorny stem
</P>
<P>
   push the bud
</P>
<P>
   reminiscent
</P>
<P>
   in amaze of glory
</P>
<P>
   to a flowered beauty
</P>
<P>
   of heavenly grace
</P>
<P>
   And, in the last of four stanzas, the iris says:
</P>
<P>
   In tongues of blue
</P>
<P>
   unsealing, the bud
</P>
<P>
   unfurls its bloom
</P>
<P>
   and all's at peace
</P>
<P>
   and all is You
</P>
<P>
   At the end of her book, Giray lists a floral vocabulary, passed
down since ancient times. Among various plants and their meanings:
</P>
<P>
   Aster: elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Camellia: constancy and steadfastness.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel: victory and glory.
</P>
<P>
   Thyme: spontaneous emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Violet: modesty.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, flowers speak _ and teach _ volumes. ``Everything in
nature grows; it doesn't ask how,'' Giray says. ``It springs. I've
learned to allow things to spring. Flowers have given me the
ability to lose control, a new sense of being one with everything.
If you unlace, you expand, and your spirit is free to recognize
what beauty is.''
</P>
<P>
   Giray sells and ships ``Prayers From the Flowers'' for $11.95.

 &HT;    Grand ideas for impromptu entertaining
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 16.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It may be the last minute, but all of a sudden you're
in the mood to throw a holiday dinner party. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) Call your caterers on the off chance they can work you in,
within a week of Christmas;
</P>
<P>
   b) Take a hard look at Happy Meals;
</P>
<P>
   c) Have another drink and forget the idea;
</P>
<P>
   d) Go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta event planner and caterer Tony Conway thinks you should
choose ``d.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the food and drink simple but the presentation grand,''
he said during a demonstration at the Atlanta Decorative Arts
Center's recent Designers Holiday Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Food as basic as mashed potatoes can be served in something as
elegant as martini glasses, he said, which is bound to get the
chatter going.
</P>
<P>
   Presentation centers on the table. But rather than spending a
small fortune on flowers, linens and glassware, look around the
house for alternative uses for items you already have _ a throw
becomes a tablecloth, a small Christmas tree makes a centerpiece _
and rent the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Then leave the ``entertaining'' to the guests. ``You're getting
your friends together, and they will take care of the
conversation,'' said Teresa Day, Conway's partner in Legendary
Events. ``You provide the drama.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 15-minute demonstration, the two pulled together a holiday
table for an impromptu cocktail party. Here are their pointers:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Table the idea: Don't have a long table for making a
presentation? An 8-foot folding one can be had at rental shops for
as little as $20.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Show a little leg: On the other hand, if you have a nice
table, don't hide it. ``One of our most expensive things in the
home is the dining room table, but we drape over it completely with
cloths,'' Day said. ``Let the table show.'' Place the cloth off
center or toss a throw on it so that parts of the tabletop show.
Gather the throw at one end and tie it with a ribbon. If you want
to dress things up, rent skirting, which can be attached with clips
around the edge of the table or with duct tape to an undercloth. Or
you can make a simple skirting with a nice piece of fabric and add
a shirttail hem.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Center of attention: Who says a centerpiece has to be a floral
arrangement? And who says whatever you choose has to be
``centered''? Decorate a small potted Christmas tree and place it
at one end of the table for instant height as well as light. Lay a
wreath in the center of the table around a punch bowl or soup
tureen and decorate it with cut roses stuck into water-filled
picks. Or stack identically wrapped gift boxes in the center,
building-block fashion. Use collectibles, such as ornaments, dolls
or music boxes, to decorate a theme table. ``Look around the house,
in the closets, the china cabinet,'' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Create height: One means for creating a dramatic table is
different levels for giving objects height. Consider stacking
Styrofoam blocks, books or gift boxes and hiding them under the
tablecloth to draw attention to a centerpiece or even a stack of
serving plates. For a contemporary look, place glass blocks, which
sell for under $10, on top of the cloth. ``Blocks also make great
reflections for candles,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shed light on it: Like artwork, no table presentation is
complete without proper lighting. Use small lanterns or lots of
small votives to highlight the tabletop. If the skirting is
interesting, clamp a light under the table.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Go unconventional: One of Conway's favorite serving pieces is
the martini glass, which he collects. Because of its wide bowl and
narrow stem, a 9-ounce glass is practical yet elegant for serving
everything from tomato bisque to frozen yogurt, for both seated
dinners and stand-up affairs. ``They're so sexy and fun to use,''
Conway said. If you don't own any, rent them, or, if you want to be
really practical, go with plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's the ideas, not the materials, that make
entertaining grand.

 &HT;    Glassmakers uncork vault of new wine stems perfect for gift
giving and festive entertaining
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 16.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time to shatter another myth: To set a festive dinner table,
matching china, matching glassware and matching napkins are musts.
If only guests would wear uniforms to complement the color scheme!
</P>
<P>
   Professional party planners will tell you their most fun and
exciting affairs result from breaking the rules.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to selecting wine glasses, why not let your guests
help?
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks really neat when you set a table to let everybody
pick out their own special one,'' said Trisha Puls of City Art
Works, an Atlanta gift gallery.
</P>
<P>
   And with the array of designs in stemware these days _ from
whimsical conversation-starters to elegant art glass _ the choices
are endless.
</P>
<P>
   Both mainstream retailers and art galleries are toasting a hot
commodity among those grown weary of the same old, same old of
homogenous ``sets.'' Consumers are drawn to colors, shapes and
sizes that allow them to mix and match to suit their personalities,
their guests' and the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Prices run the gamut, from less than $5 for mass-produced stems
at houseware havens such as Pier 1 Imports to thousands for
handblown, artist-signed pieces at high-end galleries. Stems priced
less than $100 typically are purchased as functional pieces, while
those above usually are sold to collectors, said David Alfrey of
Vespermann Glass Gallery, which is showing goblets by glass artists
across the country through December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people collect the one-of-a-kind goblet, while some just
want something a little unusual,'' said Ellie Mueller of
Vespermann.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, wine stems can be both a fun and practical
gift idea. You can build on someone's collection or start them on a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are viewing glassware more as pieces of art these days,
so they're going beyond just being functional,'' Puls said.
</P>
<P>
   But remember: If the glass is to be used, not just viewed, its
shape, texture and color can affect the taste of the wine it holds.
``We eat and drink with our eyes as much as our mouths,'' said
Atlanta wine expert Jane Garvey, so choose your stems carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought size was one of those myths worth
shattering ...
</P>
<P>
   P I C K I N G A S T E M
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a wine glass isn't just about art. There's a science to
it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently served a friend the same wine in two different
glasses,'' said Jane Garvey, wine columnist for the The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's Food section. ``He said, `I liked this one
but not that one.'''
</P>
<P>
   She rests her case: ``The shape of the glass determines how wine
is thrown back into your mouth and what parts of the palate it
hits, affecting the way it tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid altering the taste, Garvey recommends:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stems slightly flared at the the hip (for swirling) and
slightly closed at the lip (for focusing aroma). Lips should be
plain, not curled.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stems with generous bowls for swirling more complex red wines
and smaller ones for basic whites as well as roses. Typically, reds
should be served in a 20-ounce or larger glass, pouring only 6 to 8
ounces so there's room for swirling; whites should be served in a
10- to 12-ounce glass, by the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bowls without a surface design or color. A heavily cut surface
affects how the wine rolls over the palate, while dark shades
obscure the wine's color, which psychologically can alter the
taste.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Flutes or tulip-shaped glasses slightly closed at the top for
champagnes. White wines should not be served in flutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Holding all glasses by the stem and all flutes by the base so
the hand doesn't affect the wine's temperature. ``Hold it by the
bowl only if you want to warm it up,'' Garvey said.

 &HT;    Don't let thieves steal the holiday
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 16.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't let a grinch steal your Christmas. Or your Kwanzaa, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season is supposed to be a time of good cheer, but
it's also a time when home burglaries are at their highest,
according to law enforcement experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, burglaries are a bit higher in July and August, the
heavy vacation months, and then again in December,'' says Jean
O'Neil, director of research for the National Crime Prevention
Council in Washington. ``Based on what I hear from police
departments, the increase in December is concentrated around the
holidays ... especially in suburban areas or neighborhoods with a
lot of new families who might be going home for the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Burglary is a crime of opportunity, where the objective is to
get in and out of a home as quickly as possible. Most burglars
won't spend more than a couple of minutes trying to break in,
experts say. That's why one of the most effective ways of
protecting your home is to discourage unwanted intruders from ever
attempting to get in. Here are some things you can do, whether
you're going out of town or just planning to be away for several
hours:
</P>
<P>
   Inside the home
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Put interior lights on a timer. Rotate the on and off times to
discourage any would-be intruders. If possible, put stereos and
televisions on a timer, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Turn the radio to a talk show program so it sounds as if
conversations are taking place.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Turn the ringer on the telephone down or off, so an unanswered
ring can't be heard from outside.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Close the drapes when you're not at home, so burglars can't
see your valuables from a window.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Move important papers and expensive belongings to a
safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do an inventory of your home. Take good-quality photographs of
items that are hard to describe. Write down item serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure locks on windows are sturdy. Replace thumb latches
on windows with keyed locks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Install double cylinder deadbolt locks on doors with glass
panes. Make sure all exterior doors are sturdy and secure,
including patio doors and doors that lead from the garage to the
house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If firearms are in the home, make sure they are stored in a
safe place and properly secured. Store ammunition in a separate
location. Firearms and ammunition are among the most frequently
stolen items in home burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Purchase a security system and make sure it is turned on when
you leave home. When shopping for a system, look for companies that
provide 24-hour monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Trim hedges and shrubbery on the exterior of the house, so
there are no areas in which to hide. Make sure the perimeter of the
home is well lighted.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Walk around your home and determine how you would get in if
you locked yourself out. If you can find an easy way inside, it's a
good chance a burglar can, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure there are no tree branches or outside structures
that would give someone easy access to the upper level.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do not leave expensive tools, equipment, toys or bikes in an
unlocked garage or shed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do not hide keys outside.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't advertise expensive gifts by leaving empty boxes on the
curb for the garbage collector. Tear down boxes or take to a dump.
</P>
<P>
   In your community
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask a trusted neighbor or friend to park his car in your
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure delivery of mail and newspapers is either stopped or
items are picked up by a friend or neighbor. Give neighbors a key
and a telephone number where they can contact you if an emergency
arises.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask a crime prevention officer if your local police can put
your home on a surveillance list.

DESSERT SECRETS FROM SPAGO _ AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
 4 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If visions of sugarplums dance in your head this holiday season
and you're looking for some show-stopping desserts to dazzle guests
for a variety of festivities, turn to these creations culled from
some of the season's newest dessert books. There are a wealth of
memorable possibilities to deck holiday tables. All of the ideas
are accessible to home cooks and feature easy techniques and
presentation along with great taste.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recipes are shared by pastry chefs, others by
magazine cookbook staffs and others by self-taught cooks.
</P>
<P>
   You can bring fabulous chocolate desserts from Spago Las Vegas
home with festive selections from pastry chef Mary Bergin that are
found in her new book, ``Spago Chocolate'' (Ramdom House; $35),
written with Judy Gethers. Gethers, a home cook, was responsible
for breaking down the restaurant-size recipes to family-friendly
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the book's 130 recipes (which vary in difficulty) are
served in the restaurant, notes Bergin, but in a different form.
``Most of the desserts served in the restaurant are individual
creations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergin is a self-trained pastry chef who has been with Spago for
17 years. She started in West Hollywood before moving to the Las
Vegas location seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate is the most popular flavor for desserts. Eight out
of 10 people like chocolate.'' For birthdays and small weddings,
Bergin's chocolate tiramisu cake tops the list of favorite
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to appeal to novice as well as accomplished cooks, the
book's straightforward step-by-step recipe instructions don't take
anything for granted, says Bergin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really important to me to know that when I give someone
a recipe that they will be able to make it. I know what it is like
to be on the receiving end of a recipe that doesn't work and
doesn't look anything like the picture accompanying it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Consistency is important, and it's crucial to read through a
recipe prior to tackling it. With a well-written recipe, three
different people should end up with the same excellent results, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to successful chocolate desserts, Bergin advises
cooks to use the best-quality chocolate available along with other
fresh, top-quality ingredients. She's made chocolate desserts with
varying qualities of chocolate _ from Baker's to Valrhona. For home
cooks, Trader Joe's pound plus (both bittersweet and milk chocolate
available) is a good bet for the price. When it comes to melting
chocolate, be sure to use simmering, not boiling, water in a double
boiler.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bergin bakes pastries all day long, she often goes home
and whips up desserts, sweets and dinner for her 17-year-old son
and 15-year-old daughter. Her son favors the Cookies and Cream
Cheesecake from the book while her daughter likes the candies and
chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   When making cookies at home, Bergin often forms the dough into
walnut-size balls and freezes them in plastic zipper bags so her
kids can bake them off when they want something sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bergin's favorite easy ideas are a Fudgy Chocolate Cake,
Judy's Chocolate Date Cake, Chocolate Trifle, Chocolate-Almond Ice
Cream Cake and Hazelnut Brownies. To celebrate Christmas, tradition
at Bergin's home includes a completely edible gingerbread house
along with a yule log, cookies, creme brulee, apple and pumpkin
pies, meringue mushrooms and assorted cakes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bake It to the Limit'' by Dede Wilson (William Morrow;
$30), you'll find basic recipes along with more elaborate,
dressed-up renditions for a spectacular presentation. For instance,
Wilson describes how to gussy up a Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart by
piping a free-form peanut butter design on top of the ganache. She
also tells how to paint Chocolate Espresso Shortbread cookies with
edible gold and silver for a dazzling effect.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of David Lebovitz's new book, ``Room for Dessert''
(HarperCollins; $30), is simple. He favors straightforward, highly
flavored desserts, showing off the ingredients _ things he likes to
eat, he says. ``It's the greatest hits of all the best recipes I've
been making over the last 20 years of my life, personally and
professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his counterparts, Lebovitz, a former pastry cook
at Chez Panisse in Berkeley for more than a decade, has geared the
110 sweet recipes for home bakers and tried to make them clear and
easy-to-follow. ``When I was choosing recipes to put into this
book, I had two major criteria: The ingredients had to be
accessible and the recipes had to be easy to duplicate in the
average home kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebovitz avoided recipes requiring things no one wants to do at
home, like tempering chocolate, spinning sugar or decorating with
several pastry bags. His most complicated recipes are not as
daunting as they appear. Some of the elements can be prepared in
advance. No magical techniques, fancy equipment or hard-to-find
ingredients are required.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to holiday desserts and baking, keep in mind that
to ensure success, it's best to follow the recipe closely because
many require more attention to detail and involve a more scientific
approach to the ingredient mix than other recipes like chilis,
soups and salads, where a little of this and that and intuitive
cooking are fine.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in reading more about baking basics and
techniques, turn to ``Good Housekeeping Baking'' (Hearst Books;
$30), a wonderful new volume filled with color photos and more than
600 recipes _ among them Christmas creations like Brandied Buche de
Noel, Stollen, Panettone and more.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for festive, indulgent and impressive desserts to deck the
halls, try some of these. &QL;

PERSIMMON CAKE
</P>
<P>
   For this dense, moist cake, use very ripe persimmons that are
completely soft and translucent. The larger, elongated Hachiya
variety is best for baking, although the other common persimmon,
the Fuyu, will do. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 very ripe, medium-size persimmons &QL; 
1 cup walnuts, toasted &QL; 
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, at room temperature &QL; 
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
2 eggs, at room temperature &QL; 
1 3/4 cups flour &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 teaspoon baking soda &QL; 
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
3/4 cup dried currants, soaked in 1/4 cup Cognac OR brandy &QL; 
Powdered sugar for dusting cake &QL; 
Whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Cut persimmons in half and scoop out pulpy flesh with a spoon.
Puree pulp in a food processor or a blender, or pass through a food
mill. You will need 1 cup puree for the cake. (You can freeze any
leftover puree and use another time.)
</P>
<P>
   Position oven rack in center of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Line a 9-inch round cake pan or a 9 1/2-inch springform pan with
a circle of parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Cream together butter and granulated sugar until light and
fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes in a standing electric mixer. Add vanilla
and beat in eggs, one at a time. Stop and scrape down sides of bowl
and beat until eggs are completely incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together flour, salt, baking soda and cinnamon.
</P>
<P>
   Stir 1/2 of persimmon puree into creamed butter mixture, then
thoroughly mix in dry ingredients. Stir in remaining puree, walnuts
and currants with their liquor. Pour batter into prepared cake pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 45 minutes, until a
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from oven and
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Remove cake from pan and peel off parchment paper. Dust with
powdered sugar and serve with whipped cream. Makes 1 (9- or 9
1/2-inch) cake, 10 to 12 servings.

CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA CAKE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe has only four ingredients. It can be assembled in
minutes, and it produces a cake so intensely chocolate-flavored
that the only thing you will want to serve alongside it will be
softly whipped cream. Use the very best chocolate you can find. If
you want, substitute walnuts or pistachios for the macadamias _ or
leave out the nuts altogether. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter &QL; 
1 1/2 pounds bittersweet chocolate (see Note) &QL; 
1 cup macadamia nuts, toasted &QL; 
8 eggs, at room temperature &QL; 
Whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Position oven rack in center of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Butter a 9 1/2-inch springform pan and line bottom with a round
of parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Cut butter into small pieces and chop chocolate into small
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl set over hot water, melt chocolate and butter
together. Coarsely chop macadamia nuts.
</P>
<P>
   With an electric mixer, beat eggs until a ribbon forms when you
lift beater.
</P>
<P>
   Fold eggs into melted butter and chocolate, then rapidly fold in
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer batter to lined springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 400-degree oven 45 minutes. If cake appears to
be getting too dark on top, drape a piece of foil over it and
continue baking until cake begins to feel firm in center.
</P>
<P>
   When cake has cooled, loosen cake by running a knife around
sides of pan, then remove sides of springform pan. Invert cake onto
a serving plate, lift off bottom of springform pan and peel away
parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Turn cake onto a serving plate. Serve with whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 (9 1/2-inch) round cake, 10 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Because this cake has no added sugar, use a chocolate that
is not overly bitter.

PANFORTE
</P>
<P>
   This is my version of the classic holiday confection from Siena,
Italy. I like my panforte quite spicy (in Siena they call highly
spiced panforte panpepato), so I added a brisk amount of black
pepper. This makes it ideal for after dinner: sweet, but not too
sweet, with a spicy bite to it. Panforte can be made well in
advance and kept on hand for serving after dinner, sliced into
small wedges, with strong coffee or with vin santo. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, plus 2 teaspoons more for dusting
pan &QL; 
3 ounces bittersweet chocolate &QL; 
1 cup hazelnuts, toasted and loose skins removed &QL; 
1 1/2 cups almonds, toasted &QL; 
3/4 cup flour &QL; 
3/4 cup chopped candied citrus peel (preferably candied citron) &QL; 
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
2 teaspoons ground ginger &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
Pinch grated nutmeg &QL; 
Pinch chili pepper &QL; 
1 cup granulated sugar &QL; 
3/4 cup honey &QL; 
Powdered sugar for dusting
</P>
<P>
   Position oven rack in center of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Butter a 9 1/2-inch springform pan. Dust pan with 2 teaspoons
cocoa and tap out any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Chop chocolate and melt in a dry bowl set over simmering water.
</P>
<P>
   Very coarsely chop hazelnuts and almonds, leaving a few whole.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, stir together hazelnuts, almonds, flour,
5 tablespoons cocoa, candied citrus and spices.
</P>
<P>
   In a small heavy saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, mix
granulated sugar and honey and heat to 240 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Stir chocolate into chopped nut mixture. Stir in honey syrup. At
this point, batter will begin to stiffen, so work rapidly. Transfer
batter to prepared pan. Dampen your hand or back of a spoon and use
to spread batter evenly and smooth surface of panforte.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 300-degree oven 50 minutes. Remove from oven
and let stand about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While panforte is still warm, loosen edges from pan with a
knife. Remove springform and remove bottom from panforte with help
of a metal spatula. Cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle top of panforte with powdered sugar and rub in with
your hands. Do same to bottom and sides. Wrap panforte lightly in
plastic wrap and store in a cool, dry place until ready to serve.
It will keep 1 year and improves with age. Makes 1 (9 1/2-inch)
cake, 16 to 20 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Traditionally, panforte is baked in a pan lined with a
disk of edible rice paper, which makes it much easier to remove
panforte from pan. Edible rice paper is available by mail order
from Sweet Celebrations, (800) 328-6722.

CLASSIC LINZER TART
</P>
<P>
   This Austrian specialty, associated with the city of Linz, is a
tart filled with raspberry jam. Modest, perhaps, by Austrian
standards (for starters, there's no whipped cream on or in it), the
linzer tart is nonetheless a beloved tradition. Criss-crossed with
strips of rich nut pastry, the diamonds of ruby-red jam peek
through like jewels. Although usually made with almonds, this
pastry is delicious when hazelnuts are used instead. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2/3 cup hazelnuts (filberts) &QL; 
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar &QL; 
6 tablespoons butter OR margarine, slightly softened &QL; 
1 large egg &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon baking powder &QL; 
3/4 cup seedless raspberry jam &QL; 
Powdered sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Place hazelnuts in a 9x9-inch metal baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 15 minutes, or until toasted.
Wrap hot hazelnuts in a clean cloth towel. With hands, roll
hazelnuts back and forth to remove most of skins. Cool completely.
Turn off oven.
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor with a knife blade attached, or a blender,
pulse nuts with 1/4 cup flour until nuts are finely ground.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, with a mixer at low speed, beat brown sugar and
butter until blended. Increase speed to medium-high; beat until
creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping bowl with a rubber spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce speed to medium and beat in egg and vanilla until smooth,
about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low. Add ground nut mixture,
cinnamon, salt, baking powder and remaining 1 cup flour; beat just
until combined.
</P>
<P>
   With floured hands, press 2/3 of dough into bottom and up side
of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom (1/4 inch below edge
of pan). Wrap tart shell and remaining dough in plastic wrap and
refrigerate 30 minutes, or until firm.
</P>
<P>
   Spread raspberry jam over bottom of tart shell to 1/4-inch from
edge. Divide remaining dough into 10 equal pieces. On a lightly
floured surface, with floured hands, roll each piece into an 8
1/2-inch long rope. Place 5 ropes, about 1 1/2 inches apart, over
filling; do not seal ends.
</P>
<P>
   Make a lattice top with remaining 5 ropes. Trim ends of ropes
even with edge of tart; press ends to seal. With any remaining
trimmings, make rope for tart shell and press around inside edge of
tart. Make decorative edge with a fork, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 35 to 40 minutes, until
filling is hot and bubbly and crust is lightly browned. Cool on a
wire rack at least 1 hour. Sprinkle tart with powdered sugar. When
cool, carefully remove side of pan. Makes 12 servings.

MARBLED POUND CAKE
</P>
<P>
   We love this versatile cake. If you double the recipe, you can
bake it in a 10-inch bundt pan. We've baked it in a loaf pan,
cupcake tins and a bundt pan, and all have turned out beautifully.
In the bundt pan, baking time is about 1 1/2 hours, the cupcakes
bake in 20 to 25 minutes, and in the loaf pan baking time is about
1 hour. This is great with a glass of cold milk. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
1 teaspoon baking soda &QL; 
1 teaspoon baking powder &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into
small pieces &QL; 
1 cup granulated sugar &QL; 
2 eggs &QL; 
1 cup buttermilk &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted &QL; 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips &QL; 
Chocolate Glaze (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   Position rack in center of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Butter or coat with vegetable spary an 8 1/2x3 1/2x2 1/2-inch
loaf pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or
beaters, beat butter on medium speed. Gradually pour in granulated
sugar, increase speed to high and beat until fluffy. Add eggs, one
at a time, beating just to combine. Reduce speed to low and
alternate adding flour mixture (3 additions of flour and 2 of
buttermilk). Add vanilla with last addition of buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape 2/3 of batter into prepared pan. Add sifted cocoa to
batter remaining in bowl and beat until well blended. Fold in
chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   Drop large spoonfuls of chocolate mixture over batter in loaf
pan and swirl through batter with a metal spatula or flat knife,
resulting in a marbled effect.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 1 hour, until a cake
tester gently inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Set on
a rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   When completely cool, release cake from pan by running a sharp
knife around inside of pan, separating cake from pan. Invert cake
onto a rack. Place a pan below rack and drizzle Chocolate Glaze
over cake. Let set. Slip a long heavy spatula under cake and
transfer cake to a flat surface.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, cut a thin slice off both ends (end pieces are for
family consumption, see Note) and cut cake into 8 slices. No
garnish is needed for this cake, but for color, place a strawberry
or a sprig of mint alongside each slice. Makes 1 loaf, about 8
servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Since there are no ends when baked in a bundt pan or
cupcake tins, this may not apply.

 &QL; 
CHOCOLATE GLAZE
</P>
<P>
   A glaze differs from a frosting in that it is poured over a
cake. It has a shiny glassiness when it sets. A glaze has many
uses. Before frosting a cake that's not completely smooth, we pour
the glaze over, let it set and then frost. The frosting then will
be much smother and give the cake a more professional look. When
the glaze becomes slightly firm it also can be rolled into small
truffles or piped between two cookies as a filling. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces &QL; 
3 ounces (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces &QL; 
1/3 cup light corn syrup &QL; 
1/3 cup brandy
</P>
<P>
   In a medium heatproof bowl, combine chocolate and butter and set
over a pan of simmering water. Do not let bottom of bowl touch
water, or chocolate may burn. Let melt almost completely, turn off
heat and let mixture continue to melt, stirring occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk in corn syrup and brandy until smooth. Pour through a
fine-mesh strainer into a clean medium bowl and reserve, covered,
in a warm spot until needed. Makes about 2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   TO PREPARE AHEAD: Glaze can be made 2 to 3 days ahead,
refrigerated, covered and remelted over simmering water when
needed. Let stand over warm water until smooth, stirring
occasionally. &QL;

UNDATED: ... smooth, stirring occasionally. CLASSIC CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is one of the most frequently requested recipes at Spago.
If you want to save time, or don't want to make your own truffles,
good-quality chocolate truffles from a reputable chocolate shop
will work almost as well. When raspberries are not at their best,
eliminate them from the truffles and pipe plain chocolate mounds
instead. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUFFLES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces bittersweet OR semisweet chocolate &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) unsalted butter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flavoring of choice (Grand Marnier, Framboise,
Chambord OR vanilla) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 fresh perfect raspberries (optional) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE CAKES: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, at room temperature &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 yolks, at room temperature &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   For Truffles, in a small heatproof bowl set over a pan of
simmering water, combine chocolate, cream and butter. When almost
melted, remove from heat and stir mixture until smooth. Stir in
flavoring of choice and refrigerate until thick enough to mound on
a spoon, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Do not let it get
too hard, since you want to pipe it.
</P>
<P>
   Line a baking tray with parchment or wax paper. Scrape chocolate
mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a No. 3 plain tip. Pipe 8
(1-inch) mounds onto prepared tray. Place 1 raspberry in center of
each chocolate mound and pipe a little more of chocolate mixture on
top to enclose completely. It will resemble a chocolate beehive.
Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For Chocolate Cakes, position rack in center of oven. Butter (or
coat with vegetable spray) 8 oversize muffin cups (4 inches wide
and 2 inches deep) or 1 1/4-cup custard cups. Line bottoms with
rounds of wax paper. (To cut rounds, place 1 cup on wax paper and
trace around bottom with a pencil. Then cut out 8 circles and
place, pencil-side down, in cups.) Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a small heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water,
melt together chocolate and butter. This should be very liquid.
Cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle or beaters, on high speed, beat eggs, egg yolks and sugar
until tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. Scrape in chocolate
mixture and, on low speed, beat just until combined. Remove bowl
from mixer and fold in flour, using a rubber spatula. Spoon a
little of batter into each of prepared cups and set 1 truffle on
top, but do not push it down; cover with remaining batter. Arrange
cups on a baking tray.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 12 to 13 minutes, or until
edges of cakes begin to pull from sides of cups. Let stand 10
minutes, then invert onto individual dessert plates and carefully
peel off papers.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm. Dust with sifted powdered sugar and spoon softly
whipped cream or ice cream next to each cake. If desired, garnish
with a few fresh raspberries or chocolate curls. Serve immediately.
Makes 8 (4-inch) cakes, 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   TO PREPARE AHEAD: Arrange filled cups on a baking tray and
refrigerate until serving time. This can be done one day ahead.
About 30 minutes before baking, preheat oven, remove baking tray
from refrigerator and continue with recipe.

   COOKIES AND CREAM CHEESECAKE
</P>
<P>
   The chocolate crumble is used not ony as a crust but also as a
layer and a topping. The result is a creamy cheesecake with a
crunchy texture.
</P>
<P>
   I find the easiest way to melt the white chocolate is to break
it up into small pieces and place it in a small cup or bowl. Place
the cup in the microwave oven, cover with a paper towel and heat
chocolate 30 seconds at a time, stopping oven and stirring
chocolate, continuing to heat until melted. It shouldn't take more
than two or three 30-second periods. &QL;

   CHOCOLATE CRUMBLE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1-ounce
pieces &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAKE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature, cut into 2-inch
pieces &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup dairy sour cream &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces white chocolate, melted (see above)
</P>
<P>
   Position rack in center of oven.
</P>
<P>
   Butter or coat with vegetable spray bottom of a 9- or 10-inch
springform pan. Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Chocolate Crumble, sift together flour, cocoa, sugar and
salt and transfer to bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel
blade. Process with on and off turns until blended. Arrange pieces
of butter around flour mixture and process until mixture resembles
coarse meal.
</P>
<P>
   In a small cup or bowl, whisk together egg yolks and cream. With
processor running, pour mixture through feed tube, making certain
you scrape out all liquid from cup. Let machine run until dough
begins to come together, about 1 minute. (You should have about 4
cups.)
</P>
<P>
   To make crust, spoon 2 cups crumble into prepared pan and press
evenly over bottom of pan. (Rounded bottom of a 1-cup measuring cup
is perfect for leveling crust, ensuring smooth edges.)
</P>
<P>
   Spread remaining crumble on prepared baking tray. Place
springform pan and baking tray in oven.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until
crumble is lightly toasted. Transfer to a rack to cool. When
completely cool, wrap heavy-duty foil _ or 2 layers of regular foil
_ around bottom and halfway up outside of springform pan, pleating
foil to tighten. Break up crumble on parchment paper, using your
hands or a fork; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Cake, place cream cheese, sugar and salt in a large bowl of
an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or beaters. On medium speed,
beat until smooth, stopping often to scrape down sides of bowl and
under blade with a rubber spatula. Turn speed to high and continue
to beat until nice and creamy.
</P>
<P>
   Stop mixer and add sour cream, eggs and vanilla; beat 3 minutes
longer, again stopping mixer and scraping down sides of bowl and
under blade as necessary. Scrape in melted chocolate and continue
to beat until well combined and smooth. You should have about 6
cups of mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/2 of mixture (3 cups) into springform pan. Sprinkle 1/2
of crumble (1 cup) over; pour in remaining 3 cups mixture and cover
entire surface with remaining 1 cup crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Set springform pan in center of a slightly larger baking pan
with sides. Pour enough hot water into larger pan to reach halfway
up sides of springform pan, but not above foil. Carefully place
both pans in oven.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 1 hour. Cover cake loosely
with foil and continue to bake 20 minutes longer, until center of
cake is slightly firm. (Check water level after 30 minutes, making
certain there is enough water in pan.)
</P>
<P>
   Carefully remove both pans from oven and transfer springform pan
to a rack to cool. Fold foil down sides of pan, helping cake to
cool. When cake has cooled remove foil and allow cake to cool
completely. Cover pan loosely with a clean piece of foil and
refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, remove cheesecake from refrigerator. Dip a
long sharp knife in warm water and run knife around inside of
springform pan, loosening cake from pan. Remove outer ring.
Continue to dip knife into warm water as necessary for neatly cut
slices.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, arrange one slice of cake on a cake plate and garnish
with fresh berries of choice _ raspberries, blueberries or sliced
strawberries. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   TO PREPARE AHEAD: Crust can be made two days ahead; the cake
must be made one day ahead.

   FUDGY CHOCOLATE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   This wonderfully moist, fudgy cake can be made in a 10-inch
bundt pan, as below, or in two (9x5x3-inch) loaf pans (baking time
will be 35 to 40 minutes). We first tested this cake when Jean-Paul
DeSourdie, a caterer in New York, brought it as a gift. We liked it
so much we decided that, with our minor additions, it belonged in
the Spago repertoire. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Butter (or coat with vegetable spray) a 10-inch bundt pan,
making certain you coat all ridges plus center tube. If pan does
not have a nonstick coating, dust with flour, then tap out excess.
Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering
water, melt chocolate and butter, stirring occasionally. When
almost melted, turn off heat and let melt completely.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or
beaters, whip eggs. On low speed, gradually pour in sugar and
continue to beat well until mixed in, increasing speed when all
sugar has been mixed in. On low speed, scrape in melted chocolate
mixture; add vanilla and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate adding flour mixture and coffee, starting and ending
with flour mixture (three additions of flour and two of coffee). Do
additions on low speed and then turn speed to high. Stop machine
occasionally and scrape around bowl and under beaters. Add Grand
Marnier and beat just until combined.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape batter into prepared pan, distributing evenly around pan
(tap pan to level batter).
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven about 1 hour, until a cake
tester inserted in middle of cake comes out clean. Cool on rack 15
minutes, then invert onto a 10-inch cardboard round and return to
rack to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, cut cake into slices and serve with a dollop of
whipped cream. Scatter a few fresh raspberries or sliced
strawberries around cake. Or spoon a little Grand Marnier Sauce
around center of each plate and set a piece of cake on sauce. Makes
1 (10-inch) cake, 8 to 10 servings

   FLOURLESS BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH MILK CHOCOLATE DRIZZLE
</P>
<P>
   Prepare this cake, and you can promise your guests the ultimate
experience; they will not be disappointed. A simple but
straightforward exercise in sweet surrender, this flourless cake is
glazed with dark chocolate and further drizzled with milk
chocolate. The raspberry jam and kiss of cognac add intriguing
flavor notes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cognac &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6 large eggs, separated, at room temperature &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE GLAZE:
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy whipping cream &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOR ASSEMBLY AND GARNISH: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup seedless raspberry preserves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces milk chocolate, melted
</P>
<P>
   For Flourless Chocolate Cake, position a rack in center of oven.
Butter bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Line bottom of
pan with a round parchment or wax paper; butter paper.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, combine chocolate and butter. Cook over
low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until chocolate
and butter are melted. Gently whisk until smooth. Remove from heat
and stir in cognac. Let cool.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar
until well blended. Stir in melted chocolate mixture.
</P>
<P>
   In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using a
wire whip attachment, beat egg whites at medium speed until frothy.
Increase speed to medium-high and beat egg whites until soft peaks
start to form. One tablespoon at a time, beat in remaining 2
tablespoons sugar. Continue beating until egg whites are stiff but
not dry.
</P>
<P>
   Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold beaten egg whites into
chocolate mixture in 3 additions. Do not overmix. Pour batter into
prepared pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven until cake is puffed and a
tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached,
about 30 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and cool 10 minutes.
Using a small, sharp knife, cut around sides of cake to loosen.
Release pan side. Invert cake onto wire rack. Peel off parchment
paper and cool cake completely. Wrap in plastic wrap and
refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   For Chocolate Glaze, place chocolate in a medium bowl. In a
small saucepan, bring cream to a gentle boil. Using a wire whisk,
stir in honey. Pour hot cream mixture over chocolate and let
mixture stand 30 seconds to melt chocolate. Whisk mixture until
smooth. Cover surface of glaze with plastic wrap and set aside at
room temperature 30 minutes or until slightly thickened.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble cake, remove cake from refrigerator and remove
plastic wrap from cake. Place cake on a wire rack set over a baking
sheet. Using a metal spatula, spread raspberry preserves evenly
over top and sides of cake. Pour Chocolate Glaze over cake,
covering completely; spread evenly with a metal spatula. Drizzle
top of glazed cake with melted milk chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Serve cake immediately, or refrigerate. Bring cake to room
temperature before serving. Makes 12 servings.

   GIANDUJA TRUFFLE TART
</P>
<P>
   This is a chocolatey, decadent, rich dessert. Serve small slices
with a cup of coffee. Gianduja is a specialty item, a flavorful
blend of hazelnuts and chocolate that comes in block form like
regular baking chocolate (I use Callebaut brand). Look for it in
specialty food stores. For this recipe, use a milk chocolate
gianduja. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CRUST: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 (9-ounce) box Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers, roughly
crumbled by hand &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup hazelnuts, skinned and toasted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, melted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILLING: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces gianduja, finely chopped &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream &QL;
</P>
<P>
   11 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Spray an 11-inch loose-bottomed fluted tart pan with nonstick
cooking spray.
</P>
<P>
   For Crust, grind cookies and nuts in a food processor, fitted
with a metal blade, until fine.
</P>
<P>
   Pour in melted butter and pulse machine on and off to combine
well. Press crumb crust over bottom and up sides of prepared tart
pan. Use a flat-bottomed glass to facilitate pressing crumbs along
bottom and to help with edges. Keeping glass flat, move toward
edges; it will press crumbs along sides, creating an even layer all
around.
</P>
<P>
   Place tart pan on a parchment-lined sheet pan.
</P>
<P>
   Blind bake crust in preheated 375-degree oven 10 minutes. Set
tart pan directly on a wire rack to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   For Filling, melt 6 ounces gianduja with 1/4 cup cream in a
double boiler or microwave. Whisk until smooth and pour into cooled
tart shell. Refrigerate 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Melt bittersweet chocolate with remaining 1 1/4 cups cream in a
double boiler or microwave. Whisk until smooth and pour over
chilled gianduja layer.
</P>
<P>
   Melt remaining 2 ounces gianduja, place in a parchment cone and
make a random design over bittersweet ganache. Refrigerate until
firm, at least 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   This tart may be refrigerated up to 2 days; cover with plastic
wrap after it has chilled for the initial 3 hours. Serve cold, in
thin slices. Remove tart from pan before serving. Makes 1 (11-inch)
tart, 10 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   BAKE IT TO THE LIMIT: Serve above tart with creme anglaise (any
recipe), flavored with hazelnut liqueur if you like. Have creme
anglaise made, cooled and poured into a squeeze bottle. Have
luncheon or dinner-sized plates ready for this.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped, in a double
boiler or microwave and place in a parchment cone. Make a large
star design on each plate, about 7 inches from point to point, with
melted chocolate. Refrigerate plates until chocolate sets, about 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fill in chocolate star outline with creme anglaise. Then place a
slice of tart slightly off-center. You should be able to see star's
points radiating beyond slice. Dust plate's edges with sifted Dutch
process cocoa. Serve immediately.

JERUSALEM ON HIGH ALERT AS 2000 NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Police surveillance cameras constantly monitor the
Temple Mount, where Judaism's Second Temple was destroyed in 70
A.D. and which today is the site of the al-Aqsa mosque, one of the
holiest shrines in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Other video cameras discreetly survey the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, built over the site where tradition holds Jesus was
crucified and buried, where up to 20,000 pilgrims will soon pack
daily into a Crusader-era edifice that has just one exit.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 400 cameras are keeping watch on the winding,
cobblestone pathways of Jerusalem's Old City, scanning unblinkingly
for everything from pickpockets to deranged religious pilgrims bent
on carrying out bizarre interpretations of biblical prophecies of
apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   As the millennial celebrations near, security concerns are
weighing heavily on this ancient city, and the state of Israel is
straining to keep an eye on the Holy Land as it prepares to welcome
an unprecedented influx of pilgrims and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Christmas and New Year's Eve, Israeli
security officials have prepared for the worst possible scenarios,
the scariest of which would be an attack aimed at destroying the
Dome of the Rock, another holy landmark atop Temple Mount, which
Muslims call Haram al-Sharif. Religious specialists said that could
be a goal for either Christian or Jewish extremists, and security
officials said a mere attempt could touch off widescale religious
violence, even a new Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid of Jerusalem,'' said Major General Aryeh Amit, a
former Jerusalem district commander of police who participated in
some of the security planning. ``I am frightened of what can happen
in this crazy city.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weil, the city's chief consultant on strategic planning
for the celebrations of the year 2000, said, ``We've never done an
undertaking this enormous before.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil, who is troubleshooting millennial events for the
municipality from a ``situation room'' that opened Monday in the
basement of Jerusalem City Hall, added, ``The complexity is
absolutely mind boggling. . . Frankly, it will be very difficult to
keep control of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security officials are opening three police stations and
two control centers designed to coordinate police and emergency
services in a year in which Israel is expecting 3.2 million
tourists, 50 percent more than the previous record year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   From the ``situation room'' where Weil operates, officials are
monitoring the flow of traffic in and around a city that will be
more clogged than ever with tour buses and pedestrians all pushing
toward the same holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   At an ``operations control center,'' a team of security analysts
will monitor the 400 hidden video cameras and serve as the command
center in the event of emergencies or violence.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus is on the Dome of the Rock, where Muslims
believe the prophet Mohammed ascended into heaven. The ornate 7th
century mosque, with its gleaming golden dome, sits atop a patch of
land supported by the Western Wall that once surrounded the Second
Temple, the site where tradition holds that Abraham was called upon
to sacrifice his son. The Western Wall is the most sacred site of
the Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
   There are extremist circles _ both Christian and Jewish _ that
believe the mosques on Temple Mount must be destroyed in order to
rebuild the temple and prepare the way for the messiah, or the
return of Jesus Christ, who will come to trigger the biblical day
of judgment. The fear is that an extremist group will try to hasten
things along by blowing up the Muslim shrines.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a far-fetched notion. An attempt by a messianic Jewish
extremist in the mid-1980s was narrowly thwarted. In 1969, an
Australian Christian provoked Muslim riots after a failed attempt
to burn the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has started ``Project Meggido,'' referring to the
biblical site of Armeggedon, to monitor threats of millennial
violence worldwide. In October, an FBI report concluded that, ``A
simple act of desecration, or even a perceived desecration of any
of the holy sites on the Temple Mount, is likely to trigger a
violent reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Temple Mount is clearly one of the most sensitive areas,''
said Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. As an
additional precaution, he said, 400 extra police will be put on
duty to watch for end-of-the-world extremists.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange confluence of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
calendars, Dec. 31 is not only the eve of New Year's Day, 2000.
Because it happens to fall on a Friday, it will also be the Jewish
Sabbath, as well as the festive end of the Muslim holy month
Ramadan, which could bring as many as 300,000 Muslims to for
traditional prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all aware this will not be an easy moment. It will be a
great challenge,'' said Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli task force formed for the event has been working in
coordination with the FBI. Its most publicized action to date was a
crackdown last January on a Denver-based sect known as Concerned
Christians, whose leader predicted he would die on the streets of
Jerusalem and be resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Police raided two suburban Jerusalem homes where the group was
residing, arrested 14 people, and charged that the group was
preparing to blow up some of the city's mosques. The Concerned
Christians denied involvement in any plot.
</P>
<P>
   Another operation was quietly targeted a street preacher who
wears a long gray beard and calls himself Elijah. For nearly a
decade, he had been wandering the streets of Jerusalem proclaiming
himself a Biblical prophet, and over time he gathered a small
following who saw him as one of the ``two witnesses'' mentioned in
the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the task force moved against Brother David, a
Christian evangelical preacher from Albany, N.Y., who led a
following of a few dozen believers gathered regularly on the Mount
of Olives. Brother David's interpretation of the Bible's Book of
Revelation led him and his followers to believe that the world is
fast approaching the ``End of Days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prophecies in Revelation, this is the time when Jesus
Christ will return to establish his kingdom on earth and to judge
the living and the dead. For those who take these passages
literally, the coming millennium coincides with their numerological
interpretation of the biblical timetable for the ``End of Days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis swiftly deported all of these believers: Brother
David and roughly 20 of his followers; 14 of the Concerned
Christians; Elijah; and a handful of others whom Israel deemed to
be threats or to have invalid visas.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the mainstream Christian community and even the
Israeli Anti-Defamation League have criticized some of the
deportations as overzealous. The Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv
expressed outrage at the treatment of a group of Christian pilgrims
who were roughed up and turned away when they landed at the port of
Haifa. One legal specialist, Ron Shapira of Tel Aviv, has
complained that Israel's deportation laws ``allow the government to
act arbitrarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to such criticism, Ben-Ami said, ``We should be very
careful not to overdramatize the threats posed by such esoteric
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Israel's minister of tourism, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a
former military chief of staff, said, ``Maybe we might make some
mistakes. But the threat is very big and we are responsible for the
saftey to the 3 million who will visit.''
</P>
<P>
   David Katz, a professor at Tel Aviv University and author of
``Messianic Revolution,'' a study of evangelical Protestant groups,
said the key to avoiding anything that could trigger a wider
conflict will be the way the police handle these groups.
</P>
<P>
   Katz and others worry about veiled messages being sent by
extremist Jewish settlers in the Old City, whose views could
encourage a Christian sect to try to destroy the Dome of the Rock
in order to pave the way for building a Third Temple. He pointed to
posters sold in some shops that depict the Temple Mount without the
Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Other security experts note that two groups, the Temple Mount
Faithful and the Temple Institute, have meticulously made replicas
of tools used for animal sacrifices, to have them ready for use
when the temple is rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to talk to these people,'' said Katz. ``They have to
be embraced and convinced that there are different
interpretations.''

BURNING ISSUE ISN'T THE COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Barely one-third into the NHL season, the Bruins
returned to work in need of shaking off their second troublesome
winless streak of the season and turned in an impressive 2-0 win
over the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not get too depressed,'' said Pat Burns, surrounded by a
larger-than-normal media pack after the day-of-game skate at the
FleetCenter. ``Let's not be talking suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns's reaction was in obvious response to words written in
this space Sunday that noted that winless stretches _ no matter
their causes or justifications _ often prove to be coach-killers.
The Bruins opened this season with an 0-5-4 skid, the worst they've
come out of the gate since going 0-8-1 at the start of the 1964-65
season. Headed into Monday night's go-round with Phoenix, they were
0-3-3, a stretch that included a humiliating 9-3 pasting on home
ice _ the worst on Causeway Street in Burns's tenure _ at the hands
of the dreadful Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of divots in an 82-game season that get
coaches sent packing. The most recent example is Pittsburgh, which
last week tossed Kevin Constantine overboard after two-plus seasons
and brought in gold-medal makeover artist Herb Brooks to revive
playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stick a fork in us yet,'' proclaimed Burns, noting that
he had read Sunday's report. ``The fork's getting ready to stick in
me. We're not dead yet. This is early in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Would the Bruins give Burns the gate now? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Would it necessarily be the right move? No.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, what we've seen of the Bruins thus far in 1999-2000
is a far, far cry from what we expected. The young core talent of
the club, expected to take off and fly after two years of
seasoning, has been overwhelmingly underwhelming. Joe Thornton is
the exception. Jumbo Joe finally is beginning to play like the
impact player that the league's Central Scouting Bureau projected
he would be before his being drafted in 1997. He's not exactly a
Hart candidate yet, but it's at least feasible to think that he
could be a franchise center in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the rest of the young, ready-for-prime-time bunch?
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   --Sergei Samsonov _ Only tiny flashes of brilliance. Often seems
confused, unsure whether to try to beat someone one-on-one, dish
it, or shoot it. Sixty points or more was a reasonable expectation
for this season. He had 14 before picking up a goal Monday night.
At that rate, he will be challenged to match his rookie output of
47. He looked sharper vs. the Coyotes, performing with some zip,
but has to prove he can do it consistently.
</P>
<P>
   --Jason Allison _ Burns thinks he's really in a rut, and adds
that is why Dave Andreychuk has gone cold (no goals in the 0-3-3
stretch). Allison thinks he's playing OK and that he can't be
fingered as the reason for the recent malaise. The truth here:
Allison is skilled but has a tendency to let his game go soft. He
has to apply some grit, and in a hurry, or this could be one wicked
winter on Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   --Anson Carter _ He is the club's No. 2 point-getter (22 vs.
Thornton's 28). So why are we not impressed? Because Carter had a
very impressive second half in '98-99 _ a pair of late-season hat
tricks and that thrilling OT playoff goal vs. Carolina immediately
come to mind _ but he hasn't come close to returning to that form
yet this year. He was defining his career. Now, he too often looks
like he's coasting, waiting, looking for his game to find him.
</P>
<P>
   --Byron Dafoe _ He was a franchise goalie when the playoffs came
to an end. Now? He's still in the process of getting it together
after waiting a month to sign, but before Monday night he had a
mundane .887 save percentage. He was second in the league last year
at .926. That's like a .340 hitter in baseball dipping down to
.276. Just OK, nothing special. If Monday's performance (32
shots/32 saves) is the real thing, then that could change the
club's dynamic significantly.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, instead of building on last year's momentum, this
club is struggling just to get back the beat. Yes, they did rattle
off six straight wins (Oct. 23-Nov. 6). Yes, they were four games
over .500 by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually across the board, the offense has been
disappointing and Dafoe's goaltending mostly mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Equally troublesome has been the minuscule contribution from
Providence. The best of the Baby B's this year has been netminder
John Grahame, but he was hauled back down Route 95, his contract
sweetened slightly, soon after Dafoe came in for the cash. A couple
of times each week, a kid or two gets called to Boston, only to be
hustled back to Providence after barely getting a glimpse of Quincy
Market. Convinced the Baby B's can't cut it here, the Bruins in
recent weeks have added graybeards Joe Murphy and Marty McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk was a brilliant offseason acquisition, but this many
911 calls to the Salvation Army speaks to a dysfunctional feeder
system. These are jobs that young prospects should be filling.
Where are the kids? Where is the future? Two-plus seasons after
finishing dead last in the NHL and noting the obvious need to
replenish the pipeline, it's just not there.
</P>
<P>
   Who next in the spoked B? Kirk Muller? Brian Bellows? Vladimir
Krutov?
</P>
<P>
   Here's where your faithful correspondent believes this is going
if the core fails to get it going: The front office soon will
mandate that Burns adopt two or three orphans from Providence and
force them into game action with real minutes. They may not cut it.
They may be worse than what he's got, but it will be up to him to
turn them into players.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is an excellent coach. He'd be even better if he had a
better lineup under his thumb. He'd be even better if the lineup he
does have were to play up to capabilities. Thus far, that's more
their fault than his, just as the playing stock is far more
management's charge than his.
</P>
<P>
   But we have heard and seen all that before here in the Hub of
hockey. Go ask Butch Goring, Rick Bowness, Brian Sutter, Steve
Kasper, et al. As loyal and financially willing as the fan base is,
this is not a franchise that can afford to be stagnant, risk
slipping back to where it was before Burns's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Early? Not on a clock that has been running now for almost 2 1/2
years. The truth is, it's time _ for better effort, better results,
and a better return for a town that hasn't seen a Stanley Cup for
going on 30 years.

SCORPIONS, MADAM? A LIVE, AUTHENTIC CHINESE MENU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   XI'AN, China _ The table had been set out with a savory-smelling
and artistically presented banquet: shish-kebabbed cicadas with
green peppers; black ants sprinkled on hard-boiled eggs; sauteed
scorpions layered on shrimp chips; French-fried larvae and
silkworm; and the piece de resistance _ live scorpions crawling up
a 10-inch pagoda carved from a turnip.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that dinner at the Three Brothers Scorpion
Restaurant is more than just a meal; it's an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The vast panoply of Chinese cuisine proudly embraces many things
that American cooking does not, from chicken feet to snake, from
seaweed to dog. But like birds'-nest and sharks'-fin soup,
scorpions have never been everyday fare; they were a delicacy
believed to have originated in the celebrated reign of the
18th-century Qianlong Emperor, when a single fried scorpion was
served to each diner as an end-of-meal treat.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a food that doctors of traditional Chinese medicine,
and some scientists, believe has powerful health benefits. The Liu
brothers _ who claim to be the first in China to have reintroduced
scorpions to their menu _ say a visit to their restaurant offers
both a novelty and a cure.
</P>
<P>
   As Chinese society becomes more prosperous and cosmopolitan,
wealthy and adventurous Chinese are seeking ways to experiment with
food, just as they have with music and fashion. China has
mind-boggling regional variety in its cuisine, but relatively few
foreign restaurants. In the same way that American yuppies have
embraced Ethiopian or Burmese cuisine _ foods that seemed strange
even a decade ago _ well-heeled Chinese are flocking to try exotic
foods from their own gastronomic history.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese feel the same delight mixed with horror that a
daring foreigner might experience in eating a live bug. But even as
they revel in the exotica, diners also hail the connection to
Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, Wang Hao, 31, a Beijing manager visiting
this central Chinese city on business, expertly used his chopsticks
to pluck a squirming scorpion off its pagoda and dangle it
theatrically over his mouth while his friends downed shots of
scorpion-infused wine and egged him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come for the experience _ for fun,'' he shouted over the
din. ``It's in the Chinese character _ we want to try something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that tasty, but it's really good for the health,''
Wang said enthusiastically, biting off the body and waiting three
seconds for the once-lethal tail to stop wagging before he placed
it on his tongue. (The scorpions undergo a 13-step, 6-month process
to extract most of the poison and sterilize them.) ``The more
poisonous, the more healthy it is for the body.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite that simple. But Chinese medicine follows the
homeopathic principle that something toxic can, in small doses,
cure the very ailments that a large dose would cause. Scorpion
venom is thought to cure a range of ailments from fever, chills,
convulsions and anxiety to arthritis, skin problems, immune
disorders, and kidney problems. Some even claim that eating the
bugs cures cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kong Tianhan, director of a team that conducted an eight-year
study of the medicinal uses of scorpion at Henan Medical Science
University, said a polypeptide extracted from scorpion venom is
effective against human tumors, relieves pain of cancer patients,
and boosts the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   That was old news to the three Liu brothers. They had trained as
chefs and studied nutrition, and for years they pored over Chinese
food literature to come up with a recipe that would combine health
food with creative dining. Finally they hit upon scorpions, which
had died out as food after Qianlong's time, and which are native to
this region of Shaanxi province. Voila _ a gourmet novelty was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``By now, China has pretty much solved its food problem. People
have enough food, so now they can consider food `culture,' instead
of just eating to satisfy their hunger,'' said Chen Dan, the
restaurant's manager. ``We call it `future food' or `21st-century
food.' In the 21st century, people will be more and more concerned
about healthy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But first the more timid will have to recover from the
shock of facing a tableful of fried, roasted, and sauteed bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The insects and arachnids are artfully arranged on beds of
lettuce and garnished with broccoli, maraschino cherries, radishes
carved into flowers, and sugar-coated potato chips. The seasonings
are a tasty, subtle combination of cayenne pepper, cumin, and soy.
The dishes have evocative names such as ``Golden cicadas on sticks,
Scorpions rolled in the snow, Fresh blossom worm and five-flavored
silkworm larvae, or Drunken scorpions climbing the pagoda.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried scorpions are crunchy on the outside and sandy inside. The
fried rice worms taste like oily French fries. The toast stuffed
with minced chicken and embedded with a scorpion is sweet and
delicious _ though it's hard to avoid eye contact with the topping.
The cicadas have a chewy, meaty taste. The ants are crunchy and
vinegary and could almost pass for cheap caviar.
</P>
<P>
   The raw, live scorpions, once bitten, don't bite back. There is
a definite adrenaline rush to the experience, but the taste is
unremarkable: crunchy, but bland.
</P>
<P>
   To round out the meal, there's scorpion soup and sorghum wine
steeped in 20 herbal medicines and six scorpions.
</P>
<P>
   Chen trumpeted the benefits of each dish. Ants smooth wrinkles,
turn white hair black, and counter diabetes, she said. Silkworms
are high in protein, though their history is sadder; they were
eaten out of desperation by people banished to the barren
countryside during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Cicadas are
good for hearing, anxiety, and male virility. The wine is good for
kidneys, migraines, and cancer prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the diners on a typical night were Chinese tour groups
and out-of-town businessmen, but there were some locals so sold on
the reputed curative properties that they have become regulars. One
woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer comes here every other
evening with her husband. The pair eat 30 live scorpions, and at 45
cents each, it's a very expensive dish by Chinese standards. But
the woman believes the scorpions have kept her disease in
remission.
</P>
<P>
   At $17, the most expensive dish was the poisonous tree ants
imported from France. The other insects are collected in the wild
and raised on a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   Chen won't share the secret of extracting enough poison to make
the stinging creatures edible, but leaving enough to make them
potent. But she revealed one trick of the live pagoda dish: the
scorpions are soaked for a few minutes in alcohol to anesthetize
them _ but ``not too long or they faint.''
</P>
<P>
   Some didn't seem very drunk as they performed acrobatics on the
chopsticks. But Chen reassured that only about one diner a year
gets bitten, and insists there is no real danger thanks to the
detoxification process.
</P>
<P>
   China's president, Jiang Zemin, has dined here and liked the raw
scorpions best, Chen says. Owner Liu Kaijun, a former chef at the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, thinks other enlightened diners will
agree, and hopes to open a branch someday in the United States
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreigners may be very interested,'' Chen said, ``because they
are concerned with their health and also like exciting things.''

TRAVEL _ THE PERFECT GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still trying to find that perfect gift?
</P>
<P>
   Why not give the gift of travel? Many folks would certainly
appreciate a cruise or airplane ticket somewhere, but price-wise
that's out of the question for most of us. But, why not give a gift
certificate for a portion of a trip or a getaway?
</P>
<P>
   Travel gift certificates are easy to get, can be quite
inexpensive, and always fit, no matter what the person's size or
interests might be. For example, cruise lines offer a variety of
bon voyage gifts from wine to on-board credits to use in the shops
or for a shore excursion. Gift certificates can be purchased to be
used toward a trip or for a hotel stay.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott Hotels is offering gift certificates that can be used
for weekend getaways at their properties. And, if you order one and
pay for it with a Visa card, you'll save $10 on each certificate.
For details, call 800-813-GIFT.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Hotels (Inter-Continental, Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn,
Holiday Inn Express, and Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn) offer a
Prepaid Guest Card, which can be used toward any charge at their
hotels. The cards, similar to a credit card, are available in
amounts of $25 and up. For details, call 877-994-8378.
</P>
<P>
   Some other ideas:
</P>
<P>
   What could be better for an inexpensive gift than a calendar,
especially one that lists many fun events in New England for the
year 2000? For 20 years, Kanin Press (PO Box 1174, Portsmouth, NH
03802; 603-433-4775) has made New England Weekenders calendars. For
2000, it's as informative as ever, and even more colorful with
wonderful paintings of favorite locations throughout the region.
Not only will you be able to plan great weekend getaways, but
there's also room for your notations. The calendars are available
in stores or from the publisher at $13.95 a copy, plus $5.50
shipping. Kanin also produces a Weekenders Calendar for the
Mid-Atlantic states, and three lighthouse calendars: New England,
the Cape Cod area, and one for the Southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem a strange gift, the new paperback edition of
``The Merck Manual of Medical Information _ Home Edition'' ($7.95)
could be the perfect antidote for a medical problem on a trip. The
book is the same one doctors have used for years, only this one is
in everyday language. In its hardcover edition, it has already sold
more than a million copies, but the paperback is lighter and easier
to carry.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to give a book about a place where your traveler
is going or has been. ``Great Lodges of the Canadian Rockies'' by
Christine Barnes (WW West, $35) will certainly evoke memories of a
visit there. Not only are the photos stunning, but also the stories
about these lodges are fascinating. Most of these grand hotels were
built to lure Easterners west, and give the Canadian Pacific
Railroad business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your travelers raved about a food treat from the last
trip. If they've been to the Cayman Islands, a rum cake from there
is perfect. Try the original one from Tortuga Rum Cake
(800-444-0625) or from Blackbeard's Liquors (888-947-2253), which
makes its own ``award-winning rum'' for the cake. For other Cayman
Island ideas, call the tourist board at 800-346-3313.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are hundreds of items made just for travel _ some
for comfort, others for convenience. Two of the best sources for
travel needs are the catalogs of Magellan's (800-962-4943 or
www.magellans.com) or TravelSmith (800-950-1600 or
www.travelsmith.com).
</P>
<P>
   And, with so many shopping on line these days, here's an idea
for finding the right gifts and rewarding yourself. At
www.clickrewards.com you can shop at all the top on-line retailers
and earn ClickRewards, which can be redeemed for airline miles, or
for other gifts. If you use a credit card that earns frequent flyer
miles, you'll get double miles, and some merchants on the service
are offering double miles on their own, which means you could earn
triple or more miles. Should you be embarrassed by these riches,
with a click you can donate these extra miles to a favorite
charity.

Adams, and James Otis. The Freedom Trail Players will be leading
walking tours along the trail beginning Dec. 18 through Dec. 21
between 2 and 3:30 p.m. There will be carolers, refreshments, and
gift shop discounts for those who purchase tickets. Tickets are
available at BosTix booths ($10 adult, $5 children) or from
Ticketmaster at 617-931-2000. Tours begin at the Boston Common
Visitors Center. For more information, call the Freedom Trail

<P>
   For years, visitors have toured the Astors' Beechwood home in
Newport, R.I. Never has Mrs. Astor been present, tourgoers have
usually been ushered out of the mansion before she appears. Now,
Mrs. Astor (Newport resident Peg Kieman) will welcome visitors to

   A different way to welcome in the new century is by a visit to
Cuba. The Global Exchange _ a nonprofit organization that works for
global political, economic, environmental, and social justice _ is
featuring a tour to Cuba Dec. 27-Jan. 4. ``Cuba is one of the few
modern countries that likely will not be greatly inconvenienced by
any Y2K bugs because the country is not as computer-reliant as
other nations,'' said Malia Everette, director of the program. The
trip costs $2,000 and includes air fare from Mexico City. For
information on this and other trips, write Global Exchange, 2017

HARVARD TO ADDRESS STUDENTS' MENTAL HEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Recognizing that more students are suffering
from mental disorders, from typical adolescent stress to depression
and schizophrenia, Harvard University is planning a large-scale
effort to help identify and treat students before their conditions
become life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations outlined in the executive report circulated
last week include hiring more young psychologists in the
university's health service, offering training to resident advisers
and professors on how to identify and refer students who may be
struggling with serious problems, and setting up ``safe spaces''
for severely stressed students in each of the 12 undergraduate
residence houses.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is hardly alone in its concern about student mental
health. While there are few studies, many universities and national
organizations of college health counselors say they are seeing more
and more students coming on campus with serious mental health
problems, or developing problems, especially depression, while
there.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard and other challenging schools may be particular
pressure cookers: the university's report talks about students who
have never failed before, and fear that conceding even the
slightest struggle is admitting defeat; in other cases, it says,
students don't confide in resident advisers or tutors out of fear
they might not be able to get good recommendations for graduate
school or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the years of young adulthood are the years of the
onset of many psychological illnesses, and on top of that they are
a time of significant stresses,'' said Paul Summergrad, associate
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the head of
the committee that wrote the report. ``There's just a lot of
pressure on kids, coming into the university, and given the value
families are placing on elite university degrees. We have kids
coming in and taking their SATs in 5th and 6th grade. . . . Hitting
the wall becomes a pretty big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes the consequences can be extreme. A Harvard
undergraduate four years ago stabbed her roommate to death, then
hanged herself. At Johns Hopkins University, one student shot
another while they were leaving a campus club meeting. And after
the suicide of a graduate student last year, the chemistry
department at Harvard hired a psychiatrist whom students can see
free.
</P>
<P>
   While the university is acting in hopes of preventing another
tragedy, it also wanted to act in the absence of any crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately (the murder-suicide) is the most serious failure of
the system,'' said Harvey Fineberg, provost and former dean at the
university's School of Public Health, who commissioned the report.
``One of the reasons I was very determined to undertake this
assessment now is that there is not an immediate tragedy or crisis.
You can look objectively, dispassionately, unemotionally,
critically, at what's going on. If you do it in the aftermath of a
tragedy, everyone's defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Health professionals say the anecdotal increase in the incidence
of mental problems on campus could be because diagnosis has become
better. In addition, students whose mental illnesses once might
have prevented them from advancing through school are getting
better treatment and medication, allowing them to flourish in high
school and eventually attend top schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they succeed in school, you may be enriching your pool of
college age students with a lot of talented individuals who
nevertheless are psychologically vulnerable,'' Fineberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, identifying or dealing with mental disorders can be
particularly difficult on campus, given the age of the students,
and the intersection, as the Harvard report notes, of ``residential
life and the life of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the report notes, becomes deciding, ``Is a
student's inability to finish a paper due to poor study habits,
changing academic interests . . . or an obsessive compulsive
disorder? Is difficulty living with roommates a cultural adjustment
or a manifestation of social phobia? Is change in behavior or
appearance a struggle for a new sense of self or a reflection of
incipient schizophrenia?''
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on eight months of interviews, found
administrators at each of Harvard's graduate and undergraduate
divisions emphasizing the ``increasing fragility of students and
apparent higher incidence of depression and serious mental
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Students complained that resident tutors were chosen without
consideration of how well they interact with undergraduates. While
many students seek help from the university's Health Services, some
students wait as long as a month to be seen by a psychologist, and
many of the psychologists do not have training in dealing with
young adult issues. The student who killed her roommate, for
example, had been seen in the health services, but by someone with
training in education, and not in recognizing or dealing with
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more staff and the establishment of ``safe
spaces,'' the university has already taken steps to set up a
coordinating council to oversee the delivery of mental health care
on campus. Each house has been newly assigned a liaison to the
university health services. The university also wants each of its
academic departments to offer faculty training in recognizing when
they should refer students to mental health services. Ultimately,
administrators say, they want to make sure that no student is more
than two steps away from getting needed help.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us, what's important is where we live, who our
friends are, how our community works, and what happens at work,''
said Michael Jellinek, chief of child psychiatry at Massachusetts
General Hospital, who specializes in establishing systems of
support. ``All of those things interact, and push more of us over
the edge, or fewer of us over the edge. You have to think through
all of those things, from soup to nuts, take an emotional and a
developmental perspective, and see if there are things you can do,
which will not mean that everyone's going to go through it fine,
but it does mean that more people will go through it fine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ All of Haiti awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 prisoners held without trial.
</P>
<P>
   The mother superior who grieves for the nun shot to death
outside her convent.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher who lacks a light at night to prepare his lessons.
</P>
<P>
   And the country's elected officials, all nine of them.
</P>
<P>
   They wait for Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   They wait for the slender former president to say something, to
show himself outside his compound, at the end of a lane of
flowering trees and fragrant, white-blossomed Old World gardenias.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, 46, is expected to run for president again next year,
and to win easily. But his silence on public matters over the past
18 months has contributed to a growing uncertainty about him, and
about Haiti's future.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery has deepened: What is Aristide doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to keep silent and work,'' he said at his private
residence, in his first extensive interview with an American
journalist in a year. ``I want to educate the poor and work in the
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, behind two well-guarded metal gates in the
lowlands near the international airport, he is Haiti's shadow
president. He is the unelected but widely acknowledged national
leader, the first in nearly 196 years of torturous independence to
act on behalf of the poor, a priest-turned-president overthrown
early in his term who then returned to power on the heels of an
invading force of 20,000 US troops.
</P>
<P>
   Now he serves as Haiti's political godfather, receiving
businessmen, US and foreign leaders, competing parliament
candidates seeking his support in March elections, and groups of
street children arriving on the weekends to eat lunch and swim in
his pool.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the children time and again. He knows it is
paradise for them; there is not a single public pool in Haiti. And
for him? Well, for one thing, they are essentially his only contact
with the poor, for whom he put his life on the line in helping
destroy 30 years of Duvalier family dictatorship. The last count is
nine attempts on his life.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer he remains out of sight, the more tenacious the
rumors become, snaking around Haiti, slipping into the White House,
penetrating the large expatriate communities in Boston, New York,
and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In those places, people whisper that some of his aides profit
from drug traffic; that Aristide has directed supporters to disrupt
political rallies, including one in which people threw urine at a
crowd; that Aristide lives as a king, with a second swimming pool _
this one on his roof.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Aristide laughed, the stiffness leaving his body as he
leaned forward in his home office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that,'' he said. ``Because in Haiti there is a saying,
`twou manti pa fon.' It means the hole of the lie is not deep. The
best way for me to fight against those liars is to let them lie and
the truth will come. It is a free country, you are free to say the
truth, free to lie. I choose the truth, you choose the lie, go
ahead, and I should pray for you to lie more often. Because I do
not need to defend myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he lives behind walls with his wife, the former Mildred
Trouillot, and their daughters, Christine, 3, and Micaele, 1, his
opponents in Washington and elsewhere have helped turn the Clinton
administration away from Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Clinton's extraordinary commitment of troops and
funding followed many months of internal administration squabbling
over how to oust the military coup leaders and reinstate Aristide.
Many raised doubts about him, most notoriously in a widely leaked
CIA profile that questioned his mental stability. (The CIA refused
a Globe request for a background briefing on Haiti this month.)
</P>
<P>
   There were also questions in Washington about the effectiveness
of an invasion. But after Jimmy Carter negotiated the deployment of
troops in September 1994, the US force arrived without major
incident. Aristide returned a month later, and the coup leadership
scattered to the United States, Panama, and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   By prior arrangement, Aristide served only the last 14 months of
his five-year term, handing over power to his former prime
minister, Rene Preval, in Haiti's first peaceful transition from
one elected president to the next. Preval remains president of a
skeleton government until a successor is chosen in November.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, though, has stumbled badly. Infrastructure has not
supported development. Corruption has remained rooted. Parliament
has fought with Preval, and after legislators could not meet a
constitutional requirement to set a new date for elections, Preval
dissolved the body last January.
</P>
<P>
   Without a functioning government, Haiti cannot legally receive
direct foreign funds, and now between $500 million and $800 million
is in limbo, much of it perhaps lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament elections are set for March 2000, and a presidential
vote for November next year, but there are no guarantees either
will take place as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the US troop presence has dwindled over the past five
years to 450. The permanent US mission ends Jan. 1, although
rotating troops will arrive for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon planners are relieved to pull back from a mission that
has cost an estimated $2 billion. They had long worried about the
safety of the troops, who were divided in Haiti into a group that
built schools and clinics, and a group that guarded the builders.
Often, the security detail outnumbered by 2 to 1 the troops doing
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress also are happy. They have criticized the
US Haiti policy ever since eager Clinton aides called the work
there a victory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, US Representative Porter Goss, a Florida Republican
and a former CIA agent who chairs the Select Intelligence
Committee, testified at a congressional hearing that ``if there was
a case study of the failed foreign policy of the Clinton
administration, Haiti would probably be the first example.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The passion for brutality hasn't changed there.
There's a question now whether we're headed toward more violence
there, whether we're headed toward a new Tontons Macoute'' _ the
dreaded militia created by the dictator Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier and continued under his son, Jean Claude.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier hearing, Goss focused on Aristide: ``You can't do
much of anything in Haiti without the blessing of Aristide. . . .
When we talk of authoritarian government, (it's) soon to be the
authoritarian government of Aristide.''
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's problems, as cited by Goss and other Republicans, seem
endless. The government does not function, people do not feel
secure, police killings are on the rise, judges are corrupt, about
80 percent of those in Haiti's jails are still awaiting trial, and
drugs from Colombia flow easily through the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt about the depth of Haiti's problems, or that
US policy makers see only one major strategic interest in Haiti: It
sits 550 miles south of Florida, making the United States
vulnerable to a flood of refugees in a time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Absent that threat and with the intractibility of Haiti's
problems, US interest is bound to slide. ``We can't continue to
keep Haiti in tutelage,'' the US ambassador, Timothy Carney, said
from his second-floor office, which overlooks the waterfront Harry
Truman Boulevard. ``It's self-defeating to continue in the present
mode, because Haiti, any country, will eventually react to the
presence of foreigners who are in positions of seeming control or
are too numerous.''
</P>
<P>
   But the distancing from Haiti also has been accelerated by
Aristide himself _ mainly by his decision to cloister himself from
most of his country, according to several US officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haiti is floating off our radar screen,'' a senior US official
in Washington said on condition of anonymity. ``Aristide's friends
in Washington are dwindling. It's not that Aristide has become the
devil, but that he hasn't become more of a leader.''

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti: ... a leader.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where does a leader begin in Haiti?
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour's drive around Port-au-Prince shows the vast needs
of the country: smelly open sewage, roads chewed up by runoff water
from the surrounding hills, people bulging out of the zany-colored
Haitian buses known as ``tap-taps,'' bearing names such as
Temperance, Grace, Dignity, and I Love You My God.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only an hour at the Aristide Foundation for Democracy, which
Aristide started about three years ago, shows the hand of a leader.
The foundation, run out of a new warehouse, auditorium, and office
complex, includes a grocery store, a 14-hour-a-day radio show run
by street children, literacy training workshops, a cooperative
farm, and a program that has given out more than 12,000 loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation is not Haiti,'' Aristide said by his desk at
home, sitting beneath a portrait of his dear friend, assassinated
priest Jean-Marie Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only part of Haiti. But how to broaden the picture and
make it clearer to the whole country? I think this is an issue of
speaking the truth, and I'll explain.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a deep breath and returned to what he called the
country's structural injustices. For example, 1 percent of the
population controls 45 percent of the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the same group of people who led the coup against me,
who now are behind a huge campaign of disinformation. They are
fighting against their own people. We had and still have an
apartheid society. We don't call it racism, but that is what it is.
. . . As we say in Creole, `Anal fa bet pa bet,' which means, `They
are illiterate but they are not dumb.' They can see what is going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer on how to lead, though, was to first lower
expectations on behalf of the poor. The poor, he said, first need
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide and hundreds of his Fanmi Lavalas party activists have
written issue papers for the elections in March. One pledge is to
build many schools; only an estimated 50 percent of Haiti's
children attend school.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy also carries into his talks on business deals
for the country, although it is unclear what, if any, commitments
Aristide can make while out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about new projects, Aristide said nothing about basic
improvements but instead highlighted plans for a $33 million
seaport and four new international airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome foreign investors,'' he said. ``We want the public
and private sector to work together. In Haiti, that means not
allowing anyone to use weapons or money or their positions to
unfairly benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Haiti drifts, and even Aristide's friends
wonder whether he understands what is happening outside his gates.
</P>
<P>
   People are so poor that a man recently killed a nun for money.
Inside the convent of the Sisters of the St. Louis Charities, the
mother superior, who would not give her name because of her fears,
told the story of Sister Marie Geralde Robert being shot in her
left cheekbone at 9:40 p.m. Nov. 17 as she rang the convent bell.
``The sister who died died with her protector, but her protector
doesn't carry a gun,'' the mother superior said.
</P>
<P>
   Educators cannot even teach the struggle for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   At a 12th anniversary commemoration at the site of a November
1987 election day massacre, few of the hundreds of schoolchildren
present knew about the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know why I am here!'' shouted Belane Azor, 17, a
sentiment echoed by his classmates. As an Aristide activist yelled
at pupils that they must know their history, teacher Rodnay
Debcieux, 42, said he was embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a country where most of the people are
illiterate,'' he said quietly. ``There is so much to do. So many
problems. I cannot prepare my lessons because there is no
electricity at night. And if I go outside and stand under a lamp, I
might never make it home because someone could shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Haiti, at least by Western standards of free press and
speech, has made some strides toward democracy in the past five
years. One is simply the absence of the army, which Aristide
disbanded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide said he needs to preach peace among Haitians. ``We need
not to say yes to impunity, but not to encourage violence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will come easily. The rumors are proving hard enough to
beat back. Aristide volunteered an example, another one about his
pool. One day, a street child asked him whether he could get AIDS
from swimming there. Soon, all the children told him they had heard
the same story, that if you swam in Aristide's pool you would come
down with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they lie like that, they don't help themselves,'' he
said, a hint of anger rising in his voice. ``It's so stupid, so
cynical, to tell a kid of the streets such nonsense when we know
how difficult it is for Haitians to find clean water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will continue to lie,'' Aristide said, ``and I will
continue to work.''

PATRIOTS ON THIN ICE FOR PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots are at the mercy of other
forces. They could win their last three games and still not make
the playoffs. They could finish 9-7 and still make the playoffs.
The calculations are endless this time of the year, and the
complicated AFC playoff picture likely will not be clear until the
final week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unsual time of the year,'' said Patriots coach Pete
Carroll. ``You can't predict how it will go. Teams get a second
life, and hopefully we're one of them. The only way to do that is
to win them out. That means trying to get a win in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade (Phillips in Buffalo) is fighting it, Jimmy (Johnson in
Miami) is fighting it. If Minnesota had pulled the game out (over
Kansas City Sunday night), we had tremendous opportunity to gain
all around and we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With their 20-15 loss in Indianapolis Sunday, the Patriots did
not gain any ground, but they didn't lose much, either, because
Miami and Buffalo also lost.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll does the figuring and the calculating. He does it
because he needs to tell his team, as he did Monday, that there is
hope of making the playoffs. He has been in this position before,
as an assistant coach with the Jets and Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year the Jets were 8-8 (1991), we got big-time help the
last game of the season,'' said Carroll. ``In Minnesota (in 1989),
St. Louis beat Dallas in the last game. St. Louis was struggling
and Dallas was playing real well so it was quite a surprise. It put
us in the playoffs and we made a pretty good darn run.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that his wife had given up hope for the Vikings in
1989 and decided to complete her Christmas shopping at a local mall
on the final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was walking through a section where the TVs were _
furniture section _ and she saw the game on TV and she stopped and
watched, and that's where she found out we were in the playoffs,''
said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has happened. It always happens to somebody. It needs to be
us. We have to get it done this weekend. It has to start this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Patriots have an easier schedule than any of the
teams they are vying with for a playoff spot. New England's last
three opponents _ Philadelphia, Buffalo, Baltimore _ have a
combined winning percentage of 42.5 (17-23).
</P>
<P>
   While Carroll is aware of that, he also knows the speculation
and guesswork is just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look for a sea of hope, you look at the schedule and
see what's going on,'' he said. ``You can't tell. You try to figure
this team has done that and this team has done this, but you don't
know. You think you might know but you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are still alive, Carroll and his players know
that, in the words of linebacker Ted Johnson, they ``blew it'' by
losing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are pissed off today,'' said tight end Ben
Coates. ``After watching the film, we had so many chances to win
the game. All we can do is just keep on winning and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In reflecting on the game, Carroll said the Patriots could have
done more than the obvious to win. Beyond the red zone problems,
Carroll thought his defensive backs missed a couple of
opportunities to pick off passes. There also were penalty problems.
And a costly Drew Bledsoe interception just before the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew had a chance to hit Shawn (Jefferson) one time in the
corner,'' said Carroll. ``Drew had the chance to get the ball to
Ben. I'm not putting it on him because I thought he threw the ball
like crazy. He was hitting everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also pointed out that Lamont Warren busted inside for a
7-yard gain to the 1 on a failed third-quarter drive where ``one
block would have sprung him for the touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   He also half-kiddingly lamented the bye week coming when it did
_ when the Patriots were 6-2 and coming off a decisive win in
Arizona _ though everyone at the time said it came at a perfect
juncture. Since the bye, they've gone 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we didn't have the damned bye,'' said Carroll. ``I
don't know what it is, but we got back into games with our division
after it and we knew that would be a dogfight. We haven't been able
to survive our division. The break in the action . . . I don't know
. . . the timing of it was excellent in that it allowed us to get
healthy. I'm saying this tongue-in-cheek, but we haven't answered
it like we need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of the could-have-beens are huge, and all the
reflection won't do any good.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's in someone else's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot of heart from us and a lot of help
from other people,'' said Carroll. ``We can play with all the heart
we want to play with the next three weeks, but if nobody loses,
we're dead.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The televised ``debates'' now showing in America between the six
Republican candidates for president are not keeping anyone up at
night. Their format is unlively, with little cut-and-thrust allowed
among the men on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, something intriguing is emerging: the realization
that, in George W. Bush and John McCain, the two most-favored
candidates for New Hampshire, the Republicans are fielding two
opposite ideas of what an American president should be like.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of the one are exactly the weaknesses of the
other, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with style, not to be underestimated in any American
election. Bush is all winks, jokes, flapping hands and puckish
grins. He exudes so much confidence, so much fun in the race, that
he seems light-headed. And this is alarming to many who watch him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he really is a foolish fellow, afloat on too much money,
and with not even President Bill Clinton's quota of the seriousness
needed for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not unfunny himself _ he cracked the best joke of the
first debate, about his obsessive admiration for Alan Greenspan at
the Federal Reserve _ yet his campaign persona could hardly be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   He has the straight-backed stance of a soldier, a soldier's
directness of gaze: he does not hesitate to use words like
``heroism,'' ``honor'' and ``sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Without necessarily reliving his prisoner-of-war years in
Vietnam, his speeches are suffused with that experience.
</P>
<P>
   He has so much gravitas of such an old-fashioned variety that
his audiences _ attuned, even in New Hampshire, to the fluff and
tinsel of modern campaigns _ can find his persona as disconcerting,
in its way, as the capers of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally enough, these different world-views translate into
very different approaches to foreign policy. Bush, famous now for
his failure to get places and names straight, still gives the
impression that foreign policy is alternately a game and a chore.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers have helped him to map out a path in which the
preservation of American sovereignty is uppermost (a popular
theme), and in which interventions abroad are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   How different from McCain, who sees America as the preeminent
force for good in the world, and who thinks America should be
prepared not only to intervene when necessary, but to take
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this suggest that McCain is The Economist's Republican?
Not necessarily, for in terms of domestic politics the strengths
tilt to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner has laid out detailed manifestoes for governing
that suggest a busy incrementalist: tending to fiscal incaution,
perhaps, but skeptical of government, sharp-eyed on social problems
and unafraid to experiment with such things as charter schools and
church-based welfare systems.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, McCain has linked most of his thinking about domestic
policy to the probably unattainable Holy Grail of campaign-finance
reform; and, unlike Bush, he has not prepared himself for the
presidency by running the country's second-biggest state.
</P>
<P>
   He has also not prepared himself by learning how to work with
others. Where Bush is famous for bringing Texas Democrats around to
his way of thinking, McCain is equally famous for having alienated,
both with temper and aloofness, his own colleagues in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His penchant for plain speaking and maverick thinking
(refreshing, on its face, in a president) may be hazardous to his
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   So too may be his stance as an ``outsider.'' Bush used to stress
his own outsider status, cowboy boots and all. But he has now put
that quietly aside in favor of being effective, and it does not
seem to have damaged him.
</P>
<P>
   Could the answer be a Bush-McCain ticket, Light and Heavy
together? Probably not, for McCain hardly has the self-effacing
emollience required of a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Americans _ and not a few foreigners _ can only regret that the
best parts of these two are not combined in a single candidate. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The televised ``debates'' now showing in America between the six
Republican candidates for president are not keeping anyone up at
night. Their format is unlively, with little cut-and-thrust allowed
among the men on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, something intriguing is emerging: the realization
that, in George W. Bush and John McCain, the two most-favored
candidates for New Hampshire, the Republicans are fielding two
opposite ideas of what an American president should be like.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of the one are exactly the weaknesses of the
other, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with style, not to be underestimated in any American
election. Bush is all winks, jokes, flapping hands and puckish
grins. He exudes so much confidence, so much fun in the race, that
he seems light-headed. And this is alarming to many who watch him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he really is a foolish fellow, afloat on too much money,
and with not even President Bill Clinton's quota of the seriousness
needed for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not unfunny himself _ he cracked the best joke of the
first debate, about his obsessive admiration for Alan Greenspan at
the Federal Reserve _ yet his campaign persona could hardly be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   He has the straight-backed stance of a soldier, a soldier's
directness of gaze: he does not hesitate to use words like
``heroism,'' ``honor'' and ``sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Without necessarily reliving his prisoner-of-war years in
Vietnam, his speeches are suffused with that experience.
</P>
<P>
   He has so much gravitas of such an old-fashioned variety that
his audiences _ attuned, even in New Hampshire, to the fluff and
tinsel of modern campaigns _ can find his persona as disconcerting,
in its way, as the capers of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally enough, these different world-views translate into
very different approaches to foreign policy. Bush, famous now for
his failure to get places and names straight, still gives the
impression that foreign policy is alternately a game and a chore.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers have helped him to map out a path in which the
preservation of American sovereignty is uppermost (a popular
theme), and in which interventions abroad are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   How different from McCain, who sees America as the preeminent
force for good in the world, and who thinks America should be
prepared not only to intervene when necessary, but to take
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this suggest that McCain is The Economist's Republican?
Not necessarily, for in terms of domestic politics the strengths
tilt to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner has laid out detailed manifestoes for governing
that suggest a busy incrementalist: tending to fiscal incaution,
perhaps, but skeptical of government, sharp-eyed on social problems
and unafraid to experiment with such things as charter schools and
church-based welfare systems.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, McCain has linked most of his thinking about domestic
policy to the probably unattainable Holy Grail of campaign-finance
reform; and, unlike Bush, he has not prepared himself for the
presidency by running the country's second-biggest state.
</P>
<P>
   He has also not prepared himself by learning how to work with
others. Where Bush is famous for bringing Texas Democrats around to
his way of thinking, McCain is equally famous for having alienated,
both with temper and aloofness, his own colleagues in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His penchant for plain speaking and maverick thinking
(refreshing, on its face, in a president) may be hazardous to his
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   So too may be his stance as an ``outsider.'' Bush used to stress
his own outsider status, cowboy boots and all. But he has now put
that quietly aside in favor of being effective, and it does not
seem to have damaged him.
</P>
<P>
   Could the answer be a Bush-McCain ticket, Light and Heavy
together? Probably not, for McCain hardly has the self-effacing
emollience required of a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Americans _ and not a few foreigners _ can only regret that the
best parts of these two are not combined in a single candidate. &QL;

   Over the centuries economists have given warning of shortages of
food, fuel and almost every raw material. They were almost always
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, The Economist would like to draw attention to a new
shortage: of acronyms and abbreviations.
</P>
<P>
   So great is the demand in a world where new organizations spring
up almost daily, and firms are increasingly known only by strings
of initials, that there are simply not enough to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO _ the World Trade Organization, not the World
Tourism Organization, which was set up well before the free-traders
pinched its initials.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of The Economist know that the meeting in Seattle was
supposedly about opening markets to international trade. But
perhaps, as a commentator in Barrons suggests, the Internet had
been rife with rumor that the meeting was a gathering of
representatives of the World Temperance Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The chanting and the street demos were really a laudable _ and
wholly proportionate _ protest by trade unionists, greens,
turtle-lovers and anarchists against what they feared would be a
global ban on alcohol. History will remember the ``Bottle of
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Or look at the International Monetary Fund, which, for all its
preaching to the Third World, believes in monopolies when it suits
its purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Fund is suing a Californian mortgage firm, IMF Loans (an
abbreviation of Iron Mountain Financial, based on a direct
translation of the owner's German maiden name), to force it to
change its name, which it claims is misleading _ though Russia has
not yet come knocking on the mortgage lender's door.
</P>
<P>
   How long before the Washington-based IMF takes on Britain's
International Managers' Forum, the Indian Mountaineering
Foundation, or the Integrated Microscopy Facility (at Southwest
Texas State University)?
</P>
<P>
   Confusion abounds. Americans visiting Britain this summer were
puzzled by demonstrators brandishing placards demanding that the
government ``ban GM.''
</P>
<P>
   Are cars built by General Motors really so unreliable? No, the
villain was genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   A headline ``ECB raises rates'' could cause turmoil in financial
markets. Yet rather than tighter monetary policy at the European
Central Bank it might refer to the England Cricket Board increasing
membership fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turmoil at the LSE'' might signify a market crash on the
London Stock Exchange or a staff walkout at the London School of
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   And if a fellow traveller remarks that he is with the CIA, don't
be alarmed. As a member of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries,
that bulge is more likely to be a calculator than a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The nasty truth is that there are only 17,576 different
permutations of three letters. That is not enough, when a
multinational organization such as the ECB requires no fewer than
five sets of abbreviations in the languages of the EU. Add one more
letter and the permutations number almost 457,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this does not solve the dilemma. Is the CBOT the
Chicago Board of Trade or the Central Bank of Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   This is a clear market failure. In the market for cabbages or
computers, prices would rise, encouraging greater supply or choking
off demand. But the supply of abbreviations is fixed _ and the
price is stuck at zero.
</P>
<P>
   Demand cannot be satisfied. Yet multiple use of an abbreviation
only creates confusion. The solution is simple.
</P>
<P>
   A new organization is needed to tax and control the
proliferation of initials. It might be called AAAAAA (the
Association for the Alleviation of Absurd Acronyms and Asinine
Abbreviations). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet has come of age in this presidential
campaign. Every candidate has his sophisticated Web site, and sets
great store by it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the hangers-on, who set up Web sites either to
support a candidate or, more often, to ridicule him?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush knows what should happen to the latter: they
should be squashed.
</P>
<P>
   He has been suffering from the attentions of www.gwbush.com, a
spoof site with an official-looking photograph of Bush that proves,
on closer inspection, to feature a straw stuck up the governor's
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the site's creator,
Zack Exley, accusing him of using pictures ``borrowed'' from his
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also complained to the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
that the site constitutes ``express advocacy,'' and violates the
Federal Election Campaign Act's spending limits and registration
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC _ the ``Failure to Enforce Commission,'' its critics
call it _ is unsure what to do about this. It is seeking public
comment over the next two months on how election law should apply
to sites like Exley's, and indeed how it applies to the Internet in
general.
</P>
<P>
   It is a large problem. One voter in every ten surfs the Net to
find advice on how to vote. Lobbyists bombard Congress with
electronic messages: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent
over 200,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians raise big sums online (Bill Bradley has just passed
$1 million). And from RunHillary.com to AlBore.com, Web sites laud
and lampoon nearly every candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC says it is ``unquestionable'' that federal election law
applies to activity on the Internet. Critics such as the ACLU
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political speech deserves the highest protection of the First
Amendment and should only be regulated if there's a threat of
corruption,'' says Laura Murphy, director of the organization's
office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FEC has yet to demonstrate how this new Web technology
could have a corrupting influence on the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet an exceptionally large e-mail Christmas card list, or a
highly-visited Web site, may be so influential _ and even so
corrupting _ that it could draw the FEC's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Others say money should be the criterion for FEC involvement. If
people are not spending much money on their advocacy, they should
stay unregulated. Yet on the Internet, partisans can build Web
sites and send thousands of e-mails at a tiny cost.
</P>
<P>
   David Mason, one of the FEC's six commissioners, said recently
that the FEC would take a relatively permissive approach to
Internet activity, exempting most private political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view,'' he said, ``that someone who is operating on
their own would be covered by an exemption in the act which applies
to voluntary activity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand (considerable confusion here), ``the volunteer
exemption applies to someone who is volunteering on behalf of the
campaign, and if you're out there on your own you may not be
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, then, that the exemption may not cover volunteers
who are truly independent of the candidates they support. Take the
case of Noah Heller, a 19-year-old freshman student and co-owner of
NetizensForBradley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Heller has deliberately had no contact with the Bradley
campaign, to avoid being labelled an in-kind contribution. Yet, by
obeying the letter of the law, he is truly ``on his own,'' and
possibly not covered by the volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of Web sites that generate revenue.
``When you start taking money from somebody for what you're doing,
that is a different sort of thing than volunteer activity in your
home,'' says Mason.
</P>
<P>
   But many personal Web sites, having almost no money behind them,
try to offset costs with banner ads and other e-commerce. Exley,
for example, sells T-shirts and bumper stickers on gwbush.com to
help maintain the site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been soliciting online donations to create
television and e-commercials critical of Bush (he raised $2,500 in
only five days). But the ads may very likely draw the FEC's
attention. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A case last year gave some guidance on how the FEC might treat
Web sites that do not merit a volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Smith, a tax consultant in Connecticut, built a personal Web
site advocating the defeat of a local congresswoman, Nancy Johnson.
The FEC said the site constituted ``express advocacy'' that would
trigger an independent-expenditure reporting requirement if its
value rose above $250.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Smith coordinated his activities with Johnson's
official opponent, it would become an ``in-kind'' contribution that
could not exceed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But how would the FEC put a value on the site? The commission
said it would add the fee for registering the domain name
(typically $70) to the overhead costs of the computer hardware and
software (these could easily be over $1,000) and Internet services
(perhaps $240 a year), then divide that sum by the total number of
Web sites Smith maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formula could push most Web sites over the legal
threshold. But the more an individual used the Internet to
influence politics, the more likely he would be to avoid
regulation, as total expenses (which are fixed) would be divided by
a greater number of sites. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The finances of Web sites are often mysterious even to their
creators. At NetizensForBradley.org, Greg Laynor, one of the site's
founders (who also happens to be 14, and at school), explains that
dozens of volunteers work on the site, but that they have not
spoken to each other. They communicate only by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greg and Heller, the other founder of the site, have never
spoken. There is no way for them to know what money the collective
has spent on maintaining the site, and therefore whether they have
passed the spending limits. And it is possible that the FEC might
count the hardware and software costs of the volunteers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks (a word, phrase or image on a Web page that, when
clicked, sends you elsewhere) are also tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Mason says hyperlinks on personal Web sites should be exempt,
and those on commercial sites regulated. But, again, everything
depends on value; and how should hyperlinks be valued, when they
can be created in seconds at no marginal cost, and are often paid
for by barter (you link to me, I link to you)? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to see how anyone could spend $250 _ the limit
for unreported independent expenditure _ on forwarding e-mails. But
Mason says that e-mail lists of a certain size, even if they did
not surpass spending limits, may require regulation.
</P>
<P>
   When does an e-mail list, or a Web site, get too large or
influential? Even a handful of e-mails can have a disproportionate
impact. In 1996, the Children's Defense Fund's 2,000 e-mail
subscribers regularly forwarded alerts to another 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-profile complaint can propel a previously obscure Web
site to fame, attracting the eye of the regulators. (Visitors to
gwbush.com soared from 30 to around 500,000 a month after Bush
filed his complaint.)
</P>
<P>
   How will the FEC know when such a nebulous line is crossed, and,
more important, how will the Internet advocates know?
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a former election lawyer who is director of
political advocacy for Juno Online Services, says the rules are now
so confusing that ``even lawyers call specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of NetizensForBradley.org, the specialist is the
young Greg Laynor, who has read all the FEC literature but still
concludes that ``it's not clear if we're doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone says the commission must tailor its rules to non-lawyers
like Greg, lest frustrated netizens ``ignore the law and act at
their peril, or throw up their hands and decide it's not worth
becoming politically involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of a chill are already in the air. At the end of
November Mason complained that the FEC had received only 24 e-mails
during the first two weeks of public comment. And at least one big
political Web site said it would not submit comments for fear of
attracting the regulators' attention. &QL;

LOSING AT A GAME OF CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Fear is in the eyes of some Patriots today.
Resignation is in the eyes of others. Blankness is in the eyes of
nearly everyone.
</P>
<P>
   They are shell-shocked this morning, reeling from having lost
four of their last five games, stunned at their inability to solve
the offensive problems that week after week keep them out of the
end zone just often enough to lose again.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at the 11th hour plus 57 minutes, they finally seemed to
understand the predicament they have created for themselves. It is
simple. Their destiny is out of their hands now.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots no longer control their fate, unless they keep on
losing, in which case they would seal it. They must count on others
to save them from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't done yet,'' said Troy Brown, who is pound for pound
the toughest guy on this team, mentally and physically. ``We're
still alive. You're still alive until you're dead. We're going to
need a lot of help, but it ain't done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown can talk that way because he majored in computer science
at Marshall, so he understands math, and math is the only thing the
Patriots have going for them. But even if they have begun to play
like cadavers, Brown's point of view is the only one you can take
now. It is the only way you can look at them and still talk of
playoff chances. They do remain viable, but reality enters into
these things eventually, even in New England, a region whose view
of its football team so often seems to stray far from reality. And
the reality of their situation can be summed up in one word.
</P>
<P>
   Dire.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven AFC teams ahead of the Patriots fighting for six
playoff slots, and every one of them has the advantage in all
manner of tie-breakers because of New England's dismal division and
conference records. Because of that, you can say only one thing if
you play football in New England. You can say only that you are
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that you are on life support must be ignored. The
Patriots' playoff life could not appear frailer, yet all week you
will hear only of how they know they need help and help has come in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   They know they are playing just terribly enough to lose four
times since the return of the Parcells Effect, yet they talk of
help as if they were Tonto waiting for the arrival of the
ever-reliable Lone Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   This collapse began when New England was beaten by Bill
Parcells's staggering Jets five Sundays ago. They have gone 1-4
after losing to him for the third straight year. They can say all
they want in Foxborough about how there is no longer anything
between Parcells and his old team, but the fact of their annual
collapse puts the lie to that.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight years. Three straight losses to Parcells's team,
followed by three straight collapses and three straight 1-4 runs.
Whether that is because Parcells and defensive assistants Bill
Belichick, Al Groh, and Romeo Crennel keep devising the blueprint
for others to follow to beat the Patriots or simply because the
annual loss reminds too many people in Foxborough of what has been
lost is impossible to know.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that the collapse dropped a haughty 6-2 team
into fourth place in the division, bringing it closer to the
last-place Jets than the first-place Colts.
</P>
<P>
   But where there are games left, there is always hope.
</P>
<P>
   They know this, just as they know they are in deep trouble, and
so they chose to focus on the positive Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unusual time of year,'' coach Pete Carroll said.
``Teams seem to get a second life. Look what happened Monday. We
had a tremendous opportunity to gain ground across the board and we
didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   No they did not, and that brings to mind a sad thought. What if
they've already gotten all the help they're going to get?
</P>
<P>
   New England lost on a day it could have tied the floundering
Dolphins, slipping Bills, and fading Seahawks, who all lost to drop
to 8-5. Only Kansas City, which has a win over New England and thus
the tie-breaker advantage, won, but it is also only 8-5. So New
England had help but gained no ground.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when the Patriots lost to Buffalo, Miami lost the
same day. So did Seattle. So New England had help but gained no
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, when the Patriots lost to Miami, Buffalo was
losing. So was Kansas City. So New England had help but gained no
ground.
</P>
<P>
   When this slide began back on Nov. 15 with the Jets loss, it was
on a day when Miami and Kansas City also were defeated. So the
Patriots had help that day even before they realized they might
need it, but gained no ground.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, how much more help can New England expect to receive?
</P>
<P>
   Even the normally upbeat Carroll acknowledged that sad reality
for a moment Monday when asked if perhaps they'd gotten all the
help they could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be,'' he said. ``This was a tremendous weekend for us to
cash in and we didn't. We'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   His players were saying much the same thing. They were talking
hopefully while knowing hope is all but gone. Extinguished as much
by their own hands as by anything that had been done to them.
Extinguished by penalties at the worst of times and dropped balls
at the worst of times and receivers running routes from Mars and
not getting open and linemen standing after running plays when the
only things on the ground are their running back and the 1,000
pounds of defenders on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not scoring touchdowns, man,'' Brown said. ``Your guess
why is as good as mine. Our execution is hurting us. Now it will
take a lot of heart from us and a lot of help from other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand our situation. We've got to win out, but even if
we do, if nobody loses we're dead. When we were 6-2 we were flying
high. I couldn't have imagined being in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few naysayers did, and they were hooted down. Now there
is nothing more to say. It is time to watch and wait in New
England. Wait for help that already may have come and gone.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet has come of age in this presidential
campaign. Every candidate has his sophisticated Web site, and sets
great store by it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the hangers-on, who set up Web sites either to
support a candidate or, more often, to ridicule him?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush knows what should happen to the latter: they
should be squashed.
</P>
<P>
   He has been suffering from the attentions of www.gwbush.com, a
spoof site with an official-looking photograph of Bush that proves,
on closer inspection, to feature a straw stuck up the governor's
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the site's creator,
Zack Exley, accusing him of using pictures ``borrowed'' from his
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also complained to the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
that the site constitutes ``express advocacy,'' and violates the
Federal Election Campaign Act's spending limits and registration
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC _ the ``Failure to Enforce Commission,'' its critics
call it _ is unsure what to do about this. It is seeking public
comment over the next two months on how election law should apply
to sites like Exley's, and indeed how it applies to the Internet in
general.
</P>
<P>
   It is a large problem. One voter in every ten surfs the Net to
find advice on how to vote. Lobbyists bombard Congress with
electronic messages: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent
over 200,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians raise big sums online (Bill Bradley has just passed
$1 million). And from RunHillary.com to AlBore.com, Web sites laud
and lampoon nearly every candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC says it is ``unquestionable'' that federal election law
applies to activity on the Internet. Critics such as the ACLU
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political speech deserves the highest protection of the First
Amendment and should only be regulated if there's a threat of
corruption,'' says Laura Murphy, director of the organization's
office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FEC has yet to demonstrate how this new Web technology
could have a corrupting influence on the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet an exceptionally large e-mail Christmas card list, or a
highly-visited Web site, may be so influential _ and even so
corrupting _ that it could draw the FEC's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Others say money should be the criterion for FEC involvement. If
people are not spending much money on their advocacy, they should
stay unregulated. Yet on the Internet, partisans can build Web
sites and send thousands of e-mails at a tiny cost.
</P>
<P>
   David Mason, one of the FEC's six commissioners, said recently
that the FEC would take a relatively permissive approach to
Internet activity, exempting most private political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view,'' he said, ``that someone who is operating on
their own would be covered by an exemption in the act which applies
to voluntary activity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand (considerable confusion here), ``the volunteer
exemption applies to someone who is volunteering on behalf of the
campaign, and if you're out there on your own you may not be
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, then, that the exemption may not cover volunteers
who are truly independent of the candidates they support. Take the
case of Noah Heller, a 19-year-old freshman student and co-owner of
NetizensForBradley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Heller has deliberately had no contact with the Bradley
campaign, to avoid being labelled an in-kind contribution. Yet, by
obeying the letter of the law, he is truly ``on his own,'' and
possibly not covered by the volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of Web sites that generate revenue.
``When you start taking money from somebody for what you're doing,
that is a different sort of thing than volunteer activity in your
home,'' says Mason.
</P>
<P>
   But many personal Web sites, having almost no money behind them,
try to offset costs with banner ads and other e-commerce. Exley,
for example, sells T-shirts and bumper stickers on gwbush.com to
help maintain the site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been soliciting online donations to create
television and e-commercials critical of Bush (he raised $2,500 in
only five days). But the ads may very likely draw the FEC's
attention. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A case last year gave some guidance on how the FEC might treat
Web sites that do not merit a volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Smith, a tax consultant in Connecticut, built a personal Web
site advocating the defeat of a local congresswoman, Nancy Johnson.
The FEC said the site constituted ``express advocacy'' that would
trigger an independent-expenditure reporting requirement if its
value rose above $250.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Smith coordinated his activities with Johnson's
official opponent, it would become an ``in-kind'' contribution that
could not exceed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But how would the FEC put a value on the site? The commission
said it would add the fee for registering the domain name
(typically $70) to the overhead costs of the computer hardware and
software (these could easily be over $1,000) and Internet services
(perhaps $240 a year), then divide that sum by the total number of
Web sites Smith maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formula could push most Web sites over the legal
threshold. But the more an individual used the Internet to
influence politics, the more likely he would be to avoid
regulation, as total expenses (which are fixed) would be divided by
a greater number of sites. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The finances of Web sites are often mysterious even to their
creators. At NetizensForBradley.org, Greg Laynor, one of the site's
founders (who also happens to be 14, and at school), explains that
dozens of volunteers work on the site, but that they have not
spoken to each other. They communicate only by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greg and Heller, the other founder of the site, have never
spoken. There is no way for them to know what money the collective
has spent on maintaining the site, and therefore whether they have
passed the spending limits. And it is possible that the FEC might
count the hardware and software costs of the volunteers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks (a word, phrase or image on a Web page that, when
clicked, sends you elsewhere) are also tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Mason says hyperlinks on personal Web sites should be exempt,
and those on commercial sites regulated. But, again, everything
depends on value; and how should hyperlinks be valued, when they
can be created in seconds at no marginal cost, and are often paid
for by barter (you link to me, I link to you)? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to see how anyone could spend $250 _ the limit
for unreported independent expenditure _ on forwarding e-mails. But

not surpass spending limits, may require regulation.

   It appears, then, that the exemption may not cover volunteers
who are truly independent of the candidates they support. Take the
case of Noah Heller, a 19-year-old freshman student and co-owner of
NetizensForBradley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Heller has deliberately had no contact with the Bradley
campaign, to avoid being labelled an in-kind contribution. Yet, by
obeying the letter of the law, he is truly ``on his own,'' and
possibly not covered by the volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of Web sites that generate revenue.
``When you start taking money from somebody for what you're doing,
that is a different sort of thing than volunteer activity in your
home,'' says Mason.
</P>
<P>
   But many personal Web sites, having almost no money behind them,
try to offset costs with banner ads and other e-commerce. Exley,
for example, sells T-shirts and bumper stickers on gwbush.com to
help maintain the site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been soliciting online donations to create
television and e-commercials critical of Bush (he raised $2,500 in
only five days). But the ads may very likely draw the FEC's
attention. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A case last year gave some guidance on how the FEC might treat
Web sites that do not merit a volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Smith, a tax consultant in Connecticut, built a personal Web
site advocating the defeat of a local congresswoman, Nancy Johnson.
The FEC said the site constituted ``express advocacy'' that would
trigger an independent-expenditure reporting requirement if its
value rose above $250.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Smith coordinated his activities with Johnson's
official opponent, it would become an ``in-kind'' contribution that
could not exceed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But how would the FEC put a value on the site? The commission
said it would add the fee for registering the domain name
(typically $70) to the overhead costs of the computer hardware and
software (these could easily be over $1,000) and Internet services
(perhaps $240 a year), then divide that sum by the total number of
Web sites Smith maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formula could push most Web sites over the legal
threshold. But the more an individual used the Internet to
influence politics, the more likely he would be to avoid
regulation, as total expenses (which are fixed) would be divided by
a greater number of sites. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The finances of Web sites are often mysterious even to their
creators. At NetizensForBradley.org, Greg Laynor, one of the site's
founders (who also happens to be 14, and at school), explains that
dozens of volunteers work on the site, but that they have not
spoken to each other. They communicate only by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greg and Heller, the other founder of the site, have never
spoken. There is no way for them to know what money the collective
has spent on maintaining the site, and therefore whether they have
passed the spending limits. And it is possible that the FEC might
count the hardware and software costs of the volunteers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks (a word, phrase or image on a Web page that, when
clicked, sends you elsewhere) are also tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Mason says hyperlinks on personal Web sites should be exempt,
and those on commercial sites regulated. But, again, everything
depends on value; and how should hyperlinks be valued, when they
can be created in seconds at no marginal cost, and are often paid
for by barter (you link to me, I link to you)? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to see how anyone could spend $250 _ the limit
for unreported independent expenditure _ on forwarding e-mails. But
Mason says that e-mail lists of a certain size, even if they did
not surpass spending limits, may require regulation.
</P>
<P>
   When does an e-mail list, or a Web site, get too large or
influential? Even a handful of e-mails can have a disproportionate
impact. In 1996, the Children's Defense Fund's 2,000 e-mail
subscribers regularly forwarded alerts to another 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-profile complaint can propel a previously obscure Web
site to fame, attracting the eye of the regulators. (Visitors to
gwbush.com soared from 30 to around 500,000 a month after Bush
filed his complaint.)
</P>
<P>
   How will the FEC know when such a nebulous line is crossed, and,
more important, how will the Internet advocates know?
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a former election lawyer who is director of
political advocacy for Juno Online Services, says the rules are now
so confusing that ``even lawyers call specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of NetizensForBradley.org, the specialist is the
young Greg Laynor, who has read all the FEC literature but still
concludes that ``it's not clear if we're doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone says the commission must tailor its rules to non-lawyers
like Greg, lest frustrated netizens ``ignore the law and act at
their peril, or throw up their hands and decide it's not worth
becoming politically involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of a chill are already in the air. At the end of
November Mason complained that the FEC had received only 24 e-mails
during the first two weeks of public comment. And at least one big
political Web site said it would not submit comments for fear of
attracting the regulators' attention. &QL;

   ``You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law. You have the right to a lawyer and to have a
lawyer present during questioning. If you would like a lawyer but
cannot afford one, a lawyer will be appointed for you without
charge. Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar, and widely admired, phrases. Intoned in thousands of
American films and television shows, the formula is known
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, the so-called Miranda warning _ named after
a case that came before the Supreme Court in 1966, and daily read
to tens of thousands of arrested people _ is a reassuring symbol
that their criminal justice system, warts and all, is fundamentally
fair.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling requires the warning _ or a version of it,
the exact words varying from state to state _ to be read to any
arrested person before he or she is interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   Well, think again: or so it will be argued before the Supreme
Court early next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6 the court agreed to examine a lower-court ruling which
found that the Miranda warning is not, as had been thought,
required by the American Constitution and that it had, in effect,
been overruled by a long-dormant federal law enacted in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court has a curious, and revealing, history.
Unlike nearly all others, it is not the result of a genuine legal
dispute but of a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side in the current case _ Charles Dickerson, a bank
robber, or his federal prosecutors _ asked the Fourth Circuit
federal appeals court, based in Richmond, Va., to rule on the
validity of Miranda warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless that court, one of the most vigorously conservative
in the country, took up the issue at the prompting of Paul Cassell,
a law professor at the University of Utah, who has waged a lonely
campaign against the Miranda decision in law journals and court
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, almost as unusually, has asked Cassell to
defend the Fourth Circuit's decision. Cassell is a former law clerk
to Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's leading conservative, who
has already expressed his skepticism about Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell has long argued that every year Miranda warnings help
thousands of criminals to escape prosecution. This was precisely
the fear of those who criticized Miranda when it was announced by a
divided Supreme Court 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The court's five-to-four decision, based on the right against
self-incrimination laid down in the Constitution's Fifth Amendment,
was a high-water mark of the liberal court presided over by Chief
Justice Earl Warren. It immediately became the target of
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1968 presidential election, Richard Nixon attacked the
decision, and in the same year conservative senators pushed Lyndon
Johnson, who then occupied the White House, into accepting a
provision supposedly overruling Miranda as the price for passing a
big crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the worst fears of the critics and of the police have
not been realized. Despite Cassell's claims, there is little
evidence that a significant number of guilty people are going free
because of the Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason for this is that, contrary to expectations,
most people under arrest do not keep their mouths shut and do not
ask for a lawyer, even though it is almost always in their interest
to do so. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One study even claimed that the rate of confessions had risen by
9.8 percent since the warning was introduced. Most other studies
show that the confession rate has at least not fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of those arrested proceed to make a
confession. Moreover, the warning has not proved quite the bulwark
against coerced confessions and self-incrimination that the Warren
court had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Some policemen have found ways to dilute its effect _ by reading
it in an incomprehensible monotone, by cozying up to suspects
before reciting it, or by delaying access to a lawyer even when one
is requested.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court itself has chipped away at its effectiveness
in a series of subsequent cases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although the original 1966 decision explicitly
required that all questioning cease once a suspect had asked for a
lawyer or invoked his right to remain silent, the court has allowed
evidence extracted from suspects after they have invoked their
right to be used in court against them if they do go ahead and
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Information gleaned in this way can also be used to dig up other
incriminating evidence. Civil-liberties campaigners are suing
police forces in Los Angeles and Santa Monica for routinely
continuing interrogations after the Miranda rights have been
invoked. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it has not been as effective as was hoped, is Miranda worth
keeping? Most of those concerned with defendants' rights believe it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important symbol,'' argues David Cole, a law professor
at Georgetown University in Washington. ``It's the only example of
the court trying to offset with a clear rule the economic
inequalities which make the criminal justice system unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   If arrested, says Cole, ``rich people will always have their
attorneys there to advise them. Poor people almost never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some law-enforcement groups are expected to file briefs
supporting Cassell, more will probably oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Most of America's policemen are now comfortable with Miranda,
and many prosecutors argue that they have more to lose than to gain
by a return to pre-Miranda days, which is what a victory for
Cassell would mean.
</P>
<P>
   Courts rarely inquire into the voluntariness of a confession
given after a Miranda warning. Without the warning, the police
would have to prove, case by case, that a disputed confession was
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   This is why no administration has tried to resurrect the 1968
law that seemed to overturn Miranda: that law, rather than the
court's 1966 decision, has been regarded as unconstitutional, and
therefore empty.
</P>
<P>
   It will be extraordinary if the Supreme Court, after reaffirming
the Miranda decision in dozens of cases over the past 33 years,
changes its mind next year. &QL;

   It is something of an indictment of the party that few outside
his home state have heard of him. But then Tom Ridge, the governor
of Pennsylvania, is an unusual sort of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why shows how much the party is changing. Ridge comes
of a working-class family from the steel mills of Erie, Penn. He
went to Harvard. He served as a sergeant in Vietnam (returning to
become the first non-commissioned Vietnam veteran in Congress).
</P>
<P>
   This is not a combination you often see. His politics also makes
nonsense of the conventional wisdom that says there are only two
sorts of Republicans: abrasive social conservatives and
laisser-faire economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge fits into neither camp. He is no social conservative, at
least according to the abortion test. Catholic though he is, he has
consistently supported abortion choice; this ruled him out as Bob
Dole's running-mate in 1996, and may hurt his chances again next
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he tirelessly tries to persuade teenage
fathers to stay with their children (he leads a nationwide program
on this) and is as tough as old boots on crime.
</P>
<P>
   His first act as governor was to convene a special legislative
session which produced a law increasing punishments for crimes
against children and a ``three-strikes'' law against repeat
offenders. He then reintroduced capital punishment to the state,
signing over 100 death warrants.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly a laisser-faire Republican, either. For example, he
set up a program under which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania gives
poor workers 50 cents for every dollar they save, up to $600.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us (Republicans),'' he admits, ``it sounds odd for
government to be involved in encouraging people to save.''
</P>
<P>
   To some in his party, ``odd'' would hardly be the word for it.
``Completely misguided'' might be better, or perhaps ``socialist
meddling in areas which government should leave alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge is unapologetic. He believes in governmental activism. ``I
get to do the stuff below the radar screen that makes a real
difference to people's lives. That's why I like being a governor so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also strongly pro-business. ``One of my biggest challenges
was to change the perception that Pennsylvania was not a good place
to do business,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over in the Republican landslide year of 1994, he
has reduced the business-tax burden by $3 billion, partly by
tax-cutting and partly by regulatory reform. Pennsylvania is the
first state in America to have fully deregulated both the
electricity and the gas industries.
</P>
<P>
   But all this fiddling has not stopped Ridge cutting income
taxes, too. He has reduced state income taxes by about $2.6 billion
and he has kept the rise in state spending to 30 percent in cash
terms since 1995, a modest cut in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is pro-business, sympathetic to the poor, a
tax-cutter, prepared to intervene in some markets, and
traditional-tough on some social issues, liberal on others.
</P>
<P>
   Are there wider implications of his success? (Which in electoral
terms has been considerable: in a state where Democrats heavily
outnumber Republicans, he won reelection by 57 percent of the vote
in a four-way race, the widest margin a Republican has ever
achieved in Pennsylvania.)
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to say: No, he just has an unusually powerful
political personality. ``Relentless'' might be the Ridge family
motto. He numbers the indefatigable Teddy Roosevelt among his
heroes and he quotes with affection and approval his shoe-salesman
father's advice that ``if you're just relentless at pursuing
something, you'll get it done.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 625 OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   But there are bigger reasons for his success: the blurring of
the party's traditional division between social and economic
conservatives, and the re-emergence of a Republican center.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer Americans now say that they are angry with the government.
Swing voters in the coming election are likely to be financially
comfortable and politically moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center, a polling organization, has recently
invented a new typology. It divides registered Republicans into
three groups: ``Staunch Conservatives,'' who are pro-business,
morally severe, critical of the government and hostile to taxpayer
help for the poor; ``Moderate Republicans,'' who are more
sympathetic to government action but no more tolerant than the
first group of state handouts for the needy; and ``Populist
Republicans,'' who think that businesses have too much power, that
the government should do more to help the poor _ but who also share
with Staunch Conservatives a general distrust of elected officials
and a strict conservative morality.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you accept this exact categorization, the point
it highlights is that significant numbers of Republicans now take a
positive view both of government and of helping the poor (though,
paradoxically, groups who like the one do not necessarily like the
other). More than that, it makes clear that Ridge's somewhat
contradictory views reflect contradiction and confusion on the part
of voters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He suits this new phenomenon _ not because he fits any of the
groups' profiles precisely (he doesn't) but because he has
something to offer everyone and because his pragmatic approach to
government is more important than any ideological differences.
</P>
<P>
   So Staunch Conservatives may not particularly like, say, his
ideas for helping the poor, or his views on abortion. But they do
not object all that strongly. And they like his pro-business views
and his crime-reduction policies.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that it may no longer be possible to be successful
from the confines of either social or laisser-faire conservatism.
You need a broader, if fuzzier, appeal.
</P>
<P>
   That implies more policy tolerance, more local experimenting and
more ad hoc problem-solving, not only because voters want
contradictory things but because different states will try out
different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It needs a shift of power from the relative single-mindedness of
Washington, to the incoherence and ferment of 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge wants that. ``The new federalism that we seek,'' he says,
needs ``a new Republican Party.'' To be led, presumably, by George
W. Bush _ with the governor of Pennsylvania (abortion views
permitting) at his side. &QL;

JERUSALEM INSPIRES DELUSIONS ALONG WITH FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Lost souls wander the ancient pathways of the Old
City here convinced they are the Son of God, or at least one of his
prophets.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe they are John the Baptist, others the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   All of them suffer from the ``Jerusalem Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches, the number of people afflicted
with the psychological disorder is growing, said Dr. Yair Carlos
Bar-El, who is called the world's leading expert on it.
</P>
<P>
   In his office at Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center on the
outskirts of Jerusalem, he treats on average 30 acute cases a year
of travelers who become overwhelmed by the religious significance
of Jerusalem and descend into a delusional state in which they
assume the personalities of biblical characters.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming year, he expects that number will triple.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, he is up to 50 cases this year, and the flood
of 3.2 million tourists expected to visit the Holy Land for the
millennium is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the syndrome exhibit well-known signs, such as
purification acts, obsessive bathing, or wrapping themselves in
white sheets (typically taken from the hotels where they are
staying). Often, they end up disrupting prayer services at one or
another holy site, screaming about the wages of sin.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction of one percent of the tourists who come will
experience psychiatric problems brought on by the emotion of
visiting the holy sites, he said. But that will add up to roughly
3,000 cases of emotional distress among religious travelers in the
city over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   He said sufferers usually fit into one of three broad
categories:
</P>
<P>
   --Some are are mentally stable at home but develop emotional
problems triggered by something in the experience of visiting the
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   --Some arrive intent on bringing about a specific biblical
prophecy. They are typically passive but feel that they are called
to come.
</P>
<P>
   --Those in the third group, which most precisely fits the
clinical definition of ``Jerusalem Syndrome,'' typically come as
normal religious tourists, often travelling alone. During the
journey, they develop a belief that they have been called to take a
role in a prophecy or, in some cases, that they are the
reincarnation of a biblical character, often the Virgin Mary or
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Although occasionally people of other faiths develop such
symptoms, Bar-El said, it is mostly a phenomenon among Christians,
especially those in evangelical Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-El has been helping Israeli police and tour guides
understand what to expect in the way of mental aberrations among
the pilgrims, but he said their training has been limited and
insufficient to deal with the coming onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be capable of detecting these cases, to find them
early,'' he said. ``We have told authorities loudly that more needs
to be done, but our protests have gone unheard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pills are small, light and pricey. Purchasers do not
need to touch them or try them on. Getting them from pharmaceutical
company to consumer, via wholesaler, distributor and pharmacy is
expensive. Sick people are reluctant to queue up in a shop, or to
discuss their herpes in public.
</P>
<P>
   So hurrah for the Internet, which cuts out middlemen, saves
costs and eliminates the trudge down to the local drug store.
</P>
<P>
   This was the premise behind a flurry of American online
pharmacies _ drugstore.com, PlanetRx.com and Soma.com _ which set
up in business over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to have it all: a big idea; backing from some of the
Net's heaviest hitters _ Amazon.com is the largest shareholder in
drugstore.com, and its boss, Jeff Bezos is on the board;
experienced managers _ the chief executive of PlanetRx hails from
Federal Express, while drugstore.com's used to work for Microsoft;
and, of course, minimal revenues and heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   When drugstore.com, with revenues of $16 million and a $72
million loss, went public in July, only five months after opening
for business, its shares soared to a valuation of $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetRx.com, with less than $1 million in sales in its first
six months, was worth nearly $1.3 billion when it floated in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the euphoria has not lasted. Both their share prices have
since fallen by half. Soma.com has been quietly renamed CVS.com
after being bought by the big retail pharmacy chain of that name.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts have turned from enthusiasts to skeptics: a
November survey in Business2.0, an Internet magazine, cited
drugstore.com as one of the ten ``least-trusted'' sites on the
Internet. Wags at Forrester Research talk of ``drugstore.toast.''
</P>
<P>
   The health-care market, it turns out, is both more complicated
and more competitive than the Internet companies imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The American market for prescription drugs is tightly controlled
by insurance companies and health-management organizations (HMOs)
whose job it is to keep health-care claim costs _ two-thirds of
Americans have private health coverage _ as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   They employ henchmen known as pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs)
to process health-insurance claims and oversee the distribution of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Without the approval of a PBM, a drug retailer will not be
reimbursed for the cost of a prescription drug and so must charge
the customer the full cost _ on average $38 per prescription _
rather than the $5-10 so-called co-pay fee that is charged by most
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   These PBMs divide the market into three. The first bit, for
acute problems such as allergic reactions, can be handled only by
bricks-and-mortar pharmacies. Waiting for a pill to arrive in the
mail is hardly an option for someone with an attack of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme are 90-day repeat prescriptions for chronic
illnesses such as a heart condition or depression. The PBMs control
this lucrative segment, which they fulfill through their own
mail-order businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is the market that everyone is fighting over _
30-day prescriptions, a huge business representing 87 percent of
America's 3 billion prescriptions a year and growing in value by 16
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The PBMs have tried this market and found it unprofitable for
their mail-order operations, so they have been willing to
relinquish it.
</P>
<P>
   In this market segment, online firms are competing with
conventional pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Walgreens, CVS, Rite-Aid and Eckerd, which
together process some 28 percent of all prescriptions in America,
have the advantage of scale. They get discounts from drug makers
and wholesalers _ though even then, as Rite-Aid's recent profit
warnings suggest, it's hard to make much money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, online stores do not have to invest in all those
shops. But the cost of fulfillment is turning out to be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Razzouk, the chief executive of PlanetRx, says that so as
to maintain trust in a brand, firms must control everything from
taking an order to picking, packing and shipping it.
</P>
<P>
   Razzouk is investing ``millions and millions'' in automating his
company's 165,000-square-foot warehouse in Memphis, so that he can
keep the promises he makes in his $40 million of brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com currently outsources fulfillment _ odd, given
Bezos's obsession with building perfect distribution systems _
which is one reason for its poor reputation.
</P>
<P>
   PBMs are the second problem for online pharmacies. They
initially refused to accept online stores at all, but are now
changing their minds. They can see how they might exploit Web
pharmacies' advertising to attract more people into the mail-order
prescription market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in return for allowing Web firms to fill insured
prescriptions, the PBMs either want to be paid for their
cooperation, or are demanding that they handle the distribution
themselves. In response, some online pharmacies have given up.
</P>
<P>
   Soma.com sold out to CVS, which has since allied itself with
Merck-Medco, a subsidiary of Merck, a drug firm. Merck-Medco is
America's biggest PBM.
</P>
<P>
   Others are scrambling to find backers. A reluctant drugstore.com
sold 25 percent of itself to Rite-Aid, which owns PCS, America's
second biggest PBM. Last month PlanetRx hooked up with Express
Scripts, the number three PBM, selling it a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Little of the value of these deals went to the online firm.
Merck-Medco fills all the 30-day mailed prescriptions ordered
through CVS.com from its own warehouse.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pills are small, light and pricey. Purchasers do not
need to touch them or try them on. Getting them from pharmaceutical
company to consumer, via wholesaler, distributor and pharmacy is
expensive. Sick people are reluctant to queue up in a shop, or to
discuss their herpes in public.
</P>
<P>
   So hurrah for the Internet, which cuts out middlemen, saves
costs and eliminates the trudge down to the local drug store.
</P>
<P>
   This was the premise behind a flurry of American online
pharmacies _ drugstore.com, PlanetRx.com and Soma.com _ which set
up in business over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to have it all: a big idea; backing from some of the
Net's heaviest hitters _ Amazon.com is the largest shareholder in
drugstore.com, and its boss, Jeff Bezos is on the board;
experienced managers _ the chief executive of PlanetRx hails from
Federal Express, while drugstore.com's used to work for Microsoft;
and, of course, minimal revenues and heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   When drugstore.com, with revenues of $16 million and a $72
million loss, went public in July, only five months after opening
for business, its shares soared to a valuation of $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetRx.com, with less than $1 million in sales in its first
six months, was worth nearly $1.3 billion when it floated in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the euphoria has not lasted. Both their share prices have
since fallen by half. Soma.com has been quietly renamed CVS.com
after being bought by the big retail pharmacy chain of that name.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts have turned from enthusiasts to skeptics: a
November survey in Business2.0, an Internet magazine, cited
drugstore.com as one of the ten ``least-trusted'' sites on the
Internet. Wags at Forrester Research talk of ``drugstore.toast.''
</P>
<P>
   The health-care market, it turns out, is both more complicated
and more competitive than the Internet companies imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The American market for prescription drugs is tightly controlled
by insurance companies and health-management organizations (HMOs)
whose job it is to keep health-care claim costs _ two-thirds of
Americans have private health coverage _ as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   They employ henchmen known as pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs)
to process health-insurance claims and oversee the distribution of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Without the approval of a PBM, a drug retailer will not be
reimbursed for the cost of a prescription drug and so must charge
the customer the full cost _ on average $38 per prescription _
rather than the $5-10 so-called co-pay fee that is charged by most
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   These PBMs divide the market into three. The first bit, for
acute problems such as allergic reactions, can be handled only by
bricks-and-mortar pharmacies. Waiting for a pill to arrive in the
mail is hardly an option for someone with an attack of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme are 90-day repeat prescriptions for chronic
illnesses such as a heart condition or depression. The PBMs control
this lucrative segment, which they fulfill through their own
mail-order businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is the market that everyone is fighting over _
30-day prescriptions, a huge business representing 87 percent of
America's 3 billion prescriptions a year and growing in value by 16
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The PBMs have tried this market and found it unprofitable for
their mail-order operations, so they have been willing to
relinquish it.
</P>
<P>
   In this market segment, online firms are competing with
conventional pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Walgreens, CVS, Rite-Aid and Eckerd, which
together process some 28 percent of all prescriptions in America,
have the advantage of scale. They get discounts from drug makers
and wholesalers _ though even then, as Rite-Aid's recent profit
warnings suggest, it's hard to make much money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, online stores do not have to invest in all those
shops. But the cost of fulfillment is turning out to be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Razzouk, the chief executive of PlanetRx, says that so as
to maintain trust in a brand, firms must control everything from
taking an order to picking, packing and shipping it.
</P>
<P>
   Razzouk is investing ``millions and millions'' in automating his
company's 165,000-square-foot warehouse in Memphis, so that he can
keep the promises he makes in his $40 million of brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com currently outsources fulfillment _ odd, given
Bezos's obsession with building perfect distribution systems _
which is one reason for its poor reputation.
</P>
<P>
   PBMs are the second problem for online pharmacies. They
initially refused to accept online stores at all, but are now
changing their minds. They can see how they might exploit Web
pharmacies' advertising to attract more people into the mail-order
prescription market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in return for allowing Web firms to fill insured
prescriptions, the PBMs either want to be paid for their
cooperation, or are demanding that they handle the distribution
themselves. In response, some online pharmacies have given up.
</P>
<P>
   Soma.com sold out to CVS, which has since allied itself with
Merck-Medco, a subsidiary of Merck, a drug firm. Merck-Medco is
America's biggest PBM.
</P>
<P>
   Others are scrambling to find backers. A reluctant drugstore.com
sold 25 percent of itself to Rite-Aid, which owns PCS, America's
second biggest PBM. Last month PlanetRx hooked up with Express
Scripts, the number three PBM, selling it a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Little of the value of these deals went to the online firm.
Merck-Medco fills all the 30-day mailed prescriptions ordered
through CVS.com from its own warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts gets $11 million a year simply for giving
PlanetRx access to the customers of the HMOs it serves. Diana
Baumohl, head of planning, calls it ``a chance to test the Internet
and lose nothing,'' because Express does not need to consolidate
PlanetRx's losses.
</P>
<P>
   The physical stores have done well too. CVS got a fully formed
Internet channel for only $30 million. And, despite Drugstore.com's
share price fall, Rite-Aid is sitting on a paper profit of around
$320million _ handy given the group's current financial problems.
</P>

   None of this suggests that the Internet will not feature in drug
retailing. Online pharmacies are well-placed to collect and
eventually sell data on patients. That is one reason why
conventional pharmacies _ most recently, Walgreens _ are investing
in developing the Internet as another channel.

   HONG KONG _ Forget Finland's reindeer, London's Dickens or New
York's FAO Schwartz. When it actually comes to making the stuff of
good tidings, Hong Kong is the most Christmassy place there is.
</P>
<P>
   From its companies come most of the world's toys, along with its
Christmas-tree lights, trimmings and yes, even the trees
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the big green spruce or sparkling white pine around which
their presents are stacked, millions of good little boys and girls
this year can thank just one Hong Kong company: Boto, the
abominable snowman of the fake-Christmas-tree industry, which has
captured nearly 45 percent of the American market.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's factories in Shenzhen, China employ 6,500 workers,
filling up to 50 containers a day with hand-wrapped triumphs of
faux foliage to spread cheer around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are eighteen-foot pines, with real cones and authentic
smell; or smaller white, gold and silver varieties in flocked,
frosted or prelighted form; or just wreaths, centerpieces,
garlands, swags or sprays.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's vertically integrated operation makes everything from the
lights, ornaments and tinsel to PVC rigid film, which is cut up to
make ``needles.''
</P>
<P>
   While the eggnog flows, this is a great business. Thanks in part
to a glowing report by David Webb, a usually Scrooge-like
independent Hong Kong analyst, its shares are up nearly 6 percent
this week, near an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, which are growing at 20 percent a year, will hit $100
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a fly in Boto's brandy butter. What does it do for
the rest of the year? The toy companies have birthdays, new
products and parental indulgence to keep their sales going
throughout the year. But there is little call for frosted elms in
July.
</P>
<P>
   This clever company has, however, found a neat solution: an
equivalent but opposite seasonal product.
</P>
<P>
   In the off months, its Shenzhen elves now make rather spiffy
garden furniture in a new factory next to its tree workshop. &QL;

IT'S TIME TO REGROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIFA and the European Football Union should reevaluate the
criteria for qualifications. They have scheduled three meetings
between England and Germany in the next few months: home-and-away
World Cup 2002 qualifiers, and a European Championships 2000 match
in Charleroi, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   And World Cup champion France was placed in the toughest Euro
2000 group, along with the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   England and Germany were assigned to Group 9 along with Greece,
Finland, and Albania in the World Cup draw. They join Portugal and
Romania in Group A in Euro 2000. The security arrangements for
England-Germany matches are prohibitive; the last time the nations
were to meet for a ``friendly,'' they mutually consented to cancel
it out of fear of neo-Nazi groups. It did not help that the game
unwittingly was scheduled for Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The problems started when England, France, and Italy _ three of
only four European nations that have won the World Cup _ were
placed in the second grouping. The matchups were based on results
in qualifying for the France '98 World Cup and Euro 2000, scheduled
in Belgium and Holland June 10-July 2. So France received no credit
for its World Cup title, since it did not play any qualifiers as
host nation.
</P>
<P>
   Italy was fortunate. The Azzurri have Belgium, Sweden, and

   Diego Maradona has seldom been concerned with political
correctness. Nor have many others from his neighborhood in Villa
Fiorito on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, where survival is the
primary concern. But Maradona should not be perceived as
politically naive. He is among the few prominent athletes who have
expressed consistent support for Fidel Castro. Maradona recognizes
his roots and is true to them. He would never be accepted on his
terms in the sporting world's mainstream, so he has found his place
among similar renegades. In Naples, where Maradona played for seven
years, he found an entire race of people with similar sentiments.
Now Maradona is being courted by Libya. His younger brother and
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson were to arrive in Tripoli Tuesday to
begin a 90-day training program for national team striker Al-Saad
Khadafy, son of Moammar. Both Johnson and Raul ``Lalo'' Maradona
have played for soccer teams in Toronto. ``Al-Saad will see if
Johnson can teach him, and this will benefit the whole team,'' said
Libya's Italian coach, Eugenio Bersellini. The Johnson-Maradona
team, which also includes a masseur and another coach, are being
paid about $400,000.

   The New England Revolution's strike force is going strong in
South America. Eduardo Hurtado scored the only goal as LDU Quito
defeated Nacional in the first game of the Ecuadoran finals.
``Thank God I have teammates who supported me when I shot badly on
two good balls they gave me in the first half,'' Hurtado said. ``I
felt their support and I dedicate the goal to them.'' Giovanni
Savarese's Caracas FC lost to Independiente Santa Fe of Bogota in
the semifinals of the Copa MercoNorte. Meanwhile, Ariel Graziani,
who played three times for the Revolution before moving to Dallas,
was named Ecuadoran player of the week after leading Emelec to two
victories and qualification for the Copa Libertadores tournament .
. . Former Revolution striker Joe-Max Moore made his debut for
Everton FC as a 75th-minute substitute in a 0-0 tie at Exeter City
in an FA Cup match. The return game is scheduled in Liverpool
Sunday. Likely, Everton president Peter Johnson will continue to
keep a low profile after receiving a death threat over the Internet
from a group called Direct Everton Action . . . Moore is being
allowed to concentrate on his club career by US national coach
Bruce Arena, who invited 34 players to training camp starting Jan.
5 in Claremont, Calif. Revolution midfielder John Harkes, who has
89 US appearances, is headed to the camp in preparation for the
Jan. 16 friendly against Iran in Pasadena. The US meets Chile in
Coquimbo Jan. 29, then plays in the Gold Cup starting Feb. 12
against Haiti in Miami . . . Hector ``Bambino'' Viera, Bolivia's
Argentine coach, announced plans to use two naturalized Brazilians
in World Cup qualifying, which starts in Uruguay March 28. Viera,
who earns a bonus of $1 million if the Bolivians qualify, plans to
use Julio Cesar Baldivieso (Japan), Marco Etcheverry (D.C. United),
and Erwin Sanchez (Benfica) in the tournament, but will not likely
call up the Revolution's Mauricio Ramos . . . Lothar Matthaus,
billed as the successor to Franz Beckenbauer with the MetroStars,
has agreed to join the MLS team in March. But he will likely be
called to Germany for Euro 2000 and five pretournament friendlies.

   CAPE CANAVERAL _ This was the week when things were meant to
start going right again for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Discovery was to depart Saturday on a mission
to fix the disabled Hubble Space Telescope. But Friday the
lozenge-shaped digital clock that counts down to liftoff in front
of the press viewing area was blank.
</P>
<P>
   Signs all around the Kennedy Space Center telling tourists when
to expect a launch said TBD _ to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is nothing huge. Engineers found a foot-long dent in
a fuel line that circulates hydrogen to the three engines.
Apparently somebody had stepped on it. But they should have it
mended quickly and officials are tentatively planning to blast the
orbiter into the heavens at 9:18 p.m. next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crew of seven will be a British-born astronaut,
Michael Foale.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is ideal. First, it means that the agency will have
people in space over Christmas for the first time since 1983. All
holiday time has been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, it brings the nine-day mission perilously close
to the last day of the year. There is no certainty that the
computer software on the Discovery shuttle can handle the potential
pitfalls of Y2K. It must be back home by Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure on NASA to perform a successful launch as soon
as possible is intense. And it has little to do with Hubble itself,
even though the telescope has been completely disabled for the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   There is such urgency because this has been the year when NASA
has fumbled almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Both politicians in Washington and the public are starting to
ask what is going on. Even President Bill Clinton felt compelled
during a press conference this week to offer NASA his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all use the slogan, `Well, it isn't rocket science.' Well,
this is rocket science,'' Clinton remarked. ``We have to keep doing
this if we ever hope to know what's beyond our galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's worst calamities have been in the Mars program. In
September, the Mars Climate Orbiter was incinerated when it dipped
into the Red Planet's atmosphere _ somebody forgot to convert
imperial measurements to metric.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, all contact was lost with the Mars Polar
Lander after it was supposed to touch down. It is now presumed dead
and nobody yet knows what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Russia's inability to continue funding its
contribution to the construction of the International Space Station
means that the project has been put on ice. Until Russia is able to
complete a crucial part of the orbiting complex, no further work on
it can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The picture with the shuttle program here on Cape Canaveral is
hardly better. There have only been two missions so far this year _
the slowest pace since the aftermath of the Challenger explosion in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the last flight in July _ the first to be
commanded by a woman _ almost ended in disaster when a short
circuit disabled two computers that control the shuttle's engines.
It was that near-miss that led to the slowdown in the launch
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The wiring problem was deemed so severe that NASA responded by
grounding its entire fleet of four orbiters for wiring inspections,
which took several weeks. Thus, the Hubble mission that was
originally meant to launch in October, is still here on the ground.
The latest delay was the sixth. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The agency is naturally defensive about all the problems.
``Obviously everyone at the Space Center would like to see the
shuttles fly more often,'' Joel Wells, a NASA spokesman, agreed.
``But our primary concern must be that the shuttle is safe to fly
and if that means we have to sacrifice a little bit of the
frequency of flights then that is what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the pressure and all the delays are even getting to
some of the astronauts, including Foale, who completed a highly
perilous mission on the Russian Mir station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am paying more attention to the readiness of this flight
than I have on my previous flights,'' he admitted. ``If you get off
the curve, you get off your edge, you lose a little bit, and I
think we've been too long from flying.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   NASA knows that its troubles may only really begin when Congress
reconvenes in Washington after the Christmas break. Already,
members have warned that hearings will be convened to assess
whether or not the agency is doing its job properly.
</P>
<P>
   For many representatives, the loss of the Polar Lander was the
last straw and evidence that taxpayers were wasting money on NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week's failings of the Mars Polar Lander as well as
difficulties NASA has had with the International Space Station,
shuttle launches and the Chandra X-ray telescope, among others,
have made it clear that we need a total reassessment of NASA's
approach to interplanetary exploration,'' warned Representative
Bill Frist, who heads a subcommittee that oversees the agency. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC;

<P>
   The man in the hot seat will be Daniel Goldin, who is in charge
of NASA. Because of pressure to cut costs from Congress, he has
pushed through a new ``cheaper, better, faster'' policy at the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under Goldin's leadership, the agency has switched from
concentrating on a few grand _ and grandly expensive _ mission
programs to juggling a great number of less expensive ventures,
like the Mars landers. And it has all been done on what some
believe is a shoestring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still this misunderstanding in some circles that NASA
is getting all this money,'' Wells insisted. ``When in fact our
piece of the pie could not even stand up on its own _ we get less
than 1 percent of the federal budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that it is precisely the tightening of the federal
purse that has caused an overstretched NASA to commit avoidable
errors, including here at Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, the shuttle work force has been reduced. They
are sorely tried to do all they're supposed to do with the staff
they've got,'' remarked Seymour Himmel, a retired NASA official now
on the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel. &QL;

   There was a time, of course, when NASA could do no wrong. It put
the first man on the moon. It rescued its crew from the crippled
Apollo 13 craft against all reasonable odds. Now, this is a place
that feels under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Michael Foale, like everybody else, knows how
important getting Discovery off the pad and into space has suddenly
become. ``I think after this flight, NASA will breathe a collective
sigh of `Ahh, we're back in the business again,''' he said. &QL;

   Witching hour approaches. Goblins and gremlins and ghouls will
set mischief loose in the world. Fear will add its chill to the
winds that sweep through the streets. With every sunset, solid
citizens know they're another day closer to... Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have a right to feel nervous. When it's time to roll
over to the double zeros of 2000, some computers won't make the
transition. Undiscovered software bugs will leave the poor machines
stuck in 1900 or hopelessly dithering over the date.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario, automatic teller machines could
refuse to spit out cash, electrical utility grids could fail, and
entire industries could come to a halt when their computerized
inventory-control and manufacturing systems stop answering
commands.
</P>
<P>
   The chance that anything so cataclysmic might happen is small,
but real. The truth is that nobody knows for sure what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market hates uncertainty _ its inability to predict
whether or not the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
a piddling 25 basis points is enough to send the indexes tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the intensity of investor reaction to a genuinely
chilling possibility, no matter how remote.
</P>
<P>
   A stock such as Lucent Technologies fell 9 percent on July 20,
when Wall Street analysts decided that a passing remark by a
company executive about a possible slowdown in sales during the
quarter ending in December was a sign that the curse of Y2K had hit
the company.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it will pay more this winter to be attentive and
thoughtful than to be frightened, because Y2K will mean both tricks
and treats.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that shows lower sales and earnings, others
will report unexpectedly strong results.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors may decide to head for the sidelines, pulling
money out of financial markets in favor of the security of cash.
But foreign investors, especially those with money in emerging
markets, are likely to flee to the comparative safety of the U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the tricks the Y2K bug may play on investors means
paying attention to only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the auto industry. The big U.S.-based automakers
such as Ford and General Motors are exactly the kinds of companies
most susceptible to the bite of the year-2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   They sit at the top of immensely long supply chains: Their
assembly lines require interior assemblies from Lear and body
frames from Tower Automotive, for example. Those suppliers rely on
even smaller suppliers for everything from screws to vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these parts are delivered by computerized just-in-time
inventory systems that try to keep parts on hand to a minimum. Any
disruption to that flow, and the computerized manufacturing systems
that churn out cars will grind to a halt for days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, auto executives know this _ and know that no matter
how rigorously they've tested their own internal systems the
carmakers are at the mercy of systems failures anywhere in the
supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   So what have these companies been doing? Well, they have asked
suppliers to ensure that their own systems are bug-free _ and
they've temporarily turned their just-in-time inventory systems
into just-in-case insurance policies by stockpiling larger than
normal supplies of critical components. Momentary glitches won't
shut this industry down.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the same thing in industry after industry, with the
same essential effect: The numbers in company reports will be
confusing, and stock prices will be unusually volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that increase inventories are adding costs and
temporarily depressing earnings. It will take quick footwork to
convince Wall Street analysts that measures intended to prevent
truly serious problems aren't reasons to lower long-term
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors won't get the message, of course, and they'll
liquidate long-term positions on essentially meaningless changes in
quarterly numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies are recording higher costs as a result of
building inventory, others in the same industry will be showing
unexpectedly strong sales as customers step up orders so they, too,
can stockpile critical components.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't get too excited by that good news, either.
Those increased sales in the current quarter will lead to reduced
sales in future quarters when customers cut back on purchases in
order to work down inventory to normal, just-in-time levels.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothing out the trend to get a picture of what's really going
on will require intensive research and number crunching by analysts
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors will opt to sell instead of putting in the work
to figure out what the numbers mean _ after all, the conventional
wisdom is that the approach of the millennium will send share
prices down as worried individuals move to good old low-tech cash.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, the potential treats will temper the effect of
the potential tricks. Safety is a relative term, after all, and
from the perspective of individuals who have most of their money in
the stock markets of Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan, the U.S. financial
markets look positively Y2K-bug proof.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. banks, as well as European-based global banks, are
likely to see an inflow of cash from wealthy foreigners who think
having a bit of cash in New York or Miami is just a prudent hedge
against systems failure back home. Foreign corporations are likely
to make similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the approach of the millennium will move
numbers _ at individual companies and in entire financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term changes in the figures, for better or worse, will
be big enough that analysts and investors will have a hard time
ignoring them. The market can be counted on to make too much of the
short-term trend: Research shows that the market tends to project
short-term change further into the future than the facts warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary volatility in earnings or global cash flows will seem
more important than they are because of this tendency.
</P>
<P>
   The market will eventually get it right and correct those
errors. But that adjustment will take time, and while the market
works its way through this volatility, there will be more than
enough moments that seem truly horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who allow the momentary fright to scare them out of
long-term holdings are likely to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who can shrug off the scare and buy individual
equities when some loud ``boo'' has sent other investors running
for cover are likely to find their bags full of treats long after
the goblins have been put to bed. &QL;

NEW COLLEGE EYES POLITICAL LIVES FOR THE HOME SCHOOLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCELLVILLE, Va. _ The dormitories are still under construction
in the hilly fields, but Patrick Henry College already has a few
rules: Students will wear uniforms. They won't drink. They won't
date, unless their parents ``are informed of the potential
romance'' and approve.
</P>
<P>
   All of which will set the college apart when it opens next fall.
Yet what is drawing national attention to the school is not its
strict code of conduct, but its future student body. Almost every
undergraduate entering Patrick Henry College will have been
home-schooled.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them graduates of one of the most controversial
movements in American education, one that gained steam in the 1980s
amid a series of legal battles pitting parents against the
government. Now that the first wave of the country's 1.5 million
home-schooled children is reaching college age, there is a new
debate: When, and how, should they be thrust into the ``real
world''?
</P>
<P>
   Critics of home-schooling have long argued children need
exposure to the outside world and peers to grow into well-rounded
adults. And home-schoolers freely admit their aim is to ``let
children be children'' by sheltering them from the harsh realities
and temptations of the modern world. But when do children stop
being children? How do they make that transition? And what kind of
adult lives will home-schooled children be prepared to lead?
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Patrick Henry College, believed to be the first
ever to target home-schoolers, think they have found an answer in
their curriculum: The only major for incoming freshmen will be
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their classes, students will write legislative
papers for US congressmen, which they hope will then be used as
actual guides for congressional staffers. Students will also
participate in Capitol Hill ``apprenticeships,'' all to train them
for a future in the most unsheltered of careers: politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the real world means Capitol Hill, they'll be as prepared
as anyone,'' said the school's founder, Michael P. Farris, who has
home-schooled his 10 children, the oldest of whom is 24. ``If it is
defined as the college bar scene? No, they're not going to be
prepared for that a bit. It would be fair to say we're skipping one
phase of wildness. We're skipping them straight into adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   This intertwining of politics and home-schooled students is
bound to draw notice, especially since the home-schooling movement
is so often depicted as antigovernment. In the last 19 years
advocates for home schooling have filed hundreds of lawsuits in
more than 40 states, according to the Home School Legal Defense
Association. The purpose of the litigation, in most cases, has been
to get government out of citizens' educational lives.
</P>
<P>
   But to Farris and his colleagues, the vision is entirely
consistent. Patrick Henry College will be a breeding ground for the
next generation of crusaders _ who may abstain from partying with
the rest of the world, but will still work to change it. The
school's promotional material states the goal: ``Eventually, these
highly-qualified public servants will themselves begin to run for
elective office and will have the opportunity to lead our nation
back to its constitutional roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those roots do not exclude religion, in Farris's view, and
fundamentalist Christianity is clearly at the core of what the
college hopes to stand for. Students will attend daily chapel. They
must ``show evidence of a personal relationship with Jesus
Christ,'' the school pamphlet says, and must subscribe to a
seven-point statement of faith that includes believing in the
literal resurrection of Christ. Emblazoned on the blue-and-white
folders being distributed to prospective students is a school
motto: ``For Christ &AMP; For Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris's vision for student relationships is also closely tied
to faith. He hopes to develop a ``practice of courtship,'' in which
students ``engage in the activity of seriously looking for God's
partner in life.'' Students who find themselves attracted to one
another will be required to call their parents to discuss it. The
role of parents, Farris said, is ``to help them make a wise choice
of whether they will marry.''
</P>
<P>
   Campus life is still just a dream, of course. The main hall is
little more than a steel frame in the middle of a muddy field,
surrounded by cranes and construction material. The administrators,
including Farris, work out of a cluster of townhouses in a
subdivision of this tiny town in western Loudon County, whose other
inhabitants include a Dunkin' Donuts and a McDonald's along a
two-lane main road.
</P>
<P>
   But, if all goes well, the state higher education council of
Virginia will recommend Patrick Henry be approved to enroll
students, a final step toward opening its doors in 2000. Farris
said he hopes to send out applications as early as this week. And
he is in the midst of fund-raising to help pay the school's $50
million in long-term costs; since June, he said he has raised close
to $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have helped is the Republican Governor of
Virginia, Jim Gilmore, who signed copies of a Patrick Henry
biography at a party to raise funds, Farris said. There are other
political connections, too: Janet Ashcroft, the wife of Republican
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, is on the school's board of
trustees. And Farris considers Representative Steve Largent, an
influential Republican from Oklahoma, a ``good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Those political ties will become increasingly important if the
apprenticeship system is put into practice, as some of the 100 to
140 students begin to write legislative papers for congressmen. But
there are those who wonder whether integrating home-schooled, and
to some degree ``home-colleged'', students into the political
culture of Capitol Hill will be as easy or productive as Farris
makes it sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their experience is of being cut off, to a large extent, from
people with different values and different backgrounds,'' said Mark
Rozell, a professor of politics at Catholic University. ``Once
anyone goes into politics, to be successful it's necessary to know
how to converse with different people and to know how to work
effectively with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Brad Jacob, the school's provost, that is exactly why
schools like Patrick Henry are in demand. ``We see this college as
a transition from the home, and from a home school, into the real
world of living on your own,'' he said. ``We don't think it's
necessary to make that transition by dumping an 18-year-old cold
turkey on a college campus. We're trying to make that transition in
a controlled way.''

   Witching hour approaches. Goblins and gremlins and ghouls will
set mischief loose in the world. Fear will add its chill to the
winds that sweep through the streets. With every sunset, solid
citizens know they're another day closer to... Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have a right to feel nervous. When it's time to roll
over to the double zeros of 2000, some computers won't make the
transition. Undiscovered software bugs will leave the poor machines
stuck in 1900 or hopelessly dithering over the date.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario, automatic teller machines could
refuse to spit out cash, electrical utility grids could fail, and
entire industries could come to a halt when their computerized
inventory-control and manufacturing systems stop answering
commands.
</P>
<P>
   The chance that anything so cataclysmic might happen is small,
but real. The truth is that nobody knows for sure what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market hates uncertainty _ its inability to predict
whether or not the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
a piddling 25 basis points is enough to send the indexes tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the intensity of investor reaction to a genuinely
chilling possibility, no matter how remote.
</P>
<P>
   A stock such as Lucent Technologies fell 9 percent on July 20,
when Wall Street analysts decided that a passing remark by a
company executive about a possible slowdown in sales during the
quarter ending in December was a sign that the curse of Y2K had hit
the company.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it will pay more this winter to be attentive and
thoughtful than to be frightened, because Y2K will mean both tricks
and treats.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that shows lower sales and earnings, others
will report unexpectedly strong results.
</P>

money out of financial markets in favor of the security of cash.

 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on the way to the millennium: prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The world's economies grew stronger, not weaker. After a
disastrous 1998, when Asia imploded and Russian assets evaporated,
most pros bet that 1999 would be another year of global gloom.
Prominent brokerage houses forecast a recession in the U.S. _
wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risk to the world economy today is not recession but
excessive growth, which spurs central bankers to apply higher
interest rates as a brake. At the end of October, the U.S.
Department of Commerce reported that gross domestic product grew
4.8 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, prophets of doom!
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, prospects may not be as uniformly sunny, but
there's plenty of good news. Japan, for example, is finally getting
off its knees. Last winter, the Nikkei still looked sick at 14,000
or so (about a third its 1989 peak), and the GDP was actually
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Nikkei has gained 36 percent through October (in
U.S.-dollar terms). The government has cut income taxes, and
Japanese CEOs have started trimming fat payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Nissan and Mitsubishi announced major restructuring
deals in order to attract foreign investors and achieve
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan grinds forward, it will pull its neighbors along with
it. South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia have already bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark stock indexes of South Korea and Indonesia have
jumped, respectively, about 48 percent and 45 percent through
October. Even Malaysia, which panicked and placed capital controls
on foreign investors, has enjoyed a 28 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 crisis created a lot of wreckage, but it also forced
banks to allocate credit more efficiently, rather than on the
nepotistic basis of who owes a favor to the prime minister's
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   When Asia collapsed in 1997-98, global commodity prices
collapsed, too. The stock prices for such leading Canadian
companies as Inco, the world's largest nickel producer, fell down
the mine shaft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Commodities Research Bureau commodity price index
plunged almost 20 percent. But in the past six months, stronger
Asian economies _ which buy raw materials from countries like
Canada _ have lit a fire under commodities and under Canadian
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has not done so well. Because the new euro began the year
with a belly flop that wiped out 12 percent of its value, most U.S.
investors have not made money on euroland stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This will change if the new European Central Bank, which to date
looks more like a rabble than a coherent group of decision makers,
achieves some credibility in its second year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though economies are recovering there and GDP is likely to
grow faster than 2 percent in 2000, big question marks hang over
the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is not yet a clear winner, either. In June, I
warned that the Mexican market had jumped too high too quickly and
was due for a big pullback. In May it was up 65 percent for the
year, while at the end of October it was up only about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is plagued by Y2K fears, as well as political
tremors. Mexico will hold a presidential election in 2000, and
though it should be peaceful, investors remember the disaster of
1994, which began with a candidate's assassination and ended with
the peso's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the markets should be more boring in 2000 than they
were from 1997 through 1999. That's not a bad way to start a new
century.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such boredom will be challenged by the blaring
trumpets of the U.S. presidential election. But as long as Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan stays in good health,
investors will likely shrug off the noise. &QL;

   A funny thing happened on the way to the millennium: prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The world's economies grew stronger, not weaker. After a
disastrous 1998, when Asia imploded and Russian assets evaporated,
most pros bet that 1999 would be another year of global gloom.
Prominent brokerage houses forecast a recession in the U.S. _
wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risk to the world economy today is not recession but
excessive growth, which spurs central bankers to apply higher
interest rates as a brake. At the end of October, the U.S.
Department of Commerce reported that gross domestic product grew
4.8 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, prophets of doom!
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, prospects may not be as uniformly sunny, but
there's plenty of good news. Japan, for example, is finally getting
off its knees. Last winter, the Nikkei still looked sick at 14,000
or so (about a third its 1989 peak), and the GDP was actually
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Nikkei has gained 36 percent through October (in
U.S.-dollar terms). The government has cut income taxes, and
Japanese CEOs have started trimming fat payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Nissan and Mitsubishi announced major restructuring
deals in order to attract foreign investors and achieve
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan grinds forward, it will pull its neighbors along with
it. South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia have already bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark stock indexes of South Korea and Indonesia have
jumped, respectively, about 48 percent and 45 percent through
October. Even Malaysia, which panicked and placed capital controls
on foreign investors, has enjoyed a 28 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 crisis created a lot of wreckage, but it also forced
banks to allocate credit more efficiently, rather than on the
nepotistic basis of who owes a favor to the prime minister's
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   When Asia collapsed in 1997-98, global commodity prices
collapsed, too. The stock prices for such leading Canadian
companies as Inco, the world's largest nickel producer, fell down
the mine shaft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Commodities Research Bureau commodity price index
plunged almost 20 percent. But in the past six months, stronger
Asian economies _ which buy raw materials from countries like
Canada _ have lit a fire under commodities and under Canadian
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has not done so well. Because the new euro began the year
with a belly flop that wiped out 12 percent of its value, most U.S.
investors have not made money on euroland stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This will change if the new European Central Bank, which to date
looks more like a rabble than a coherent group of decision makers,
achieves some credibility in its second year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though economies are recovering there and GDP is likely to
grow faster than 2 percent in 2000, big question marks hang over
the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is not yet a clear winner, either. In June, I
warned that the Mexican market had jumped too high too quickly and
was due for a big pullback. In May it was up 65 percent for the
year, while at the end of October it was up only about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is plagued by Y2K fears, as well as political
tremors. Mexico will hold a presidential election in 2000, and
though it should be peaceful, investors remember the disaster of
1994, which began with a candidate's assassination and ended with
the peso's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the markets should be more boring in 2000 than they
were from 1997 through 1999. That's not a bad way to start a new
century.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such boredom will be challenged by the blaring
trumpets of the U.S. presidential election. But as long as Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan stays in good health,
investors will likely shrug off the noise. &QL;

THE INS AND OUTS OF DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ When Pat Buchanan quit the Republican Party this
fall and started running for president as a Reformer, he darkly
threatened a legal war with the one entity that has earned the
public's trust in presidential politics _ the Commission on
Presidential Debates. Include me in this fall's general election
debates if I'm the third party's nominee, Buchanan warned, or I'll
sue.
</P>
<P>
   The next words out of Buchanan's relentlessly working mouth
several days later on the subject were quite different. This time,
he said that if 15 percent of the likely electorate has warmed to
his message in the national polls, the commission will be forced by
the political facts of life to include him.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Buchanan was recognizing legal reality. Despite all
manner of legal and political obstacles, the commission's track
record is perfect. The courts have without fail upheld the
bipartisan organization's statutory authority as well as its
exercise of that authority. It is regarded as scrupulously fair
legally because in fact that's what it is.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan was also recognizing political reality, broadly
defined. The general election debates are now legitimately special.
They have the feel of finality as the country nears its decision.
And their essence is the credible impression that on stage are the
only people with a ``chance'' to be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are trying to make the same point about intra-party
debates as the Republicans' and Democrats' nominating caucuses and
primaries approach, and they're wrong. It's bad enough that a
battle for big shots' big bucks has become the field-winnowing
first primary of the season; to have elites further limit the
nomination contest would be an abomination, further tarnishing the
meaning of the prize.
</P>
<P>
   As the preparations were being made for Monday night's GOP
affair in the big civic center complex that graces downtown here,
what was in the air was the faint whiff of instability. This is a
party with multiple factions _ social conservatives, economic
conservatives, moderates, and populists. Each of these factions
challenges the front-runners intellectually and personally, as well
as for actual votes. They are integral elements of the testing
process that can confer legitimacy on the ultimate decision of
voters, not to mention the entertainment and political value of a
trenchant question or challenging answer.
</P>
<P>
   To throw out Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, or Orrin Hatch at this
point _ as some Republicans who prefer order too much argue _ would
be to impose a choice more than to clarify one.
</P>
<P>
   There is irony, to be sure. George W. Bush has a right to wonder
at the odd elements of democracy as they have affected his alleged
juggernaut. When he was more or less hiding, his position was seen
as unassailable by a political community in love with and blinded
by money and endorsements. As he descended from Olympus,
perceptions have changed.
</P>
<P>
   That's tough, but fair, and even the most order-fixated
Republican must agree that it's better to find out what a
front-runner is made of now than smack in the middle of the general
election. It's better to let all the excited Republican people
outside the hall here waving signs for their guy know that he has a
chance to be heard inside the hall and on television.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks _ just as decision time nears in Iowa and New
Hampshire _ the debate commission is planning to unveil its
all-important criteria for inclusion in the fall debates. The
likelihood is that they may change some from 1992 and 1996,
primarily toward something easier for the public to understand,
more nearly automatic, and less subject to interpretation, but
still focused on the only question that should matter come
September _ can Candidate X be president or at least deny the
others an Electoral College victory?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, with the Federal Elections Commission doing the
formal certifying, the statutory requirement of objectivity
included 11 criteria used by the debate commission's advisory
panel. Chaired by the greatest of all the presidential scholars,
Harvard's emeritus professor Richard Neustadt, they focused on the
Electoral College. That meant that as Neustadt did his work before
each debate, the key question was whether a candidate was in
realistic position to win any state.
</P>
<P>
   That question may change toward some simpler point about
national poll standings (Buchanan's 15 percent ain't bad), but the
fundamental point about electability or ability to deny victory to
the others should remain. The danger always lurks that a low bar
will prompt one of the so-called major party nominees to balk at
participating, as Jimmy Carter did with John Anderson 20 years ago
when the League of Women Voters was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Ross Perot spent May and June in a tie with George Bush
and Bill Clinton. Even in the fall, hovering near 20 percent, he
was in position to matter. Four years later, with half his support
gone, he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, the debate commission has been co-chaired by the
same selfless Republican (Frank Fahrenkopf) and the same selfless
Democrat (Paul Kirk) and run by the same dedicated Republican,
Janet Brown.
</P>
<P>
   They have put on great shows. They have gradually gotten rid of
preening reporter panels and substituted questions from citizens,
as well as direct exchanges among the candidates. Their research
shows the public sees the debates as ``theirs,'' not the parties'.
</P>
<P>
   We should all hope this continues through another election
cycle.
</P>

JERUSALEM INSPIRES DELUSIONS ALONG WITH FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Lost souls wander the ancient pathways of the Old
City here convinced they are the Son of God, or at least one of his
prophets.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe they are John the Baptist, others the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   All of them suffer from the ``Jerusalem Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches, the number of people afflicted
with the psychological disorder is growing, said Dr. Yair Carlos
Bar-El, who is called the world's leading expert on it.
</P>
<P>
   In his office at Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center on the
outskirts of Jerusalem, he treats on average 30 acute cases a year
of travelers who become overwhelmed by the religious significance
of Jerusalem and descend into a delusional state in which they
assume the personalities of biblical characters.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming year, he expects that number will triple.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, he is up to 50 cases this year, and the flood
of 3.2 million tourists expected to visit the Holy Land for the
millennium is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the syndrome exhibit well-known signs, such as
purification acts, obsessive bathing, or wrapping themselves in
white sheets (typically taken from the hotels where they are
staying). Often, they end up disrupting prayer services at one or
another holy site, screaming about the wages of sin.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction of one percent of the tourists who come will
experience psychiatric problems brought on by the emotion of
visiting the holy sites, he said. But that will add up to roughly
3,000 cases of emotional distress among religious travelers in the
city over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   He said sufferers usually fit into one of three broad
categories:
</P>
<P>
   --Some are are mentally stable at home but develop emotional
problems triggered by something in the experience of visiting the
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   --Some arrive intent on bringing about a specific biblical
prophecy. They are typically passive but feel that they are called
to come.
</P>
<P>
   --Those in the third group, which most precisely fits the
clinical definition of ``Jerusalem Syndrome,'' typically come as
normal religious tourists, often travelling alone. During the
journey, they develop a belief that they have been called to take a
role in a prophecy or, in some cases, that they are the
reincarnation of a biblical character, often the Virgin Mary or
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Although occasionally people of other faiths develop such
symptoms, Bar-El said, it is mostly a phenomenon among Christians,
especially those in evangelical Protestant denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-El has been helping Israeli police and tour guides
understand what to expect in the way of mental aberrations among
the pilgrims, but he said their training has been limited and
insufficient to deal with the coming onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be capable of detecting these cases, to find them
early,'' he said. ``We have told authorities loudly that more needs
to be done, but our protests have gone unheard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time'' is the stuff of fairy tales, not corporate
histories. But that is how Stora Enso Oyj introduces its saga, and
for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish company is as old as the millennium. That makes it
one of the oldest companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock is also well worth buying, industry analysts say.
Stora joined forces a year ago with Enso Oyj of Finland to create
Europe's biggest paper maker.
</P>
<P>
   The combined group is taking advantage of record-low inventories
around the world and raising prices. At the same time, it is
divesting itself of 2 billion ($2.04 billion) worth of utility
assets in a bid to overtake International Paper Co. and become the
top paper maker in the word.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a story, not only because Stora is so old but also
because its history so well illustrates the ongoing struggle in
Europe between public and private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Stora traces its origins to Stora Kopparberget, or the Great
Copper Mountain, in Falun, Sweden. The mine was first worked at
some time between 850 and 1080.
</P>
<P>
   A Deed of Exchange dated 1288 and signed by the king bequeathed
an eighth part in the mine to the diocese of Bishop Peter of
Vasteras in exchange for a farm complete with mills, fields,
pastures, fishing rights and forests.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a great success, at least not at first. In 1347, King
Magnus Eriksson issued a charter following a disappointing visit to
the mine. The charter, which is one of the oldest surviving
documents of its kind in Sweden, details the poor conditions in and
around the mine and outlines a new management and wage structure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1360, a few years after the Black Plague struck the mine in
force, the king supplemented the charter with a Mining Statute.
This allowed master miners to mine ore in proportion to the number
of smelters they owned.
</P>
<P>
   It also determined the sequence of work. At this point,
according to Stora research, the mine emerges as a truly corporate
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   This was obviously a success _ so much so that in 1396 Queen
Margareta reasserted the crown's right to the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Stora Kopparberget thrived through most of the 15th century. A
guild was formed, with St. Orjan as the patron saint. By this time,
the miners probably mined more than 2,000 ship's pounds of copper a
year, according to preserved Lubeck accounts. That is about 300,000
kilograms. Almost all of Swedish copper was sold through Lubeck and
through the Hanseatic League.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of a pump driven by a water wheel gave the mine a
new lease on life in 1556. King Gustav Vasa was enthusiastic about
the new technology but had trouble with master miners who refused
to abandon their traditional working methods.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, by the beginning of the 17th century, all the
mine's chambers were being worked as one, systematically utilized
unit, enabling Sweden to surpass Germany in production and refining
and dominate the European copper market.
</P>
<P>
   A copper mint was the next step, just in time for Sweden's move
to a copper monetary standard. For more than 200 years, all of
Sweden's copper coinage was minted in nearby Avesta. The biggest
coin was the 10 daler piece, which weighed almost 20 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Mining copper ore required enormous amounts of wood. In 1648, a
trading company was formed to transport wood to Falun, which by
this time had become a town.
</P>
<P>
   The mining thrived and work went on all day and night. The pits
went deeper and deeper and the walls between the chambers became
thinner and thinner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1687 they caved in. Extraordinarily, no one was hurt. All of
Stora Kopparberget's miners were above ground, celebrating
Midsummer. Indeed, the cave-in exposed hidden ore and created a
tourist attraction, the Great Pit. It was a stroke of great luck in
what were otherwise bleak lives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1734 the Swedish scientist Carl von Linne visited the mine
and called it the greatest marvel in Sweden but ``as terrible as
hell itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Forestry became increasingly important and, by the late 1800s,
generated more than half of Stora's income. Associated works also
produced silver, sulfuric acid, newsprint and red paint (which,
according to legend, followed the discovery of iron deposits by a
Finnish shepherd boy when his billy-goat, Kare, returned home with
red horns).
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish crown's direct authority over the mine came to an
end in 1862 and the mine and the various individual works were
combined into one company, Stora Kopparbergs Bergslag. In 1885,
Stora became a limited company. The nominal capital was 9.6 million
kronor.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Stora was a rapidly growing company with
interests in market pulp, sawn goods, newsprint and electricity as
well as mining. But in 1990, the company decided to focus
exclusively on its most profitable sector, forest products, and in
November 1998 it completed its merger with rival paper maker Enso.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stora Enso has 40,000 employees around the world. It is
listed on the Helsinki and Stockholm exchanges and has market value
of about 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stora seems to have made the right choice. Chile, which now
produces most of the world's copper, has been forced into recession
by low copper prices.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, forest products and paper in particular are ripe
for significant growth, industry analysts said. Pent-up demand from
the recovering economies of Asia and the need to replenish low
inventories in Europe and North America will enable Stora Enso to
boost both prices and supply over the next few years, they said.
</P>
<P>
   There could even be a sudden, sharp surge in demand from
magazines and newspapers that want to mark the millennium with
features, the analysts said.
</P>

   Fox had a well-rounded NFL pregame show Sunday, with highlights
and zany antics as usual, but also news and solid commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw had the scoop of the weekend. According to him,
Redskins owner Daniel Snyder told six veteran players to do
whatever it took to win against the Arizona Cardinals, even if it
meant not listening to their coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wrong,'' Bradshaw said. ``That's not how you lead a
football team to victory. That's not good for Norv Turner, and if I
were Norv, I would drag Snyder in a room and have a few words with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Host James Brown and analyst Cris Collinsworth had an
interesting discussion about race, prompted by an interview of
Kerry Collins, the New York Giants quarterback who has been accused
of making racist comments in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Collinsworth told viewers, ``Race relations are one thing that
no one wants to talk about, but it can destroy a football team
faster than any other thing I know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times a coach doesn't even know what's going on in
the locker room. One problem is that sometimes black players can
say things to each other that if a white tries to say the same
thing, it's over. That team is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a little bit like blaming the victim. Brown picked up on
that theme, saying, ``I think your point is well taken. Often times
you will hear black players say some things to other black
ballplayers. It's my belief that no matter what, if it's racial in
nature it's not to be said by a black to a black, much less a white
to a black. I think you ought to just stay away from it, period. No
matter who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the usually lighthearted crew moved beyond the world of
sports and tried to deal with a serious topic.

   With their amazingly long necks, spindly legs, and spotted
exteriors, giraffes are curious creatures indeed. Here, from
Classic Encounters, which conducts safaris and other travel to
southern Africa, are some fascinating facts about giraffes:
</P>
<P>
   --They are the tallest land mammals, averaging 10 feet high with
8-foot necks.
</P>
<P>
   --When born, they average 6 feet tall and weigh about 130
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   --They sleep (standing up) for about five minutes at a time and
average a mere 20 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   --Adults can eat up to 140 pounds of foliage a day.
</P>
<P>
   --Their markings are as unique as human fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   --If water is nearby, they'll drink it. But they can go for
weeks without water.

They were fakes, of course, but the crowds loved them, and the
museums gave rise to circus sideshows. In addition to the
``preserved'' devil man and monkey woman, the museum contains
hundreds of ersatz oddities, including the ``Lip of a Lion Shot by
Teddy Roosevelt'' (in reality a scrap of cooked liver) and the

WAIT-AND-SEA-CHANGE IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The conventional wisdom is that the collapse of World Trade
Organization talks last week was a grave setback to hopes for
further expansion of global trade. It seems unlikely that this is
the case. But the real direction of march won't be clear for at
least another year.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the five-day bout of street theater in Seattle, most
trade professionals had concluded that the talks were unlikely to
go forward in 1999 in any public way, owing to two uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   One was obvious: the coming US election. The other is slightly
less so: the advent of the Internet, with all its uncertainties for
the conduct of global business.
</P>
<P>
   Why an administration that won two mighty trade liberalizations
early in its first term didn't make that same calculation and
scuttle the talks _ or at least not fan the tinderbox flames _ is
one of those riddles that awaits the next high-level insider book
by Bob Woodward of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, it was some combination of political paralysis and
battle fatigue. The desire to give Al Gore's candidacy a boost
clearly contributed to the debacle, in which President Clinton
seemed to throw his weight behind sanctions demanded by American
labor unions against nations violating arbitary labor and
environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   But the snappy answer Clinton gave after the fact at a White
House press conference packed more persuasive power than anything
he said to the delegates or the newspapers in Seattle:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years from now, we'll all take it for granted that we've
come a long way in integrating trade and the environment and labor.
That's what I think and what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   That next round of negotiations _ when it comes _ will not bear
Clinton's name.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the sea change that occurred in Seattle. It
had less to do with the hundreds of bottom-up nonovernmental
organizations whose members converged on the city than it did with
the top-down sentiments of the trade ministers who witnessed the
``battle in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the United States has been the leading proponent
of a fair global trading game. This year, ``the inchoate feeling of
many developing countries became a little more sharp, their sense
that somehow we were trying to capture it for our own advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the judgement of Columbia University professor Jagdish
Bhagwati. He spent five days in Seattle, jousting with various
critics of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the emphasis we put on services, agriculture, where we
are exporters, they saw the US as increasingly trying to caputure
markets for its own producers. Meanwhile, we were essentially
unwilling to give up anything on the import side.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, European nations hestitated to support
American bargaining positions, at least partly because they feared
subtle attempts to stack the deck in favor of e-commerce trading
practices. The Internet was for the most part developed in the
United States, and American manufacturing and software companies
possess considerable advantages.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wanted is a clearer signal of American intentions in
the years to come _ in the form of a 2000 election that clarifies
the nature f the consensus under which the United states is to be
governed.
</P>
<P>
   All four major candidates _ Bill Bradley, George W. Bush, Al
Gore and John McCain _ are deeply avowed free-traders, though Gore
probably is more beholden to union wishes than the others. Somewhat
less clear is the position of each on the landmark issue of
taxation of Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is what kind of Congress will arrive in
Washington with the new president. The loss of as few as five seats
by the Republicans would give the Democrats control of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party resistance to the North American Free Trade
Agreement and the ratification of the Uruguay Round _ both
championed forcefully by President Clinton _ contributed to the GOP
landslide and the loss of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that the rest of the world is unwilling to
follow the US lead down a road whose route markings are not yet
clear.

<P>
   And the God of Materialism looked down upon the world at
Christmastime and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the world's children glued to their television sets, the
glow of action-packed advertising washing over their eager little
faces.
</P>
<P>
   He heard them thinking: ``I want that! I want that too! I want
that! And that! And that!''
</P>
<P>
   And he knew that his creative disciples in advertising offices
around the globe had been hard at work this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The God of Materialism knew that to hook customers for life you
had to brainwash them very young.
</P>
<P>
   You had to hit them hard and hit them again.
</P>
<P>
   How else could you ensure that they would pester mom and dad for
the hottest kiddie creature, game, or device?
</P>
<P>
   And don't just give them kids' advertising. Hit them with the
adult ads. Then they'll be sure to badger dad until the old man
buys the cool car they saw streaking across the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   The God of Materialism had recently called upon professor James
McNeal, the guru of kid advertising at Texas A&AMP;M University. McNeal
explained that parents are giving their children ever greater
influence over family buying decisions, to assuage their guilt for
their time-starved schedules. McNeal estimated that kids ages 4 to
14 have a decided impact on the brand, size, color and style of
cars purchased.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he discovered that the average 10-year-old has
memorized as many as 400 brand names. When kids beg their parents
for a product, he said, they name the item by its brand 92 percent
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The God of Materialism was most gratified to learn that
advertising targeting children had grown 15 to 20 percent a year
for the past six or seven years.
</P>
<P>
   When the God of Materialism left McNeal, he smiled again.
</P>
<P>
   But as he surveyed his world from his perch on high, his eye
fell on a troubling sight. In parts of Europe, he saw kids seated
cross-legged before their television sets _ but sin of sins! _ no
glow of advertising lighted up their little faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of humans are these?'' He cried. ``Certainly not
created in my image!''
</P>
<P>
   The God of Materialism summoned the Angel of Advertising for an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please forgive me, your highness,'' the angel began. ``But I
have discovered an unsavory fact: It is against the law in Sweden
to run TV advertising targeted at children who are less than 12
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The God of Materialism swallowed hard. ``Go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets worse, I'm afraid,'' the angel said. ``It's the same
in Norway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Christmas still comes to these places?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Belgium, advertising to kids is banned in some parts of the
country near the time of children's programming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A crime against humanity!'' the God of Materialism huffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denmark, Poland and Ireland are also thinking about cracking
down on kids' advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to bring this before the International Tribunal in
the Hague!'' cried the God of Materialsim.
</P>
<P>
   The Angel of Advertising continued:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swedish government did a study several years ago that
showed children who were 7 or younger could not distinguish between
ads and programming. It also showed that older kids didn't
understand the intent of commericals. Do you want to know what the
head of Sweden's consumer agency said about TV advertising?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I must.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It is considered that it is not a fair way of
dealing with very small consumers, because they are being
exploited.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The God of Materialism fell silent. Then, in a weak voice, he
said: ``I'm depressed. I'm going shopping.''

THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF CEARA IS A BEACH BUFF'S PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORTALEZA, Brazil _ If life is a beach, as bumper stickers
claim, then this is definitely the place to live it up.
</P>
<P>
   Fortaleza is the capital, largest city, and chief port of the
state of Ceara (pronounced Say-AH-Rah)in the northeast corner of
Brazil, a region where bright sunshine is the rule and rain a
rarity. Ceara's 350-mile-long coastline is a necklace of more than
120 beaches, most backed by dramatic sand dunes or towering rock
formations and each seemingly more beautiful than the next.
</P>
<P>
   One of Brazil's most thinly populated states _ much of the vast
interior is grazing land with lots of cattle but very few people _
Ceara was virtually a tourist-free zone until fairly recently. No
longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, Brazilians _ who savor beaches the way the French
do wine _ began flocking here from the overcrowded and
problem-plagued cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. They were
drawn by the terrific beaches and consistently great weather
(temperatures average in the mid-80s year round) but also the
easygoing and hassle-free lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The state is now the number one vacation destination for
Brazilians and also attracts about a million foreign visitors a
year, mostly other Latin Americans and Europeans. North Americans
have been slow to discover Ceara but that appears about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Varig, the Brazilian national air carrier, now offers weekly
nonstop service to Fortaleza from Miami, a six-hour flight away.
And, construction of a $100 million cruise ship terminal designed
specifically to accommodate the new generation of megaships will
begin in a year or so. When the terminal is completed, in mid-2003,
Fortaleza seems certain to become an important cruise port.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of major destination status, Fortaleza, which
has a population of about 2 million, has been given a civic
makeover. Major new additions include a convention center,
international airport, and an impressive cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Several deluxe hotels have also opened, most like the five-star
Caesar Park and Othon Palace along Avenida Kennedy, the beachside
boulevard that functions as a sort of al fresco living room for the
city. The boulevard is about three miles long and a promenade for
much of its length. There are wide sidewalks for strolling, as well
as seafood restaurants, playgrounds, performance spaces, and
facilities for exercise, from weight lifting to soccer all spaced
along it.
</P>
<P>
   The western end of the avenue is the scene of a nightly crafts
fair, with more than 100 stalls selling such local specialties as
lace, woodcarving, cashews nuts (the state's main cash crop), and
the potent local sugar cane rum. There is also a distinctive Ceara
handicraft: small bottles filled with colored sand worked into
artful pictures and designs.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the avenue, however, the action is in early
morning. That's when fishermen start unloading their catch and the
city's beachside fish market opens for business.
</P>
<P>
   The fish market is a colorful scene with dozens of vendors
setting up their stalls under the trees rimming the beach, which
also shelter fishermen mending nets and working on their boats.
Most of the boats are ``jangadas,'' flat-bottomed and square-prowed
wooden craft that look like glorified rafts and are powered only by
a large triangular sail.
</P>
<P>
   Unique to Ceara, the primitive but colorfully painted and
remarkably seaworthy jangada is a beloved local symbol. So also is
the city's most notable landmark building, Theatro Jose de Alanca,
a wonderfully ornate old theater built during a boom period at the
turn of the century and flaunting an impressive cast-iron facade
imported from Scotland, of all unlikely places. Fortaleza is an old
city, founded in the early 17th century, and retains the neat grid
street pattern of an old Portuguese town. However, the city has few
colonial relics other than the remains of the fort for which it's
named. But examples of local arts and handicrafts, which reflect
both Portuguese colonial and native Indian influences, can be seen
in shops and museums.
</P>
<P>
   In an engaging bit of recycling, the old city jail, a bastille
dating from the 1820s, has been turned into a crafts center where
you can buy lace, pottery, twig furniture, hand-woven hammocks, and
the like. The building also houses the Museum of Popular Culture,
which has a first-rate arts and crafts collection, particularly of
religious sculptures. There is a similar but even more extensive
collection on display in the art gallery of the new cultural
center, a complex of buildings that include several theaters and a
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural life requires buildings, but in Fortaleza social life
is very much an outdoor activity _ and for that a beach will do
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The two beaches along Avenida Kennedy, Mucuripe and Meireles,
are in the heart of the city and get more use than probably any
others in the state. As everywhere in Ceara, the sand here is like
talcum powder and the water incredibly warm. Fortaleza is on the
Atlantic but just below the equator and blessed with average ocean
temperatures that New Englanders, anyway, generally associate with
bathtubs rather than beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Mucuripe and Meireles are good beaches by international
standards but considered only so-so by finicky Brazilians. Praia do
Futurio (Future Beach) is generally ranked Fortaleza's best beach,
not only for its three miles of scrumptious sand but also for its
seafood restaurants, many selling fresh shrimp and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   The happy custom in Fortaleza is for restaurants and clubs in a
different part of the city to organize and host an event of some
sort every night of the week. Here, life is also a party. On
Thursdays the scene is at Future Beach where oceanfront restaurants
all offer fresh cooked crabs at bargain prices, along with free
entertainment that usually includes terrific local musicians and
terrible local comedians.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night belongs to Iracema Beach and more specifically to
LaPirata, a large open-air disco that stages what it boasts is the
wildest rave on the planet. There are no closing hours in Brazil
and dancing to the pulsing rhythms of the Samba and Ceara's own
regional dance, the Forro (a fusion of traditional Brazilian and
American popular music), goes on until dawn. Contributing to the
high energy level is ``caipirinha,'' the punch-packing Brazilian
national drink, made of distilled white rum mixed with lime juice,
sugar, and crushed ice.
</P>
<P>
   Other interesting beaches are just outside town. Porto das
Dunas, 12 miles east of the city, is the home of Beach Park, the
largest aqua theme park in Latin America. The park also boasts the
world's tallest waterslide, the appropriately named ``Insanity,'' a
terrifying 134-foot drop that ends in a very large splash.
</P>
<P>
   Cambuco, 26 miles west of Fortaleza, is a long stretch of golden
sand watched over by dunes up to 40 feet high that have been
sculpted by the winds into fantasical shapes. In between the dunes
are fresh-water lagoons, some big enough for water skiing. Dune
buggy rides are a popular recreation at Cambuco and so is dune
surfing: sliding down steep dunes on surfboards.
</P>
<P>
   Morro Branco, some 50 miles east of the capital, is one of the
beaches that craftspeople go to for the colored sands used in
bottle paintings. It is surrounded by high, multicolored cliffs _
there are 12 shades of reds and browns _ that are pierced by caves
and canyons.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you go east from Fortaleza along the Sunrise Coast
or west on the highway paralleling the Sunset Coast, the route will
take you by one splendid and distinctive beach after another. Some
are ideal for windsurfing or surfboarding, others perfect for
chilling out and working on that tan. And others are just great to
look at.
</P>
<P>
   The farther you get from Fortaleza in either direction the
longer and lonelier the beaches seem to get. Scattered along both
coasts, however, are little fishing villages, most untouched by
tourism but some with pleasant little bed-and- breakfast inns
called ``pousadas,'' which attract an international clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Best known of these out-of-the-way havens for sophisticated
beach bums are Canoa Quebrada, about 100 miles east of the capital,
and Jericoacoara (known as Jeri), more than 200 miles and a day's
drive down the Sunset Coast. Both still have unpaved streets and
are accessed only by dune buggy or over dirt roads. But as far as
some beach purists are concerned, there are alarming signs of
encroaching civilization, among them the fact that (gasp!) a power
line was run into Jeri this year.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it may be time to start looking for another remote,
spectacularly beautiful and still undiscovered beach. No problem.
After all, this is Ceara.

THE INS AND OUTS OF DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ When Pat Buchanan quit the Republican Party this
fall and started running for president as a Reformer, he darkly
threatened a legal war with the one entity that has earned the
public's trust in presidential politics _ the Commission on
Presidential Debates. Include me in this fall's general election
debates if I'm the third party's nominee, Buchanan warned, or I'll
sue.
</P>
<P>
   The next words out of Buchanan's relentlessly working mouth
several days later on the subject were quite different. This time,
he said that if 15 percent of the likely electorate has warmed to
his message in the national polls, the commission will be forced by
the political facts of life to include him.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Buchanan was recognizing legal reality. Despite all
manner of legal and political obstacles, the commission's track
record is perfect. The courts have without fail upheld the
bipartisan organization's statutory authority as well as its
exercise of that authority. It is regarded as scrupulously fair
legally because in fact that's what it is.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan was also recognizing political reality, broadly
defined. The general election debates are now legitimately special.
They have the feel of finality as the country nears its decision.
And their essence is the credible impression that on stage are the
only people with a ``chance'' to be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are trying to make the same point about intra-party
debates as the Republicans' and Democrats' nominating caucuses and
primaries approach, and they're wrong. It's bad enough that a
battle for big shots' big bucks has become the field-winnowing
first primary of the season; to have elites further limit the
nomination contest would be an abomination, further tarnishing the
meaning of the prize.
</P>
<P>
   As the preparations were being made for Monday night's GOP
affair in the big civic center complex that graces downtown here,
what was in the air was the faint whiff of instability. This is a
party with multiple factions _ social conservatives, economic
conservatives, moderates, and populists. Each of these factions
challenges the front-runners intellectually and personally, as well
as for actual votes. They are integral elements of the testing
process that can confer legitimacy on the ultimate decision of
voters, not to mention the entertainment and political value of a
trenchant question or challenging answer.
</P>
<P>
   To throw out Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, or Orrin Hatch at this
point _ as some Republicans who prefer order too much argue _ would
be to impose a choice more than to clarify one.
</P>
<P>
   There is irony, to be sure. George W. Bush has a right to wonder
at the odd elements of democracy as they have affected his alleged
juggernaut. When he was more or less hiding, his position was seen
as unassailable by a political community in love with and blinded
by money and endorsements. As he descended from Olympus,
perceptions have changed.
</P>
<P>
   That's tough, but fair, and even the most order-fixated
Republican must agree that it's better to find out what a
front-runner is made of now than smack in the middle of the general
election. It's better to let all the excited Republican people
outside the hall here waving signs for their guy know that he has a
chance to be heard inside the hall and on television.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks _ just as decision time nears in Iowa and New
Hampshire _ the debate commission is planning to unveil its
all-important criteria for inclusion in the fall debates. The
likelihood is that they may change some from 1992 and 1996,
primarily toward something easier for the public to understand,
more nearly automatic, and less subject to interpretation, but
still focused on the only question that should matter come
September _ can Candidate X be president or at least deny the
others an Electoral College victory?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, with the Federal Elections Commission doing the
formal certifying, the statutory requirement of objectivity
included 11 criteria used by the debate commission's advisory
panel. Chaired by the greatest of all the presidential scholars,
Harvard's emeritus professor Richard Neustadt, they focused on the
Electoral College. That meant that as Neustadt did his work before
each debate, the key question was whether a candidate was in
realistic position to win any state.
</P>
<P>
   That question may change toward some simpler point about
national poll standings (Buchanan's 15 percent ain't bad), but the
fundamental point about electability or ability to deny victory to
the others should remain. The danger always lurks that a low bar
will prompt one of the so-called major party nominees to balk at
participating, as Jimmy Carter did with John Anderson 20 years ago
when the League of Women Voters was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Ross Perot spent May and June in a tie with George Bush
and Bill Clinton. Even in the fall, hovering near 20 percent, he
was in position to matter. Four years later, with half his support
gone, he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, the debate commission has been co-chaired by the
same selfless Republican (Frank Fahrenkopf) and the same selfless
Democrat (Paul Kirk) and run by the same dedicated Republican,
Janet Brown.
</P>
<P>
   They have put on great shows. They have gradually gotten rid of
preening reporter panels and substituted questions from citizens,
as well as direct exchanges among the candidates. Their research
shows the public sees the debates as ``theirs,'' not the parties'.
</P>
<P>
   We should all hope this continues through another election
cycle.

WHO'S THE NEXT EMC? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chances are you didn't have EMC stock in your portfolio when the
decade began. Why would you?
</P>
<P>
   The Hopkinton, Mass. high-tech company was small and struggling.
A year earlier, its chairman and president had vowed to go without
pay until the money-losing operation returned to profitability.
EMC's chief competitor was IBM Corp., then and now the world's
biggest computer company. Its business, computer storage, wasn't
even recognized as a distinct market.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for you. If you had invested in EMC Corp. back then, you
would be one very rich individual today. A dollar invested in EMC
on Jan. 1, 1990, is worth nearly $700 today. Put another way, an
investment of $1,500 would have translated into just over $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   EMC was the top-performing Massachusetts stock in the 1990s. It
had some serious competition for the number one spot, however. CMGI
Inc., the Andover Internet incubator, went public at the beginning
of 1994, and a dollar invested in it at the beginning would be
worth more than $600 today.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of our top ten stocks aren't in that league. In the
past 10 years, they increased in value between 16- and 34-fold.
Even in this age of wildly heightened expectations about the stock
market, that's still a pretty fair performance.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of our top ten companies are in electronics. Biogen Corp.
is in health care, Staples Inc. is in retailing and Oak Industries
Inc. is a traditional manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   What else can you say about the top companies? Either through
luck or foresight, they were in position to take advantage of some
of the key trends of the decade. For EMC, it was the explosion of
data storage; for CMGI, the mushrooming of the Internet. For Analog
Devices, it was the boom in communications; for Staples, it was the
enormous growth in small business and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   But just being in the right business wasn't enough. In many
cases, these companies had to be willing to drop what they were
doing and reinvent themselves. Some had to do it more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Take EMC. In 1990, the company canceled most of its products to
concentrate on one market: computer storage for mainframe
computers.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the decade, EMC owned the business. But chief
executive Michael Ruettgers wasn't content to rest on his laurels.
``Mike saw that mainframes were not going to be a growth area,''
says Mark Fredrickson, the company's director of corporate
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The action was moving to personal computers, and Ruettgers
pushed EMC, reluctantly at first, to head in that direction. More
recently, he has engineered another midcourse correction, away from
hardware and toward software. Judging by the stock price, his
creative destruction was just what the company needed.
</P>
<P>
   At Analog Devices in Norwood, the early '90s was a time of
soul-searching. The once high-flying company had crash-landed. The
main customers for its specialty chips _ the military and industry
_ held limited promise for future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do,'' chairman Ray Stata told his troops, ``is
change everything we do and how we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Analog did just that. Communications, a tiny fraction of sales
in 1990, is the biggest and fastest-growing part of Analog's
business today; military sales are far less important than they
once were.
</P>
<P>
   Analog's stock is up 20-fold in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Teradyne also started the decade on a low note.
Teradyne sells test equipment to the semiconductor industry. In the
early 1990s, much of that industry was moving to Japan _ and buying
equipment from Teradyne's chief competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Teradyne couldn't do much about that. ``But we decided we had to
stop thinking of ourselves as victims,'' says Thomas Newman, a
Teradyne vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The company embraced total quality management in a big way, a
decision that led to a raft of new products and a change in
corporate culture. When the American semiconductor business snapped
back, Teradyne was in perfect position to ride the wave.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was up 16-fold in the 1990s, missing the top 10 list
by a hair.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the top group, the stock of State Street Corp. was up
more than sixfold during the decade, a very impressive performance
for a company that did fabulously in the 1980s. Gillette stock was
up more than fivefold, even though it has lost ground over the past
year. Again, over the long haul, it has been a heck of an
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after a column of ours about EMC appeared, we
heard from a curious reader. She told us she had not had much luck
in the market and was looking for one good investment. ``Could you
please tell me what stock is likely to be the next EMC?'' she asked
in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great question. When we figure out the answer, you, our
readers, will be the first to know.

DID GUMBEL STUMBLE, OR IS HE SIMPLY THE SCAPEGOAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to get off Bryant's back.
</P>
<P>
   That's Bryant as in Gumbel, as in the co-host of CBS's ``The
Early Show,'' which is staggering on the ropes like a punch-drunk
fighter. After a mere seven weeks, the program intended to turn CBS
into a contender again in the morning-show sweepstakes, and make
NBC's ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America'' flinch, is
sinking faster than the Patriots' playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Its ratings, which were never anything to shout about, are in
free fall with ``The Early Show'' proving as hapless with viewers
as its predecessors. And last week, four staffers got the boot
after executive producer Steve Friedman said they weren't up to the
task of battling their competitors. Publicly, network wags are
downplaying what certainly looks like turmoil, saying that the show
just needs time to build an audience and work out the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   Said Friedman, ``It's like opening up a hamburger fast-food
restaurant across the street from McDonald's and Burger King. It's
takes time for people to say, `Maybe I ought to try that other
place.' ''
</P>
<P>
   CBS sunk $30 million into building a studio for ``that other
place,'' and so far they have precious little to show for it. So
now it's scapegoat time, and some eyes have quickly turned to the
man in the Joseph Abboud suits _ Bryant Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, there have been ominous whispers about the
so-called ``Gumbel factor.'' It usually goes a little something
like this: He's a smart newsman, a talented interviewer, but he's
also an arrogant and abrasive egomaniac whose mere presence, for
some viewers, is reason enough to reach for the remote.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this is new. For much of his career, Gumbel
has been dogged by stories about his mercurial nature and
less-than-gracious manner toward co-workers. Everyone remembers the
field day the tabloids had when a leaked memo found Gumbel, then
co-anchor of ``Today,'' dissing the morning show's weatherman
Willard Scott. There was so much hoopla one would have thought
Gumbel cursed the pope (who, by the way, he met without incident
while with ``Today'') rather than a goofy weatherman who once
dressed on-air as Carmen Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   And more recently, Gumbel didn't help his own cause when he made
what some believed to be veiled swipes at his former ``Today''
co-host Katie Couric in a New York Times Sunday Magazine article.
Without naming names, he seemed to imply that while he was no
choirboy, the famously perky Couric had pulled her fair share of
stupid diva tricks.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of things, coupled with Gumbel's healthy
self-confidence bordering on smugness, have led some to see the man
as some sort of unholy cross between Ted Bundy and Dennis Rodman.
Andrew Tyndall, whose Tyndall Report tracks network news shows,
told USA Today just two weeks after the premiere of ``The Early
Show,'' that it's ``a well-known fact that Gumbel alienates a
portion of the audience. Certain people cannot stand him. But CBS
knew that going in, and figured his strengths outweighed his
weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how no one seemed concerned about Gumbel's so-called
``weaknesses'' when he was co-anchoring ``Today,'' and the show was
handily beating any and all comers. And, while we're on the
subject, what ``weaknesses'' might those be? Would it be his
reputation for exhaustively researching interview subjects and
topics? Would it be the sharp, incisive interviews he conducts
whether he's talking to comedian Chris Rock, baseball exile Pete
Rose, or Lieutenant Steve May, an Arizona congressmen and gay Army
Reservist challenging the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those ``weaknesses'' refer to Gumbel's inability to be
an insubstantial Ken doll feigning giggles and gravity for two
hours each weekday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it could be something more insidious, which Gumbel, 51,
himself addressed in a USA Today profile a few years ago. Asked
about being labeled arrogant, he said, ``I do think there are a
great number of Americans who are more comfortable with blacks (as)
comics, jokesters, always laughing, never taking the world or
themselves too seriously. I can think of very few, if any,
African-American men in this business who were not accused of
arrogance. Do I think it's a coincidence? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it is less than amusing that Ted Koppel runs his
shop in a tight fashion and is concerned about the graphics,
concerned about who his producer is, gets tough with his director,
and that shows his professionalism, his attention to detail,''
Gumbel added. ``But if I do that, suddenly I'm a meddler, or I'm
arrogant, or I'm conceited, or I make enemies. I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel has long been one of television's best and brightest. He
may not be great to work around or for, but when the camera
flickers to life, he makes just about whatever he's doing better
because he's doing it. There hasn't been anyone better on the
morning shows for the past two decades, and that's why he was wooed
by a host of network suitors when he chose to leave NBC.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't think he can be playful, you've never seen him
interview the great Tracey Ullman.
</P>
<P>
   When something goes wrong in this high-stakes game, someone has
to get dumped on, and Gumbel's an easy, high-profile target.
(Oddly, little has been said about his co-host Jane Clayson, but
maybe that's because no one can remember her name long enough to
lob critical grenades at her.) Still, those who must cast blame for
the failings of ``The Early Show'' might start with the
knuckleheads who smothered any individuality it might have offered
out of the box when they opted for a cookie-cutter clone of its
competitors, right down the annoyingly ubiquitous storefront
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the program has its weaknesses, one of which is
being the newest kid on the fiercely competitve morning-show block.
But whatever his peccadilloes, Gumbel isn't one of them. In truth,
the ``Gumbel factor'' may be ``The Early Show's'' only and greatest
asset.

DEFINING `AFFAIR'? HAVE IT YOUR WAY

<P>
   Gentle readers, you did your best. We were hoping you could help
settle the debate between two friends over whether an affair
necessarily implied adultery, and you responded. But unlike last
year's survey on bring vs. take, this question brought nothing like
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   On the basic question of whether adultery was part of the
definition of affair, respondents _ whose ages ranged from 27 to 79
_ were evenly divided. But almost everyone felt the need for
further footnoting.
</P>
<P>
   ``An affair implies a situation with a short lifespan,'' wrote
28-year-old Jonathan, one of those who said adultery wasn't
necessarily part of the deal. ``A relationship is a stable
situation of indefinite duration. Affair implies an adventure from
which you return, like a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   But 64-year-old Joel thought a fling could also be too brief to
meet the definition: ``Many relationships are so transitory as to
hardly merit being called an affair.'' If you can't remember it, in
other words, it doesn't qualify.
</P>
<P>
   And when marriage is impossible, love affairs can go on for
years, becoming monuments to romance lived respectably: Look at
Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Thus Sarah, who's in her 50s,
calls her relationship with another woman a love affair, using love
as a declaration of exclusivity and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   For 34-year-old Mary, an affair involves deceit, but not
necessarily a marriage: ``It could be any relationship with an
implied commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of parity. ``When I confided to my
therapist that I was having an affair with a married man, she
corrected me by saying that `it is his affair, but your
relationship,' '' wrote 56-year-old Jean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Technique of the Love Affair,'' a 1928 guidebook for women
just reissued by Pantheon, shows that the definition has been
shifty for quite a while. In this precursor of 1995's ``The
Rules,'' the affair is not just about sex. Caution and coquetry are
essential on the road from ``flirtation' to ``light affair'' to
``serious affair,'' one that might even lead to marriage. But how
light is light, and what constitutes a ``lover''? Though the
liberated young flappers aren't saving themselves for marriage,
these terms remain open to interpretation. To fog the windshield
further, ``Technique'' was written in an era when ``making love''
could still mean simply flirting.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently words of love _ and sexual involvement _ are just too
culture- and context-bound to be pinned down. We use affair for
affairs both sordid and sweet, short and long, secret and public.
No wonder dictionaries keep it simple, with entries like ``an
amorous relationship between two people not married to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing has changed, though: We're less likely now to call an
event an affair, often substituting the unlovable function. We can
still describe a wedding reception as ``a grand affair,'' it's
true. But no longer do we see hotels issuing the invitation Durham
Caldwell saw on a billboard board decades ago: ``Have your next
affair at the Schine Inn!''

N.E. STATES MAY JOIN TO LOWER DRUG COSTS

 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number one health policy problem of the day _ the soaring
cost of prescription drugs _ is leading state officials and
consumer advocates to propose solutions once dismissed as radical.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and public officials are exploring the idea of
combining entire state populations, perhaps even all of New
England, into giant drug purchasing groups to wrest the deep
discounts and rebates that drug companies now grant only to favored
customers such as large HMOs and Medicaid programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative under active discussion is whether states
can find ways to legislate pharmaceutical price discounts of 20 to
40 percent _ in effect, price controls at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   Such proposals are considered quixotic in Washington, but many
state legislators say drug manufacturers have less clout at their
level.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, constituents upset about high pharmacy prices _ such
as politically potent elders _ have more direct access to local
legislators, which make the lawmakers more vulnerable to
grass-roots pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who is Vermont's Senate
president, said he and his colleagues can't go to the barber shop
or grocery store without hearing ``a lot of sad stories about
people who can't afford to buy their drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike members of Congress, he added, state legislators don't
have to raise multimillion-dollar campaign chests to get elected
and therefore don't depend on contributions from the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only makes sense, if Congress isn't going to do anything,
to explore how states can work together,'' Shumlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of concerted state action is catching fire in New
England as the best strategy to rein in prescription drug
expenditures rising by 15 percent a year. Pharmaceutical cost
increases are outstripping all other health sectors and threaten to
surpass total hospital expenditures in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of state activism are suddenly everywhere, driven by
pressure on elders with no drug coverage, on families that face
escalating HMO premiums, and on state spending for Medicaid and
drug-subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
   Shumlin plans to host a Thursday meeting in Montpelier of
legislative leaders and policy advisers from Massachusetts,
Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire to discuss how they might work
together to control the cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's strength in numbers,'' Shumlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts budget, passed last month, contains a
little-noticed mandate to create a drug-purchasing pool that could
encompass 25 percent of the Bay State's population. This fall,
California enacted a law that requires pharmacies to give discounts
of up to 40 percent to Medicare beneficiaries. Vermont is even
considering state-subsidized bus passes so residents could travel
to Montreal to buy drugs at about half of what it would cost in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators, health officials, and advocates have concluded
that state action to create large purchasing groups offers the
best, and simplest, approach. Prescription drug spending in the six
New England states totals an estimated $5.4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be done,'' said Judith Kurland, regional
director of the US Department of Health and Human Services for New
England. ``The health care purchasing power of the six New England
states, with our 13 1/2 million people, is comparable to all of
Canada's, with its 29 million population.''
</P>
<P>
   The region's proximity to Canada, where drug prices are set by
individual provinces, also makes for telling contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Danyow, a 78-year-old breast cancer patient from St.
Alban's, Vt., made the trip to Quebec last July with four other
women from her ``healing group'' to buy tamoxifen, a cancer drug
that costs about seven times more south of the border, according to
a recent study by Vermont officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a three-month supply for less than $50,'' Danyow said.
The average Vermont retail price for the same quantity of tamoxifen
is $388.74, according to the state study.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland has no power to implement a regional drug-purchasing
``buyer's club,'' as she calls it. But the state governments might,
even in the face of expected opposition from the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, industry representatives vow to fight state
legislation on prices. They say that all such proposals are based
on wrong-headed notions of why US drug prices are so much higher
than in Canada or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Powell, who handles government price control issues for
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, cited
one study that found half of the price difference between the
United States and Canada is because the two nations have disparate
laws on product liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the provisions that make our system so much of a lottery
don't exist in Canada,'' Powell said. She notes that Canada does
not have strict product liability laws, allow class-action law
suits, permit punitive damages, or allow lawyers to launch suits on
the prospect of large fees from eventual awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the pharmaceutical association,
added that government price controls in the United States would
slow manufacturers' ability to develop new life-saving drugs.
Opponents criticize that claim, noting that drug companies spend
more on marketing and administration than they do on research and
development, reap the benefits of government-sponsored research,
and have plenty of room in their profit margins to fund new product
development.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's approach is more coverage for drugs ``rather than
government-imposed price constraints,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many states have focused recently on expanding coverage
to targeted populations, such as low-income elders and uninsured
families. But many are realizing these initiatives can't continue
if drug prices keep rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state simply cannot afford to subsidize the drug companies
without limits,'' said Geoffrey Wilkinson, executive director of
Massachusetts Senior Action Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy price trends, for instance, will crucially affect the
feasibility of a Massachusetts plan to design an insurance program
to cover catastrophically high pharmacy costs for all elders _ an
effort mandated by the recent budget legislation. Untrammeled price
inflation, analysts say, would drive premiums so high that elders
could be discouraged from buying coverage when they are healthier,
offsetting the costs of heavier users.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' current budget includes a mechanism to negotiate
pharmaceutical prices on behalf of a group that will include
Medicaid recipients; low-income elders in the state's Senior
Pharmacy program; state, county, and municipal employees; and those
who are uninsured or underinsured.
</P>
<P>
   These groups may add up to 1.6 million people, or 1 in 4 Bay
State residents. The door may be opening, however, for a bolder
group-purchasing approach that would encompass the entire state
population. A proposal to accomplish this, filed annually since
1995 by Representative Pat Jehlen, a Somerville Democrat, is
attracting mainstream support.
</P>
<P>
   While New England legislators strategize and debate options,
consumers are left to stopgap measures, such as periodic
drug-buying trips to Canada. That's what Lucille Danyow expects to
do next month, when her latest cache of cancer medicine runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, her husband drove her to Quebec. ``But he's 87,'' she
worried last week, ``and I don't know what the weather will be next
month.''

   LOS ANGELES _ For most performers, New Year's Eve is a priority
booking. For r&AMP;b diva Chaka Khan, Universal Studios Hollywood's
Millennium Dance Party represents the start of an unusually full
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, the studio will play host to the gala millennium
event, which also features such musical acts as electro-pop group
Berlin, new wavers Missing Persons and salsa star Yari More
performing in themed party areas topped off by a choreographed
display of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Guests will go footloose in the park with four dance areas _ a
high-energy Rio carnival, a masquerade ball, a red-carpet Hollywood
movie premiere and a romantic escape area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just enjoy performing _ period,'' says Khan, who sang with
r&AMP;b group Rufus from 1972-78 before going solo. ``If the sound is
good, the vibes are there and people are into it, I don't care
where I sing.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 will be heralded at Universal with explosions,
confetti cannons and party favors while the celebration continues
until 2 a.m. to allow guests to keep dancing or enjoying such
attractions as Terminator 2: 3D, Jurassic Park _ The Ride, Back to
the Future and Backdraft.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve has long been a favorite night in the Khan
household, and the vocalist plans to catch some of the other acts
on the Universal lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say there's competition on a night like Dec. 31,
but we all want to do our best,'' she said. ``We want to give our
all for a crowd that wants to have a night to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, the Grammy-winning Khan has released a series of
solo albums and cut vocals with Prince, Steve Winwood, David Bowie
and Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to hear a selection of familiar tunes from Khan on New
Year's, including the Top 40 hits ``Tell Me Something Good,'' ``You
Got the Love,'' ``Sweet Thing,'' ``Once You Get Started,'' ``I Feel
for You'' and ``I'll Be Good to You.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, the Illinois-born Khan says she never tires of singing
her hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people that's just happy to do music for the
love of music,'' she says. ``If there's someone out there who wants
to hear me perform something in particular, I'll always be happy to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Released this summer, Khan's 20th album, ``Come 2 My House''
(New Power Generation Records), includes 10 songs written or
co-written by Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince financed the entire project,'' Khan said. ``He's really
a lovely human being. He's a little shy and misunderstood, but he's
lovely. There was no pressure. It was the perfect partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Khan plans to release a new album and will launch a
year 2000 tour, perhaps with a visit to Europe or Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what I do,'' she insists. ``That's what keeps me going,
no matter how busy or tired I might get. I just love the music.'' &QL;

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

   __ ABOUT the SURVEY: The New York Times Millennium Poll was
conducted by the News Surveys department of The New York Times. It
was designed by MARJORIE CONNELLY, staff editor, under the
direction of MICHAEL KAGAY, head of the department. A total of
1,178 adult Americans were interviewed by telephone between July 17
and July 19, 1999. The sampling error in the poll could account for
variations of plus or minus 3 percentage points in major findings.

<P>
   ON THE EVE OF THE MILLENNIUM, Americans are concentrating on
their own families and are relatively less involved with their
communities outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of the public believes it's critical to have
the power to stand up for oneself and be able to communicate one's
feelings. Being a good neighbor is given more priority than
community involvement or having a lot of friends. And having
children is deemed more important than being married.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to good economic times, there is a general feeling of
optimism about the future for most Americans. That optimism,
however, is joined by considerable concern about the morals of this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Peace and quiet _ time for onesself _ is seen as in short supply
these days. Getting time for oneself is an important wish for the
future.

   __ ABOUT the SURVEY: The New York Times Millennium Poll was
conducted by the News Surveys department of The New York Times. It
was designed by MARJORIE CONNELLY, staff editor, under the
direction of MICHAEL KAGAY, head of the department. A total of
1,178 adult Americans were interviewed by telephone between July 17
and July 19, 1999. The sampling error in the poll could account for
variations of plus or minus 3 percentage points in major findings.

TIME WILL CHOOSE THE WRONG MAN OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The race is on at Time magazine to select the
Person of the Century. Time's Man of the Year _ later changed to
Person of the Year _ has always generated lots of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The hype machine is in full swing to anoint the one person who
has most influenced human affairs over the past hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the magazine's editors will make the final decision,
Time has an on-line poll to measure public reaction on the
contenders. Journalists have hammered away on Bill Clinton for
allowing political decisions to be driven by polls, but that didn't
stop Time from doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Christians are upset because Jesus is not a contender in this
particular millennium. Jews, appalled that Adolf Hitler was leading
in the on-line poll, started clicking for Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli prime minister assassinated four years ago by an
ultranationalist Jew trying to staunch the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent tally, that helped. Rabin was in second
place with about 600,000 votes. The Third Reich's superstar settled
into third place with slightly more than a half million clicks. In
first place with 620,000 fans is the man who certainly did shake up
the planet: Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   As a parlor game, this is lots of fun. If we take it seriously,
other contenders like Einstein, Gandhi and Mother Teresa stand tall
on the horizon beyond the Heartbreak Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Time admits the poll is far from scientific. Some effort has
been made to stop on-line programs that automatically launch
thousands of votes for a candidate. But the on-line poll leaves
lots of room for ballot stuffing. You can vote early and often.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, and putting on-line popularity polls aside, one
person knocks out all the other contenders in a single hard blow:
the aforementioned Adolf Hitler. The key word in Time's choice is
``influential,'' not loved or admired. The magazine acknowledged
this when it chose Hitler as the Man of the Year in 1938, Josef
Stalin in 1939 and 1942, and Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   St. Augustine said the function of the bad was to make the good
stand out more strongly. Hitler certainly fills the bill. In 1934,
a year after gaining power, the maniac bellowed, ``We may be
destroyed, but if we are, we shall drag the world with us _ a world
in flames.'' This shows not only hatred toward his enemies, but
toward the German people too.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing this non-drinking, non-smoking, vegetarian _ in
some ways he was way ahead of his time _ ever came to power. The
iron leader spent most of the day sleeping, then conducted business
into the wee hours of the night while sweating racial hatred and
popping pills administered by a quack doctor for his chronic
flatulence.
</P>
<P>
   Like a monster rising from the ninth circle of Hell, Hitler's
ideology was based on little more than mass murder and total war
designed to coat every square inch of ground with blood.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Meaning of Hitler,'' historian Sebastian Haffner wrote:
``There is no doubt that Hitler is a figure of world political
history; there is equally no doubt that he belongs to the annals of
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine will reveal its choice in the Dec. 27 issue. There
will be an hour-long special on CBS devoted to the Person of the
Century.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea who Time will choose, but I predict it will not
be Hitler. Time editors won't want to take the heat and the
subscription cancellations that would follow. Instead, the editors
will write an essay on why they did not choose Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. Hitler would enjoy that.

CELEBRATING THE NEW YEAR IN A BUNKER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is something so darkly comic about the
State Department's holiday terrorism warning. One might suspect the
late filmmaker, Stanley Kubrick, of having scripted it. After all,
the irony is already close to the ``Dr. Strangelove'' level.
</P>
<P>
   Never before in the history of the United States have so many
people been so well off and willing to spend plenty to commemorate
the last Hanukkah, Christmas and New Year's Eve of a century and a
millennium. While most Americans will do their partying in the
States, thousands have planned once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimages to
the Holy Land, long weekends in Paris or luxury cruises half-way
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two weeks before Christmas and three weeks before the
biggest celebration in the Western world, along comes the State
Department to pour a big old ice bucket of freezing cold water on
everybody's head.
</P>
<P>
   Because of ``credible information that terrorists are planning
attacks,'' U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad during this
holiday season have been put on what may be the scariest _ and most
ridiculous _ alert of the last 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where might these attacks occur?
</P>
<P>
   State Department: ``Locations throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what sort of situations might these acts occur?
</P>
<P>
   State Department: ``Where large gatherings and celebrations will
be taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What precautions against such possible attacks can be taken
by U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad?
</P>
<P>
   State Department: ``Avoid large crowds, keep a low-profile,
review security practices, remain alert to the changing situation
and exercise caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, thanks for sharing. You forgot to tell us to have a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   OK. OK. Nobody wants to see another Pan Am Flight 103. And ever
since that 1989 mid-air bombing over Scotland, any ``credible, but
not counterable'' threat of murder or mayhem must be passed along
by the State Department in the form of a public warning.
</P>
<P>
   But, if the best the folks at State can do is tell us what most
U.S. citizens already know _ somewhere out there, insane ideologues
hate us and, as a holiday surprise, are plotting to make some of us
dead _ why did they even bother warning us?
</P>
<P>
   Short of abandoning all travel plans and eating big bucks in
cancelled airfare and hotel deposits, how can anyone seriously
respond to such a non-specific, all-encompassing warning?
</P>
<P>
   Should you go ahead but stay in your hotel room the entire time?
Cancel all planned visits to such sites as the Wailing Wall, the
Place de la Concorde, Piazza San Marco, Trafalgar Square, Plaza
Colon, the Brandenburg Gate?
</P>
<P>
   How about hiring bodyguards and asking for an armored car when
you check in at Hertz? Or cleverly festooning your clothing with
shamrocks, Celtic crosses and buttons that say, ``Kiss me _ I'm
Irish''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somebody in the State Department, maybe even Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, feels better now that they have shared
their credible but not counterable information about possible
holiday terrorism abroad. Now, if something happens, they'll be
able to say, ``We told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   And, who knows? Maybe the worldwide warning will actually end up
saving somebody's life _ somebody, say, who was all set to sing
``I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy'' at the stroke of midnight on New
Year's Eve in Red Square.

NEW YORK NEEDS A LOBBYING LAW _ NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Here's an old Albany joke: Kids in this town
don't wear masks on Halloween. Instead, they dress up as state
legislators, knock on the doors of lobbyists and demand presents.
</P>
<P>
   And get them.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it's possible that the governor and both houses of
the Legislature will reach agreement this month on toughening New
York's lobbying law before it dies Dec. 31. It's also possible that
O.J. Simpson will find the real killer, that Bill Clinton will
enter a monastery and that Rudolph Giuliani will win the Nobel
Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Of all those possibilities, passing a tougher lobbying law seems
far and away the least likely.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there aren't proposals out there. Several Assembly
Democrats have offered new lobbying laws so tough that they enjoy
zero chance of passage. Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno has a
proposal that the Democratic leadership is already bad-mouthing.
And, before long, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is likely to
offer his own lobbying law suggestion _ one the Republicans will
trash as soon as the wraps come off it.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the holidays are coming. The state
Senate is in town to do something with health care financing _ and,
perhaps, with the lobbying law. But the Assembly isn't yet
scheduled to appear before the new session begins next month.
</P>
<P>
   If, after the Senate goes home, the Assembly does show up to
pass its own lobbying law, the Senate probably won't come back
before Dec. 31. Even if the Assembly passes a 30- or 60-day
extension of the current law, it's unlikely that the Senate will
return to ratify that extension before the new session begins Jan.
5.
</P>
<P>
   Which means, essentially, that even if both houses and the
governor do agree to pass a lobbying law next month _ or the month
after that, or the month after that, or the month after that _
there'll exist a glittering window of time between passage of the
new lobbying law and expiration of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   This will be some window. It will permit lobbyists to shower
expensive gifts on lawmakers and never have to make them public.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking BMWs here. We're talking tickets to Paris. God
knows what we might be talking about. The possibilities beggar the
imagination. No, no, no, say the Republicans; we can always make
any new lobbying law retroactive. After all, we do that with
funding bills, don't we?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. That's because the organizations receiving state money,
even if it arrives late, have no reason to sue. The lobbyists and
their clients would have every reason to sue. They won't want to
make public the gifts they've showered on lawmakers during the
window between the expiration of the current, woefully inadequate
lobbying law and passage of any new one.
</P>
<P>
   They'll argue that no law was in place when they decided to play
Santa Claus to the lawmakers, and that ex post facto laws violate
the U.S. Constitution, which they do.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming, that is, that any new law really is passed during the
next legislative session. Neither the lawmakers nor the lobbyists
who finance their campaigns and provide them with goodies want to
see a lobbying law in the first place. They never did.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the New York State Temporary Commission on Lobbying
has been ``temporary'' since 1977. Neither the legislators nor the
lobbyists who shower cash and presents on them really want to see a
tough lobbying law a permanent part of state government.
</P>
<P>
   So keep your eye on this. And remember it next November, when
all these people stand for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   What you're seeing, quite simply, is Albany at its slimy worst.

`WEST WING' RESTORES CREDIBILITY TO WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great American soap opera that is ``The West Wing'' could
never have made it after Watergate but seems absolutely essential
after Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Nixon days, the country was reeling from its first
popular-opinion nightmare that citizens could no longer trust the
government. Now, as we near the post-Clinton days, our
disappointment long ago turning to unsentimental jadedness, how
many among us could stand up and say that politics is noble, that
politicians are representatives of the people and that clashing
political ideologies are set aside for the common good?
</P>
<P>
   The days of trusting a Jimmy Stewart-style candidate and living
in a world of Frank Capra dreams are over. Even Bill Clinton's
bar-lowering antics in the White House failed to raise much of a
ruckus among the general population. The last 25 years have been a
textbook example of jadedness grown to exponential levels.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why ``The West Wing'' (9 p.m. EST, Wednesdays on
NBC) is a hit, why it casts such a mysterious trance over cynics.
There is no question that it is a superb bit of television, much
like ``ER'' used to be and how creator Aaron Sorkin's other show,
``Sports Night,'' often is.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if these characters were somehow wedged into a drama that
had nothing to do with the president or politics they would still
coalesce into a wonderful ensemble that riveted the nation. They _
and Sorkin _ are that good.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a show about the president of the United States, the
people who work in the White House and the day-to-day realities of
politics. And not cynical, irony-laden politics and situations
either. No, on ``The West Wing'' soapy do-gooderism is played up to
operatic proportions and somewhere Frank Capra is standing at
attention, saluting Old Glory, a tear in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written these days about anti-irony, the return of
honesty and real emotions. From a popular book on that very idea to
yuppies turning their backs on prosperity to seek a simpler life in
their own private Walden, there is a bubbling undercurrent in this
country that seeks the return of the good in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more readily represented in pop culture than in
``The West Wing,'' a show that has become a hit across the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' is nothing if not modern fantasy, prime-time
wish fulfillment. First, a liberal Democrat (Martin Sheen) is in
the White House. He is surrounded not by political vultures and
cronies but by eager go-getters, aides filled to the brim with
righteousness and intellect and just enough smart-aleck savvy to
distinguish them from, say, ``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   That latter part is key if you want to hook former ``Seinfeld''
fans and those who consider themselves intellectual independents
who frown on mainstream pap. Perhaps this is the finest attribute
of ``The West Wing'' _ pulling in the cynics and wrapping them in a
warm flag before they knew what hit them.
</P>
<P>
   From the stirring music at the beginning, and throughout this
show, to the blurred flag waving gloriously in the frame to the
distant shot of the White House and then the 44 minutes of
pro-politics, pro-Constitution, pro-government dramatics that
follow, ``The West Wing'' is a kind of love poem to the Founding
Fathers or something to put in a time capsule so that 100 years
from now historians can say, ``They were a suspicious lot until
just before the new millennium, when they began to believe again.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sorkin and the writers of ``The West Wing'' do,
fundamentally, is get at the meaning of ``good politics.'' Civil
rights come up in virtually every episode. The kind and smart
president and his dedicated staff go through difficult,
gut-wrenching situations; they are overcome often with doubt, which
leads to much hand-wringing, head-shaking and personal reflection.
But in the end, as the music swells and the tears begin to well in
viewers everywhere, those decisions are made for the good of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The show is developing such true believers that Sheen _ a noted
liberal _ is said to be worried that people will confuse the show's
middle-of-the-road president (in Sheen's view) with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen has a point. ``The West Wing'' is making believers out of
people. It is restoring faith. Closer to the 2000 election someone
ought to study how a hit television show helped shape an election.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, we will have many more opportunities to soak in
Sorkin's warm bath of patriotism. We can follow President Josiah
Bartlet, a New Hampshire Democrat who just happens to be a direct
descendant of the one of the signer of the Declaration of
Independence. His chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer), a good
man and recovering alcoholic who devotes his life above everything
(even his wife, who leaves him) to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Or deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), the
fiery, wily strategist with compassion for the people. Then there's
communications director Toby Ziegler and his deputy Sam Seaborn
(Rob Lowe), putting the best spin on the president's populist
message.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure the contentious press is kept at bay as much as
possible is press secretary C.J. Gregg (Allison Janney).
</P>
<P>
   They are all good people. Even political consultant Madeline
Hampton (Moira Kelly), who is a sheep in shark's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, we want to follow these people because they are
doing the nation's work, they are guiding us to greatness in a
world of madness. And even if, in moments, it all seems so corny
and unbelievable, you are dragged back in and reduced to tears or
pride before the dreaded jadedness can rise in your throat.
</P>
<P>
   When President Kennedy said, ``Ask not what your country can do
for you, but what you can do for your country,'' Aaron Sorkin must
have been all ears. He has created a great television show.
</P>
<P>
   In five or so years, it may not age as well as others, but it is
definitely of _ or slightly ahead of _ its time.

surge in the polls, John McCain on Tuesday is expected to set out a
far-ranging health care plan, including a new block grant to help
low income senior citizens with the costs of prescription drugs and
measures to give more children insurance. The speech is his attempt
to address some of the hottest issues on the campaign trail and

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The outlook for interest rates grows
murkier after the government reports that consumer prices remained
tame in November but that retail sales rose much sharper than
expected. The Labor Department says the Consumer Price Index rose
0.1 percent _ somewhat less than expected and half the pace
recorded in the previous month. But an acceleration in housing
prices contributed to an increase of 0.2 percent in the core index,
which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors. Retail sales,
meanwhile, jumped 0.9 percent in November, posting the largest gain
in three months. Excluding the heavily weighted category of sales
at auto dealers, retail activity rose a more modest 0.4 percent, in
line with expectations. Treasury prices slump after the retail
sales report. By Louis Uchitelle.

Barboza.

   USED-CARS (Canton, Mich.) _ For most of the last century,
selling cars, particularly used cars, has been a gritty business in
which profits usually went to the entrepreneur who could negotiate
the highest possible price for each automobile, while spending as
little as possible on amenities like furniture, carpeting and
salaries. AutoNation and several other big, publicly traded
companies captured Wall Street's fancy three years ago by trying to
change all that. Now that strategy appears to be imperiled, as the
industry has been buffeted by the rise of the Internet, a decline
in used-car prices and by a renewed push by traditional car dealers
to improve customer services. By Keith Bradsher.

   PRODUCT-AS-PROCESS (Undated) _ Marshall McLuhan wrote 35 years
ago that the medium is the message. Today, a great many business
thinkers, in one way or another, seem to be saying something
similar: the process is the product. Puzzling or not, that thought
has become today's operating philosophy. Aside from electronic
gadgetry, the other things we buy _ the cars we drive, the shoes we
wear, the trips we take _ are not all that different from what they
were 10 years ago. But the ways they are produced have been
overhauled, as the awesome speed of the Internet forces every
business to reinvent its product as a process. By Fred Andrews.

FEDERAL AND LOCAL OFFICIALS VOW TO FIGHT GUN INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking the next step in a potential federal lawsuit
against gun manufacturers, senior administration officials met here
with 17 city and county officials Tuesday and vowed to fight for
safer firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Bruce
Reed, President Clinton's point man on gun policy, said at a news
conference that the meeting had produced the outlines of a unified
stance that local and federal officials will take to the gun
industry ``over the next days.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the threatened class-action lawsuit that HUD would
launch through 3,200 housing authorities across the country is to
force the manufacturers to produce safer guns and new business
practices that would guard against shady dealers.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne expressed outrage at
the easy access many children have to guns and said she was buoyed
by the federal lawsuit threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are here from California and have been very
actively involved in this ... wouldn't have traveled across the
country if we didn't believe that this administration and Secretary
Cuomo were serious,'' Renne said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The time is now for the gun manufacturers to step
up to the plate and be serious because we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the federal and local officials had ``agreed to stand
together ... to ensure that the gun industry takes responsibility
for its share of the violence'' that has wracked public housing
projects over the last few years. Flanked by the local officials
and a representative from the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Cuomo said the group intends to
``reach our goals through negotiations'' but is ``wholly prepared
to go to litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who is also President Clinton's domestic policy adviser,
said he will meet with the state attorneys general from New York
and Connecticut on Wednesday about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeking monetary compensation, HUD wants gun makers
to crack down on disreputable dealers and make safer guns that
can't be fired by children. The administration also wants gun
makers to agree to end practices such as marketing weapons that are
impervious to fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   The federal-local coalition effort is distinct from lawsuits
that 28 cities have filed against gun manufacturers seeking
monetary damages and changes in the ways guns are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The suits have had mixed success in the courts. A judge
dismissed Cincinnati's suit in October, but another judge allowed
Atlanta's suit to proceed.

either through abuse or neglect, may be fined under new rules
issued by the federal government Tuesday. If those rules had been
in effect last year, 12 percent of the nation's 17,000 nursing
homes would have been fined, said Nancy-Ann DeParle, head of the
Health Care Financing Administration. (Lipman, Cox News Service).

   LATINOS-POLICE _ WASHINGTON _ Representatives of the National

announce a partnership to address racial profiling, law enforcement
abuses and the number of Latinos in law enforcement. (Schultz, Cox

   MILLENNIUM-MOON _ WASHINGTON _ Call it the Millennium Moon. An
unusual confluence of orbital dynamics will produce the brightest
full moon of the 20th century on Dec. 22, the day after the winter
solstice. Because the moon on that night will be near its
``perigee'' _ the closest its slightly out-of-round orbit brings it
to the Earth _ it will appear slightly larger than normal. However,
the earth-moon system will also be near the ``perihelion'' point,
the orbital position that takes the Earth closest to the sun,
sunlight reflected by the moon will be slightly more intense. The
confluence of the three factors occurs about once every 133 years
and will not occur again during the next century. But astronomer Ed
Barker of Austin's McDonald Observatory said the difference will
hardly be noticeable to the average observer. (Nesmith).

   CUBANS _ As U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations continue to strain
with the weight of the custody battle over 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez, the longstanding issue of Cuban detainees in U.S. jails
flared today with negotiators working for armed Cuban detainees to
release two deputies and a warden taken hostage at the St. Martin
Parish jail in Louisiana. One of the Cubans has been held for 13
years and is frustrated at the lack of progress in his case. The
Cubans are among a group of 60 in jail for the INS pending
deportation or other action. (Konigsmark, Atlanta

Florida will abandon the water war negotiations, or agree to a
deadline extension to keep the talks alive. Representatives from
Georgia, Alabama and Florida are meeting at a negotiating session
in Atlanta on Tuesday, and Florida will reveal whether it will
stick to an earlier announcment that further talks may be futile to
divide up the waters of the Chattahoochee and other rivers. If the
talks fail, the water war most likely will end up in the Supreme

And if $70 million isn't enough to make you part with a buck, just

according to Lottery estimates obtained by The Palm Beach Post
through the public records law. (Date, Palm Beach Post). 16.

   ABORTION-TEXAS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ As of Jan. 1, under-age girls
will have to notify their parents before they get an abortion in
Texas. The law takes effect amid grave concerns about the
confidentiality requirements of a provision allowing a girl to go
to a judge instead of her parents. The new law requires the court
proceedings _ not just the girl's name _ to be confidential. Some
say that could violate the Texas Constitution's ban on secret court
proceedings. Some judges are worried about not having access to the
court cases that will enable them to know what the standards for
awarding the bypass are. There's also a question of making public
the actions of elected judges so people can determine whether they
are judging such cases fairly or on the basis of their own pro- or
anti-choice views. One Houston judge has been jailed for
anti-abortion protests. (Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman).

   MEXICAN-SHOPPERS _ SAN MARCOS, Texas _ Like millions of other

a car full of bags to tell the tale. Shoes from Nike, dishes from
Pfaltzgraff, clothes from Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica and Liz
Claiborne, assorted gifts from the Disney Store. But instead of
heading home to Austin or San Antonio, Trevino drove more than five
hours to Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. It's a trip she has made
twice a year for the past six years. She's hardly unique, however.
These days, more and more Mexicans are coming to Texas to shop.

<P>
   You might have thought the salaryman, the grey-suited symbol of
modern Japan, had suffered enough indignity in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the ``bubble economy'' seven years ago, he
has watched a lifetime's hard work go down the drain as bankruptcy
and restructuring have ravaged corporate Japan. Many employees have
lost their jobs and others have seen their firms taken over by
foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new, more grotesque humiliation has been heaped on the
heads of Japan's corporate warriors.
</P>
<P>
   By general consensus, they smell _ and the rest of Japan is
clamoring for them to do something.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months Japan's biggest cosmetics company,
Shiseido, has achieved extravagant success with a range of products
intended frankly to eliminate middle-aged body odor. Another
company is marketing deodorant undergarments, aimed at the
over-40s.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show high levels of disgust among the younger,
specifically female sections of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the backlash is summed up in a recent television
advertisement for Deo-Green, a line of vests, long-johns, Y-fronts
and boxer shorts said to devour the microorganisms responsible for
BO.
</P>
<P>
   A woman stands listening to a Walkman on one of Tokyo's crowded
rush-hour trains. All around her stand oblivious salarymen, armpits
and greasy necks bobbing and swaying at the level of her nose. Her
distress rises, she screams and solves the problem by removing the
Walkman headphones and replacing them in her nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of young women by Deo-Green's
manufacturer, 92.8 percent of them believe men should do something
about their sweaty odor; 68.7 percent of the sample object to the
smell of their fathers, 80 percent to that of fellow commuters, and
96.4 percent of working women said their bosses stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't usually mind the smell of people, but oji-san smell is
different,'' Miwako Shikata, a film-school graduate, said. ``I'd
say it's up there along with vomit and the smell of public
toilets.''
</P>
<P>
   Oji-san means uncle, but comes to stand for middle-aged men in
general, and it this group _ the over-40s _ that are bearing the
brunt of the odor offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But it took Shiseido, better known for makeup and perfumes aimed
at the young female, to come up with a name and a solution for the
oji-san's shame.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind it is Shoji Nakamura, Shiseido's chief perfumer,
or ``nose,'' a man with olfactory organs so sensitive he can
distinguish more than 2,000 scents.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 12 years ago, when I was near middle-aged or elderly
people in trains or meetings or queues, I began noticing the
characteristic smell,'' he said. ``It is greasy and oily, with
nuance of green grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Shiseido gave him the go-ahead and a team of five
embarked on Project Oji-san. The first step was to gather raw
material, and for this Dr. Nakamura turned to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them to wear T-shirts and night garments for three
straight nights. Then I analyzed the constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a technique known as headspace gas chromotography
analysis, he identified the greasy, grassy smell that had caught
his imagination all those years ago _ a type of ``unsaturated
aldehyde'' called nonenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tests revealed that nonenal is formed when fatty
9-hexadecenoic acid is oxidized or dissolved by skin microflora,''
according to Shiseido. This tends not to occur until the 40s and
50s.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiseido team then set itself the task of eliminating and
concealing the repulsive excretion. The result is a line of
patented cosmetics that neutralize and mask nonenal.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged in neutral orange and selling for a few pounds apiece,
they have surpassed sales projections to make the company (pounds
sterling)1.42 million (nearly US$ 2.5 million) in three months,
most of it spent by women on behalf of their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   There is oji-san body shampoo and oji-san body powder, oji-san
body mist and moistened wipes for sweaty brows.
</P>
<P>
   There is even an oji-san air freshener, for fragrant daughters
to spray around their rooms after the departure of their smelly
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   On each can, in bright letters, is the slogan of the entire
range: ``Wow! Where did that smell go?'' &QL;

 &HT;    'AFRICAN VOICES' A NEW PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT SMITHSONIAN
 &HT;    Moving in (l) lifestyle and (t) travel categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ``other Mayflower'' set sail from Africa with a
cargo of enslaved Asante villagers about a century after the
original landed on Plymouth Rock. It landed in the colony of
Virginia on July 4, 1719, and most of those aboard were sold to
Robert Carter to work on his tobacco plantation near Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Their story is among the tapestry of tales woven into ``African
Voices'' _ a new permanent exhibition that opens Wednesday at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Six years in the making, the $5.5 million exhibit explores the
culture and history of a continent through films, photographs,
interactive videos, more than 400 artifacts, and the words of
scores of its people.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,500-square-foot exhibition ``demonstrates how African
cultures have spread worldwide, becoming a part of the very fabric
of American life,'' said Robert Fri, director of the museum. It
``encourages people to look beyond the existing stereotypes and
assumptions about Africa and Africans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit aims ``to present the diversity and dynamism of
Africa,'' said Fri, and ``to show how African cultures have spread
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an exhibit explaining the traditional ``mud cloth
pattern'' on paper cups of Peet's Coffee illustrates how ingrained
African culture has become in everyday American life.
</P>
<P>
   Fri said the exhibit is largest cultural display in all the
Smithsonian museums.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of slavery and colonialism are only two of 10 stories
told in the ``History Corridor'' that runs down the center of the
exhibit. The other historical themes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The story of human origins in Africa about 5 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tales of the Egyptian and Nubian civilizations that arose in
the ancient Nile Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ The conquests and rule of African Muslims in the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   _ The emergence of independent African nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Africa's struggle for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   _ And a changing section on the challenges that Africa faces
today.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are told ``from both rural and urban settings,''
said curator Mary Jo Arnoldi. The exhibitors received input from
Brazil, Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Egypt and
South Africa, as well as from experts and institutions within the
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``aqual,'' or contemporary portable home for Somali camel
herders. With a framework of arched roots and covering of woven
mats, the structure can be quickly disassembled and carried on a
camel's back. If a Somali marriage ends in divorce, the woman
retains rights to this house and its goods.
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``airplane coffin'' from Ghana made by artist Paa Joe. This
colorful conveyance ``confirms the deceased with the prestige and
mystique of travel,'' the curators wrote. Burial in a winged coffin
``connects the spiritual journey of death with a reminder of a life
well lived.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An early 20th century carved wooden door from Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   _ An antelope mask made from corn husks and used by the Chewa
people of Malawi.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contemporary toys and dolls of African children.
</P>
<P>
   At every corner, an African voice speaks out _ sometimes in
narration, sometimes in song, sometimes in a written proverb or

 &HT;    'AFRICAN VOICES' A NEW PERMANENT EXHIBIT AT SMITHSONIAN
 &HT;    Moving in (l) lifestyle and (t) travel categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ``other Mayflower'' set sail from Africa with a
cargo of enslaved Asante villagers about a century after the
original landed on Plymouth Rock. It landed in the colony of
Virginia on July 4, 1719, and most of those aboard were sold to
Robert Carter to work on his tobacco plantation near Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Their story is among the tapestry of tales woven into ``African
Voices'' _ a new permanent exhibition that opens Wednesday at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Six years in the making, the $5.5 million exhibit explores the
culture and history of a continent through films, photographs,
interactive videos, more than 400 artifacts, and the words of
scores of its people.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,500-square-foot exhibition ``demonstrates how African
cultures have spread worldwide, becoming a part of the very fabric
of American life,'' said Robert Fri, director of the museum. It
``encourages people to look beyond the existing stereotypes and
assumptions about Africa and Africans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit aims ``to present the diversity and dynamism of
Africa,'' said Fri, and ``to show how African cultures have spread
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an exhibit explaining the traditional ``mud cloth
pattern'' on paper cups of Peet's Coffee illustrates how ingrained
African culture has become in everyday American life.
</P>
<P>
   Fri said the exhibit is largest cultural display in all the
Smithsonian museums.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of slavery and colonialism are only two of 10 stories
told in the ``History Corridor'' that runs down the center of the
exhibit. The other historical themes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The story of human origins in Africa about 5 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tales of the Egyptian and Nubian civilizations that arose in
the ancient Nile Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ The conquests and rule of African Muslims in the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   _ The emergence of independent African nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Africa's struggle for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   _ And a changing section on the challenges that Africa faces
today.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are told ``from both rural and urban settings,''
said curator Mary Jo Arnoldi. The exhibitors received input from
Brazil, Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Egypt and
South Africa, as well as from experts and institutions within the
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``aqual,'' or contemporary portable home for Somali camel
herders. With a framework of arched roots and covering of woven
mats, the structure can be quickly disassembled and carried on a
camel's back. If a Somali marriage ends in divorce, the woman
retains rights to this house and its goods.
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``airplane coffin'' from Ghana made by artist Paa Joe. This
colorful conveyance ``confirms the deceased with the prestige and
mystique of travel,'' the curators wrote. Burial in a winged coffin
``connects the spiritual journey of death with a reminder of a life
well lived.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An early 20th century carved wooden door from Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   _ An antelope mask made from corn husks and used by the Chewa
people of Malawi.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contemporary toys and dolls of African children.
</P>
<P>
   At every corner, an African voice speaks out _ sometimes in
narration, sometimes in song, sometimes in a written proverb or
passage. ``When you reach Benin, it is still very far away,'' goes
one saying from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The National Museum of Natural History is located at 10th Street
and Constitution Avenue NW and is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is free.

CATCH-22S FOR 22 PERCENT OF AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Imagine that 22 percent of the population had
disabling and mysterious disorders of a specific vital organ _ the
liver, say _ and couldn't get treatment. Imagine further that tens
of thousands of these people were lying in sickness and pain all
over the streets.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a call for a national war on liver disease.
Health plans would be forced to cover it. Scientists would work
overtime to invent medications to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Quit imagining. It's true, except the organ in question is the
brain, and for some reason disorders of the brain are ignored,
denied, feared or considered a joke. Thus people don't seek
treatment for them, even though very effective medications exist.
</P>
<P>
   What we're up against with mental illness is a huge, unofficial
``Don't tell, don't talk about it'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, is trying to end that
policy. He has issued a report saying that 22 percent of the
population has diagnosable mental disorders, but two-thirds don't
seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The report's main recommendation is ``seek help if you
experience symptoms of mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   You bet, Doc. The Catch-22 is, if you're crazy, you don't think
you're crazy. And if you seek help, you're crazy to think you'll
get much from the average health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The late Joseph Heller, who invented Catch-22, the rule that
``anybody who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy,''
would have a field day with the surgeon general's advice, as
well-meaning as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Think of all the Catch-22s there are for the 22 percent of
Americans with the highly stigmatized disorders of the brain. Seek
help? That's advice seriously out of touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who is seriously depressed probably is too depressed to
get out of the house or pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody planning to commit suicide, as Kay Redfield Jamison
discusses in her new book ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding
Suicide,'' probably is concealing the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who goes out and seeks help for mental problems probably
finds they aren't adequately covered in the health plan. There
aren't enough beds on psychiatric units for the seriously ill
either.
</P>
<P>
   The craziest thing of all is that medications exist to
effectively treat depression, manic-depression and certain other
disorders, yet people don't take them. It's understandable.
Consider the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   That's another Catch-22. You have to be crazy to tell an
employer, or a even a friend, you take drugs that keep you sane.
</P>
<P>
   Not telling and not talking about it are requirements of mental
illness, unless you're Woody Allen and using psychiatry as a
running (or lying down) gag for your own enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has done more than any single individual to make
psychiatry seem like a ridiculous waste of time fit only for
weak-willed narcissists _ even at a time when psychiatry has moved
away from the couch to effective and relatively inexpensive pills.
</P>
<P>
   But the disappearance of Woody Allen won't help much. The
stigmatization of mental illness is older than Bedlam, runs wide
and deep, and it isn't about to disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac and Zoloft are laugh lines, even though such new drugs
are effective in treating serious depression in many individuals.
They're also knocked by many social commentators as a means to lull
the non-ill into Stepford tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that they only work on the depressed, and have no
effect on those who are just looking for a high.
</P>
<P>
   In America, there are three strong streams of non-thought about
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   One says, ``Buck up and pull out of it. It's all in your head.''
The problem is, it is all in the head, and sometimes those little
neurons need some chemical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Another says the mentally ill are violent. Newspapers never fail
to use the phrase ``He had a history of mental illness'' in murder
stories when they can.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that far more people are killed and injured by those
without a history of mental illness. And plenty of people who have
fought and beaten mental illness are working around you.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another disordered line of thinking is that mental illness
is strictly socially defined, schizophrenics have great insights,
and mental hospitals and psychoactive drugs are totalitarian tools
of social control. Those romantic, ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest'' illusions have been disappearing as large mental hospitals
have closed and their former patients have appeared on the streets.
Unfortunately, now we associate mental illness with a state of
hopeless degradation that can't be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general is to be congratulated for making a
statement that mental illness is hazardous to the nation's health,
and should be treated as a health problem like any other.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't a health problem like any other if you're running
for public office, looking for a job or trying to keep a job.
That's another Catch-22 in the fight against mental illness and its
stigma.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be crazy to talk about having been crazy, and then
who's going to listen to you?
</P>

 &HT;    WILL ONLINE VOTING OVERCOME SNAGS TO ACHIEVE ITS PROMISE?
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For an idea whose time has yet to come, Internet
voting is drawing lots of attention.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Dell Computer Corp. revealed that nearly 80
percent of current World Wide Web users _ more than 100 million
Americans _ would like the chance to vote on line.
</P>
<P>
   If the ballot box does find its way into cyberspace, some
experts believe, it could help reverse slumping voter
participation, which is especially prevalent among computer-savvy
young people.
</P>
<P>
   But staging a pick 'n' click election ``is not like most other
applications on the Internet,'' California Secretary of State Bill
Jones warned at a briefing here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said a forthcoming California task force study on Internet
voting will call for a four-stage process.
</P>
<P>
   In stage one, he suggested, Internet voting would take place at
the voter's wired-up traditional polling place. As mouse clicks
replace punch cards, ballots could be tabulated more rapidly. But
the thorny problem of online identity _ being able to prove you are
who you say you are _ would not arise.
</P>
<P>
   Stage two would expand the process to any local polling place,
including schools and libraries with fast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commuters who went to work before the polls open could vote
during their lunch break,'' said Jim Adler, a former rocket
scientist who serves as chief executive officer of VoteHere.net,
one of several startup companies in an expanding field.
</P>
<P>
   During the next step, people could vote from kiosks located in
conveniently located malls and other urban centers. But Adler and
Jones both emphasized that these voters would be required to obtain
their Internet ballots through much the same paper-based
authentication process that today governs mail-in absentee ballots.
</P>
<P>
   A final and somewhat distant goal is remote voting at any time
and from any place with Internet access, including TV sets in the
home equipped with digital two-way set-top boxes. Before that
happens, election officials and computer experts must devise
totally foolproof ways of dealing with possible fraud and potential
hackers who could mount crippling virus attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet holds out the promise of allowing us to build in
integration of voting with voter education and information about
candidates that we never had before,'' said Larry Sabato, a
political science professor at University of Virginia who has
successfully used VoteHere's software in moc elections for his
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think Internet voting is coming? Yes, I do,'' said Thomas
Ferguson, the Connecticut-based chairman of the National
Association of State Election Directors. ``But first there have to
be answers to some of the unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pending legislation would direct President Clinton to initiate a
broad federal study of Internet voting issues that could provide
some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., seeks
ways of implementing voting via cyberspace without furthering the
``digital divide'' _ the access gap between rich and poor, whites
and minorities, urban and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the legislation, Jackson said voting on line,
``presents a fantastic opportunity to reverse a 40-year decline in
national voter turnout. American families increasingly find it
difficult to take time from their busy work schedules, child care
and community activities to vote. ... The Internet could make
voting easier, more convenient and extremely efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the trail-blazing California study, which is due
out later this month, recent signs of interest include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A pilot program run by the Defense Department and at least
five states that will allow a small number of military personnel
stationed overseas to vote on line in next November's presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Arizona, as many as 50,000 Democrats are gearing up to vote
on line from their homes and offices in the party's March
presidential primary. To do so, they must first register with party
officials and obtain a secure digital code that verifies their
identity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Next month, VoteHere.net will host a straw poll for some 3,500
registered Alaska Republicans who live in a Texas-sized remote
region that is accessible at that time of year only by snowmobile
and dog sled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to talk about all the benefits involved,'' said
Adler, who has set up January Alaska vote. ``But this has to be
totally redundant and totally safe. It's not like Internet polling
or even (corporate) proxy voting, both of which have been around
for some time. With Internet voting, you can't have any mistakes.''

   KOSOVO RETURNEE: Alongside a two-lane road that winds through
the hills in southern Kosovo sits a walled farmyard with a
cinderblock house at its center. The steep, forested hills rising
all around could be mistaken for those of north Georgia. Skender
Rahimi couldn't get this place out of his mind even while he was in
the safety and relative serenity of Atlanta. His story is a
familiar tale of exile and return that is common among the 800,000
Kosovar Albanians who fled their homeland last spring during the
brutal conflict between the Serb-led Yugoslav military and ethnic
Albanian separatists. The conflict came to an end after NATO's
78-day bombing campaign forced the Yugoslav army, police and
paramilitaries to withdraw from Kosovo.

Rahimi couldn't get this place out of his mind even while he was in
the safety and relative serenity of Atlanta. His story is a
familiar tale of exile and return that is common among the 800,000
Kosovar Albanians who fled their homeland last spring during the
brutal conflict between the Serb-led Yugoslav military and ethnic

GARCIA MAY BE IN LINE FOR QB OF 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. - Although nobody from the San Francisco
49ers has talked openly about Jeff Garcia's auditioning for a
future role with the team, his coach has finally suggested that is
the case.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief topics to come out of coach Steve Mariucci's
weekly news conference on Monday was the matter of Garcia, who
starts at quarterback for the 49ers but also remains a work in
progress. Garcia led the 49ers to their first win in two months
when the team beat the Atlanta Falcons and threw for 437 yards in a
loss to Cincinnati two weeks ago. He also played so poorly earlier
this season that he lost his job for three games.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia now seems to be set to finish the year as the team's
starter. By bestowing that responsibility on Garcia, Mariucci
acknowledged he is hoping to learn quite a bit about his
quarterback over the remaining three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know where we stand with Jeff by the end of the year,''
Mariucci said. ``I don't know about the other quarterbacks, but
hopefully, Jeff will continue to improve and we'll be able to see
where to go either in the offseason or the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's other quarterbacks are injured starter Steve Young
and reserve Steve Stenstrom.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing for more yards than any other quarterback this
season against Cincinnati, Garcia turned in a solid effort against
Atlanta. He completed 16 of 24 passes for 160 yards, and though he
didn't throw for any touchdowns, he also did not toss any
interceptions. He has appeared far more comfortable with the recent
game plans than earlier this season, when four of his five starts
ended in defeats.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for Garcia's relaxed style of play is that the
49ers coaches have tailored their strategies to fit his strengths.
He is more accustomed to making plays on the fly than standing in
the pocket. So most of the plays Mariucci and offensive coordinator
Marty Mornhinweg called on Sunday required Garcia to move around
and first look to tight ends and running backs for his throws.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of game plan that will appease wide
receivers Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes, who combined
for four receptions for 38 yards against Atlanta. But that is how
the 49ers think they have to play with Garcia until he develops
into a more polished pocket passer. Of course, the question the
coaching staff is pondering is if that growth will actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see Jeff making progress,'' Mariucci said. ``The
big thing was that we didn't turn the ball over. I think you saw
what he does best. He moves the ball around and gets it to the
backs and tight ends. He's very good at that. What he's being
coached on is staying in the pocket and throwing downfield to the
receivers. He's doing what he does best but he has to continue
improving on making plays in the pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Garcia does improve over the next three weeks, there are
no guarantees the 49ers will not pursue other options in the
offseason. Before Sunday's win, the team seemed to be plummeting to
the point where a high selection in next April's draft appeared to
be a given.
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers do wind up in decent enough position to pluck a
highly rated prospect like Marshall's Chad Pennington or
Louisville's Chris Redman, they would have a hard time passing that
up. As for free agency, that is not going to yield much at
quarterback; Cincinnati's Jeff Blake and Tennessee's Neil O'Donnell
headline the upcoming crop. These are players the 49ers must
consider because Garcia may end up being nothing more than a solid
backup and the team has shown no indication that they expect Young
to be playing next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jeff is a backup, we're going to have to decide on a
starter still,'' Mariucci said. ``Is it Steve Young? A trade? Free
agency? Those decisions will have to be made.''

SWEET REWARDS OF A WATCH ON THE RIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is the sixth of eight columns by Patrick O'Connell, the
chef and an owner of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington,
Va. They are written with Marian Burros.)  (af) 
 By PATRICK O'CONNELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, we've been serving candied grapefruit
rind after dinner at the Inn t Little Washington. Our guests seem
to find the chewy texture and bittersweet flavor irresistible. It's
the perfect last bite after an extravagant meal, or equally good
with afternoon tea. And to make it, all you need are grapefruit and
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how we began serving the rind centers on one of the
oldest inhabitants of our tiny town, who died at 107 a few years
ago. Mattie Ball Fletcher, affectionately called Mother Ball by
everyone, was known for her cooking, her herb garden and her
outspokenness.
</P>
<P>
   When we opened she was in her mid-80s and was our primary
supplier of herbs, which she grew just a few doors away.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Ball didn't believe in waste. She was appalled when she
learned that we threw out the rinds of the grapefruit we used for
our tarts. So she offered to candy them for us, but she was not
about to explain her technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks think it's a secret,'' she said, ``but there's no secret
to it. It's just right much work.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually even she knew she was too old to candy the rinds, and
she finally confided the recipe to one of our kitchen assistants
who delivered meals to her from the inn.
</P>
<P>
   We still make the rind the way Mother Ball did, but we've
streamlined the recipe. When we blanch the rind to get rid of the
bitterness, we line up three pots instead of using the same one
over and over as she did.
</P>
<P>
   We also slice the rind into more delicate strips that are all
the same size, unlike Mother Ball's. (Scraps can flavor cookies or
tea cakes.) But we candy the rinds the same way, coating them first
in sugar syrup and then tossing them in dry sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Around Christmastime, the candied rind makes a wonderful gift or
stocking stuffer, placed in small decorative boxes or wrapped in
transparent bags and tied with ribbons. Candied grapefruit rind
keeps for weeks in a cool, dry place and can be made easily and
economically in large batches for gifts.
</P>
<P>
   We usually present the candied rinds after dinner along with
tiny chocolates and dime-size cookies in a fabric-lined, miniature
picnic basket. It makes a happy souvenir or a snack for the ride
home.
</P>
<P>
   The rind, as we call it, is the star of this little presentation
and always brings back memories of the neighbor who taught us the
rewards of frugality.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIED GRAPEFRUIT RIND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 large pink unblemished grapefruit
</P>
<P>
   6 cups sugar. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Fill 3 4-quart saucepans with water. Place over high heat,
and bring to a boil. Cut each grapefruit vertically (through the
stem end) into eight wedges. Peel off and reserve rind from each
wedge, saving pulp for another use.
</P>
<P>
   2. Trim off pointed ends of rind wedges, and cut each wedge into
strips 1{ to 2 inches long and \ inch wide. Discard any irregularly
shaped trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   3. When water boils, submerge strips into one pot, pushing them
down with a spoon to keep them below the surface. Return water to a
full boil, then boil rind for 2 minutes. Drain rind immediately,
then place it in a second pot of boiling water. Return water to a
boil, and boil for 2 minutes. Drain, and place rind in third pot of
water. Boil again for 2 minutes, and drain well.
</P>
<P>
   4. In one pot, combine 5 cups of the sugar and 5 cups water.
Place over medium heat, and boil until sugar has dissolved. Add
rind to sugar syrup, making sure it is submerged. Boil, stirring
occasionally, until syrup reaches 238 degrees on a candy
thermometer. Rinds should be translucent.
</P>
<P>
   5. Drain rinds, and transfer them to a wire rack placed over a
cookie sheet or waxed paper. Allow them to dry in a single layer in
a warm, dry place overnight, until they are barely sticky.
</P>
<P>
   6. Place rinds in a large bowl with remaining cup of sugar. Toss
to coat evenly. Store in a covered container at room temperature
until ready to serve. If rinds become moist or sticky, toss them in
sugar again.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 cups.

CABERNET FRANC STARS AS ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anonymity is too often the fate of cabernet franc. Its usual
role in Bordeaux is as a blending agent, to soften the tannic edges
of cabernet sauvignon, its dominant relation.
</P>
<P>
   When it does get to shine on its own, it is plagued by issues of
identity. Do you know it by the gloriously rich wines of Cheval
Blanc, the only major Bordeaux chateau whose wines are largely
cabernet franc, or the light-bodied, herbal wines of Chinon,
Bourgueil and other towns of the upper Loire? How about the lean,
acidic wines of Friuli in Italy?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the multiple personalities of cabernet franc are a
tribute to its versatility, something more winemakers seem to
appreciate. In California, which leans to a heavier Bordeaux style,
the number of acres planted with cabernet franc is growing rapidly.
New York, especially the North Fork of Long Island, seems to be
fertile ground for the lighter Loire style.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet franc wines, particularly those from the Loire and Long
Island, almost always improve with food. Alone, they can often be
austere, tasting largely of herbs and green bell peppers, but with
anything from fish to Southeast Asian cuisines the wines blossom.
</P>
<P>
   American cabernet francs are labeled with the name of the grape.
The French system is to put the region on the label, so if you are
looking for a good cabernet franc from the Loire, remember the
names Chinon, Bourgeuil, Saumur-Champigny and Anjou-Villages.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're lucky enough to drink a fine Bordeaux, know that
it probably has some cabernet franc in it, quietly doing its job. &QL;

ENSURE LOW RATES BY BUYING THIS YEAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If ever there were a time to buy life insurance, this
is the time.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the hype insurance companies are pitching to
potential customers about the dawn of the Triple X era of life
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry or get excited. Insurers aren't trying to make their
business sexier by giving away pornography with their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Triple X is the misnomer of a regulation adopted by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners that requires life insurers
to keep more cash in the reserves they maintain for long-term
guaranteed premium policies.
</P>
<P>
   It gets its nickname from the association's alphabet-reliant
naming system.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners took this step out of worry that the fierce
competition to sell term insurance, which is estimated to have
premiums 40 percent lower than five years ago, might leave some
companies without enough money stashed away to pay future claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triple X is meant to ensure that a promise made is a promise
kept,'' says Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the American Council of
Life Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RULE AFFECTS TEXAS POLICIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen states also have adopted the rule, which takes
effect in Texas and most other states Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   After that insurers will have to keep more money in accounts
that return less interest than if they were allowed to invest that
money in stocks and other securities.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the loss in income and to get the additional
money to increase their reserves, insurance companies can either
make less profit, raise premiums and/or eliminate long-term
policies from their product line.
</P>
<P>
   Since stockholders aren't too inclined to see a drop in
revenues, many insurers are predicting premiums rates will rise 15
to 50 percent on term and universal insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Others are saying 30-year term insurance will no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is prohibited by the regulation, but
some products certainly will be harder to find,'' says Ted Becker,
chief life actuary for the Texas Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the mini-Y2K hype.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers wondering if they should boost their coverage before
the calendar fills up with zeroes need to consider a crucial
question: Do you need more life insurance?
</P>
<P>
   If someone depends on your income and you don't have any, then
the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Those with some insurance need to sit down and figure out how
much money your loved ones would need if you died today.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, calculate your monthly expenses and think about what
future plans you want to fund. If you want the mortgage paid off, a
child's college education funded or your spouse to be able to stop
working, then you need to have enough insurance to cover all of
that.
</P>
<P>
   Rules of thumb, such as being insured for seven times your
annual income, really don't cut it. But you can use that to get
started if thinking about your bills, debts and mortality is just
too depressing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHOLE LIFE PRICES COULD DROP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once you've determined your coverage level, you need to decide
what type of policy best suits your financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   Term insurance provides protection for a specific amount of time
and pays a benefit only if you die during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent insurance gives lifelong protection and pays a death
benefit as long as your premiums are paid.
</P>
<P>
   The three types of permanent insurance are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whole or ordinary life, which has fixed premiums that build up
cash inside the policy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal or adjustable life, which has flexible premium
payment schedules and a guaranteed death benefit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Variable life, which ties death benefits and cash values to
the performance of an underlying investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Although term and universal may see rate increases, don't
automatically choose term over whole life.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the consumer-friendly Triple X rule is that it
used revised mortality tables to come up with the new reserve
requirements. That could have the unintended effect of lowering
whole life premiums.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this confuses you, talk to your insurance agent or a
financial planner about your current cash flow and your financial
goals. These professionals should be able to guide you to the best
type of policy for you.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use the Internet to research policies and check
rates. Visit Quotesmith.com or accuquotelife.com.
</P>
<P>
   But start searching soon. Getting life insurance is more
complicated than filling out an application.
</P>
<P>
   The underwriting process requires a medical exam, a credit
report, a driving record and other details of your health and
lifestyle. It typically takes life insurance companies 3 to 6 weeks
to set up a policy.
</P>
<P>
   And just like the other millennium bug, Triple X may prove to be
much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, of the life insurance council, says some companies will
be taking a wait-and-see approach to the rule for the first six
months of the new year. And if competition to write policies stays
strong, rate increases may not be as high as those predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But the bargain shopper in me says, if you need more insurance,
don't wait.
</P>

BOOKS THAT GO BEYOND `RED WITH MEAT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish Dr. Seuss were still around. I could make him still
another fortune and come off with a tidy little sum for myself.
How? Simple. Persuade him to write a how-to book about wine. You
know: big print, silly pictures, a 300-word vocabulary, mostly
one-syllable words like ``wine'' and ``vine,'' and a title like,
oh, how about ``The Ape That Ate the Grape''?
</P>
<P>
   It would be a smash! How do I know this? I don't, but year after
year at about this time, publishers pump out yet another batch of
wine primers. They are a brilliant lot, those publishers, so they
must know what they're doing. They have obviously tapped into an
insatiable demand for books that say yet again, and as cleverly as
possible, red with the meat and white with the fish.
</P>
<P>
   But concentrating on oversimplified, glossy gift books means
overlooking some less heralded but often intriguing things written
about wine that are not meant for neophytes. Some months ago, a
thoughtful reader put me on to a truly remarkable piece of American
social history, Madelon Powers' ``Faces Along the Bar: Lore and
Order in the Workingman's Saloon, 1870-1920'' (University of
Chicago Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   For the millions of immigrants to this country in the 19th and
early 20th centuries, the saloon was an indispensable source of
advice, education, information and relaxation. It took them out of
their fetid tenements, however briefly, and played a defining _ and
now almost forgotten _ role in shaping their new lives.
</P>
<P>
   With considerable skill, Ms. Powers steers a path through
sentimentalists like George Ade and Peter Finley Dunne and
reformers like Jane Addams and Jacob Riis, but uses them and a
hundred other sources to paint a vivid picture of both the
fellowship and the tragedy to be found in what has been called the
``poor man's club.''
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations are worth the price of the book. One shows a
map of a section of Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1894. The area
bounded by the Bowery and Hester, Essex and East Houston Streets,
is shown to have had a population of 49,359 people and 237 saloons,
or a saloon for every 208 residents. ``Ah, the Irish,'' one is
tempted to say. No, the map is titled, ``Jewish Quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a totally different vein, ``Wine From Sky to Earth'' (Acres
U.S.A., $24) by Nicolas Joly, the father of the biodynamic movement
among winemakers, explains how he left investment banking and
returned to his family's vineyards along the Loire, bringing with
him an entirely new way of looking at grape growing and winemaking.
He demystifies biodynamics, which calls for the abandonment of all
chemical fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides, as he argues that
the process involves a return to old ways, not a leap into
something new and untried.
</P>
<P>
   As David Ridgway, the sommelier at Tour d'Argent in Paris, says
in his preface to Joly's book, ``We acknowledge the influence of
the moon, sun and stars on the tides, but at present we deny that
the same effects extend to grapevines.''
</P>
<P>
   Biodynamics has been called extreme organic farming. But Joly
has imparted his enthusiasm and his methods to hundreds of
winemakers around the world, including some of the most famous.
Now, he has produced a highly readable and most valuable book for
anyone interested in the future of wine and the grapes from which
it is made.
</P>
<P>
   Most wine books, like many of the wine fan magazines, are
treacly encomiums to the industry and the winemakers. So, ``The
Wrath of Grapes'' (Spike, $13.50) by Lewis Perdue offers a
much-needed, unsugared view of the wine business and the people who
run it. Instead of giving lush descriptions of vineyards and rare
wines, he talks about overproduction, flat consumption, an
antiquated distribution system, unstoppable vineyard diseases and a
host of other problems besetting America's winemakers. At the same
time, he suggests some fascinating ways to capitalize on the
industry's problems, from investing in undervalued stocks to buying
good, undervalued wines. You will be intrigued by his lists of the
most underrated wines, like Shafer Vineyards, and overrated wines,
Dom Perignon. This is a good little book for counteracting wine
industry hype.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Sense of Place: An Intimate Portrait of the
Niebaum-Coppola Winery and the Napa Valley'' (Routledge, $24.95),
Steven Kolpan, who teaches wine studies at the Culinary Institute
of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., offers a discerning view of the
winery created and owned by Francis Ford Coppola. Much of the
material about the sad demise of the original Inglenook Vineyards
has appeared elsewhere, but Kolpan is particularly good on the
contributions of the Mexican laborers who quietly perform so much
of the work that goes into making Napa Valley wines.
</P>
<P>
   As for those easy-reading wine guides, two are worth a mention.
With the 14th edition of his ``Windows on the World Complete Wine
Course'' now out (Sterling, $24.95), Kevin Zraly is the grandfather
of wine-primer writers, and his book the McGuffy's Reader of wine
books. His never-flagging enthusiasm for wine bounces off every
page, just as Zraly bounces around the room during his wine
lectures. In a classroom, expounding on the glories of Burgundy _
or anything else _ he is a one-man Cirque du Soleil. But his book
is still the best of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are also a couple of new kids on the block who
_ although I wouldn't swear to this _ seem to be fixing to
out-Zraly Zraly. Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, a
wife-and-husband team who write a popular weekly wine column for
The Wall Street Journal, have produced a lighthearted and
informative little book called ``The Wall Street Journal Guide to
Wine'' (Broadway Books, $25). Their enthusiasm for the grape, which
can border on the manic (they love the word ``wow''), is exceeded
only by their enthusiasm for each other. It spills over on every
other page. They are the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald of
wine.

SCALLOPS, PLUS CRUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scallops have so many virtues _ they're tender, fast cooking,
high in protein and flavorful _ that they are perfect for weeknight
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of simple ways to serve them after they have
been simply seared, beginning with lemon and continuing with pan
sauces, made by adding other ingredients to the skillet after the
scallops are cooked. These take advantage of the flavors and
caramelized sugars left behind by the scallops.
</P>
<P>
   Few pan sauces add texture, however, and I wanted both flavor
and crunch. When I turned to almonds, an obvious solution, I was
distressed that I had only skin-on nuts. I decided to try them
anyway, and the result was amazing: a small handful of chopped
almonds added not only contrasting texture but rich, deep color as
well.
</P>
<P>
   When I later tried the recipe with blanched almonds, they
produced less color and crunch. I have since discovered that
chopped walnuts and pecans work just as well as almonds.
</P>
<P>
   I used sea scallops, but if you can find true bay scallops from
Nantucket or Long Island the results will be even better. Just
reduce the cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   SEA SCALLOPS WITH ALMOND SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   About 1{ pounds sea or bay scallops
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Pinch cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup roughly chopped almonds, skin on
</P>
<P>
   } cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Chopped parsley for garnish, optional. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine oil and half the butter in a large skillet,
preferably nonstick, and turn heat to medium-high. Sprinkle
scallops with salt and cayenne. When butter foam subsides, add
scallops to pan, one at a time (or all at once if you're using bay
scallops), and turn heat to high. Cook about 2 minutes, or until
one side browns, then turn and brown other side for a minute or two
longer. (If you like scallops more well done, cook a couple of
minutes more.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove scallops to a plate, and keep warm. Add nuts to
skillet over high heat, and cook, stirring, a minute or two, until
dark brown. Add wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
reduced to a syrup, about 5 minutes. Add remaining butter; when it
has thickened, pour over scallops. Garnish with parsley if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 to 4 servings.

DR. FEELGOOD'S EATING WELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie? ``You might as well put this right up there on the
food pyramid,'' said Dr. Eric Rimm, an associate professor of
epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health,
getting into the spirit of this week's Eating Well column which, in
honor of the season, has been temporarily renamed Dr. Feelgood's
Eating Well column.
</P>
<P>
   Eggnog? Caviar? Help yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers of Eating Well, who may be certain I have taken
leave of my senses, can be assured that all I have done is come to
grips with reality. There is no sense in railing about fat and
calories during the holidays, because one or two days of
overindulgence are not going to kill anyone and are even unlikely
to cause weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the number of calories needed for weight
maintenance, a person would have to consume 5,000 to 7,000 calories
in a day to gain any weight at all, and it's not likely to be even
close to a pound, said Dr. Wayne Calloway, an obesity specialist
and an associate clinical professor of medicine at George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind I decided to look on the bright side of our
annual holiday orgy of eating, and I found all kinds of good stuff
for your body as well as your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in between the cholesterol and the saturated fat, the
calories and the salt in the foie gras, the sausage stuffing and
the standing rib roast, there are dozens of nutrients that are
highly recommended by the food police. These are the vitamins and
minerals and phytochemicals that may prevent cancer and heart
disease and a host of other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone already knows that chocolate is a health food: Two
pounds of it, particularly dark chocolate, has the same
cancer-fighting antioxidants as a quart of tea.
</P>
<P>
   But did you know that each time you eat a three-ounce piece of
pumpkin pie you may well be reducing your risk of cataracts and
macular degeneration? The pumpkin in that small wedge of pie is
filled with carotenoids, almost 3,000 micrograms of beta carotene,
1,900 of alpha carotene and 400 of lutein, the carotenoid connected
with cataract prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Before dinner you might have some heart-healthy caviar: Its fats
are mostly mono- and polyunsaturated, and those are preferable to
saturated fat. Wait _ that's not all. Caviar is loaded with iron,
which helps the blood, and with magnesium and selenium. It has
reasonably good amounts of &UR;  &LR; B12 and folate, which reduces the risk
of birth defects. As for its levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which
protect against heart attacks, they are absolutely great. That
benediction comes from Bonnie Liebman at the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, not exactly a champion of wretched excess.
</P>
<P>
   How about the silken unctuousness of foie gras? Have a second
helping because liver is a significant source of copper, necessary
to make hemoglobin in the blood, and of iron, especially important
for women. And it is packed with selenium, as much as 22 times the
recommended daily allowance, which may reduce the risk of prostate
cancer. Foie gras is not bad in the B vitamin department either; in
fact it's got far more vitamin B12 than the recommended daily
requirement, and B12 helps to prevent neurological problems. Foie
gras also has a significant amount of vitamin A, a precursor of
those carotenoids.
</P>
<P>
   Standing rib roast is a must even though it is not exactly
perceived as health food. It is hard to get enough B12 in the diet
without eating meat. Team the foie gras with the rib roast, and you
get a double whammy: Three ounces of foie gras and a six-ounce slab
of beef provide 10 milligrams of iron, more than half the daily
iron requirement. Any other time of year, nutritionists recommend
three ounces of meat (about the size of a deck of cards) as an
appropriate serving size, but this is Christmas!
</P>
<P>
   Even fruitcake has its merits, although it is not everyone's
favorite. What with all those fruits and nuts. Three ounces has
three grams of fiber, which is about 10 percent of the recommended
daily amount. But that's not all. There are also about 20
micrograms of lycopene in that fruitcake, not a great deal, but
every microgram counts in efforts to reduce the risk of prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   You will also get some fiber from Granny's rich
sausage-oyster-cornbread stuffing, not to mention selenium, folate,
iron and tons of zinc. Zinc aids healing and immune function. Both
the cornbread and the oysters add some lutein.
</P>
<P>
   And this just in. All alcohol, not just wine, may be good for
you, providing a superb excuse for indulging in several well-spiked
cups of eggnog, a drink that also contains an excellent source of
protein. A study reported in this week's British Medical Journal
reaffirms the notion that distilled spirits are as effective as
wine or beer in reducing the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   So now you know the little secret that nutritionists have kept
to themselves for years. Buried in the foods that may clog your
arteries and make you fat are nutritional treasures.
</P>
<P>
   If you insist on knowing the information that has been purposely
been excluded here, you can log onto the Agriculture Department's
Web site, www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/, and look it up for
yourself. I'm certainly not going to spoil this column by telling
you.

 UNDATED: most content.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other Internet start-ups are expanding their offerings by making
publishing as democratic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain.com is an online seller of technical and computer books
that started a few years ago in a Silicon Valley garage. Last month
it announced the infusion of $20 million in venture capital to
support a publishing program that allows authors to sell their
works online for a 50 percent royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been the appearance of such works as Richard
Bach's ``Air Ferrets Aloft.'' A Fatbrain.com summary describes the
title as ``the first widely published disclosure of the remarkable
activities of the world's domesticated ferret community, told
through the stories of outstanding individual animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon to come: ``Philosopher Ferrets in the Wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there is some uncertainty about whether this new
technology will produce a wider selection or simply digital slush.
</P>
<P>
   NetLibrary, for instance, will not accept any self-published
titles on its site. The company's view is that books have more
credibility when they are screened and filtered by professional
editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowing people to post their titles,'' said
Melancon. ``If you do, it devalues the other books, because it
doesn't have credibility. Say I go to a Web site and I look up
books on low birth weight and prenatal care in developing
countries. I pull up a book by Sam Jones and I have no idea who Sam
Jones is.''
</P>
<P>
   The prices of netLibrary's books are the same as those of print
versions, but other companies are already starting to experiment
with e-book price discounts because of reduced costs for storage,
inventory and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Zero Heure, a French publisher founded two years ago, is able to
offer discounts for electronic titles that the Bertelsmann-owned
online bookseller Bol.Fr cannot match for printed versions because
of European rules regulating cover prices for conventional books.
</P>
<P>
   A minute after an order is placed, the electronic publisher will
e-mail some of the latest French best sellers at one-third off the
list price to American customers with no access to print versions
in stores here.
</P>
<P>
   Zero Heure is buying the electronic rights for print books, but
is also publishing its own original titles. Next month, for
instance, the company intends to publish ``Ici Kaboul,'' an ongoing
book about an Afghan woman's experiences in Kabul that will be
updated quarterly with new electronic chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's writing a chronicle of her life, and this could continue
as long as she wants,'' said Jean-Pierre Arbon, one of the
company's founders and the former managing director of Flammarion.
</P>
<P>
   This experimentation with literary forms has spread to nouveau
companies with no publishing experience such as CyberGold, an
e-commerce company that offers an array of digital products.
</P>
<P>
   This month, CyberGold featured its first electronic title,
``Dark Again,'' a thriller by David Saperstein, the author of the
book ``Cocoon,'' which inspired the movie of the same name. It is
available for $7.50 for the entire book or 50 cents a chapter. Each
chapter includes additional material _ from the assassin's
corporate memos to diary entries.
</P>
<P>
   One basic question that all these companies must confront is
whether readers will warm to the new forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like netFind, are counting on a generation of
young readers, weaned on computers, who are ready to read on
screens. But as skeptics have pointed out, for years to come
companies will also have to reach the much larger group of older
readers to make the market viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 48, and for me I can't do it,'' confessed Dillon, who is
in charge of acquiring electronic titles for the University of
Texas. ``But my kids are in high school and they read books from
beginning to end on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his personal misgivings, he is betting on a generational
shift that will raise the popularity of e-books. He noted, for
example, that the library had expected that readers would be
interested only in electronic versions exploring computer topics.
But the taste in digital fare is far more eclectic, with readers
checking out titles from ``Art Ideology and Economics in Nazi
Germany'' to ``100 Years of Tomorrow: Brazilian Women's Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to put the money there, because we're guessing
that's what will happen,'' he said of student demand. ``It's
getting harder and harder to get them to go into their car to come
to the library.''

<HEADLINE>
TO CULTIVATE A CHILD'S INTEREST IN READING, CHOOSE BOOKS THAT ARE
FUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent mark needed over e in Pokemon) 
 
By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagination and creativity are the wings of one's mind. On these
two wings, you will fly high and far.
</P>
<P>
   Jean and Mou-Sien Tseng used these words to explain how they
feel about illustrating children's books.
</P>
<P>
   But those two sentences also describe the essence of children's
books, and why so many work so hard to put books in children's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Give a book and you give a window, a magic carpet, a gift which
reaches beyond a single volume.
</P>
<P>
   To select a book:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get one the child will enjoy reading. That may not be the one
with the fancy cover. Or the one with a moral that a child
``should'' read. Remember, the book is not as important as the fact
that a child is reading.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select one with quality paper and a sturdy binding that will
withstand many little hands and readings.
</P>
<P>
   _ A picture book should be an artistic achievement. Children
appreciate nuance as much as adults. Pictures don't have to look
like the cartoons they see on TV, all brightly colored and cute.
</P>
<P>
   _ Books should fit a child's reading and interest level. But
age-appropriate labels are only guides. Some children can handle
``Bridge to Terabithia'' at 8, others not until 12.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put by Eden Ross Lipson, author of the ``New York Times
Parent's Guide to the Best Books for Children'' (Random House,
$15): ``... In choosing or giving books, remember to try to find
titles that children can embrace, not suffer; seize, not shove away
for the deferred or postponed gratification of something to `grow
into,' like a winter coat.''
</P>
<P>
   She tells the story of Beverly Cleary, author of the Ramona
series, who said, ``When I was a child, a relative gave me
`Ivanhoe' to grow into. I was so disappointed that I still have not
grown into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Books can be classics, they can be notable award winners, they
can be just plain fun. Fiction or nonfiction. Silly, sassy or
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   But they must speak to the child looking at the pictures,
reading or listening to the words.
</P>
<P>
   These, culled from hundreds of new books, are lively, quality
books, beautifully written and illustrated. They are delightful to
read aloud. They will capture hearts, imaginations and attention.
They will live longer in a child's mind than a Pokemon game and
Millennium Barbies. They will help instill a love of reading, the
most precious gift you can give a child.
</P>
<P>
   But they are only a place to start.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOR THE VERY, VERY YOUNG &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``First Night'' (G.P. Putnam, $15.99), by Harriet Ziefert,
marches along as Amanda Dade leads the parade. Others fill in the
New Year's event but Amanda Dade leads. The repeating verse helps
children learn words and sounds. S.D. Schindler's illustrations of
colored pencils and Magic Markers on midnight blue pastel paper are
stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Are You Peeling? Foods with Moods'' (Scholastic, $15.95)
takes an old theme and illustrates it with goofy personified
vegetables and fruit. An orange screaming. A silly kiwi.
Delightfully delicious!
</P>
<P>
   ``Tucker Flips!'' (Dutton, $9.99) is a pint-sized book for
pint-sized hands. Puppy Tucker dreams of playing with children. He
even practices ... and learns to flip! The bold, colorful drawings
will keep tiny eyes sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOR AGES 4 TO 8 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Books for beginning readers can, of course, still be read aloud.
Author and reading-aloud advocate Jim Trelease writes that ``almost
as big a mistake as not reading to children at all is stopping too
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Night Iguana Left Home'' (DK, $15.95), by megan McDonald
with illustrations by Ponder Goembel, is at once loopy and sweet.
Even the most cherished pet dreams, and Iguana, who lives with her
``almost sister'' Alison, dreams of a warm-weather vacation by the
sea. She takes off on a well-planned but mishap-prone trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Make Me Laugh'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $16) is by
the wonderful James Stevenson. Sorry, can't say much about this
because the story line is a secret. But here's a hint: You may feel
like laughing but you don't. No laughing allowed when reading this
book. None. Delightful read-aloud book for even the most solemn
child and curmudgeonly adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swine Lake'' (HarperCollins, $15.95) leaps from the famous
minds of author James Marshall (the prince who gave us ``George and
Martha'') and artist Maurice Sendak (the king who gave us ``Where
the Wild Things Are''). Their partnership is what is special about
this book. Pigs on pointe. Hungry wolf in a box seat. Getting
caught up in the moment. The power of a positive review. What a
tasty treat!
</P>
<P>
   ``Do You Want To Play? A Book About Being Friends'' (Dutton,
$15.99) has a simple story and a zany circus of characters that
keeps each page buzzing like a beehive. Learning to be a friend _
from sharing and fighting to apologizing to playing alone _ may be
a blatant message, but who cares? Bob Kolar's art is like romping
through a toy store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the Apple Pie?'' (Philomel, $15.99) is best when read
aloud. The nonsense tale of a missing pie's journey around the
world is just plain fun from Ukrainian emigrant Valeri Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's A Wardrobe in My Monster!'' (Carolrhoda, $15.95) tells
about what happens when Martha, bored with ordinary pets, gets a
great big, ugly monster at the pet store. Original. Delightful.
Adrienne Geoghegan wrote, and Adrian Johnson illustrated, with
panache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Piccolo's Easy Chair'' (DK, $15.95) will send kids into
fits of the giggles. One day Mrs. Piccolo's big chair follows her
to the grocery in search of its favorite snack _ cheese puffs.
Author Jean Jackson has an extraordinary imagination, as does
illustrator Diane Greenseid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma Fina and Her Wonderful Umbrellas'' (Cinco Puntos,
$15.95), from a small press in El Paso, is called a bilingual early
reader. Benjamin Alire Saenz's Grandma Fina is a kind feisty lady
who is loved by the whole community. Every person invited to her
birthday party decides what she needs most is a new umbrella. But
what's a grandma to do with all those umbrellas! Geronimo Garcia's
illustrations make you love Grandma Fina even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullfrog Pops!'' (Gibbs-Smith, $15.95) puts a cocky animal in
a pickle and watches what happens. Rick Walton's tale and Chris
McAllister's hilarious paintings fill this book with color, humor
and a big, fat, extraordinarily hungry and ornery bullfrog. Has
Bullfrog met his match in Ravenous Gulch? This is another to read
aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Escape from City Zoo'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux,
$16) is from Australian cartoonist Tohby Riddle. A band of unlikely
buddies do what few have dared _ they break out of city zoo. The
fugitives' quest for a new life puts them into some sweet and some
funny scenes. But they can't escape their past. Here's sweet
suspense, silly surprises and intriguing black and white
illustration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOR AGES 6 TO 10 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfume of Memory'' (Scholastic, $16.95) is an original
tale by Michelle Nikly, illustrated by Jean Claverie in soft,
dreamlike watercolors. Yasmin dreams of becoming the Royal Perfume
Maker, but the law forbids it. Only boys can compete, according to
an ancient, unfortunate law. But when the queen's memory is taken
away by an enemy, only young Yasmin figures out how to save the
kingdom and restore tradition and hope. Doing what is right is a
powerful thing, and even the youngest can summon that power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ghost of Shanghai'' (Abrams, $16.95) takes Li on a journey
across Shanghai to deliver the wedding dress her mother has made
for the wealthy Ha family. She is hit by a bicycle. As she lies in
the street, a ghost assures her she will be all right. But he has a
request. Li learns about justice and honor in this charming story
of contemporary China and a little girl with big dreams. Claude
Guillot wrote the story, which Fabienne Burckel vibrantly
illustrates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAMILY READ-ALOUD BOOKS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (Candlewick Press, $24.99)
was originally published in 1865. Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge
Dodgson) taught mathematics at Christ Church College, Oxford
University, and wrote the story for his dean's daughters. The story
is as magical as ever. Try this on the Harry Potter fans in your
house. This new version is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury, who adds
modern charm and a bit of whimsy that don't remind you a bit of
Disney's characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fairies' Ring: A Book of Fairy Stories &AMP; Poems'' (Dutton,
$24.99) is collected and adapted by Jane Yolen and illustrated by
Stephen Mackey. Even in this day of space alien teen-agers on TV
and creatures battling each other in video games, fairies are
magical. Their age-old allure is presented in this rich collection
of the familiar and unfamiliar and beautiful illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince and the Pauper'' (Dial, $17.99) was adapted by
Marianna Mayer from the Mark Twain novel of switched identities.
This is a worthy introduction to a classic story, one of the best
of many new adaptations on book shop shelves. Gary A. Lippincott's
engaging paintings brim with detail and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wings of an Artist: Children's Book Illustrators Talk About
Their Art'' (Abrams, $17.95), more than 20 celebrated children's

ROMANCING THE NUT: FIRST, GET IT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most kitchen equipment is purchased with the task in mind: You
want a tool that works easily and efficiently. So it is rare to
come across a tool like the nutcracker, which is used both for the
task and for the pleasure of breaking open a nut and retrieving the
meat.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts straight from the shell have much more flavor than those
bought shelled, so purist bakers want to shell nuts, and shell them
quickly. More often, though, nut cracking is an amusement for
people lounging by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why few nutcrackers look serious. You know when you put
a walnut in the mouth of a wooden squirrel that this is not about
cracking 10 nuts a minute. (With most squirrel or soldier
nutcrackers you may never get a nut open _ it always slips out of
the mouth.)
</P>
<P>
   The seven nutcrackers I tried were wildly different in
appearance, and none of them were very efficient. By design, they
crack only one nut at a time, and most nuts will still require a
little peeling by hand.
</P>
<P>
   I began with the most recognizable nutcracker, the spring-action
pincer-type with narrow steel handles; this one came with four
picks.
</P>
<P>
   With practice, you can get this nutcracker to work well. It will
split a walnut up its sides, and then you can pick out the halves.
But this nutcracker is flimsy and thin, so you could just as easily
squeeze too hard and smash the nut _ or a finger. Next to
familiarity, its price may be its best asset. The Quackenbush brand
is $3.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   High design hasn't necessarily helped the nutcracker. Oxo's
version was the clunker of the group. With a handle made of zinc,
it feels like an anvil. I thought the weight and wide shafts would
help hold the nut in place and crack it forcefully but slowly.
Instead, once the handles were squeezed, the weight only compounded
the force.
</P>
<P>
   The shell didn't just crack, it exploded. A hazelnut shell hit
me in the head; when I tried an almond, it blew to smithereens. The
Oxo is $11.95 at A Cook's Companion, 152 Atlantic Avenue (Clinton
Street), Cobble Hill, Brooklyn; (718) 852-6901.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect the same results from the Rocket, which looks
like a contraption made by someone who spends too much time in a
tool shed. But it works splendidly. You hold the nut, end to end,
between two cupped receptacles, then pull a lever _ like a beer
tap. The cups clench the nut and it cracks according to how hard
you pull the lever; the meat stays mostly in whole pieces. The
Rocket is $12.98 at Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   A similar concept applies to the Biesse nutcracker. The nut is
laid on a grooved rubber surface, under two overlapping levers.
When you lightly pound the top lever, the nut is cracked between
layers of rubber. The idea is fine, but the results inconsistent. I
was able to get whole meats from Brazil nuts, but walnuts broke
into large pieces, each of which had to be cracked.
</P>
<P>
   What I liked least about this tool, though, was the way it
removed you from the cracking. Nut cracking should be hands-on. The
Biesse is $7.99 at Chef Central, 240 Route 17 North, Paramus, N.J.;
(201) 576-0178.
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidt &AMP; Brendel nutcracker, a hand-held model, does manage
to break nuts gently. The nut is placed in a ridged cone. As you
squeeze the handles, the nut cracks and falls farther into the cone
and the handles crack at different points every time you squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the tool cracks the outer shell without crushing the
nut, then you have to peel away the shell and pick out the meat. It
is $14.99 at Chef Central.
</P>
<P>
   Zyliss recently introduced a nutcracker similar to the Schmidt &AMP;
Brendel but without the cone. It is the best design of the six
all-purpose crackers. A round cavity holds the nut; as you squeeze,
a ridged piece presses against the nut and cracks it. The cavity
contains the shell as it shatters, and you don't have to press too
hard and risk an exploding nut. The construction is solid and
hefty, with a comfortable matte surface, which helps you grip.
Every nut I cracked came out in one piece. It's $13.98 at Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   One specialized nutcracker, the Mono walnut opener, is a silky
stainless-steel disk, shaped much like the Batman symbol and
attached to a thin leather string. Its surface has just a slight
indentation where your thumb is placed, but the depth is so perfect
and so comfortable that it fits right into your hand.
</P>
<P>
   It actually works, too. All you do is press the center point
into the base of the walnut, then turn it like a key. The nut
splits in half flawlessly, and you can use the other points to pry
up the meat. It's $19.50 at the MOMA Design Store, 44 West 53rd
Street; (212) 708-9669.

 &HT;    NURSING HOMES THAT HURT PATIENTS NOW SUBJECT TO STIFF FINES
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nursing homes that harm patients can be given steep
fines under new federal orders issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If those orders had been in effect last year, 12 percent of the
nation's 17,000 nursing homes would have been fined, said Nancy-Ann
DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, which
oversees Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, nursing homes have received warnings and minimal
fines which gave them little incentive to make long-term
corrections to problems, DeParle said at a breakfast with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in what she described as a ``yo-yo effect'' of
homes complying with regulations for a brief period and then
violating them again without fear of significant sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put that to an end by making a deterrent so
that it would not be in a nursing home's interest to wait it out,''
DeParle said, noting that thus far ``it has not been in their
interest ... to spend the money to fix the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Under DeParle's new instructions, states must impose sanctions,
which could range up to a $10,000 fine for each violation, whenever
a nursing home is found to have caused harm to a patient on two
consecutive inspections. The injuries do not have to have been
caused by the same violation for a home to be sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes are inspected by the states on a roughly annual
basis, but homes would be subject to more frequent inspections if
problems are identified or if there are complaints.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office study in June predicted that stiffer
federal sanctions would be effective in reducing harm to nursing
home patients. In its study of 107 nursing home inspections, the
GAO found 201 cases of harm to patients, including bed sores,
broken bones, severe weight loss, burns and death.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle's orders also give the states greater authority to
sanction nursing homes that don't meet certain health and safety
regulations by denying Medicare and Medicaid payments for new
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Homes that do not fix serious problems could lose their
contracts for Medicare and Medicaid payments entirely.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle's instructions are part of a broad effort by the Clinton
administration to make nursing homes safer for their 1.6 million
elderly and disabled residents.
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget this year includes more than $50 million to
enhance nursing home safety enforcement. Since the spring, federal
officials have trained more than 600 state and federal survey
managers.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration has put a priority in
getting inspectors to focus on problems such as preventing bed
sores, malnutrition and physical abuse in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also released a new pamphlet, ``Your Guide to
Choosing a Nursing Home,'' to answer questions about selecting a
nursing home. The guide is available by calling 1-800-MEDICARE
(1-800-633-4227).
</P>
<P>
   People interested in comparing local facilities can get data
related to residents' health status at Medicare and
Medicaid-certified nursing homes through the Health Care Financing
Administration's Internet site at www.medicare.gov.

WHERE THE BUFFALOES ROAM, MOZZARELLA IS MADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPACCIO SCALO, Italy _ On March 23, 1787, the great German
poet, dramatist, scientist and aesthete, Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe, headed southeast by carriage from Naples to the Gulf of
Salerno.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove by rough and muddy roads toward some beautifully
shaped mountains,'' he wrote in his journal. ``We crossed brooks
and flooded places, where we looked into the savage, blood-red eyes
of buffaloes. They looked like hippopotamuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the roads are paved and the marshes have been drained.
But the ruins of the noble Greek temples at Paestum, which thrilled
Goethe to the tips of his toes, are still standing on the broad
coastal plain, right beside the sea, and the descendants of his
buffaloes roam nearby. They have gentle eyes with Betty Boop
lashes, and they look nothing like hippopotamuses.
</P>
<P>
   But they produce the ultra-rich milk that goes into mozzarella,
one of those regional delicacies that is imitated everywhere and
duplicated nowhere. Cow's milk has about 3.5 percent butterfat,
buffalo milk about 9 percent; not surprisingly, cows'-milk
mozzarella, known as fior di latte, which can be made anywhere, is
a lot leaner. It melts better (and hence is the perfect pizza
cheese), but it never approaches the richness and subtlety that
buffalo milk gives.
</P>
<P>
   The production of mozzarella is confined by Italian law to
buffalo milk, and thus to Salerno, the province south of Naples,
and Caserta, the province to the north, the only two places in the
country suited to the raising of buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations do not limit its consumption to this region, which
is called Campania, but they might as well. Genuine mozzarella
travels worse than a colic-plagued baby. Its characteristic taste,
which is mild with salty, lactic and nutty overtones, and texture,
which must be springy but not rubbery, begin to deteriorate soon
after it reaches its peak on the second day after manufacture. At
its best, the cheese oozes whey when cut; a fine mozzarella is as
juicy as one of Harry &AMP; David's pears. Chilling the cheese,
unfortunately, kills it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian buffalo-milk mozzarella makes it to New York. But
it is mostly pasteurized _ a no-no to connoisseurs _ and sometimes
over the hill by the time it reaches stores.
</P>
<P>
   The only mozzarella di bufala made in the United States comes
from a company called Italcheese in Norwalk, Calif., which is run
by Virgilio Cicconi, an immigrant from Italy. But it is kneaded and
shaped by machine, not by hand, which changes the texture, and it
is available only on the West Coast, mostly in Southern California
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   In Naples, true buffalo-milk mozzarella is ubiquitous _ on the
antipasto table, in salads, as a filling in fritters, in the
glorified toasted cheese sandwich known as mozzarella in carrozza
(literally, cheese in a carriage). But it is rare north of Rome and
scarce even there.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the world _ well, the world of Italian cheese
lovers, anyway, along with a few foreign interlopers _ beats a path
to Antonio Palmieri's door near this hamlet 25 miles southeast of
Salerno.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens wrote that people in this part of Italy didn't so much
live their lives as enact them. He could have been talking about
Palmieri. Slim, faultlessly tailored, with a dapper mustache, he
looks more like a matinee idol than a farmer, but a farmer he is.
He runs Caseificio Vannulo, the Vannulo dairy farm, which makes
almost 900 pounds of mozzarella every day, entirely by hand, from
the unpasteurized milk of its 350-buffalo herd, one of only three
in Italy fed completely on organic forage. It may well be the best
mozzarella anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   You can see evidence of that in the dairy's parking lot, which
is filled with cars of people from all over Italy who come to buy
mozzarella. Palmieri sells his entire output at the dairy, with a
single exception: a small amount goes directly to the region's only
Michelin three-star restaurant, Don Alfonso 1890. Because none of
his output enter retail commerce, he does not need to put his
cheese, with its preservative bath of milky water, into the sealed
and dated plastic packages that the government requires as a
protection against contamination and spoilage. Along with many
traditional mozzarella-makers, Palmieri thinks packaging harms the
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mozzare'' means ``to lop off'', and cutting or breaking a
small piece of cheese from a larger one is a key step in the
manufacturing process, which is carried out here by men in
T-shirts, caps, trousers and rubber boots as white as the
mozzarella they make.
</P>
<P>
   The product begins life as a tofu-like curd, to which boiling
water is added. That makes the ``dough'' stringy, and as it is
kneaded by one man and stirred with a pole by another, it quickly
turns into something glossier and silkier. Excess water is scooped
off, and when the consistency is right, one man holds up a
football-size chunk of cheese and another breaks off a fistful,
using his fingers like pincers.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting cheeses _ braids called treccie, rounds the size
of baseballs or grapefruits, and little mouthfuls called bocconcini
_ are dropped into tubs of salted water, where they cure for
several hours. As the mozzarella cools, the workers told me, its
center gets rubbery. Eight hours later, it starts to ``relax,'' and
by the second day the cheese reaches its apogee. By the fifth day,
it will no longer be fit to eat fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Mozzarella di bufala is a very old product, wrapped in tradition
and superstition. Up until the 1960s, a farmhand would wear a
buffalo skin when a baby buffalo died in hopes of assuaging the
mother's grief and improving her milk.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be said that buffaloes could not be milked by
machine; the Palmieri operation disproved that. It used to be
thought that buffaloes had to spend large parts of their lives
wallowing in mud to protect their skin; half of the Palmieri
animals now live mud-free lives.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows for sure where the buffaloes came from in the
first place. Some local mozzarella mavens say the original herds
were brought to Italy from India by way of Greece in the sixth
century. Others say they came from Africa with layovers in the Arab
world and then in Sicily. In any event, they differ markedly from
American bison; they have no shaggy cowl, and their horns are
straighter.
</P>
<P>
   Because buffalo-milk mozzarella costs three times as much as
fior di latte, many makers use a blend of 30 percent buffalo milk
and 70 percent cows' milk. Some falsify their labels. But for the
knowing eye, there is a dead giveaway. The genuine article is
pearly white, because buffalo milk contains no carotene, the orange
hydrocarbon found in carrots and other vegetables. Carotene in
cows' milk makes fior di latte yellowish.
</P>
<P>
   But does it all matter? Is there a real difference? I used to
have my doubts. But they were erased by tasting the best of both
cheeses at the source _ fior di latte from Latticini Cordiale on
the Sorrento peninsula one day, Caseificio Vannulo's mozzarella the
next. I'm convinced now that it's no contest. It's the difference
between a juicy vine-ripened tomato from your own garden and a
rock-hard hothouse special.
</P>
<P>
   Mozzarella at its best is one of the world's greatest cheeses,
simultaneously sweet and pungent. Fior di latte, good as it can be,
is never much more than a pizza topping.

WINE INDUSTRY FORESEES VINDICATION ON HEALTH ADVISORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's wine industry is not happy about
the federal government's decision to temporarily halt a program
that lets the industry tout the apparent health benefits of wine on
its labels.
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts and bottlers said Monday that they were
nonetheless confident that planned hearings on the program would
put the issue of labeling to rest for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think an educated public is better than an uneducated
public. The scientific community's research is really going to be
our response,'' said John De Luca, president of the Wine Institute,
a San Francisco-based association that represents more than 500
members in California.
</P>
<P>
   Yielding to pressure from Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for the time being put the
cork on the 10-month-old practice of permitting wine labels to
allude to the apparent healthful benefits of wine. The agency plans
hearings on the labeling next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, the liquor industry's most outspoken and powerful
congressional critic, has been fighting the wine industry over
labeling for years, introducing legislation to prevent the
marketing ploy and, at one point, accusing the Wine Institute and
senior government officials of conspiring to manipulate government
nutritional guidelines to promote the sale of alcohol based on its
health benefits. Thurmond's daughter was killed by a drunken
driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ill effects of alcohol are well documented,'' Thurmond
said in his response to the ATF's latest directive. ``The
government should not dilute the negative repercussions of alcohol
consumption by allowing labels which may confuse the public.''
</P>
<P>
   De Luca said the policy to allow the labels has been precarious
since the ATF approved it in February for the J. Lohr and Laurel
Glen wineries. Officials with ATF made clear at the time that they
intended to hold public hearings that could result in a change of
policy, De Luca said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the ATF has approved 98 labels for 17 wineries.
Those wineries will be permitted to use their labels, but what will
happen to future applicants will likely be determined after the
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Although studies show that moderate wine drinking is associated
with reduced risk of heart attack, the labels are not permitted to
make explicit health claims. Instead, they generally refer
consumers to their doctors or suggest they send away for the
government's ``Dietary Guidelines for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The dietary guidelines, under lobbying from California's $6.3
billion-a-year wine industry, were revised in 1995 to become more
wine-friendly.
</P>

<P>
   Most kitchen equipment is purchased with the task in mind: You
want a tool that works easily and efficiently. So it is rare to
come across a tool like the nutcracker, which is used both for the
task and for the pleasure of breaking open a nut and retrieving the
meat.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts straight from the shell have much more flavor than those
bought shelled, so purist bakers want to shell nuts, and shell them
quickly. More often, though, nut cracking is an amusement for
people lounging by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why few nutcrackers look serious. You know when you put
a walnut in the mouth of a wooden squirrel that this is not about
cracking 10 nuts a minute. (With most squirrel or soldier
nutcrackers you may never get a nut open _ it always slips out of
the mouth.)
</P>
<P>
   The seven nutcrackers I tried were wildly different in
appearance, and none of them were very efficient. By design, they
crack only one nut at a time, and most nuts will still require a
little peeling by hand.
</P>
<P>
   I began with the most recognizable nutcracker, the spring-action
pincer-type with narrow steel handles; this one came with four
picks.
</P>
<P>
   With practice, you can get this nutcracker to work well. It will
split a walnut up its sides, and then you can pick out the halves.
But this nutcracker is flimsy and thin, so you could just as easily
squeeze too hard and smash the nut _ or a finger. Next to
familiarity, its price may be its best asset. The Quackenbush brand
is $3.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2000.
</P>
<P>
   High design hasn't necessarily helped the nutcracker. Oxo's
version was the clunker of the group. With a handle made of zinc,
it feels like an anvil. I thought the weight and wide shafts would
help hold the nut in place and crack it forcefully but slowly.
Instead, once the handles were squeezed, the weight only compounded
the force.
</P>
<P>
   The shell didn't just crack, it exploded. A hazelnut shell hit
me in the head; when I tried an almond, it blew to smithereens. The
Oxo is $11.95 at A Cook's Companion, 152 Atlantic Avenue (Clinton
Street), Cobble Hill, Brooklyn; (718) 852-6901.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect the same results from the Rocket, which looks
like a contraption made by someone who spends too much time in a
tool shed. But it works splendidly. You hold the nut, end to end,
between two cupped receptacles, then pull a lever _ like a beer
tap. The cups clench the nut and it cracks according to how hard
you pull the lever; the meat stays mostly in whole pieces. The
Rocket is $12.98 at Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   A similar concept applies to the Biesse nutcracker. The nut is
laid on a grooved rubber surface, under two overlapping levers.
When you lightly pound the top lever, the nut is cracked between
layers of rubber. The idea is fine, but the results inconsistent. I
was able to get whole meats from Brazil nuts, but walnuts broke
into large pieces, each of which had to be cracked.
</P>
<P>
   What I liked least about this tool, though, was the way it
removed you from the cracking. Nut cracking should be hands-on. The
Biesse is $7.99 at Chef Central, 240 Route 17 North, Paramus, N.J.;
(201) 576-0178.
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidt &AMP; Brendel nutcracker, a hand-held model, does manage
to break nuts gently. The nut is placed in a ridged cone. As you
squeeze the handles, the nut cracks and falls farther into the cone
and the handles crack at different points every time you squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the tool cracks the outer shell without crushing the
nut, then you have to peel away the shell and pick out the meat. It
is $14.99 at Chef Central.
</P>
<P>
   Zyliss recently introduced a nutcracker similar to the Schmidt &AMP;
Brendel but without the cone. It is the best design of the six
all-purpose crackers. A round cavity holds the nut; as you squeeze,
a ridged piece presses against the nut and cracks it. The cavity
contains the shell as it shatters, and you don't have to press too
hard and risk an exploding nut. The construction is solid and
hefty, with a comfortable matte surface, which helps you grip.
Every nut I cracked came out in one piece. It's $13.98 at Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   One specialized nutcracker, the Mono walnut opener, is a silky
stainless-steel disk, shaped much like the Batman symbol and
attached to a thin leather string. Its surface has just a slight
indentation where your thumb is placed, but the depth is so perfect
and so comfortable that it fits right into your hand.
</P>
<P>
   It actually works, too. All you do is press the center point
into the base of the walnut, then turn it like a key. The nut
splits in half flawlessly, and you can use the other points to pry
up the meat. It's $19.50 at the MOMA Design Store, 44 West 53rd
Street; (212) 708-9669.

 &HT;    FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEATEN Y2K BUG, CLINTON SAYS
 &HT;    260&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton congratulated federal workers
Tuesday for ridding the government of virtually all Y2K computer
bugs that threatened operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done our job,'' he said, citing a new Y2K report by
the White House's Office of Management and Budget showing that 99.7
percent of ``mission-critical'' computers have been cleared of
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton predicted the year rollover will produce only
``glitches'' that can be handled through backup plans now in place.
</P>
<P>
   The president's optimism was supported by the 11th and final OMB
quarterly report on the Y2K bug, a software flaw that could cause
some older computers to read only the last two digits of the date.
That seemingly small flaw could cause many computers to malfunction
or shut down on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   OMB said U.S. agencies have completed work on 6,159 computerized
systems critical to fulfilling the government's obligations. Only
16 systems are still being fixed, but that work will be completed
by the year-end deadline. A government computer that generates,
say, a holiday greeting to staff is not considered ``critical,''
while one that issues Social Security checks is.
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking Tuesday, the president's Y2K czar, John Koskinen,
told the National Press Club that because major industries ``are
basically done with their Y2K work ... we do not expect to see
major national failures'' in key sectors, such as power generation,
telecommunications or transportation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen himself seemed amazed at the surge of good reports on
Y2K. ``Serious people, two years ago, maintained there was no way
we would finish the work in time'' to avoid nightmares caused by
malfunctioning computers, he said. When he started heading the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion in February 1998, many
members of Congress were critical of the administration's Y2K
preparations. ``The consensus was that the government wouldn't make
it,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the World Bank said at the time that three-fourths
of the world's countries had not even begun to think about Y2K
problems. ``In short, the problem looked too mammoth, too
complicated and too interconnected to be solvable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What changed was that ``top management'' in both government and
private businesses finally realized that the problem was serious.
By spraying the bug with about $100 billion in labor and equipment,
U.S. government and industry leaders made dramatic progress in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his optimism, Koskinen predicted that ``the transition
to the new century will not be perfect.'' Some small businesses,
health care facilities and schools have been too slow to fix
problems, he said. A number of developing countries also are not
prepared for the date rollover.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Americans to prepare for a few days of potential
disruptions in business routines. So, for example, families should
make sure they get their prescriptions up-to-date and have some
ready-to-eat meals on hand in case they have to stay home in the
early days of 2000, he said.

   GERMANY-SLAVE-LABOR (Berlin) _ After months of bitter
negotiations, German industry and government officials agreed
Tuesday to establish a fund of roughly 10 billion marks or $5.1

signed the controversial accords that would give Panama full
territorial sovereignty and total responsibility for the canal.

on his first foray into politics in 1978, the winner of a Senate
seat from New Jersey. In 1984, he won re-election by one of the
largest margins in state history. So in 1990, when Bradley came
within 3 percentage points of losing his once safe bastion to an
unknown, poorly financed Republican named Christie Whitman, he was
devastated. To many of his critics and supporters alike, the

dealt a severe setback to Linda Tripp as she faces trial on
criminal charges for secretly tape-recording telephone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky that led to last year's
impeachment drama. Judge Diane O. Leasure ruled that the immunity
conferred on Mrs. Tripp by federal prosecutors in the independent
counsel's office investigating Clinton did not prevent Maryland
from bringing a prosecution for violating state wiretap laws. The
agreement only prevented the state from using information gathered
by the federal prosecutors after the immunity took effect. More
importantly, Leasure also ruled that immunity was not conferred on
Mrs. Tripp on Jan. 16, 1998, as she and the prosecutors believed.
That was the day that Mrs. Tripp turned over to the prosecutor's
office a handful of tape recordings of her conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky and received in exchange a letter from Jackie Bennett
saying she had immunity. Instead, the judge said that the immunity
did not make effect until Feb. 19, when a federal judge confirmed
the immunity agreement in a formal court order. By Neil A. Lewis.

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM MOON WON'T BE MUCH
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Call it the Millennium Moon, but don't look for too
much.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual combination of orbital mechanics will bring a full
moon into one of its closest approaches to Earth on Dec. 22, a time
when both will be closer than usual to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers say the effect, though rare, won't look particularly
impressive. If there were some way to put the Dec. 22 full moon
next to an ``ordinary'' full moon, they said, the human eye would
be unable to tell which was brighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be a torch in the sky, lighting up the night,''
said Yale University astronomer Bradley Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will not notice the difference,'' said research
scientist Ed Barker of the University of Texas's McDonald
Observatory in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the dates and distances:
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 winter solstice, the point at which the Earth's north
pole is tilted away from the sun at the greatest angle, will occur
at 5:44 a.m. EST on that day. Sixteen minutes later, at 6 a.m., the
moon's orbit will be at perigee, the point closest to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The distance between the two bodies at that time will be about
213,992 miles. The average distance is about 230,641 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The moon will be full a few hours later, at 12:31 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Earth-moon system, which also swings farther and
closer to the sun during the 365-day orbit, will be at
``perihelion,'' the point closest to the sun, on Jan 3.
</P>
<P>
   The three events _ moon perigee, Earth perihelion and a full
moon _ don't occur often, only once in about every 133 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the greater proximity to the Earth, the moon will
appear to be about 16 percent larger than normal that night.
</P>
<P>
   However, that happens several times every year, whenever the
full moon coincides with the moon's closest approach to the Earth
once every 27 days, Schaefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barker and Schaefer said they received a widely distributed
e-mail message describing the upcoming full moon in dramatic terms.
On a snow-covered terrain, the message declares, the moon will
appear so bright that car headlights will seem ``superfluous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, it's just trivia,'' Schaefer said.

 By DEIRDRE SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I abandoned the sinking ship of newspaper
journalism and hopped aboard a pirate vessel, the Internet. Instead
of writing news for a venerable newspaper, I'm now providing
content for a Silicon Alley start-up founded by two 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow reporters and I often grumbled about the long hours,
low pay and humdrum assignments at the Philadelphia daily where we
toiled on the suburban beat. Yet, when I told them where I was
going and added that, yes, at the tender age of 27, I'd be
receiving stock options, I saw sellout in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Sellout? Maybe. But in journalism, you have to work your way up
the ladder for years. Your bosses have worked their way up the
ladder. You put in time at newspapers in states like Iowa and
Louisiana, and then maybe you have a shot at a staff job on a
newspaper in New York or San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the new economy, if you're smart and confident, you don't
have to wait in line. You can be whatever you want to be. There are
no ladders and no pigeonholes.
</P>
<P>
   My new bosses at InfoRocket, an online information-auction
company where users pay other users for answers to their questions,
seemed excited about my arrival. Experiment with the copy, they
told me. We trust you.
</P>
<P>
   So I admit it: I was probably rubbing it in when I told my
newspaper friends that InfoRocket's co-founder, Matt Cassin, 24,
was wearing shorts during my interview. And that irreverent
employees had scrawled site models and quotes like ``Revolt Against
Time'' in black ink on the office's white walls. (I later learned
this was because the walls were to be torn down.)
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just the casual atmosphere that struck me; what
bowled me over was the sheer energy of the place. People were
coming and going, banging away furiously at the keyboards, shouting
across rooms. At one point, Teo Montoya, 25, the other co-founder,
stumbled into the room unshaven and disheveled. He had been up all
night writing code, but that didn't stop him from sitting down with
me for an hour to talk about everything from my favorite movies to
the ``new information paradigms.''
</P>
<P>
   I hate to say it, but the hectic pace made me wonder if this
Internet start-up didn't resemble a newsroom back in the heyday of
newspapers. I belonged here, I told myself.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have a computer or a desk for the first three days, and
it took even longer to get a telephone. But on my first day the
company ordered pizza and my 13 colleagues and I sat around the
conference table. ``OK, team,'' said Matt. ``How is everything
going? Do we need to discuss anything?''
</P>
<P>
   We really didn't, but we did anyway. I was forced to reveal my
most embarrassing moment. (Losing my bathing suit while
water-skiing, if you must know.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm hard at work planning the e-mail newsletter I'll
eventually be writing for our users. ``I have lots of ideas,'' I
say. ``We'll take 'em,'' my colleagues reply.

 &HT;    LATINO GROUPS URGE ADDING MORE HISPANIC POLICE OFFICERS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Putting more Hispanic police officers on the
streets could mean a drop in racial profiling and law enforcement
abuse of Latinos, Hispanic organization urged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos remain severely under-represented in most major police
departments across the country, and not just within the top ranks,
but among the rank and file as well,'' said Adrian Garcia, national
president for the National Latino Peace Officers Association.
</P>
<P>
   A November study released by the National Council of La Raza
found that Latinos hold less than 8 percent of supervisory
positions in law enforcement in Houston, a city that is more than
one-fourth Hispanic. In Los Angeles, a city more than one-third
Hispanic, 22 percent of police officers and 14 percent of law
enforcement supervisors were Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The study also reported that the number of complaints received
by the National Council of La Raza on racial profiling and law
enforcement harassment of Hispanic Americans has nearly tripled in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamental to stemming the dramatic increase in civil rights
violations against Latinos is restoring the trust between law
enforcement and the Hispanic community,'' said Raul Yzaguirre,
president of the National Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Tuesday, the National Council of La Raza,
the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association and the
National Latino Peace Officers announced a partnership to address
the issues of Latino- related racial profiling, police harassment,
and the lack of Latino law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership will also address the lack of statistical data
on the incidents of racial profiling against Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although racial profiling of African Americans has received a
great deal of media attention, its impact on Latinos has not been
as widely reported,'' said Rachel King, legislative council for the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the ACLU sponsored anti-profiling bills in 20
different states. King said that several statistical collection
bills and anti-profiling bills have been introduced in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   King said that people can report incidents of racial profiling
or police harassment to the ACLU's racial profiling national
hotline at 1-877-6-PROFILE, or on line at
http://www.aclu.org/profiling.

`DAY OF DECEIT': ON DEC. 7, 1941, DID WE KNOW WE KNEW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 60 years, it has been bruited about _ and for nearly
60 years unproved _ that President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew in
advance of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941,
but, because he wanted some national shock therapy to get the
reluctant country into the war, he did nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Robert B. Stinnett, a Navy veteran of the war who
subsequently made a career as a journalist for The Oakland Tribune,
has produced the results of a 17-year search for documentary
evidence on this important historical question.
</P>
<P>
   The basic conclusion of his new book, ``Day of Deceit: The Truth
About FDR and Pearl Harbor,'' is this: Not only was the ``surprise
attack'' no surprise to Roosevelt, but also the effort to provoke
Japan into military action had been the principal policy of the
Roosevelt administration for the entire preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a dogged and sometimes compelling effort to substantiate
this conclusion, Stinnett has produced no ``smoking guns'' on the
subject, contrary to Gore Vidal's excited blurb on the dust jacket.
Stinnett's main and most radical argument about Roosevelt does not
overcome previous substantial and contrary historical work on the
approach of the war. On less global subjects, too, this book will
probably elicit skeptical responses from other historians who will
properly argue that Stinnett has failed to take account of less
radical explanations for the data he has uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Historians of World War II generally agree that Roosevelt
believed war with Japan was inevitable and that he wanted Japan to
fire the first shot. What Stinnett has done, taking off from that
idea, is compile documentary evidence to the effect that Roosevelt,
to ensure that the first shot would have a traumatic effect,
intentionally left Americans defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most sensational of Stinnett's claims in this regard
concerns Japan's most important spy on Hawaii, Tadashi Morimura,
who, in the months before the attack, gave Tokyo grids of the
harbor showing the location of U.S. naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the assault took place, he sent radio messages to
Tokyo saying that a surprise attack remained feasible. Stinnett
demonstrates that Morimura's dispatches were intercepted by U.S.
naval intelligence, which had cracked the Japanese code, and that
translations of those intercepts were sent to Washington. But they
were never given to Adm. Husband Kimmel, the U.S. Navy commander
for the Pacific, or to his Army counterpart, Lt. Gen. Walter Short.
</P>
<P>
   The implication here is that Roosevelt, by withholding critical
information from commanders in the field, wanted, as Stinnett puts
it, to ``ensure an uncontested overt Japanese act of war.'' Given
that 2,273 U.S. soldiers and sailors died at Pearl Harbor, this
basic conclusion, if it is correct, would require some drastic
rethinking about Roosevelt and the U.S. entry into the war. But
while the volume of documentation provided by Stinnett is
impressive, he hardly decides the issue once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett's strongest and most disturbing argument relates to one
of the standard explanations for Japan's success in keeping the
impending Pearl Harbor attack a secret: Namely that the aircraft
carrier task force that unleashed it maintained strict radio
silence for the entire three weeks leading up to Dec. 7 and thus
avoided detection. In truth, Stinnett writes, the Japanese
continuously broke radio silence even as the Americans, using radio
direction finding techniques, were able to follow the Japanese
fleet as it made its way toward Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Japanese who made radio broadcasts were Adm. Isoroku
Yamamoto, commander of the Japanese Imperial Navy, and Vice Adm.
Chuichi Nagumo, commander of the leading element in the Japanese
Pearl Harbor strike force. Stinnett writes that their messages were
intercepted, deciphered and provided to Washington by a coded
transmission procedure known as TESTM. Roosevelt, says Stinnett,
would have been provided the TESTM documents, but they were not
given to Kimmel or Short.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Stinnett might be right about this;
certainly the material he has unearthed ought to be reviewed by
other historians. Yet the mere existence of intelligence does not
prove that that intelligence made its way into the proper hands or
that it would have been speedily and correctly interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis Smith, a Yale University historian, remarks in this
connection on the failure to protect the Philippines against
Japanese attack, even though there was a great deal of information
indicating that such an attack was coming. Nobody, not even
Stinnett, believes that there was any intentional withholding of
information from the U.S. commander in the Philippines, Douglas
MacArthur. The information available was for some reason just not
put to use.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1962 book, ``Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision,''
historian Roberta Wohlstetter used the word static to identify the
confusion, the inconsistencies, the overall uncertainty that
affected intelligence gathering before the war. While Stinnett
assumes that most information that now seems important would have
gotten speedy attention at the time, the Wohlstetter view is that
there was a great avalanche of such evidence, thousands of
documents every day, and that the understaffed and overworked
intelligence bureaus may simply not have interpreted it correctly
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the fact that Morimura provided bomb grids to Tokyo
has long been known. It is extremely disturbing that interceptions
of his radio transmissions to Tokyo did not tip the U.S. side off
to the impending attack, but that failure by itself does not prove
Stinnett's contention of a conspiracy to deprive commanders of the
information they needed.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it is difficult, after reading Stinnett's copiously
documented book, not to wonder about some previously unchallenged
assumptions about Pearl Harbor. His disclosures about supposed
radio silence are certainly compelling. But his failure to take
into account other, less drastic possible analyses of the way that
intelligence was disseminated and interpreted leads one to read his
book with both interest and a strong dose of skepticism.

A CENTURY OF REMARKABLE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Time magazine has compiled the profiles of 100 men
and women it considers the most influential individuals in shaping
the course of history the past 100 years,
</P>
<P>
   From that list the magazine has assigned itself the dubious task
of singling out the greatest mover and shaker of the century, who
will be featured in its Dec. 27 issue and in a CBS one-hour
special.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever century-end public relations stunt, and rival
Newsweek has its own version with a different twist. The magazine
honors instead ordinary people _ those who fought in World War I or
II or joined the civil rights marches or the crusade for women's
equality or worked the assembly lines to produce airplanes, TV
sets, refrigerators, cars and telephones for millions of their
fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek asks five questions rather than one: What was the
biggest invention, the biggest medical breakthrough and the biggest
turning point and who was the biggest villain and the biggest
entertainer? It seeks a public consensus through its Web site, the
results of which will be aired on NBC's ``Today'' show next week.
</P>
<P>
   Such games can be fun and even useful. Looking back and taking
stock of a remarkable century can help us to prepare mentally and
emotionally for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we did some things wrong and some things right. It is
important to remember both categories.
</P>
<P>
   We avoided the disaster we all feared most, a nuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union that would have reduced Moscow, Washington
and much of the globe to rubble. By the end of the century, the
Cold War was history, and democracy was on the march in most parts
of the world. The Internet and the communications revolution are
transforming and speeding up the way we all do business. Medical
breakthroughs in antibiotics and genetics are extending life and
health. We are exploring the wonders of space.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a bloody century too. Adolf Hitler nearly destroyed
all of Europe, killing millions in the process. Josef Stalin
ruthlessly murdered his own people to retain power. Countries
shaking off the colonial yoke or divided by civil war were steeped
in violence and death.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy's assassination shook America. Governments
rose and fell. Leaders triumphed and failed.
</P>
<P>
   So much happened. So which individual or small group of
individuals made the biggest impact?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already weighed in on behalf of Franklin
D. Roosevelt, who led America out of the Great Depression and World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke picked
Hitler on the theory that the person who had ``the most profound
impact on the events of the 20th century'' need not be a hero but
could also be evil.
</P>
<P>
   An online poll conducted by Time shows Elvis Presley in the
lead. Honest! Is anybody in that survey taking the question
seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities listed in a Time-CBS book titled ``People of
the Century,'' from which the person of the century will be chosen,
include such serious figures as civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., physicist Albert Einstein, French leader Charles de
Gaulle, Britain's Winston Churchill, India's Mohandas Gandhi and
birth-control educator Margaret Sanger. There are also relatively
unknown giants, such as Leo Baekeland, who produced the first
modern plastic; A.P. Giannini, founder of the Bank of America;
William Carrier, who invented air conditioning; Alexander Fleming,
co-discoverer of penicillin, and Robert Goddard, the first true
American rocket scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Frivolous candidates are given a shot at person of the century,
either to jolly up the book's contents or out of desperation to
find enough folks to fill it. (That's the beauty of Newsweek's
contrary approach. There's no end of ordinary people to designate.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Time-CBS book, Coco Chanel is there, for fashion; the
Kennedys in a lump, for celebrityhood; T.S. Eliot, for poetry; Leo
Burnett, who made fabled advertisements; Martha Graham, for dance;
Bill W., founder of Alcoholics Anonymous; Lucky Luciano, Mafia don;
Walt Disney, for Mickey Mouse; Ray Kroc, for McDonald's hamburgers;
Lucille Ball, for making us laugh, and Marlon Brando, for once
being a good actor.
</P>
<P>
   Even Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana are there. Oh, please,
guys. If Frances Cleveland, President Cleveland's beautiful young
bride, were not of the wrong century, you'd probably pick her too.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Time-CBS choices instructed us or amused us, and
some even helped to improve our lives. But they did not tower over
us or the century.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody being considered is dead. Oprah Winfrey and Ronald
Reagan are still here. But President Clinton and Vice President
Gore get no mention in the top one 100 _ surely just an accidental
oversight?
</P>
<P>
   To pick ONE person who had the most influence in the most ways
means
</P>
<P>
   we must go for greatness. To my mind, it's no contest. FDR wins
it hands down. I'd also throw in Eleanor Roosevelt, his political
eyes and ears, for good measure. What a dynamic couple.
</P>
<P>
   Together they saved democracy from a dying, unresponsive
economic system at home and a dangerous fascist abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schlesinger, FDR's fan and biographer, writes that ``the
world we live in today is Franklin Roosevelt's world.'' It's true.
FDR's vision of a government with a social conscience and a world
at peace is our reality. Lucky us.

TV CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: DOES THE MUSH KEEP BRAINS AFLOAT ON TV? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a television series be uncompromising and successful at
once? Since its much-hyped premiere three months ago, ``The West
Wing'' has developed a distinct style that suggests the answer is a
chilling ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   With its acerbic sense of politics and its Mighty Mouse hero of
a president, the show is ``Wag the Dog'' meets Frank Capra. That
collision of styles has made it the smartest, most tantalizing,
most maddening new drama in a season full of them.
</P>
<P>
   And the series' split personality points to an issue about
television's possibilities and limitations. A solid though not a
spectacular ratings success, artistically ``The West Wing'' towers
over the junkier dramas that litter the television landscape,
including several that began the season with promise. Yet it
consistently undermines its own ambition, as if it doesn't dare
trust the audience to grapple with realism and ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   That seems self-defeating, since the show is most absorbing when
it is most complex and sardonic. There are a few fundamental truths
that the White House staff in ``The West Wing'' live by. As the
deputy communications director (played by Rob Lowe) put one of
them: ``There's two kinds of trouble here: actual trouble and PR
trouble.'' Everyone knows that a public relations disaster is the
most serious problem of all.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's episode (NBC at 9) the staff deals with
both kinds, debating the merits of a hate crime bill spurred by the
murder of a gay 17-year-old and dealing with the threat that a
Republican political opponent will reveal that the chief of staff
was once addicted to prescription drugs. They consider a little
pre-emptive blackmail. Maybe a helpful prostitute they know could
reveal the names of some Republican clients?
</P>
<P>
   But in case all this seems too cynically realistic, the
communications director goes to exceptional, unpublicized lengths
to arrange an Arlington funeral for a homeless veteran; the
president's secretary reveals she lost not one but twin sons during
the war in Vietnam; and as the show tosses realism aside
completely, the president goes Christmas shopping and refuses to
let the press tag along for a photo op.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way the series has evolved through the season. It
has enhanced its strengths, presenting a tough-minded sense of the
dizzying pace, the compromises, the high-stakes bluffs and
strong-arm tactics of politics. Yet in every episode there is the
big Television Moment when President Josiah Bartlett, played by
Martin Sheen with such windbag bluster it's a wonder he ever got a
vote, enters and makes a rousing ideological speech. He is a deus
ex president arriving from fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   What the show says about politics is addressed to a smart
audience; yet its emotional mushiness suggests a fear that the
audience cannot deal with ambiguity unless it is countered by the
sop of inspirational uplift. And in strictly commercial terms, that
premise may not be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, who created ``The West Wing,'' also created
``Sports Night,'' the riskiest show on television. Freshly blending
drama and wit, ``Sports Night,'' set behind the scenes of a
television sports show, defies audience expectations and has
struggled in the ratings so severely that ABC now seems to have it
on life support. President Bartlett may exist to save ``The West
Wing'' from itself, making it palatable enough to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its compromises, ``The West Wing'' has turned out to
be the best the season's new dramas. ``Once and Again,'' ABC's
40-something show about divorce, has become so earnest that
watching it is like enduring a therapy session. ``Now and Again''
on CBS offers some charm in the romantic plot about a middle-aged
man in a hot young body pining for his wife; yet he is asked to do
government spying that gives the series a hokey aura.
</P>
<P>
   And though CBS's ``Judging Amy'' is consistently engaging, its
aspirations are not as high as those of ``The West Wing.'' If ``The
West Wing'' is loaded with realism undercut by mawkishness, ``Amy''
turns that pattern upside down. As a judge with a small daughter
who returns to live with her own mother, Amy Brenneman is at the
center of many expected heart-tugging moments; but that formula is
undercut by the kinds of family squabbles that link the show to
reality and give it a bracing air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' is ambitious enough to be measured against its
own aspirations rather than the low level of drama that surrounds
it. The show came closest to fulfilling its potential a month into
its run with an episode about a White House attempt to pass a gun
control bill. At the last minute the staff lost five crucial votes.
``How do we get five votes without giving away everything in the
store?,'' wonders Sam Seaborn (Lowe's character).
</P>
<P>
   Josh Lyman, the deputy chief of staff (played by Bradley
Whitford with such nuanced thoughtfulness that he has become one of
the show's most believable characters) begins manipulating
congressmen. He threatens to run another Democrat against one of
them in the next primary. In the end, the president's people win
but feel as if they've lost: they've spent too much political
capital; the arm-twisting will cause a backlash; it was a
watered-down bill anyway; the hated, distrusted vice president gets
credit on CNN for saving the bill. (There's actual trouble and PR
trouble.)
</P>
<P>
   The texture of the series works in smaller ways, too. When
Josh's assistant mentions that the Republicans want to give back
the budget surplus by lowering taxes, she asks, ``Why don't  &UR; we &LR; 
want to give it back?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cause we're Democrats,'' he says, delivering the line with a
deadpan look and a wry tone that reveals how subtly Whitford has
created Josh's character.
</P>
<P>
   This inside view makes the White House staff human, flawed,
intriguing. The chief of staff, Leo McGarry (John Spencer), is a
recovering alcoholic whose marriage has just broken up because he
is too absorbed in his work. The press secretary, C.J. Gregg
(Allison Janney), is breezily efficient but real enough to consider
dating a reporter despite the obvious conflict of interest. The
Lowe character can't seem to escape silly plot twists: first he
unknowingly slept with a hooker, then he arranged a doomed date
with the chief of staff's daughter. But even he is a more credible
character than the president.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the president invites his staff to eat chili with him one
night, he offers a toast that invokes the days of John F. Kennedy
and the space race. ``What will be the next thing to challenge
us,'' he says, music swelling in the background, ``that makes us go
farther and work harder, as we did in the time when our eyes looked
toward the heavens and with outstretched fingers we touched the
face of God.'' That is typical presidential conversation in ``The
West Wing,'' though you'd think he'd save it for the State of the
Union address. It is an accident of timing that the swirl of
current pop cultural references includes Andy Kaufman (the subject
of a new film) lip-synching to the old Mighty Mouse theme, but that
is what comes to mind when this cartoon president steps in to save
the day.
</P>
<P>
   An episode about selecting a new Supreme Court justice begins
with acerbic wit when the Ivy League-educated Peyton Cabot Harrison
III accepts the president's offer to be nominated. ``You know what
we're finally going to have?'' an ecstatic Josh asks his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``WASPy old man on the Supreme Court?'' she answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A smooth confirmation process,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a monthslong vetting process, Harrison is done in by
a 30-year-old, anonymously written footnote in a law journal that
suggests he might not protect privacy rights. In a flash he is
replaced by a Hispanic judge, Roberto Mendoza (Edward James Olmos),
who began his career as a police officer injured on duty and then
went to law school at night. The president hands Mendoza the
nomination with a dramatic flourish. ``Tomorrow evening at 5
o'clock I am naming you as my nominee to be the next associate
justice of the Supreme Court,'' he says. (What, no three-month
checks on him? Wouldn't they be doubly cautious this time?) ``Let
the good fight begin,'' the president says as Mendoza walks out of
his office and, of course, the music swells.
</P>
<P>
   And when a hurricane hits off the coast of Virginia and traps a
Navy fleet, the president leaves a state dinner and promises to
stay on the phone with a lowly radio operator named Harold ``as
long as the radio works,'' he says. (Or until Harold drowns,
whichever comes first.)
</P>
<P>
   The first lady (Stockard Channing) is there holding his hand,
reassuring him he can't stop hurricanes. Her character has not been
seen much so far, but she has a significant role. This is a
cultural moment when Gail Sheehy is promoting her biography of
Hillary Rodham Clinton by recounting how she reacted to news of her
husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The real first lady,
according to Ms. Sheehy, hauled off and hit the president, calling
him stupid. This may or may not be true (the book's research has
been widely challenged) but it suggests how much nostalgia and
fantasy is involved in the Bartletts, whose very names, Abigail and
Josiah, reek of America's Puritan past.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are meant to be comforting, but audiences know
better. This season, one of the characters on ``Sports Night''
rejects a suggestion from an executive because it implies ``the
audience is not as smart as we are.'' If ``Sports Night'' has
trusted its audience, ``The West Wing'' seems to have taken all the
network advice it can. If the best parts of the series keep us
coming back, the mushy undercurrent keeps us tearing our hair at
the end, frustrated that a show with such ambition is so fearful of
its own brainy realism.

THE BAD OLD DAYS OF U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS DID HAVE ONE GOOD ASPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds crazy, I know, but I always thought there was
something reassuring about the Cold War. In a world where one
reckless act by a superpower could lead to nuclear devastation, the
superpowers were disinclined to be reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, with the Soviet Union dismantled and the threat of
nuclear war no longer the overriding factor in U.S. foreign policy,
the world's lone remaining superpower is far more likely to deploy
its military forces on a whim, to involve them in some well-meant
but misguided adventure that in Cold War times would have been
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the bad old days, when Marxist thugs ruled the Evil
Empire, the United States wouldn't have dreamed of interfering in a
European civil war. But in 1999, with no Brezhnev glowering in the
Kremlin, no Khrushchev sitting with his finger on the nuclear
button, the United States and its NATO allies rained bombs on
Yugoslavia with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin didn't like it, but there wasn't
a darn thing he could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   So which is better _ a perilous and delicate balance of power
that forces superpowers to mind their own business, or a
one-superpower world in which the United States can meddle in any
conflict any time it wants to do so?
</P>
<P>
   I can't stop believing that there was something to be said for
an international stalemate that discouraged ill-advised military
adventurism. But I'm not goofy enough to wish for a return to the
Cold War and its theory of mutual assured destruction; the world is
immeasurably safer and happier without such tension and hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks otherwise should take note of that rhetorical
blast from the past offered up by Yeltsin the other day when he
responded to President Clinton's criticism of his policies by
reminding the U.S. commander in chief that Russia still has the
capacity to blow up the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously must have forgotten for a few seconds, a minute
or half a minute, what Russia is and that Russia possesses a full
arsenal of nuclear weapons,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin said that Clinton had forgotten ``what Russia is,''
he was referring to his country's status as a major power among the
nations of the world. But it was an interesting choice of words,
since no one could possibly forget what Russia is: the nerve center
of the former Soviet Union, one of the truly evil and oppressive
empires of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   No, the American president hasn't forgotten what Russia is. And
neither have the American people, who lived with the Soviet threat
for too long to ever seriously embrace the fantasy that Russia
could ever be our friend.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously unstable and reportedly unhealthy Yeltsin has
fostered the illusion of friendship between the former Cold War
adversaries because his troubled country desperately needs American
economic aid. But it clearly didn't take much provocation _ Clinton
questioned Yeltsin's treatment of rebels in Chechnya _ to
reactivate long-dormant animosities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shrugged off Yeltsin's outburst in the way that a sober
and responsible patron might ignore the ravings of a rude but
harmless drunk at the neighborhood saloon. Why dignify an idiotic
remark with a serious response?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, by the time the media reported what Yeltsin had said,
he'd probably forgotten that he said it.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable, of course, that this incident signaled a
treacherous new turn in U.S.-Russian relations _ and that would be
unfortunate. The two countries will never be pals, but mutual
tolerance beats mutual assured destruction any old day.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there was something nostalgic about that fleeting
moment of contentiousness, that brief flashback to the flashpoint
atmosphere of the Cold War. Those were difficult days, to be sure,
but there was a sense of order to the world back then. There was a
predictability to the way nations interacted, even if the
interaction was too often characterized by malice and menace.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy as it sounds _ and scary as it was _ there was something
reassuring about all that.

CONTROLS ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   MOMS PLAN MARCH TO TRIGGER NEW (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By JUDY HOLLAND   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Outraged by gun violence that has killed or wounded
children, thousands of mothers across the country are organizing
what they hope will be a ``Million Mom March'' aimed at pressuring
Congress to enact tougher controls on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   They intend to arrive in the nation's capital for a march on May
14th, Mother's Day, a holiday that originated during the Civil War
to remind women to take care of each other's wounded sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want common sense gun laws in this country that make it
less easy for the criminally insane or for children to get guns,''
said the founder of the march, Donna Dees-Thomases of West
Caldwell, N.J., a part-time publicist for comedian David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the mothers' march will mobilize enough mothers
to do for irresponsible gun ownership what the MADD mothers did for
drunk driving,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   MADD, the organization of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, has
raised public awareness about the issue. Many states have recently
lowered the level of blood-alcohol that defines drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases says the Aug. 10th shootings at the North Valley
Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles _ where a young man with a 9
mm Uzi killed a postal worker and wounded five people , including
three little boys _ persuaded her it was time to stand up to the
powerful gun lobby. She also cited the April 20th massacre at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in which two teen-agers
shot to death 12 students and one teacher before the youths killed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said her campaign is intended to make gun policy
an issue in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about enlightenment,'' she said. ``Mothers are finding
out how their congressmen have voted on gun policy... We want to
put this right in their faces. The time for compromise is over.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the mothers are pushing for:
</P>
<P>
   _Extensive background checks and ``cooling-off periods'' of 14
to 30 days for people who want to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   _Federal licensing of gun owners and registration of guns.
</P>
<P>
   _Safety locks on all handguns and loaded chamber indicators.
</P>
<P>
   _ A limit on handgun purchases of one per month.
</P>
<P>
   Leading gun control advocates in Congress such as Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., claim that their legislative agenda has been
thwarted by the political clout of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   One key part of that agenda, the Juvenile Justice Bill, was
approved last June in the House and the Senate. However, differing
versions of the measure have been mired in a conference committee
convened to merge the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation contains a ban on the import of high-capacity
ammunition clips, a provision to encourage gun manufacturers to
include trigger locks, a ban on juvenile possession of assault
weapons and a provision to require background checks for any
firearm sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said her group welcomes others besides mothers,
but chose moms to start with because ``there's something safe and
comforting about mothers' getting together.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the ``Million Mom March'' is a word-of-mouth effort
financed by sales of baked goods and T-shirts and is gaining
members who visit her website www.millionmommarch.com or call
1-888-989-6667.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases has enlisted a fleet of volunteers such as Gail
Powers, a North Ridge, Calif., mother of two, whose then-4-year-old
son Nathan was at the North Valley Jewish Community Center during
the August shootings and emerged unhurt but badly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said after the shootings, her son ``was afraid of
everything. If there ever was a sound and he couldn't see how it
was being made, it was a trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somebody who did not know the nature of gun violence,''
Powers said. ``We are hoping to open peoples' eyes up to what
people and children are doing with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Another volunteer is Spring Venema, an Otsego, Mich., mother of
two whose father-in-law was killed in a robbery of his home.
</P>
<P>
   Venema, a graphic arts coordinator at a pharmaceutical company,
said she has never been involved in politics before but has taken a
public speaking class and spends three hours a night contacting
potential marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could save one family from going through what mine went
through, it would be worth it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has taken plenty of ``guff'' from gun owners who
have called her names, but she says she won't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like confrontation,'' she said. ``I'm a peaceful
person. I am doing this because I love my children. I'm just going
to stand my ground because I think it's right. I'll never stop
working on this until this goal is set. It's a lifelong
commitment.''

 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leafing through a book on drinks recently, I came across an old
recipe for punch, and realized I could barely remember the last
time I had had one. It wasn't that I didn't like punch. I simply
hadn't thought about it in years.
</P>
<P>
   So I served it at a party, mostly out of curiousity. The surface
looked like an amber pond with orange zest and slices of cucumber
floating like meadow grass and lily pads. The drink itself, James
Beard's Champagne punch, was a delicious doozy, with Cognac,
Cointreau, orange juice, lemon juice and Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   My guests circled around it, &UR;  &LR; and conversation sparked. All had
a punch they could remember _ whether it was a high-octane blend
from college or the ginger ale punch at their parents' cocktail
parties.
</P>
<P>
   That tight air at the start of a party lifted. And I finally
understood the magic that punch possesses. It satisfies thirst, of
course, but it is also a prop for mingling. People gravitate toward
punch bowls, and surround them as they do a newborn. I wish I'd
discovered it sooner, and apparently there are plenty of others who
feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Caterers around New York City say they have been seeing
something of a punch revival, a fizz of interest especially at this
time of year when people are having holiday parties and smaller
family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Just as bartenders loosened the tie on the martini, punch has
slipped into something more comfortable. Today's concoctions use
ingredients from all over the world, and the mixtures are less
formulaic.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Fehlig, the owner of the Upper Crust, a Manhattan catering
company, makes a punch with Campari, ginger ale, vodka and orange
juice. For the holidays, he mixes orange pekoe tea, cranberry
juice, rum, lemon juice and soda water, and floats cranberries and
half moons of lemon on top. Entertaining Ideas, another Manhattan
caterer, serves a Champagne punch scented with pomegranate syrup
and mint leaves.
</P>
<P>
   True punch may not have the clarity of a classic martini. And it
may not possess the earthiness of wine. But it is a fine drink. A
balanced mixture of alcohol and fruit juice _ sometimes sweetened,
sometimes spiced _ it is pretty, fresh tasting, and often a little
fizzy.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, it makes an impression. Suzanne
Studier-Feldman, who lives in the Flatiron district, served glogg,
a warm, powerful Swedish punch made with red wine, vodka and
spices, at a holiday party last weekend. ``It's a very good drink
to serve your guests when they first come,'' she said. ``It's nice
and warm and it has a little alcohol in it so it kind of starts the
party off on the right foot.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to forget glogg. Or the blood orange and
rum punch scented with nutmeg made by Entertaining Ideas.
</P>
<P>
   They are all great drinks, as important to a party as the food.
But somehow over recent years, punch came to represent a style of
entertaining that Americans would rather forget. Until recently,
caterers who did serve it didn't even call it punch _ it was a
``cocktail'' or ``specialty drink.''
</P>
<P>
   It is strange that it went out of fashion. Punch fits the mold
of an American creation: It's a panoply of ingredients, it has lots
of flavor, and it's splashy. But it wasn't invented here. It
actually originated in India 1,500 years ago, said Leslie Brenner,
a culinary historian in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was called panch, a Hindi word meaning five, because it
had five ingredients: citrus juice, water, arrack, sugar and
spices. Arrack, a distillation of palm tree sap, was a coarse
spirit, Ms. Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to add all this other stuff to make it palatable,''
she added. By the end of the 17th century it had made its way to
the British Isles, where it was known as the drink of mariners, and
it was a hit among the English in colonial India. Colonial America
also latched onto punch, replacing the arrack with rum.
</P>
<P>
   Punch's heyday in America, though, didn't come until later,
during the 19th century. It was everywhere. Punches were served at
bars, at parties and at social clubs, from elaborate silver punch
sets.
</P>
<P>
   There were ale punches, milk punches, punches with egg white,
punches even fraternity boys might cower at. The Wassail Bowl, an
old British recipe, was a heady mixture of warm beer, nutmeg,
ginger, sherry, lemon and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Regents punch, another popular one, makes Long Island iced tea
seem like Kool-aid: it contains green tea, lemon juice and rind,
Seville oranges, cinnamon, sherry, Champagne, brandy, rum, curacao,
pineapple syrup and, of course, soda water to lighten it up a bit
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibition quieted punch drinking for a few decades. In the
1950s, Esquire Magazine made an earnest effort to revive it. In
``Esquire's Handbook for Hosts'' (1953), a defense of punch says
the real thing should bear no resemblance to a ``sloppy pink
lemonade pond.''
</P>
<P>
   A bowl of cheer, it goes on, ``is a natural hub of a party, and
though you'd best have a Scotch-and-soda bar for diehards who
regard a punch bowl as a quaint curio, you'll be surprised at the
converts you win with some of these mixtures _ particularly if you
ladle them into stemmed Delmonico glasses or outright tumblers
rather than those cute-handled cuppies known as knuckle traps.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little technique to making punch. All you need to know
is how to stir and taste, and to use good alcohol and fresh fruits
for juices. Punch is bluntly flavored and any lackluster component
will ruin it. (If you prefer nonalcoholic punch, you can usually
just leave out the alcohol, or substitute sparkling water for
Champagne. That cranberry orange tea punch, for instance, is just
as delicious without the rum.)
</P>
<P>
   It's important to stir it long enough to dissolve the sugar, or
you can rub the sugar into the rind of the citrus fruit to extract
its full essence before adding it to the punch bowl. And if you're
using a bubbly ingredient, make sure you add it at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``American and Other Drinks,'' a cocktail book written by Leo
Engel in 1875, offered some of the best instruction on punch
making: ``The great secret in Punch brewing is to make the mixture
sweet and strong, using tea instead of water, and so thoroughly
amalgamating all the compounds that the taste of neither the
bitter, the sweet, the spirit, nor the element shall be perceptible
one over the other.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once you get the balance right, you can decorate it by freckling
the surface with edible flowers or letting fruit bob around in the
liquid. You can float thin cross sections of orange, cranberries,
cinnamon sticks, curls of lemon zest, translucent slices of
cucumber and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   A cold punch needs to be very cold to keep it refreshing and
clean tasting. The classic trick is to make an ice ring. But an
even better trick is to freeze some of the punch, before the
alcohol is added, in the ice ring. Then, as it dissolves, it
doesn't dilute the mixture. If you want to make it visible, fill
the ring with fruit before freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The punch bowl set is one relic of the past that should probably
remain a relic _ although cookware suppliers like Sur la Table say
they have been selling more of them this year. The punch bowl was
originally much smaller and meant to be picked up with both hands,
like a latte cup.
</P>
<P>
   The large punch bowl sets that followed were simply decorative.
It's more fun to simply buy a big beautiful bowl that can double as
a salad or pasta bowl when you're not having a party. Wine glasses,
Champagne flutes or even tumblers work just fine. Just like they do
for any other drink. &QL;

A PARTIAL REDEMPTION IN `SIMPATICO'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: fact box at bottom) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thin, fragile line between success and failure is one of
playwright Sam Shepard's career-long obsessions. So it's ironically
fitting that Matthew Warchus' movie version of Shepard's sly
horse-racing fable ``Simpatico'' should straddle that line with the
precarious balance of a nervous jockey on derby day, until at last
it slips clean off the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico,'' which is making a one-week Oscar-qualifying run,
is a misfire. But it's an honorable, intelligent misfire from a
promising rookie director who hasn't quite found a way to fully
translate Shepard's lean, lyrical stagecraft into naturalistic
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film's awkward stretches are partially redeemed by its
gutsy if not always laugh-proof lead performances, by the jagged
poetry of John Tolls' cinematography, and by Stewart Copeland's
abstract country-western score, which almost single-handedly
elevates the stumbling screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough for you? Don't forget that in Shepard's mytho-poetic
America of fallen dreamers and ambitions that got off on the wrong
foot, partial redemption is about the best a body can hope for.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly more than what we first expect for Vinnie (Nick
Nolte), a broken-down barfly living out near Cucamonga, where's
he's been nursing a guilty conscience and a busted love affair for
decades. Seems that in the course of a generally reckless youth,
Vinnie, his erstwhile best friend Carter (Jeff Bridges), and Rosie
(Sharon Stone), the girl they both loved, hatched a get-rich plan
of switching slow racing horses for fast ones, then betting the
high odds.
</P>
<P>
   When a California racing commissioner named Simms (played with
raffish elegance by Albert Finney) caught onto the act, the trio
hatched a blackmail plan to shut him up, using Rosie as bait.
</P>
<P>
   But while their ill-gotten gains helped Carter grow up to become
a millionaire thoroughbred breeder, with a plush Kentucky homestead
and Rosie (now his wife) among his leggy trophies, Vinnie backslid
into alcoholism and depression. Simms also was driven from racing
by the scandal, the juicy Polaroid evidence of which Vinnie has
preserved in a cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, as the movie begins, Vinnie has come up with
a payback scheme that involves luring Carter to California and
confronting both Rosie and Simms, who has managed to put his past
behind him and start a new life under an assumed name. By one of
several plot twists that make little dramatic sense, Vinnie's
scheming also inadvertently drags in his only friend, Cecilia.
Cecilia's a loopy but self-possessed supermarket checkout girl
(Catherine Keener), who despite being saddled with some horribly
awkward dialogue, gradually emerges as one of those intriguing
eccentrics in the Shepard mold.
</P>
<P>
   As the story tracks the men's disparate paths toward
self-discovery, the cunning, feral Vinnie and the smooth,
domesticated Carter seem to be swapping identities, like the rival
brothers in Shepard's ``True West.'' Warchus, a British theater
director best-known for helming the international hit play ``Art,''
has a sure feel for this cat-and-mouse dynamic, as do Nolte and
Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Warchus and screenwriter David Nicholls also have come up with
the bright idea of reconstructing the circa-1970 flashbacks of the
horse-racing scam using youthful versions of Vinnie, Carter and
Rosie. The ardency of the three young actors who play the
principals' foolhardy former selves _ Shawn Hatosy, Liam Waite and
Kimberly Williams _ helps make these sequences among the movie's
most effective.
</P>
<P>
   The film's pictorial beauty, however, is nearly overwhelmed by
the tin-eared platitudes, as when Carter waxes to Cecilia about a
horse's ``rippling muscles'' as a thing ``beyond seduction, beyond
lust.'' The film slips into even more overstatement when Stone
makes her belated first appearance as the disheveled, boozing
Rosie, unleashing her inner demons with every slurred consonant.
It's not Stone's fault that she appears to have strolled in from a
Tennessee Williams play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico'' is named for the beautiful, aging Triple
Crown-winning stallion that Carter is about to sell. As potentially
heavy-handed as that symbolism is, here it makes a potent metaphor
for Shepard's vision of the receding macho frontier, in which a
stud is usually another name for a former champion who doesn't know
his best days are over. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last summer, as a worker welded steel beams in a
church in Aurora, Colo., falling sparks ignited wooden trusses
below. Another worker, seeing the flames and smoke, yelled a
warning, but the welder did not understand a word.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Spanish; his co-worker spoke Russian. So the fire
spread, causing several hundred thousand dollars in damages. ``If
someone could've communicated there, there would've been less
damage, and they could have stopped the spread of the fire,'' said
Terry Kish, director of human resources services for the Colorado
Contractors Association in Englewood.
</P>
<P>
   As more immigrants pour into the United States, more workplaces
are resounding with the sound of foreign tongues. Keeping the lines
of communication open among linguistic groups is important in any
work setting, of course, but nowhere is it more critical than in
the construction trade, where misunderstandings can set in motion
million-dollar mistakes _ or cost lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cites the
example of a demolition worker who was killed last year when he was
struck by the boom of the machine he was operating while
demolishing a Manhattan office building. He left the machine while
it was running and inadvertently pressed the boom control pedal.
The safety instruction book was written in English; the worker
understood only Polish.
</P>
<P>
   A second example was a Mexican laborer who was power-washing a
building wall in 1996 and was killed when the lift he was in
toppled 30 feet to the ground in Rockefeller Center because it was
not set up properly. None of the safety warnings that would have
prevented the accident were written in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, a magnet for immigrants from all over the
world, some work sites are reminiscent of the biblical Tower of
Babel. But even though OSHA requires that a Material Safety Data
Sheet for every chemical substance in the workplace be available to
the workers exposed to it so that they will be familiar with the
hazards and precautions to take, very few are available in any
language other than English.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at many sites in Manhattan can get by in either Spanish
or English, according to Walter Suarez, 28, a Spanish-speaking
laborer at the Fischer Mills Building on Greenwich Street in
downtown Manhattan, where workers were recently pouring concrete
floors for new apartments. But, Suarez said through an interpreter,
if you speak only Croatian or Chinese, ``then you have a problem;
like if we scream to stop the pump, and they don't hear or
understand, over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, many people say, is to train everyone in a common
language. ``We just view that as a primary safety consideration,''
said Paul Fernandes, spokesman for the Building and Construction
Trades Council of Greater New York, noting that the union's
apprenticeship programs have an English-as-a-second-language
component. ``Ordinarily, everyone should have to be able to speak
English on the job, because if even one person doesn't, that could
be affecting dozens or hundreds of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Language barriers on the job are an even bigger problem among
day laborers, nonunionized workers who are less likely to speak
English, Fernandes added.
</P>
<P>
   If English is not a common tongue, a second line of defense is
to have an interpreter on hand, construction veterans say. Failing
that, said Jim Pakenham, safety director for Bovis Lend Lease, a
large national construction company, in emergency situations, ``You
use sign language.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many foreign-born workers are unaware of safety hazards
and their right to safe working conditions. Fearful over their job
security or possibly tenuous immigration status, they are less
likely to complain and more likely to be in danger, worker
advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest threats to the safety of non-English-speaking
employees is their failure to report hazards, said Laurie Kellogg,
training representative for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
and Textile Employees. ``There's fear of talking to the boss, and
the complete lack of awareness that there are safety rules,'' she
said. ``Then you'll have people doing dangerous things because
their supervisor told them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the garment trades, people who are not fluent in
English can suffer unnecessarily from repetitive stress injuries.
Most workers blame such problems on old age or arthritis, when in
many cases the problem is work-related. Workers who do not
understand that are unable to collect workers compensation, Ms.
Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA faces language barriers as well, in the course of regular
inspections and investigating violations at building sites, said
Robert Kulick, area director for the agency's Manhattan office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical that we talk to employees to establish what the
conditions are at the work site'' he said. ``It's a problem for us
if they speak one version of a Chinese dialect, or Portuguese, and
translators aren't available.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is trying to provide documents in more than one
language, particularly in Chinese, at least in the garment
industry, he said. Posters using pictograms can also help in
warning about hazards.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, OSHA's Kansas City, Mo., regional office
distributes a poster showing a skeleton in a fall-protection
harness, with a caption, referring to the number of bones in the
body: ``200 Reasons Why You Should Wear Fall Protection.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, OSHA has requested the help of interpreters from
the United Nations during some of its larger compliance cases. The
agency is trying to hire bilingual compliance workers, including a
Polish construction specialist who was able to speak with workers
during a building collapse in Brooklyn in November that killed one
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Al Scott of Cheyenne, Wyo., who produces a pocket
English-to-Spanish dictionary of construction terms, says he has
found that whenever a boss tries to speak to workers in their
native language, morale goes up _ and the number of accidents is
likely to go down.

CHARLES SCHULZ, CREATOR OF `PEANUTS,' RETIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ You're on your own, Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   After drawing more than 18,000 comic strips over a half-century
about a pie-faced little loser who never got any smarter or any
older, a boy whose best friends were grief and unease, who was
regularly outsmarted by his own dog, Charles Schulz has decided to
put down his pen and cut Charlie Brown some slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to be a cartoonist and I feel very
blessed to have been able to do what I love for almost 50 years,''
Schulz said in an open letter that was released Tuesday from his
home in Santa Rosa, Calif. ``That all of you have embraced Snoopy,
Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus and all the other `Peanuts'
characters has been a constant motivation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, 77, said that he would stop drawing the strip
immediately and that it would retire when the last one runs on Jan.
4. The cartoonist was recently found to have colon cancer and said
he needed to devote himself to fighting his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' has appeared, without interruption, since it was
introduced on Oct. 2, 1950. Schulz has drawn every one of the
strips, taking time off only for his 70th birthday, though he
worked ahead so that the strip would continue to appear while he
was off, said Diane Iselin, a spokeswoman for United Media, which
syndicated the strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' appears in 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries and 21
languages, making it the most popular comic strip in the world, Ms.
Iselin said.
</P>
<P>
   A social and marketing phenomenon that grew beyond the funny
pages to become one of the cornerstones of postwar popular culture,
``Peanuts'' followed the angst-ridden exploits of a group of
children in a nameless American suburb _hapless Charlie Brown, his
conniving dog Snoopy, the sharp-tongued Lucy, her blanket-cuddling
brother Linus, the Beethoven-adoring Schroeder, forever-sandalled
Peppermint Patty and Woodstock and all the others. Adults never
appeared in the strip.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, the son of a barber in St. Paul, Minn., went by the
nickname of Sparky (for a character in the ``Barney Google'' comic
strip), though he has described himself as shy and removed. As a
youth, he took a correspondence course in cartooning and earned a
C-plus in ``Drawing of Children,'' according to the official
biography on the comic strip's official Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems beyond comprehension of people that someone can be
born to draw comic strips,'' Schulz says in his official biography.
``But I think I was. My ambition from earliest memory was to
produce a daily comic strip.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the military in World War II, Schulz began to
draw a comic strip for a local Roman Catholic newspaper and later
joined the faculty of the same correspondence school that he had
once studied with. One of his earliest characters was Charlie
Brown. After selling several single-panel comics to The Saturday
Evening Post, he began a weekly single-panel comic in The St. Paul
Pioneer Press called ``L'il Folks,'' which starred Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   When an editor at the Universal Feature Syndicate suggested to
Schulz that he expand to a strip format, the cartoonist signed a
five-year contract. But legal tangles forced Schulz to change the
name of his strip from ``L'il Folks'' (too close to ``L'il Abner'')
to ``Peanuts,'' a name he hated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' took several years to catch on in the crowded comic
strip market. But by 1952, it was popular enough that Rinehart and
Co. decided to take the unusual step of issuing a selection of the
strips in a mass-market paperback.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, a San Francisco housewife asked Schulz if she could
create a ``Peanuts'' calendar, the beginning of more than three
decades of ``Peanuts'' marketing that has expanded to plush toys,
games, books, stickers, videocasettes and hundreds of other items _
and will continue even as the strip ends.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``Peanuts'' musical on Broadway, several television
specials (including the Emmy-winning ``Charlie Brown Christmas'' in
1965) and a hit 1966 recording (``Snoopy vs. the Red Baron'' by the
Royal Guardsmen) that turned Charlie Brown's dog, deluded into
thinking he was a World War I flying ace, into the strip's most
popular and ubiquitous character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad, sad time for us,'' Lorrie Myers, Schulz'
secretary, told The Associated Press. ``It has been such a part of
our lives for 50 years. We've kind of grown up on Snoopy and
Charlie Brown and to see it come to a close is a sad time.''

FEDERAL, LOCAL OFFICIALS VOW FIGHT AGAINST GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Updates with NRA comment in 11th graf and fixes last graf,
updating status of lawsuits.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking the next step in a potential federal lawsuit
against gun manufacturers, senior administration officials met here
with 17 city and county officials Tuesday and vowed to fight for
safer firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Bruce
Reed, President Clinton's point man on gun policy, said at a news
conference that the meeting had produced the outlines of a unified
stance that local and federal officials will take to the gun
industry ``over the next days.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the threatened class-action lawsuit that HUD would
launch through 3,200 housing authorities across the country is to
force the manufacturers to produce safer guns and new business
practices that would guard against shady dealers.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne expressed outrage at
the easy access many children have to guns and said she was buoyed
by the federal lawsuit threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are here from California and have been very
actively involved in this ... wouldn't have traveled across the
country if we didn't believe that this administration and Secretary
Cuomo were serious,'' Renne said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The time is now for the gun manufacturers to step
up to the plate and be serious because we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the federal and local officials had ``agreed to stand
together ... to ensure that the gun industry takes responsibility
for its share of the violence'' that has wracked public housing
projects over the last few years. Flanked by the local officials
and a representative from the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Cuomo said the group intends to
``reach our goals through negotiations'' but is ``wholly prepared
to go to litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who is also President Clinton's domestic policy adviser,
said he will meet with the state attorneys general from New York
and Connecticut on Wednesday about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeking monetary compensation, HUD wants gun makers
to crack down on disreputable dealers and make safer guns that
can't be fired by children. The administration also wants gun
makers to agree to end practices such as marketing weapons that are
impervious to fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Baker, the National Rifle Association's top lobbyist,
said the municipalities and the White House ``are getting
desperate'' after judges recently threw out lawsuits brought by the
cities of Bridgeport, Conn., Miami and Cincinnati against gun
makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to threaten the full force of power of the
federal government to get from the gun companies concessions'' that
should be legislated by Congress, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal-local coalition effort is distinct from lawsuits
that 28 cities have filed against gun manufacturers seeking
monetary damages and changes in the ways guns are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Although judges have dismissed the Bridgeport, Miami and
Cincinnati lawsuits, another judge has allowed one filed by Atlanta
to proceed and has ordered the industry to open its files.

   MILLENNIUM-MOON _ WASHINGTON _ Call it the Millennium Moon. An
unusual confluence of orbital dynamics will produce the brightest
full moon of the 20th century on Dec. 22, the day after the winter
solstice. Because the moon on that night will be near its
``perigee'' _ the closest its slightly out-of-round orbit brings it
to the Earth _ it will appear slightly larger than normal. However,
the earth-moon system will also be near the ``perihelion'' point,
the orbital position that takes the Earth closest to the sun,
sunlight reflected by the moon will be slightly more intense. The
confluence of the three factors occurs about once every 133 years
and will not occur again during the next century. But astronomer Ed
Barker of Austin's McDonald Observatory said the difference will
hardly be noticeable to the average observer. (Nesmith).

Gonzalez, the longstanding issue of Cuban detainees in U.S. jails

release two deputies and a warden taken hostage at the St. Martin

Cubans are among a group of 60 in jail for the INS pending

reactor UT bought in 1992 and shut down last month due to a welding
defect. That's right, one year is all you get for a plutonium
container. Because reactors are supposed to last 40 years and the
company that made this one has never had such a problem since it
began, the factory rep is coming to Texas next week from the
headquarters in San Diego to check out the problem. Although
there's no safety danger, officials from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission came to Austin this week to take a look. Though it's a
lot of red tape for UT, the shutdown's greater impact is on
graduate students who had planned to get their degrees in May and
were counting on the reactor for their experiments. (Jayson, Austin

   WATERWAR _ ATLANTA _ Georgia will find out Tuesday whether
Florida will abandon the water war negotiations, or agree to a
deadline extension to keep the talks alive. Representatives from
Georgia, Alabama and Florida are meeting at a negotiating session
in Atlanta on Tuesday, and Florida will reveal whether it will
stick to an earlier announcment that further talks may be futile to
divide up the waters of the Chattahoochee and other rivers. If the
talks fail, the water war most likely will end up in the Supreme
Court. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 14.

And if $70 million isn't enough to make you part with a buck, just
wait 2.8 years, by which time it will likely have hit $134 million,

through the public records law. (Date, Palm Beach Post). 16.

   ABORTION-TEXAS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ As of Jan. 1, under-age girls
will have to notify their parents before they get an abortion in
Texas. The law takes effect amid grave concerns about the
confidentiality requirements of a provision allowing a girl to go
to a judge instead of her parents. The new law requires the court
proceedings _ not just the girl's name _ to be confidential. Some
say that could violate the Texas Constitution's ban on secret court
proceedings. Some judges are worried about not having access to the
court cases that will enable them to know what the standards for
awarding the bypass are. There's also a question of making public
the actions of elected judges so people can determine whether they
are judging such cases fairly or on the basis of their own pro- or
anti-choice views. One Houston judge has been jailed for
anti-abortion protests. (Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman).

   MEXICAN-SHOPPERS _ SAN MARCOS, Texas _ Like millions of other

serious shopping at the outlet malls with a fistful of receipts and
a car full of bags to tell the tale. Shoes from Nike, dishes from
Pfaltzgraff, clothes from Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica and Liz
Claiborne, assorted gifts from the Disney Store. But instead of
heading home to Austin or San Antonio, Trevino drove more than five
hours to Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. It's a trip she has made
twice a year for the past six years. She's hardly unique, however.
These days, more and more Mexicans are coming to Texas to shop.

   GERMANY-SLAVE-LABOR (Berlin) _ After months of bitter
negotiations, German industry and government officials agreed
Tuesday to establish a fund of roughly 10 billion marks or $5.1

some details remained fuzzy Tuesday evening, German negotiators
reluctantly agreed to increase what they had insisted was their

   MIDEAST-ASSESS (Washington) _ Israelis do not stand on ceremony
or bow to courtesy. But, in an unprecedented show of support, 21
out of 22 of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's often squabbling Cabinet
ministers saw him off at Ben Gurion Airport when he flew here
Tuesday to resume Israel's negotiations with Syria. There couldn't
have been a clearer demonstration of how Israelis _ like many
others in the Middle East _ perceive the import of the moment. It
is a moment of truth, as they see it, and it can be felt in the
air. A news analysis by Deborah Sontag.

signed the controversial accords that would give Panama full
territorial sovereignty and total responsibility for the canal.

   BRADLEY-WHITMAN (Washington) _ It once seemed that the word
failure was not a part of Bill Bradley's lexicon. He had been a
Rhodes Scholar, Olympic gold medalist, two-time NBA champion and,
on his first foray into politics in 1978, the winner of a Senate
seat from New Jersey. In 1984, he won re-election by one of the
largest margins in state history. So in 1990, when Bradley came
within 3 percentage points of losing his once safe bastion to an
unknown, poorly financed Republican named Christie Whitman, he was
devastated. To many of his critics and supporters alike, the
disastrous 1990 campaign _ both sides use the adjective _
represents the most important event in Bradley's political life. By
James Dao.

IN SEARCH OF KENTUCKY HOLIDAY COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Recipes appear in 2d take.)  
(DW) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRODSBURG, Ky. _ Coming down through Bluegrass Country from
Lexington to this bustling little farming town, it's not at all
difficult to envision central Kentucky as it must have been 150
years ago. The stately farm homes _ mansions, really _ the
well-kept barns and stables and the spotless white fences and
handsome stables are ample proof that Kentuckians are proud of
their land and their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   I was in search of another facet of that heritage, Kentucky
cooking, particularly in the bountiful holiday season. I was on my
way to visit two of the state's leading culinary landmarks, both
here in Harrodsburg: the Beaumont Inn and, a few miles east of
town, the historic Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beaumont, Ken Dedman, representing the fourth generation
of his family to own and operate the inn, was putting the final
touches on his Christmas decorations. The imposing Greek Revival
inn, originally a finishing school for girls, has been a
destination for lovers of authentic Kentucky cooking for more than
80 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's Kentucky cooking,'' Dedman said. ``Or maybe
Kentucky Southern _ not just Southern cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Shaker Village, Christmas decorations were also up, for
parties. I dined by the light of candles and the last pale rays of
the setting winter sun. Everything, I knew, was much as it had been
when the Shakers lived here a century ago, because the hard-working
women of this religious sect recorded everything, especially the
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen was turning out its own version of Kentucky cooking.
There and at the Beaumont Inn were local favorites like country
ham, corn pudding, carrot casserole, biscuits and a plethora of
pies. But at neither stop did I find Kentucky's famous bourbon:
Mercer County, like about 75 percent of the state, is dry.
</P>
<P>
   Harrodsburg was the first permanent European settlement west of
the Alleghenies, in the 1770s. In 1805, the Shakers arrived. A
religious sect founded in England in 1747, they moved to America in
1774. Eventually, they established 19 Shaker villages from Maine to
Indiana, of which Pleasant Hill was the third largest, with some
500 members. All those settlers left their mark on the cuisine
here.
</P>
<P>
   Ronni Lundy, who lives in Louisville and has written extensively
about the food of her home state, explained how Kentucky cooking
differs from traditional Southern style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kentucky is a long state from east to west, and a short state
from north to south,'' she said. ``In the north it borders the
Midwest, and the cooking there shows that influence. Eastern and
central Kentucky are part of the mountain South _ the southern
Appalachians, western Virginia, West Virginia and parts of
Tennessee. Further south, where it's hotter, the tendency is to
cook for the moment. Here, where we have winter, we tend to
preserve things.''
</P>
<P>
   Like country ham, which is a specialty at both the Beaumont Inn
and the Shaker Village, as well as at other restaurants like Boone
Tavern, not far away in Berea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aging country ham is really a Kentucky specialty,'' Ms. Lundy
said. ``In the deep south, the pig is cooked and eaten right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beaumont Inn's specialty, not surprisingly, is country ham.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandfather was the innkeeper, there were two items on
the menu, fried chicken and country ham,'' Dedman said. ``We've
expanded our menu, but they are still our most popular items,
served separately or combined with a side order of corn pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most good ham producers age them for about a year, and people
buy them and eat them right away,'' he continued. ``We hang them in
our own ham house for at least another year or until they are two
years old. The extra time really improves the flavor. At any given
time, we have about 6,000 pounds of ham aging here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooking a country ham begins with scrubbing it and then soaking
it overnight. At the Beaumont, the chef, Nick Sundberg, then boils
the ham for hours, removes the skin, rubs it down with a paste of
cornmeal and brown sugar and bakes it. Some Southern cooks have
been known to add a quart of Coca-Cola to the pan before baking the
ham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is what defines the quality in a good Kentucky ham,''
said John T. Edge, the author of ``A Gracious Plenty,'' a new book
on Southern cooking (Putnam, $30). ``The process is simple _ salt,
hang, smoke. But we live in a hurry-up time, where brine is
injected and water is added to hams, and they are barely aged at
all. Time is what makes the Kentucky hams so good.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything characterizes Kentucky cooking even more than
country ham it's the almost ubiquitous presence of corn bread.
``When I was a child, bread meant corn bread,'' Ms. Lundy said.
``The white stuff you bought at the grocery store was `sweet
bread.'''
</P>
<P>
   Corn was part of Kentucky life from Colonial days because it was
relatively easy to grow. It was a staple of the Native American
diet long before the first settlers arrived west of the mountains,
and many dishes like corn bread and corn pudding are variants of
dishes familiar to the original inhabitants of the region.
Kentuckians prefer their cornmeal and corn flour white and their
corn bread without sweetening.
</P>
<P>
   Country ham takes a back seat to fresh vegetables at the Shaker
Village at Pleasant Hill. The settlement was founded in 1805 and
disbanded in 1910. The Shakers, celibate, austere and withdrawn
from the world, reveled in nature's bounty and became successful
farmers, cattle raisers and traders. Eventually, here in Mercer
County, they owned some 4,500 acres in fields, pastures, gardens
and orchards.
</P>
<P>
   While the men, called brethren, tilled the fields, raised
livestock and made tools, the women, called sisters, produced
woolen goods, dried seeds and herbs, and cooked for the community
and guests.
</P>
<P>
   The last member of the Shaker community died in 1923.
Restoration of Pleasant Hill began in 1961. With the restoration of
the handsome Shaker buildings has come a revival of Shaker customs,
including the cooking. Thanks to well-preserved old journals, the
Pleasant Hill kitchens can prepare many of the dishes served to the
community and their guests, including hundreds of Union and
Confederate soldiers, more than a century ago. Now a nonprofit
educational corporation, Pleasant Hill welcomes travelers
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the peak of the summer season, we serve up to 600 meals a
day,'' said Brian Bentley, the restaurant's assistant manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Pleasant Hill's 19th-century heyday, the community was
self-sustaining. Its gardens, orchards and pastures produced enough
surplus to permit the Shakers to trade and sell their plenty as far
off as New Orleans. There are still gardens and orchards, cattle,
sheep and poultry, but they are maintained principally to
demonstrate how the Shakers lived. Only the garden vegetables are
used in today's kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   A Shaker specialty often on the menu is a casserole made with
salsify, which is also known as oyster plant. It recalls the
salsify seeds brought from Britain to America by the first Shakers
in 1747. Once Pleasant Hill grew its own salsify. ``Now, we import
it from Belgium,'' Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Shakers were celibate, they bestowed their names on the
dishes that they created: Sister Amelia's Stuffed Onions, Sister
Abigail's Blue Flower Omelet, Sister Olive Wheeler's Ginger
Cookies, Sister Mary's Zesty Carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most popular dish is Shaker lemon pie, which has
been called the quintessential Shaker recipe because it embodies
two important ideals of the sect: simplicity (it's easy to make)
and thrift (because it uses every bit of the lemon, including the
rind). The secret is slicing the lemons paper thin.
</P>
<P>
   The Shakers had no stated objection to alcohol and made both
hard cider and fruit wines. Today, no alcohol is served at Pleasant
Hill or at the Beaumont Inn, although guests who bring their own
wine and spirits may drink in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guests from all over the United States and Europe who
are astounded to discover that they can't get a drink in the heart
of Kentucky bourbon country,'' Dedman of the Beaumont Inn said.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the county's drinking laws was voted down 2-to-1
this year. Will Rogers took note of the irony in that predicament
many years ago when he observed, ``Southerners will drink wet and
vote dry so long as any citizen can stagger to the polls.''

BATTLING OVER THE LEGACY OF AN ITALIAN MODERNIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CITTA DI CASTELLO, Italy _ Even in an argumentative country like
Italy, some would be surprised by the furious dispute taking place
over some burlap sacks, sheets of burnt plastic and panels of
particle board. But in this case those ordinary materials passed
through the hands of Alberto Burri, one of Italy's most important
postwar artists, who made the commonplace divine.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years after Burri's death at age 79, a battle is
under way between his widow, Minsa Craig Burri, and the foundation
that Burri established to act as administrator and curator for his
artistic legacy. The drama is being acted out in Citta di Castello,
a placid Renaissance town in the central Italian region of Umbria
where Burri spent much of his life and created two museums devoted
entirely to his art.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Burri and the Palazzo Albizzini Foundation have been
feuding since 1996. Mrs. Burri has made one unsuccessful attempt to
claim a big share of her husband's inheritance, which led to a
lawsuit in which she is now the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Now tensions have risen further. In late November, Mrs. Burri
produced a shakily handwritten will signed by her husband in
December 1994, two months before his death, making her his
universal heir. If accepted by the court, this document would
automatically revoke the previous will, which left almost
everything to the artist's foundation. ``I want everything,
everything that is my due,'' Mrs. Burri said recently. ``I'm
destroyed by three years of fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Burri says that if she wins she will set up a Burri museum
in Rome because Citta di Castello, about 150 miles north of the
capital, is too remote for art lovers to visit. The foundation
fears that losing the inheritance would mean closing the existing
Burri museums for lack of funds. What's more, the foundation's
charter mandates that the Burri collection pass to the National
Gallery of Modern Art in Rome if either of the Citta di Castello
museums shuts down. Foundation members say that regardless of who
wins, a lengthy court case could so thoroughly deplete the museums'
finances that they could no longer operate.
</P>
<P>
   Such quarrels, pitting relatives against one another or against
foundations that profess to have the public's interest at heart,
are common in the art world. And, like the cases of Picasso, Mark
Rothko and Max Beckmann, the contest over Burri's estate promises
to be long and bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the small town of Citta di Castello in 1915, Burri is
celebrated for helping to bring about Italy's artistic recovery
after World War II. He was one of the first artists to explore the
poetry of the mundane, proposing that anything, even the most
humble burlap sack, could be transformed into art.
</P>
<P>
   Burri worked in series, creating abstract collages using
ordinary materials. His most celebrated series, and the one that
confirmed his status as one of the foremost artists in Italy, was
the Sacks, which he began in 1950. Later series featured such
materials as wood, iron, plastic and particle board.
</P>
<P>
   His paintings hang in many museums, including the Solomon R.
Guggenheim in New York, the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Tate
Gallery in London. But Burri lived frugally and chose not to sell
many works during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Although a complete inventory has never been made, the contested
inheritance includes 450 to 800 paintings, prints, temperas and
lithographs, as well as real estate in Italy. In the last two years
Burri pieces have sold for $24,000 to $511,000. In October,
Sotheby's in London sold a 1954 ``Sack'' for $409,000.
</P>
<P>
   Slight and almost frail in appearance, Mrs. Burri moves with a
dancer's grace, though her hands are twisted with arthritis. A
choreographer and poet, she met the pa)nter in the early 1950s when
she came to Rome after a successful European dance tour. She worked
only sporadically in Italy, where outlets for modern dance were
rare. ``When I presented my piece `November Steps' at the Rome
Opera in 1973, hal&AMP; the audience was shouting `Brava! Brava!' and
the other half was shouting `Basta! Basta!''' she recalled. ``I was
so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple lived mostly in Los Angeles and Citta di Castello
until Burri's failing health prompted them to move to the French
Riviera in 1992. They kept two houses in Citta di Castello, one in
the city center, another in the countryside, so that Burri could
pursue one of his favorite pastimes, hunting. Mrs. Burri said that
the foundation had prevented her from entering her former town
residence to retrieve her belongings. ``They changed the locks
without telling me,'' she said. ``They told me that I could only
use my house for vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   Palazzo Albizzini Foundation secretary-general Nemo Sarteanesi
said ``Burri wanted the world to know Citta di Castello,'' adding,
``He used to say that if Americans wanted to see his paintings,
they would have to come here looking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first museum pened in the 15th-century Palazzo Albizzini in
1981 with a representative collection of paintings that Burri
arranged and hung. Nine years later a wch larger museum displaying
some of Burri's later, more monumental pieces opened in a former
tobacco-processing factory.
</P>
<P>
   Burri donated his artworks and thousands of dollars to the
museums. He also left a number of paintings that were to be sold at
auction to finance the administration and maintenance of the
museums, which costs about $200,000 a year. So far the foundation
has relied mainly on government financing and ticket sales and has
not had to sell many pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Sarteanesi said he feared that the dispute with Mrs. Burri would
depress the market for Burri's art. ``Now that we have this
confusion, people will think twice about spending money,'' he said.
``This conflict has caused us enormous harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the foundation have said that it was Burri's desire,
confirmed in the will signed in July 1993, that the foundation
benefit from his estate. ``Burri was afraid of death and knew that
the only way to keep his art alive was through these museums,''
explained Giuliano Giombini, a foundation member.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Burri, however, said that her husband had changed his mind
and made her his heir in the latter will because he was unhappy
with the way the foundation was being run.
</P>
<P>
   She insists that she does not want her husband's artworks for
personal gain and has designated 300 paintings from the inheritance
for her museum project in Rome. ``At least having a Burri museum in
Rome would allow the public to see his work,'' she said. `Citta di
Castello is so small, it doesn't even have an airport.''

`I FILLED OUT THOSE FORMS AND I LIED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, Dec. 21)

<P>
   Janice, mother of a kindergartner, has a message for other new
mothers contemplating going on welfare: Make sure you do it
legally, she says, not the way she did it.
</P>
<P>
   Janice is in jail. She'll miss Christmas with her little boy.
She'll be behind bars for New Year's and spend the first two months
of the millennium in the El Dorado County Jail for committing
welfare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   This week she sat in her apartment, emptied of a number of
belongings she sold to get money in order to pay her bills ahead.
Someone had just purchased her vacuum cleaner and with that money
she was off to buy her son a Christmas present, perhaps a set of
Legos.
</P>
<P>
   He'll spend part of the holidays with Janice's parents and then
live with his father, Janice's estranged husband, until she's
released.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Janice will be in jail serving 60 days because, as
she explained to her son, ``Mommy did something I shouldn't have. I
broke the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Janice says, she is not unique. That is why she
wanted to pass on her warning. ``I know women who do this or think
about doing this all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And it commonly begins as it did for her.
</P>
<P>
   She met a man, fell in love, got pregnant and they moved in
together. He had a job and was capable of supporting them, but in
order to get AFDC and food stamps she told welfare authorities that
she was alone and that the baby's father was dead. That was six
years ago. Janice later stated in an affidavit that her boyfriend
pressured her to lie. He countered that he didn't. But in the end
it came down to she said/he said, and it was Janice's signature on
the welfare papers. This fall, sheriff's officers came to Janice's
house in Sonoma County, Calif., where she lives with her little boy
and arrested her for committing welfare fraud in El Dorado County.
</P>
<P>
   Janice knows all about how it was wrong and illegal and unwise.
``My friends are so mad at me for being so stupid and weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Her only defense, she says, is, ``I wanted to do whatever it
took to make him happy,'' meaning her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have left him and gone home to live with my parents.
Or I could have gone on welfare legally and lived by myself, taken
the harder route, the lonely route. But I felt at the time my only
choice was to commit the crime and keep the man.''
</P>
<P>
   She also admits, ``I liked having my own money. I knew it was
illegal and wrong but I filled out those forms every month and
lied.''
</P>
<P>
   She and the baby's father eventually married, and Janice went
off welfare and began working as a house cleaner. A year later,
Janice left her husband, moved to Sonoma County with her son and
turned herself in.
</P>
<P>
   0``I talked to the district attorney's office and told them who
the real father was and that I had lied on the original paperwork.
I turned myself in so I could get child support. They attached his
wages and that started the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took years before anyone came after her for welfare fraud
and at first she hoped she could just pay it off. She'd begun
sending $25 a month to El Dorado County toward the $6,400 she owes
for 10 months of food stamps and AFDC, but that wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told just because you make restitution doesn't keep you
out of jail. I think they're disgusted with me. They think this
girl needs a wake-up call. I guess I agree.'' Janice is 36,
attractive and articulate. ``I was one of those kids who was
supposed to be gifted,'' she says, almost smiling. She plans to go
to business school next year when her son enters first-grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to think about educating the brain God gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't try to rationalize her acts nor paint her husband as
the bad guy but accepts her role in a bad decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you don't take the time to think about the future
because you're so wrapped up in the moment. You don't see that
things could change, that the boyfriend could leave or you'd want
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you get pregnant you need to make sure the child has a
father. You have to make the man responsible for his child. Put his
name down on that paper. Because six years later it can come back
full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, Janice says she'd be married and have three
kids and ``be the mom picking up my kids at the bus stop.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead she's going to jail and trying to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that after this, things can only get better.''
</P>
<P>
   First she has to say goodbye to her son for a while. ``That's
going to be pretty painful. He's such a lovable little guy.''

 &HT;    Rudolph's death exaggerated, say mountain residents
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the Lake's End Grill in North Carolina's Nantahala
Forest Tuesday, Peggy Ellison grilled a hamburger for an FBI agent.
The two chatted about the latest twist in the saga of accused
bomber Eric Robert Rudolph: The outgoing director of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms thinks he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here's just laughing about it,'' said Ellison, whose
restaurant sits smack in the middle of the prime search area for
the 33-year-old fugitive. The agent waiting for lunch told Ellison
``he didn't know where the (ATF chief) got his information.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview published in Tuesday's USA Today, ATF
Director John Magaw said: ``My gut instinct is that he is still
there, in a cave, and he's dead. That's only my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaw leaves Monday to coordinate the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's response to domestic terrorism. The new
director, who remains unannounced, is scheduled to be sworn in
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the opinion of the director,'' ATF spokeswoman Tracy
Hite said. ``We still have resources dedicated toward finding Eric
Robert Rudolph and toward prosecuting him.''
</P>
<P>
   The carpenter and former resident of the Nantahala community is
charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at Centennial Olympic Park
and the fatal bombing at a Birmingham abortion clinic Jan. 29,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the rugged Appalachians of western North Carolina,
Magaw's comments made the rounds in newspapers, on television and
on radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think he's dead? No, I just think he's smart,'' said
Ellison, whose marquee for months has read ``Rudolph eats here.''
Guests once gossiped regularly about Rudolph, but it's been two or
three months since anyone's mentioned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's in a cave, I just don't think's he's out there without
any help,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   John Wagner, a retired Florida auto parts salesman who moved to
Nantahala in 1973, is one of Ellison's regulars. He's been saying
the same thing as Magaw for almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I've said all along _ he dug a hole, climbed in
and blew his brains out,'' said Wagner, who's had fatigue-clad
agents trod on his property. ``It's hard for me to believe _ I
don't care how tough he is _ that he's been out there for two
winters eating nuts and berries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep asking about the reward,'' said Wagner, wondering how
to collect the $1 million FBI bounty if Rudolph is dead. ``They
tell me, `Just bring in his teeth.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Magaw's opinion, though, doesn't necessarily have teeth with the
Southeast Bomb Task Force, a multi-agency group stationed in nearby
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is entitled to their own gut theory, whether they be
the outgoing director of the ATF or any citizen in the Nantahala
forest, '' Task Force spokesman Patrick Crosby said Tuesday. ``But
the task force must always be diligent and assume nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even local law enforcement has placed little stock in Magaw's
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to look for him until it's proven he's
not here,'' said Roger Williams, chief deputy of the Cherokee
County Sheriff's Department in Murphy, N.C. ``The man's elusive. .
. . I try not to form opinions because when I do, I don't do as
good a job as I need to investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   Magaw noted no food's been reported missing, no cabins have been
broken into.
</P>
<P>
   That's true, as far as Elsie Lail knows. She rents cabins at the
Hideaway Campground in the Nantahala Gorge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a few people'' who shared Magaw's opinion, Lail
said. ``Personally, I think he's somewhere else, and I think most
people think he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the task force intensified its search when a
mountain acquaintance of Rudolph reported the suspect stole food
and his pickup. The truck was recovered nearby a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it's been quiet. No forensic evidence has been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a non-event,'' Wagner said. ``You don't see the
dark-tinted Suburbans, Blazers and Explorers or searchers in
fatigues. There are no helicopters, and they used to be a daily
occurrence.''

FOR SPICE GIRL MELANIE CHISHOLM, THE `SPORT' IS ALL IN THE MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BILL DeYOUNG  
The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask Melanie Chisholm, one of the most famous women in England,
how she deals with the constant presence of paparazzi, and the
artist som%times known as Sporty Spice chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I'm really lucky because they don't
really bother with me that much,'' she says. ``They tend to be more
interested in people's personal lives, and I haven't got one.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm has been one of the Spice Girls since the beginning,
and some 40 million records later, she is a 26-year-old
multimillionaire and an instantly recognizable celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   In Great Britain, the Spice Girls sell newspapers, and Fleet
Street likes nothing better than a juicy story about Victoria
``Posh Spice'' Adams and her new husband, soccer star David
Beckham.
</P>
<P>
   They like Emma ``Baby Spice'' Bunton and Melanie ``Scary Spice''
Brown, too. And even Geri ``Ginger Spice'' Halliwell, who's not in
the group any more, gets more press than Melanie Chisholm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because I favor work, and you always know what I'm up
to,'' Chisholm says good-naturedly in a telephone interview from
Liverpool. ``Victoria's got a famous husband as well, so obviously
they're a lot more interesting than me. They're only interested in
who you're sleeping with, rather than the music you're making.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the group took some time off while Adams and Brown
married their beaus and had babies. Chisholm, a self-proclaimed
workaholic, used the opportunity to record a solo album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern Star,'' released under the name Melanie C, covers a
cross-section of musical styles, from electronica and industrial to
flat-out rock 'n' roll, and a few moments of Spice-like pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I like, and I never pushed myself in any
direction,'' Chisholm says. ``I just sort of wanted to see what
came naturally. I think it was always going to be different from
Spice Girls stuff, because as individuals we're very different to
who we are within the group, even.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm recently had her hair cut into a spiky blond 'do.
Because of her prolific tattoos, her gold tooth and the steel stud
in her nose, the first reaction to ``Northern Star'' was that she'd
gone, well, punk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love pop music, and lots of different styles of music, and I
do love to rock out and do pretty hard stuff. But I don't think I'd
ever make an album that was totally that,'' Chisholm says. ``I like
it being quite eclectic-sounding. 'Cause, you know, my emotions go
up and down, day to day. And I like to express that.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote the album, which includes production by Rick Rubin
(Tom Petty, Red Hot Chili Peppers) and William Orbit (Madonna's
``Ray of Light''), Chisholm played a few dates as a solo. Her
performance of the Sex Pirtols' ``Anarchy in the U.K.'' left a lot
of fans scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's finding it quite hard finding what
category to put me in,'' she says. ``The kids haven't really got on
to what I'm doing, and the older ones are a bit cynical about me
being a Spice Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of working-class Widnes, just outside Liverpool in the
north of England, Chisholm had designs on a performing career at an
early age. In 1994, she answered a trade magazine ad for an
all-girl band.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Monkees and Menudo, the Spice Girls didn't come
together organically but were created for a purpose; in this case,
a production team and a financial backer set out to put five very
different singer-dancers together to tackle the British charts.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The quintet got
along famously and charmed the world. And most of the group's hits,
including ``Wannabe,'' ``When 2 Become 1'' and ``Too Much,'' were
co-written and arranged by the Spice Girls themselves.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the Spice Girls were ``manufactured,'' they've
taken some hard knocks from the music press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one saving grace we've always had is that we truly do
believe our music's great,'' Chisholm explains. ``As much as people
can knock us _ and they can say whatever they like _ we've always
believed in the music that we've made.
</P>
<P>
   From day one, even the Spice Girls' harshest critics agreed that
Spo2ty, she of the Nike sweats and athletic stage moves, was ``the
real singer'' in the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wd're all very capable vocalists,'' she says. ``I think the
girls in the band would all agree that I'm probably the most
determined out of everybody, and I do work the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, each to their own. Everybody's got their
favorite Spice Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls were nearly knocked off the rack by the sudden
departure of Haliwell in 1998, on the eve of the group's two-month
debut American tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we could keep the show together,'' Chisholm says.
``We had to go out and do a couple of dates in Europe like the day
after she left. But I think our biggest fear with America was just
if people would want us as a four-piece, without Geri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let everybody know, and thank God the promoters and
everybody in America, they didn't have any problem with it being
just the four of us. But it went great.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she has exchanged ``the odd card and letter'' with
Haliwell, and intends to read her ex-mate's autobiography one of
these days.
</P>
<P>
   But Chisholm didn't care for ``Schizophonic,'' Haliwell's
post-Spice solo recording. ``I would've thought she could have made
a better album, and I think vocally it is very weak,'' she says.
``And if people don't think so, they must be deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   The four Spice Girls are back in action this month, playing a
series of Christmas shows in their home country. Each show was a
near-instant sellout. A new album is due in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   And no, the group does not intend to split up any time soon. For
Melanie Chisholm, it's possible to be a Spice Girl and a solo at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really funny, because as time goes by more and more
things become apparent to me,'' she says, ``especially being back
with the Spice Girls over the last few weeks and doing live shows.
When I'm part of the band, the Spice Girls, I am completely
different. It is really, really strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I'm up there on stage I really act the part, I do. I
really act Sporty Spice. It's a part of me, you kno{, but it's not
the way I would be on my own on stage.''

<P>
   ATLANT _ Fans of ``Gone With the Wind'' who have been looking in
vain for Margaret Mitchell's fictional Tara can now find a little
bit of the Hollywood version in Midtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The front door of the legendary plantation used in the movie set
and the portrait of Scarlett O'Hara that hung over Rhett Butler's
mantel are the main attractions in a new museum adjacent to the
Margaret Mitchell House at 10th and Peachtree streets.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500-square-foot museum will open to the public Thursday
after a private gala tonight marking the 60th anniversary of the
film's premiere in Atlanta on Dec. 15, 1939 at Loew's Grand
Theater. Exhibits will include dozens of artifacts from the
collection of Herb Bridges, a retired Sharpsburg postal worker who
has been collecting GWTW memorabilia for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb's collection is impressive,'' says Mary Rose Taylor,
executive director of the Margaret Mitchell House &AMP; Museum. ``This
is an opportunity to give the public a little more. Even for
Atlantans who think they're bored with the `Gone With the Wind'
story, this exhibit will allow them to see it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic items in the exhibit is the
larger-than-life portrait of Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara,
painted for the movie by artist Helen Carlton. On loan from the
Atlanta Public Schools (it normally hangs at Margaret Mitchell
Elementary School), the portrait still bears the marks of the
whiskey glass that Clark Gable hurled against it in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's a liquor stain, but Bridges speculates it was just
colored water. ``I'm sure they had to shoot several takes, and they
wouldn't have used alcohol. Although,'' he adds, ``in the scene
where Rhett is giving Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) a drink, Clark Gable
actually used real whiskey as a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The white wooden Tara doorway and casement is owned by Gene
Talmadge, son of Betty Talmadge, former Georgia first lady who
bought it for $5,000 in 1979 and spent $8,000 restoring it.
Everything else is from Bridges' extensive collection, from an
assortment of Scarlett and Rhett dolls to the striped pants Clark
Gable wore in the film.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is the enormous array of merchandise tied-in
to the movie. In a way, Bridges says, it was the ``Toy Story'' or
``Star Wars'' of its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had Scarlett perfume, Scarlett dolls and various other
things,'' Bridges says. ``Rich's sold the first Scarlett dolls. A
jeweler made Belle earrings _ named for Belle Watling (the madam of
the local brothel) _ in the shape of little bells and sold those.
Scarlett hair bows sold for five cents at the dime stores and there
were beautiful paper doll books.''
</P>
<P>
   Other items of note include mimeographed film scripts, aisle
lights from Loew's Grand Theater, the green bonnet that Rhett
brought Scarlett from Paris, and original movie posters in English
and foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``One movie poster went for $71,000 at an auction,'' says
Bridges. ``I started collecting this stuff when nobody wanted it. I
bought it a piece at a time. I had three children and a house
payment. There was no way I could pay any big money for it.'' Now
Bridges, who owns the largest private collection of ``Gone With the
Wind'' memorabilia in the world, is glad to have found a permanent
place to exhibit his treasures. ``I am thrilled to be able to do it
at a reputable place like the Mitchell House and Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a wonder the Mitchell House even exists. It was
on the verge of demolition when Taylor launched efforts to save it
in the 1980s. It finally opened in 1997 after a series of financial
setbacks and two cases of suspected arson _ one in 1994 and another
in 1996 when the renovation was nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was saddened by the near-destruction of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not sorry to see the Margaret Mitchell House burn to the
ground,'' novelist Pearl Cleage wrote in the Atlanta Tribune at the
time. ``I was, in fact, delighted that someone had taken direct
action against what I consider to be an insult of monumental
proportions to African-American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all African-Americans share Cleage's view, however. One of
the Margaret Mitchell House board members is Dr. Otis Smith, a
former president of the Atlanta branch of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith frequently points out, Mitchell quietly gave
scholarship money to at least 40 Morehouse College graduates to
enable them to attend medical school.
</P>
<P>
   This little-known side of the author is emphasized during tours
of the Margaret Mitchell House, Taylor says. At the end of each
tour, a short video describes Mitchell's anonymous contributions to
the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, attendance has grown steadily from 45,000 in 1997 to
65,000 this year. Taylor expects those numbers to rise with the
addition of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been self-supporting since the house opened,'' says
Taylor, ``but we do it by having fund raisers. We are looking for
an endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   A non-profit organization, the Margaret Mitchell House acquired
the $1 million-plus building, a former NationsBank branch, through
a grant from the Woodruff Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   During a pre-exhibit tour, public relations director Heather
Hjetland explained that the museum will be divided into three
sections: The making of the movie, the movie's premiere, and the
movie's legacy.'' (The film, by the way, was shot in Hollywood _
not in Atlanta.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have records of the movie's music, the pants worn by Clark
Gable, and a corset worn by Vivien Leigh. You can see how tiny her
waist was,'' she says, holding the garment against her body.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items is a two-and-a-half-foot scale model of a
railroad boxcar used in the burning of Atlanta scene. ``They shot
that scene in Hollywood,'' Hjetland says. ``They burned the King
Kong set and other old Hollywood sets.''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there is the movie merchandise, from hair bows to
Lux soap. ``This is really the first movie that was so
commericalized,'' Hjetland says. ``The Hollywood publicity machine
kept `Gone with the Wind' alive in people's minds from 1936 to 1939
when the movie was released.''
</P>
<P>
   Six decter, Scarlett fever shows little signs of
subsiding. According to Publishers Weekly, the novel still sells
250,000 copies a year, second only to the Bible, and signed first
editions of ``Gone With the Wind'' are worth upwards of $25,000.

 &HT;    Georgia amends water basin plan
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In an effort to salvage deteriorating water war
negotiations, Georgia officials put an altered proposal on the
table on Tuesday to keep Florida from pulling out of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials said they will study Georgia's new plan, but
they declined to say whether they will budge from their declaration
this month that a continuation of the talks beyond a Dec. 31
deadline appear to be futile.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Florida and Alabama are locked in a battle over sharing
the waters of the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint river
basin, or the ACF. The basin's headwaters begin in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia wants to be sure it has enough water to allow for future
development. But Florida and Alabama are concerned Georgia's use of
the water from those rivers will leave less water for their own
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has proposed a water-allocation plan that would
guarantee certain minimum flows of water at the Georgia borders
during droughts, through the manipulation of dams along the
Chattahoochee, for the next 50 years. Tuesday, Georgia officials
modified that plan to allow for a changes to be made after only 10
years. Georgia officials also called for a study to determine if
minimum flow levels should be maintained along the Flint River, as
well as the Chattahoochee, during droughts.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether negotiators from Alabama and Florida will
agree to the Georgia plan, or the changes introduced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three states are scheduled to meet in another negotiating
session in Tallahassee on Dec. 29. If they don't agree to extend
the deadline, the talks will fail and the squabble could head to
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials say chances of reaching a settlement in the
ACF fight are slim and perhaps unachievable because of Georgia's
refusal to agree to specific flow conditions in the Flint River.
They say they probably will not agree to a deadline extension if
Georgia remains unyielding. The Flint, which begins just south of
Hartsfield International Airport, meets up with the Chattahoochee
in southwest Georgia at the Florida state line to form the
Apalachicola. The Apalachicola flows across the Florida Panhandle
and nourishes oysters and other marine life in Apalachicola Bay on
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For an agreement to be reached, Florida and Alabama also would
have to agree to other stipulations, such as limits on how much
they can withdraw from the basin for human consumption and
industry. In addition, Florida would have to agree to limits on how
much oysters and other commercial fishes can be taken from
Apalachicola Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's demands sparked visible annoyance among Florida's
negotiators. Bob Kerr, Georgia's chief negotiator, said that
Georgia wants to make sure that Florida properly manages
Apalachicola Bay in return for guaranteed volumes of water from the
state.

RESEARCHERS STILL HEALING FROM GULF WAR SYNDROME
WHISTLE - BLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Md.)   (bl)  
 By CARL HULSE   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group Washington Bureau   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James Moss is a regular at the veterans medical
center in Gainesville, Fla., another casualty of Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Moss was not a soldier in the conflict. Rather, he was a U.S.
Agriculture Department researcher whose work on insecticides
unexpectedly suggested a link between the chronic disorder
afflicting thousands of veterans and an experimental drug taken as
a nerve gas antidote by Gulf War troops.
</P>
<P>
   When he refused to halt what his superiors claimed was an
unauthorized study, he lost his job. He now works as a temporary
research technician at the VA center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a big irony,'' observed Moss, 48, still bruised from
his run-in with a hostile government bureaucracy. ``It is rather
amazing to be in there working among veterans, especially knowing
some are sick'' from the very problem he investigated.
</P>
<P>
   After years of government denials, a new Pentagon-funded study
has substantiated what Moss and another Florida scientist, Thomas
Tiedt of Bradenton, said all along _ pyridostigmine bromide, given
to troops to protect against nerve gas attacks, was a potential
culprit in the puzzling, debilitating malady. The cure, in effect,
caused the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``PB cannot be ruled out as a possible contributor to the
development of unexplained or undiagnosed illness in some PGW
veterans,'' said the authoritative Rand Corp. study issued in
October.
</P>
<P>
   While not conclusive on the link, the finding was a far cry from
the insistent Pentagon position that the PB tablets given more than
250,000 servicemen and women were no factor in the syndrome _ a
stance affirmed in two earlier government studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't rule it out, by definition you are ruling it
in,'' said Tiedt, who like Moss, is acknowledged in the Rand study
for his research on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Both men expressed a level of satisfaction in the release of the
Rand review, but they are still healing from wounds suffered in
their battle with powerful government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tiedt, 49, a medical toxicology consultant, said he devoted
almost full-time to the controversy at his own expense between
1994-98 only to be treated like a pariah by some of his colleagues
in the research community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would show up at these things and I was just ridiculed all
over the place,'' said Tiedt, who said his personal finances also
took a beating. ``I will be forever behind the eight ball
financially.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact on Moss, recognized as one of the first to raise the
prospect of PB contributing to the disorder, was even more direct.
Ordered to quit his pursuit of how insecticides widely applied in
Gulf military installations might have interacted with PB, Moss not
only refused to stop but eventually took his findings to receptive
members of Congress in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his research contract later that year and had to go on
unemployment. He became a substitute teacher to support his wife,
Gail, a librarian, and their three children. His life was seriously
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a very pivotal role and he paid a very heavy price
for his citizenship and his advocacy on behalf of Gulf War
veterans,'' said Paul Sullivan, executive director of the National
Gulf War Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent congressional hearing on the report, other
veterans advocates singled out Moss and Tiedt for their willingness
to step forward on the controversy when others shied away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have experts who have been on the veterans' side since
1993,'' said Denise Nichols, a retired Air Force nurse and
vice-chair of the National Vietnam &AMP; Gulf War Veterans Coalition,
in recognizing the work of Moss and Tiedt. Moss earlier received a
commendation from the state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the personal turmoil, Moss is not sure he could have
done anything differently once his work with cockroaches pointed
him in the direction of a tie between PB and DEET, a popular
insecticide that the Agriculture Department helped develop in the
1950s in the same Gainesville lab where Moss worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't just sit on it,'' said Moss, about his decision to
publicize his research despite fierce resistance from his
superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Moss filed a complaint over his job loss, but a USDA
investigation reported that he was simply let go when his contract
expired and there was no other position for him, a decision upheld
by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Tiedt came to the subject via a different route. As a
postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland in the 1970s, he
did some of the original research demonstrating the toxicity of
compounds like PB even at low dosages.
</P>
<P>
   So he said he was shocked when, while channel surfing in June
1994, he came across C-Span's coverage of a congressional hearing
at which three government experts testified under oath that PB
posed no known toxic risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you at the time that threw me for a loop,''
recalled Tiedt, who _ after a few sleepless nights _ contacted Sen.
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.V., then head of the Senate Veterans' Affairs
Committee. Rockefeller was sympathetic to veterans' claims that PB
tablets had helped make them sick and had himself been looking for
Tiedt.
</P>
<P>
   Tiedt provided Rockefeller's staff with evidence of extensive
research on PB, material included in a searing 1994 Senate panel
report critical of the Pentagon's history of experimenting on its
own troops. Tiedt then considered the matter closed.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of continued Pentagon stonewalling on the research
surrounding PB, Tiedt pressed on. He testified before a
presidential advisory commission and then a House panel in 1997
about the existing record on the potential consequences of PB and
his view that it would not have protected the troops regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seemed to finally turn the tide with the DOD,'' said
Tiedt, decrying the human anguish that arose out of the military's
decision to give troops PB when research indicated it would be
ineffective for its intended purpose. ``It should have never been
administered in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tiedt nor Moss equate their own personal trials with the
suffering by the actual victims of Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tiedt: ``It doesn't match 100,000 veterans who are sick and
hundreds of thousands of others and maybe millions of Americans who
are deeply offended at the lack of respect'' shown the veterans by
government skepticism toward their illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has motivated the veterans and the people supporting the
veterans is simply a yearning for respect,'' he said. ``For
somebody just to say, we believe you.''

<P>
   According to a three-year study done by the Center for Lifestyle
Management, an average of 10 hours on Christmas week are spent
arguing and bickering with family members about holiday-related
activities.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting statistic, to be sure, but what I want to know is
what these family members are doing the rest of the time?
</P>
<P>
   According to my cheap, matchbox-size pocket calculator
(Christmas gift, 1995), there are 168 hours in a week. Assuming
that family members do not quarrel during their eight hours of
sleep each night, that still leaves 102 hours that family members
are not arguing or bickering with each other about holiday-related
activities during Christmas week.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, if you're not arguing with your family
members for more than 10 hours Christmas week, you're not really
trying. Ten hours of holiday-related bickering is nothing. Many
family-members can't even clear their throat in that short a time.
Heck, in my house we've done more bickering than that just hauling
the Christmas stuff down from the attic.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for this woeful lack of bickering? My guess is
that the average American family is not engaging in nearly enough
holiday-related activities. Simply sitting down together and
agreeing on a Christmas-card message should be good for at least
five hours of bickering. You can add another five hours by
discussing who gets a card and who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Families that are interested in getting their bickering time up
where it belongs should try engaging in the following
holiday-related activities:
</P>
<P>
   Buy a Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing gets the holiday bickering scene off to a ``bang'' than
a trip to the ol' tree lot. Begin by arguing over whether you want
a long-needle or short-needle tree. If everybody in your family
prefers one type, then you should demand they buy the other. Point
out that all the trees everyone else likes have lousy shapes, drop
needles and are hard to decorate. As soon as people start agreeing
with your point of view, change your mind. Insist on visiting at
least four lots on opposite ends of town before making a decision.
Forget to bring a rope to tie the tree down in the trunk of your
car. And, of course, always buy a tree that is too big to fit in
your tree stand.
</P>
<P>
   Play Christmas music nonstop for the entire week.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing brings families closer together, bickering-wise, then
back-to-back-to-back playings of the Jingle Dogs rendition of
``Away in a Manger.'' Even a brief playing of any Christmas albums
sung by Leonard Nimoy or Ringo Starr should accomplish the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Decorate the outside of your house with those trendy new icicle
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Icicle lights were specifically engineered for those people who
couldn't tangle the lights they had into a big enough knot. Icicle
lights are pre-tangled at the factory, thereby saving the busy
homeowner the trouble of doing it himself. To me, nothing says
''Christmas'' like trying to unravel a hopelessly snarled set of
icicle lights while balanced precariously atop a 30-foot extension
ladder on a windy day. Other family members can lend encouragement
to the person hanging the lights by telling him to hurry-up or,
after he's finished, by telling him they wish he'd bought a
different color.
</P>
<P>
   Go shopping at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas shopping is plenty stressful what with the traffic,
the joust for a parking space, the mobs of desperate shoppers and
the surly and/or confused and/or unresponsive salesclerks. Bring
the whole family along and the experience comes to resemble the
dizzy, nerve-stretching terror one normally associates with the
shower scene in the movie ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   While you're there, be sure to let the kids visit Santa. Few
things relax a small child more than being involuntarily hauled, in
front of a crowd of staring people, onto the lap of a huge,
strange, harshly lighted man in a wet, smelly red suit who bellows
``Ho! Ho! Ho!'' at odd intervals and for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   If you engage in just a few of these holiday-related family
activities, I'm sure you'll find yourself arguing and bickering a
lot more than 10 hours Christmas week. In fact, you might want to
start the week before, just to make sure you get it all in.

CHRISTMAS `REVUE' OF CHILDREN'S SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you plan to bring a computer home this gift-giving season for
Junior and Sissy, you might want to add something to help with the
experience during the coming year: A subscription to Children's
Software Revue.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about this bimonthly publication before, because
it's a reliable place to find impartial, kid- and parent-tested
software. Revue Editor Warren Buckleitner started the magazine
after years of evaluating children's software for an
education-based group.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Revue is supported by its subscribers; it does not
accept advertising from the publishers of software it evaluates.
(Yeah, yeah, I know. The other magazines all have policies saying
advertisers have no control over editorial content. But seeing the
full-page ad for Modem's Magical Dialtone Vacation across from the
glowing review of Modem's Magical Dialtone Vacation always gives
pause.)
</P>
<P>
   And I like a magazine where the ``Greetings from the Staff''
column says that computers are not the ultimate dream when it comes
to childhood development: ``Kids will always be kids, and
technology can not and should not replace experiences like riding a
bike or reading a book.'' It's an obvious viewpoint _ but one not
emphasized enough in computer magazines catering to families.
</P>
<P>
   When Junior and Sissy sit in front of the computer, they may as
well be exposed to quality software _ and the current issue of
Children's Software Revue has reviews of 164 new CDs, Internet
sites and computers for kids. (They even give a nod to some games
for the PlayStation and Nindendo 64.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for some games for the whole family to use on
the computer once it's up and running, CSR offers these
suggestions: Elite Darts is ``the next-best thing to being there.''

By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I was contacted a few years ago about some unclaimed money
coming to me in California, but I was not told how much or where it
was from. Who can I contact about collecting this?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.O., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The California state controller's office handles unclaimed

now offer searchable databases on the Web. To find these, visit the
site www.unclaimed.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the '60s, there was a popular light called the Rain Lamp
that pumped oil up and down a series of nylon strings. Where can I

ISRAELI ARMY REPORTS SLAYING OF 2 TERRORISTS PLANNING BOMB ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Two terrorists, reportedly from Hamas, were killed
by Israeli commandos Monday night near Hebron as they prepared a
bomb attack, Israeli army officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza City, leaders of the militant Hamas movement praised the
two as martyrs and accused Israeli forces of deliberately killing
them.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli defense officials said the two had been killed after
firing on an undercover surveillance unit that found them in a town
in the West Bank, Beit Awwa. The officials said that both men were
members of the clandestine Hamas military wing and that they ranked
high on Israel's most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   Two explosive devices were seized in the raid, according to Gen.
Yitzhak Eitan, commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank. ``They
were on their way to carry out an attack and were surprised by our
forces,'' said Eitan. ``So their attack was averted.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Beit Awwa said soldiers fired a volley of rockets
at the house after having exchanged fire with the two militants,
who were later found dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   The army unit ``had a good idea who they were'' and hoped to
capture them alive, said Deputy Defense Minister Efrain Sneh on
Tuesday night. ``If terrorists surrender,'' said Sneh, ``they don't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier comments by Sneh were interpreted by Hamas leaders
as confirmation that Israeli forces had intended to kill the two.
``There is an automatic contract on anyone from Hamas who commits
murderous attacks,'' Sneh had said, in response to a state radio
reporter who asked whether the army purposely killed the men.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hamas in Gaza, Ismail Abu Shanab, said, ``Israel
bears full responsibility for this killing, and we say we have the
total right to defend ourselves and to react to this criminal
act.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, Iyad Batat, was said by Israeli authorities to have
been a commander of Hamas guerrilla forces in the Hebron area, and
he was accused of the shooting death of a border police officer
this year. Reporting at the time to a parliamentary committee, Sneh
had predicted that those responsible for the officer's death would
be ``dead within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the radio interview Tuesday, Sneh said, ``I had said that
within a year those attackers would die, and see, it took less than
a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Tuesday night, Sneh hastened to clarify that he had
not meant his statement to imply ``that Israel acts like the mob,''
marking its enemies for execution. Rather, he said, he had meant to
stress that government policy was to pursue anyone responsible for
attacks against Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said then that I can promise you that in one year they will
be killed,'' Sneh said. ``This was not a judicial statement. It was
just a way of saying that we have a very active policy of combating
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officers called the raid a serious blow against Hamas,
already debilitated by the seizures of weapons and explosives in
Palestinian territory and the closing of military planning offices
in Jordan and Syria. Three other accused Hamas militants were
arrested in the sweep at Beit Awwa.

about the consistency of cream and was full of subtle flavors that
didn't overwhelm the pumpkin flavor.''

 &HT;    Bradley, Gore compete for gay vote
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last spring, when Bill Bradley was still a blip on
the political radar, Vice President Al Gore's campaign sat down
with two dozen gay and lesbian leaders in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the meeting, led by Gore's former campaign
manager, Craig Smith, was to build support for Gore in New York's
influential gay and lesbian community, according to Kevin Finnegan,
the president of a gay Democratic club and one of those who
attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear that what they really meant by 'support' was
money,'' Finnegan recalled. ``We said, 'Look, we don't know what
the vice president's positions are and where he's going to take
things.' Craig Smith didn't know anything. . . It was a very
disappointing meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bill Bradley, who in the summer and early fall organized
several of his own meetings with New York gay and lesbian leaders.
Bradley's spade work paid off. Two weeks ago, he picked up
endorsements from several prominent gay and lesbian activists,
including Finnegan and two New York city council members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley reached out to the community in a way that Gore did
not,'' said Finnegan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is now doing some outreach of his own. On Monday, he issued
a three-sentence statement calling for an end to the
administration's ``Don't ask, Don't tell'' policy toward gays and
lesbians in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opposition to the 1993 policy, universally decried by gay
and lesbian advocacy groups, ranks as one of his highest profile
breaks with the Clinton administration. The policy, which First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton last week also denounced, prohibits
superiors from investigating or asking about the sexual orientation
of military personnel. But it allows gay service men and women to
be discharged if they talk about their sexuality openly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to publicly abandon ``Don't ask, Don't tell,''
which aides say he privately opposed for years, underscores the
extent to which the vice president has had to jettison his
political strategy of focusing on the general election and the
eventual Republican nominee in favor of one that confronts the
threat Bradley poses for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is now having to fight Bradley for votes among a
constituency that, according to some gay and lesbian leaders, he
took for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying contest for votes among gay and lesbian
Americans also illustrates much about Bradley. While Bradley has
publicly disparaged the politics of playing to special interest
groups, privately he has waged an aggressive campaign to reach out
to key constituencies within the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In September, following several private meetings with gay and
lesbian leaders in New York, Bradley announced his support for
virtually every major initiative supported by the gay and lesbian
community, including opposition to ``Don't ask, Don't tell,'' and
support for full equality of benefits for domestic partners. He
remains opposed to government sanction of gay and lesbian
marriages, and as a New Jersey senator Bradley voted for the
Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between
a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's willingness to learn about issues important to gays
and lesbians won over Ethan Geto, a gay activist in New York who
became one of Bradley's state co-chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody at that level comes to you and solicits your
advice, then they take all of your advice in an aggressive,
committed fashion, how can you not support them?'' Geto said.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian voters are only a small percentage of the
electorate, but they comprise an influential block within the
Democratic Party, particularly in New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley and Al Gore have learned to count,'' said Keith
Morrison, managing director of the Stonewall Democratic Federation,
the gay and lesbian wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison described the behind the scenes push for gay and
lesbian votes as the most intense of any previous presidential
election. ``It's almost to the point where you wish they didn't
have your phone number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay and lesbian advocacy
group, hasn't endorsed either Gore or Bradley but plans to endorse
soon, said executive director Elizabeth Birch.
</P>
<P>
   Birch welcomed Gore's opposition to ``Don't ask, Don't tell''
and hinted her organization would back the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of gay people out there are
supportive of the vice president because they have seen action,''
Birch said. ``The fact is that Bill Bradley was never a leader on
these issues. He was always a good vote, but he was never a
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gore has picked up the endorsement of three of the
state's five openly gay and lesbian public office holders. Bradley
has the endorsement of the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also won the endorsement of Ronald Johnson, the city's
former AIDS administrator and an influential figure in the fight
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with our early meetings with former senator
Bradley and the degree to which and the way he addressed issues
that were important to gay men,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson and others announced their support for Bradley,
Gore's New York campaign elevated state Sen. Tom Duane, an
influential gay legislator, to the position of honorary co-chairman
and named Emily Giske, vice chairman of the state party, as a
senior advisor to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Giske said the Gore campaign ``probably miscalculated'' in not
reaching out to New York gay and lesbian leaders sooner. But she
said that Bradley had made a calculated effort to split the gay and
lesbian vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bradley campaign was very astute,'' she said. ``They took
a big chart and they put it on the wall and they said, 'What makes
up this primary vote?' You can still do that in this primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the majority of the gay and lesbian Democratic
clubs have not endorsed either candidate yet, although the vice
president enjoys widespread popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the Golden state, Gore can take nothing for granted.
The Stonewall Democratic Club of Los Angeles, the largest
Democratic club in the state, gay or otherwise, endorsed Gore in
January.
</P>
<P>
   But many members are now unhappy with the early endorsement,
according West Hollywood city council member Steve Martin, a former
club president. Martin, who is not committed to either Gore or
Bradley, said he is considering offering a motion to rescind the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that Gore could wrap this up in the gay and
lesbian community and take our constituency for granted,'' Martin
said. ``I don't see that it's in our community's best interest to
swear allegiance to one Democratic candidate, when there is another
candidate who is wooing us and who's record is very credible on our
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bauman, the club's current president, said the majority of
Stonewall members still support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been consistently the gay and lesbian community's
best friend in the White House,'' Bauman said. ``Bradley has made
some proposals that are very progressive on gay rights, but I
always urge people to look at someone's record.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the top issues for gay and lesbian issues in California
is a ballot initiative scheduled for March 7 that would make gay
and lesbian marriages illegal. Bradley was the first presidential
candidate to announce his opposition to the ballot question, and
Gore quickly followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley also support hate crimes legislation,
another important issue among gay and lesbian voters. Bradley has
gone one step further than Gore, saying he would seek to amend the
1964 Civil Rights Act to include gays and lesbians as a protected
group of citizens.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Chestnut Soup Soothes the Soul  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Richard Reddington might not be as well known as
Hubert Keller or Roland Passot, but his star is on the rise. Just
taste his Chestnut Soup with Leeks and Apples if you need
convincing.
<P>
   Like any great cook, Reddington, who worked at Chapeau in the
Richmond District until earlier this year, is able to coax
complexity out of only a few ingredients. And this soup is easy for
the home cook because it requires no stock and only a few
ingredients _ mainly chestnuts, leeks, apples, celery root and
cream.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find fresh chestnuts, canned work just fine, and
the celery root is readily available at most supermarkets. This
gnarled root vegetable needs to be peeled before being used, but
the work pays big dividends when combined with the other
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The soup is an adaptation of one that Reddington learned working
with Daniel Boulud at Daniel in New York. That was only one stop on
his culinary career. He started at La Folie, took off for France
and worked several years for Roger Verge and then with Alain
Passard at Arpege, a Michelin three-star restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   On his return to the states, he not only worked for Boulud, but
opened Spago Beverly Hills with Wolfgang Puck and worked as chef de
cuisine at Jardini &LR; e &LR; re under Traci des Jardins.
</P>
<P>
   While the setting at Chapeau is modest _ money has been spent on
the wine list and table settings, but not the decor _ the food is
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Sweating the vegetables. &LR;  Don't rush this slow process of
cooking the leeks and onions, known in professional kitchens as
``sweating.'' Slow cooking gently releases the sweet flavor of the
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ An unexpected combination.  &LR; The play of distinctive chestnut
and celery root flavors mediated by apple is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CHESTNUT SOUP WITH LEEKS &AMP; APPLES
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks (white and tender light-green parts only), well rinsed
and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-size celery roots, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound roasted and peeled fresh or canned chestnuts
</P>
<P>
   6 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add the leeks
and onion, cover and cook very slowly, stirring occasionally, until
soft and translucent, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the apples and celery root and continue to cook over low
heat until the apples begin to fall apart, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chestnuts and water. Increase heat to medium-high and
simmer until the chestnuts are very tender, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Return the
soup to a boil; remove from heat. Cool slightly, then puree in a
blender until smooth. Strain. Rewarm, if necessary.

 BY KEVIN K. SINGER  
 c.1999 Oncology.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Survival may be the first priority when one receives a diagnosis
of cancer, but at some point many patients become concerned with
the effects that battling the disease will have on their sexuality
and, ultimately, their self-esteem and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Oncology Nursing Society's 10th Annual Fall
Institute in Salt Lake City, two health-care professionals outlined
the problems cancer patients face in terms of their sexuality, and
discussed strategies to help them cope and overcome their
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Whether dealing with hair loss or fatigue, the vast majority of
cancer patients have some worries that relate, either directly or
indirectly, to their sexuality. But in the past, the focus has
often been mainly on concrete sexual problems, such as impotence or
vaginal dryness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the research that has been done has been in focused
cancer groups,'' said presenter Sandra Mitchell, a nurse
practitioner at the University of Maryland Cancer Center in
Baltimore. ``We don't have a good sense of how widespread the
problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexual issues arising from cancer are typically disease-,
treatment- and/or gender- specific, commented Edward B. Rubenstein,
M.D., associate professor of medicine at the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, treatment of prostate, testicular, ovarian and
breast cancers can directly impact one's sexuality. For prostate
cancer, a significant minority of men who receive surgery or
radiation become impotent, and hormonal therapy causes what is
called chemical castration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those patients lose sexual desire and function,'' Rubenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   For women, a mastectomy isn't simply the removal of a breast;
it's also the disfigurement of a sexual organ that for many is a
symbol of their femininity.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation to pelvic areas can decrease a woman's natural vaginal
lubrication, and hormonal therapies often wreak havoc on sexuality.
The libido suffers greatly, said presenter Judy Shell, R.N., a
Ph.D. candidate who is a medical family therapist at Central
Florida Cancer Centers in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Even with cancers not related to sexual organs, systemic
treatment may cause problems, for example raising the specter of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphoma, for instance, requires fairly aggressive chemotherapy.
``If the patients are in the reproductive ages, they may lose
gonadal function,'' Rubenstein said. ``It may be permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon cancer patients often have to wear a colostomy bag, and
head-and-neck cancer patients may have a tracheotomy tube or
discoloring of the face due to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of issues really impact a person's sexuality and
how they view themselves as men and women,'' said Shell. ``Who we
are as men and women can be impacted no matter what the cancer
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair loss, one of the most common and visible effects of cancer
treatment, can devastate a person's self-image as a sexual being.
``Hair is a symbol of social status, personality and attraction,''
Shell said. ``Baldness can signify illness, and, culturally, ill
and sick people are asexualized.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting also play havoc with one's
sexuality. ``A lot of the aggressive chemotherapies knock you for a
loop,'' Rubenstein said. ``The side effects can be pretty
debilitating and can interfere with sexual desire.''
</P>
<P>
   On the most basic psychological level, cancer and subsequent
treatment can affect a patient's sexuality by undermining their
view of themselves as capable, healthy human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every patient has some sexuality concerns, not just in terms
of intimate sexual relations, but who they are as men and women,''
Shell said. ``Sexuality is not just sex.''
</P>
<P>
   For single patients, the question becomes: Who will find me
attractive, and how or what do I tell any potential partners about
the disease?
</P>
<P>
   For those already involved with someone, the illness forever
alters that relationship. ``Cancer affects the relationship,
sometimes for the good, and sometimes not for the good,'' Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that sexuality isn't simply intercourse, Shell said
that when battling cancer, many patients need some level of
intimacy and support. ``Often, they're more interested in just
[being] held,'' she said. ``They need to feel connected and loved.
They need a sense of security, which is really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell tells couples dealing with cancer to talk. ``At the point
in time they should be closest to someone, that's when they're
furthest apart,'' she said. ``One of our jobs is to help them
communicate with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sexuality, however, communication in general is
often a problem, since the topic is often seen as taboo by patients
and doctors preoccupied with fighting cancer. Patients may think
sex shouldn't be a priority, Shell said, or they may have been told
this in no uncertain terms by health-care professionals. When
raising questions about sex, some patients have heard they should
be happy to be alive. ``People have been reprimanded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said it's important that doctors and nurses have the
kind of relationship with their patients in which they can talk
about these problems, or at least refer them to someone who can.
``It's not something you're generally going to talk to your
next-door neighbor about,'' she said. ``It's a very private
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Health-care professionals can also provide simple, commonsense
tips to facilitate sexuality, Shell said. For instance, Shell
counsels those who experience fatigue to schedule sexual activity
around the time of day they feel most energetic, even though it may
not be their usual time for intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity is key to overcoming some of these concerns. After
battling breast cancer, Jacqueline Brandwynne became engrossed in
the topic of women's sexuality during and after cancer treatment.
She consulted cancer patients, therapists and gynecologists, and
developed a vaginal lubricant for her Very Private line of
products. She also composed a seven-step program to guide women
back into their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do things that are real,'' Brandwynne said. ``(The
seven-step program) gives them a logical sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Before doctors and nurses can offer any help, they have to
reevaluate their view of sexuality, both Shell and Mitchell noted.
The preferred model, they agreed, should incorporate physiological,
interpersonal, psychological and cultural aspects of the patients
and their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also very important to validate for the person the
importance of their concerns,'' Mitchell said, ``and normalize
those concerns.''

Undated: folk costumes. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  The researchers presented their results earlier this month at
a meeting on the importance of perishables in prehistory that was
held at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ``One of the most
common reactions we heard was, `How could we have missed that stuff
all these years?''' Dr. Adovasio said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret W. Conkey, a professor of anthropology at the
University of California at Berkeley, and co-editor, with Joan
Gero, of ``Engendering Archaeology'' (Blackwell Publishers, 1991)
said, ``They're helping us to look at old materials in new ways, to
which I say bravo!''
</P>
<P>
   Not all scholars had been blinded by the Venutian morphology.
Dr. Elizabeth Wayland Barber, a professor of archaeology and
linguistics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, included in her
1991 volume ``Prehistoric Textiles,'' a chapter arguing that some
of the Venus figurines were wearing string skirts. The recent work
from Dr. Soffer and her colleagues extends and amplifies on the Dr.
Barber's original observations.
</P>
<P>
   The new work also underscores the often neglected importance of
what Dr. Barber has termed the ``string revolution.''
Archaeologists have long emphasized the invention of stone and
metal tools in furthering the evolution of human culture. Even the
names given to various periods in human history and prehistory are
based on heavyweight tools: the word ``Paleolithic'' _ the period
extending from about 750,000 years ago to 15,000 years ago _
essentially means ``Old Stone Age.'' Duly thudding and clanking
after the Paleolithic period were the Mesolithic and Neolithic, or
Middle and New Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the
Industrial Age.
</P>
<P>
   But at least as central to the course of human affairs as the
invention of stone tools was the realization that plant products
could be exploited for purposes other than eating. The fact that
some of the Venus figurines are shown wearing string skirts, said
Dr. Barber, ``means that the people who made them must also have
known how tn make twisted string.''
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of string and the power to weave, people
could construct elaborate yet lightweight containers in which to
carry, store and cook food. They could fashion baby slings to
secure an infant snugly against its mother's body, thereby freeing
up the woman to work and wander. They could braid nets, the better
to catch prey animals without the risk of hand-to-tooth combat.
They could lash together wooden logs or planks to build a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The string revolution was a profound event in human history,''
Adovasio said. ``When people started to fool around with plants and
plant byproducts, that opened vast new avenues of human progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new report, the researchers argue that women are likely
to have been the primary weavers and textile experts of prehistory,
and may have even initiated the string revolution in the first
place _ although men undoubtedly did their share of weaving when it
came to making hunting and fishing nets, for example. They base
that conclusion on modern crosscultural studies, which have found
that women constitute the great bulk of the world's weavers,
basketry makers and all-round mistresses of plant goods.
</P>
<P>
   While vast changes in manufacturing took the luster off the
textile business long ago, with the result that such ``women's
work'' is now accorded low status and sweatshop wages, the
researchers argue that weaving and other forms of fiber craft once
commanded great prestige. By their estimate, the detailing of the
stitches shown on some of the Venus figurines was intended to
flaunt the value and beauty of the original spinsters' skills. Why
else would anybody have bothered etching the stitchery in a
permanent medium, if not to boast, whoa! Check out these wefts!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made immortal in stone,'' Dr. Soffer said. ``You don't
carve something like this unless it's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The detailing of the Venutian garb also raises the intriguing
possibility that the famed little sculptures, which rank right up
there with the Lascaux cave paintings in the pantheon of Western
art, were hewn by women _ moonlighting seamstresses, to be precise.
``It's always assumed that the carvers were men, a bunch of guys
sitting around making their zaftig Barbie dolls,'' Dr. Soffer said.
``But maybe that wasn't the case, or not always the case. With some
of these figurines, the person carving them clearly knew weaving.
So either that person was a weaver herself, or he was living with
her. He's got an adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Durable though the Venus figurines are, Adovasio and his
co-workers are far more interested in what their carved detailing
says about the role of perishables in prehistory. ``The vast bulk
of what humans made was made in media that hasn't survived,''
Adovasio said. Experts estimate the ratio of perishable objects to
durable objects generated in the average culture is about 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reconstructing the past based on 5 percent of what was
used,'' Dr. Soffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the items that have endured over the millennia
are things like arrowheads and spear points, archaeologists
studying the Paleolithic era have generally focused on the ways and
means of that noble savage, a k a Man the Hunter, to the exclusion
of other members of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, in Paleolithic studies we hear about Man the
Hunter doing such boldy wonderful things as thrusting spears into
woolly mammoths, or battling it out with other men,'' Adovasio
said. ``We've emphasized the activities of a small segment of the
population _ healthy young men _ at the total absence of females,
old people of either sex and children. We've glorified one aspect
of Paleolithic life ways at the expense of all the other things
that made that life way successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest examples of fabric yet discovered are some
carbonate-encrusted swatches from France that are about 18,000
years old, while pieces of cordage and string dating back 19,000
years have been unearthed in the Near East, many thousands of years
after the string and textile revolution began.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to study ancient textiles in the absence of
textiles, Dr. Soffer, Dr. Adovasio and Dr. Hyland have sought
indirect signs of textile manufacture. They have pored over
thousands of ancient fragments of fired and unfired clay, and have
found impressions of early textiles on a number of them, the oldest
dating to 29,000 B.C. But the researchers believe that textile
manufacture far predates this time period, for the sophistication
of the stitchery rules out it's being, as Dr. Soffer put it, ``what
you take home from Crafts 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Adovasio estimates that weaving and cord-making probably goes
back to the year 40,000 B.C. ``at a minimum,'' and possibly much
further.
</P>
<P>
   Long before people had settled down into towns with domesticated
plants and animals, then, while they were still foragers and
wanderers, they had, in a sense, tamed nature. The likeliest sort
of plants from which they extracted fibers were nettles. ``Nettle
in folk tales and mythology is said to have magic properties,'' Dr.
Soffer said. ``In one story by the Brothers Grimm, a girl whose two
brothers have been turned into swans has to weave them nettle
shirts by midnight to make them human again.'' The nettles stung
her fingers, but she kept on weaving.
</P>
<P>
   But what didn't make it into Grimms' was that when the girl was
done with the shirts, she took out a chisel, and carved herself a
Venus figurine.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Cookbooks Offer Gift-Givers a Stocking Full of  Great
Ideas   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  So many books, so little time . . . If you tried
to make every recipe published in books in 1999, you'd still be
cooking when the clock strikes midnight in the year 2001.
<P>
   Here's a round-up of books we especially liked this year
(several have already received the full review treatment in this
section, and some may get complete reviews later). Any of them
would make a good gift for a cook on your holiday list _ especially
if that cook is a Francophile. This year, French cookbooks
dominated the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Daniel Boulud's Cafe Boulud Cookbook: French-American &LR; 
 &UR; Recipes for the Home Cook,'' &LR;  by Daniel Boulud (with Dorie
Greenspan; Scribner; 400 pages; $35) is modeled after this New York
celebrity chef's restaurant. Menus are divided into the categories
of classic French, seasonal, international inspirations and food
from the garden, and the book encourages creative mixing. Many
recipes are for complete entrees, including side dishes, so a cook
can recreate the whole dining experience. And, true to the title,
these are recipes for home meals, with only a few extravagances
that veer into restaurant cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ In  &UR; ``Parisian Home Cookiversations, Recipes and Tips &LR; 
 &UR; From the Cooks and Food Merchants of Paris'' &LR;  (William Morrow; 335
pages; $25), Michael Roberts goes to great lengths to point out
that the French insistence on fresh ingredients does not mean
purchasing budget-busting luxury items and that many splendid
French home recipes don't require hours of complicated preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is an entertaining writer, and his anecdotes and
descriptions of markets and people bring the Paris food scene to
life.
</P>
<P>
   _ Veteran food writer Georgeanne Brennan entices readers to
catch the cadence of eating  &LR; a &LR;  la Fran &LR; c &LR; aise &LR;  in  &UR; ``Savoring &LR; 
 &UR; France: Recipes and Reflections on French Cooking,'' &LR;  a
Williams-Sonoma book with stunning scenic photos by Steven Rothfeld
(Time Life Books; 256 pages; $39.95). The book is especially strong
on the kind of first courses common in France but rarely found in
French restaurants abroad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Straddling the French-Spanish border, San Francisco chef
Gerald Hirigoyen (Fringale and Pastis restaurants) recalls his
boyhood in  &UR; ``The Basque Kitchen: Tempting Food from the &LR; 
 &UR; Pyrenees'' &LR;  (with Cameron Hirigoyen, HarperCollins; 262 pages;
$35).
</P>
<P>
   He offers a wealth of recipes for true Basque cooking, which he
calls rustic in the best sense of the term: excellent ingredients
simply prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Other local chefs share their enthusiasm as much as their
recipes in books published this year.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Rose Pistola Cookbook,'' &LR;  by Reed Hearon and Peggy
Knickerbocker (Broadway Books; 276 pages; $35) is packed with
recipes for the wonderful food that distinguish this North Beach
hot spot. Hearon focuses on the dishes that Italian immigrants from
Liguria brought with them when they came to San Francisco looking
for gold _ and stayed to build a city.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon's fish dishes _ like roast whole fish with artichokes and
potatoes, one of the restaurant's signature dishes _ are especially
wonderful. A home version is simple to make and its presentation is
the height of rustic elegance.
</P>
<P>
   _ In &UR; ``The Tra Vigne Cookbook: Seasons in the California Wine &LR; 
 &UR; Country,'' &LR;  Michael Chiarello (with Penelope Wisner; Chronicle
Books; 215 pages; $35), chef of Tra Vigne restaurant in St Helena,
draws on his sumptuous culinary heritage _ his father's homemade
wine, his grandfather's home-cured prosciutto, his mother's
vegetable garden _ combines it with a Northern California larder
and creates a distinctive cuisine rich with a sense of tradition
and seasonality.
</P>
<P>
   Chiarello bases much of his cooking on master recipes suitable
for each season. And while perfecting these and other Chiarello's
recipes may require perseverance from a novice home cook, results
will leave holiday guests with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alice Waters and crew brought us another book whose visual
appeal matches its culinary merits.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; ``Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook'' &LR;  (with David Tanis and Fritz
Streif and illustrations by David Lance Goines; HarperCollins; 267
pages; $35) is a must-have for admirers of Waters and her
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the upstairs cafe with its eclectic
California/Proven &LR; c &LR; al/ Tuscan melange, this is a more
light-hearted book than previous ``Chez'' volumes, with
reminiscences about the restaurant giving it a personal touch.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous books, it makes a strong appeal for using Northern
California's agricultural bounty. A few recipes push the envelope,
but even though few people will want to make their own head cheese,
it's entertaining to read how this old-fashioned, waste-nothing
concoction is handled at the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the most user-friendly books in the current crop is
former Chez Panisse and Monsoon restaurant pastry chef David
Lebovitz'  &UR; ``Room for Dessert,'' &LR;  (221 pages; HarperCollins; $30).
This well-illustrated volume deserves a prize for clearly laying
out the basics of the craft, from utensils and ingredients to
techniques and, of course, recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Lebovitz admits in his introduction that he left out some great
recipes because they fall into the category of Things Nobody Wants
to Do at Home (spinning sugar, tempering chocolate). Amen.
</P>
<P>
   Those recipes he considered appropriate for home kitchens are
wonderful: flourless chocolate macadamia cake, butterscotch flan,
fig cookies and a plum huckleberry upside-down cake that lifts this
homey cake into the heavenly category.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``West Coast Seafood: The Complete Cookbook,'' &LR;  by Jay Harlow
(Sasquatch Books; 366 pages; $23.95) is a thoroughly researched
volume, offering information on species, their inherent qualities,
seafood seasonality and safety and, of course, excellent recipes.
This book is particularly useful for Northern California cooks
because, true to its title, it deals with the creatures of the sea
that we can purchase, not the catch of Nantucket or the Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Weir Cooking: Recipes From the Wine Country,'' &LR;  by Joanne
Weir (Time-Life Books; 208 pages; $27.50) is based on the Northern
California author's television series by the same name. Preaching
the modern mantra of fresh and seasonal, Weir has a happily
unorthodox approach, encouraging cooks to experiment: ``Forget
about white with chicken, red with meat,'' she writes. ``Follow
your nose and your taste buds and enjoy what tastes good to you.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; `'San Francisco Flavors: Favorite Recipes From the Junior &LR; 
 &UR; League of San Francisco'' &LR;  (Chronicle Books; 319 pages; $27.50) is
a collection gleaned from the kitchens of San Francisco's movers
and shakers, without being a fawninrity book. The volume is
especially strong on that rarely emphasized meal _ brunch.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``Short &AMP; Sweet,'' &LR;  by Melanie Barnard (Houghton Mifflin; 238
pages; $25) delivers what it promises _ desserts in a hurry. One of
the author's strategies is to embellish purchased ingredients like
high-quality pound cake and ice cream. It's a very useful guide for
time-pressed cooks.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``A Spoonful of Ginger,'' &LR;  by Nina Simonds (Alfred A. Knopf;
320 pages; $30) guides Western cooks through a broad range of
Korean, Chinese and Japanese recipes. Extensive lists and sidebars
provide a glimpse at history and philosophy, along with good tips
for using Asian ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``The Pie and Pastry Bible,'' &LR;  by Rose Levy Beranbaum
(Scribner; 692 pages; $35) is a highly acclaimed, exhaustive
treatment of the subjects. There is no faulting the results but for
the most part the recipes are so demanding and time-consuming that
this is a book for perfectionists and professionals.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Piedmont Beats Tuscany for Italian Title   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Italian wine fans are divided over the best region
for red wine _ Piedmont or Tuscany? The controversy is not unlike
the one that divides lovers of California Cabernet Sauvignons _
Napa Valley or Alexander Valley?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Measuring the best Italian red wine region by the number of
wines with DOC and DOCG status, the clear-cut winner is Piedmont.
Eight DOCG wines and 44 DOC wines account for 80 percent of
Piedmont's total production, the highest in Italy; the average in
other regions is about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Denominazione di Origine Controllata  &LR; is the system of Italian
wine production governed by national and regional authorities, in
compliance with the European Economic Community. The DOC covers
approved vines, the winemaking process and the selling of the wine
but does not guarantee quality. DOCG _ DOC with  &LR; Garantita &LR;  _ does
guarantee the authenticity of wines of ``particular esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why does Piedmont have so many more DOC and DOCG wines than,
say, Tuscany?
</P>
<P>
   The hills of Piedmont account for a part of the high quality.
General wisdom says that hills are the best spots for growing
quality wine grapes. Piedmont also has varied soils, especially in
such noted DOCG zones as Barolo and Barbaresco, where there's a
complex mix of calcareous and sandy soils with veins of clay marl.
Further, the climate of Piedmont is right for the leading red
grapes _ Nebbiolo and Barbera _ plus such valuable whites as
Moscato Bianco (Asti Spumante), Arneis and Cortese, the grape of
Gavi or Cortese di Gavi.
</P>
<P>
   Nebbiolo is one of Italy's great classic red grapes and one of
the top red wine grapes of the world. Barolo and Barbaresco,
arguably Italy's best red wines, are made solely from Nebbiolo.
Nebbiolo has an unusual but pleasing nose of ripe plums, violets
and anise, with fresh fruit flavors, sometimes with a trace of
chocolate. Nebbiolo is the grape for Barolo, Barbaresco, Gattinara
and Ghemme.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera is known for its considerable natural acidity and fresh
berry aromas and flavors. Barbera d'Alba and Barbera d'Asti are the
most popular, but producers of Barbera del Monferrato are
campaigning to elevate the reputation of their wines. Barberas from
great vintages, like 1998, are rated among the best of Piedmont
reds.
</P>
<P>
   Moscato Bianco, one of many in a large family of Muscat grapes,
is the highly aromatic grape of lightly sparkling Moscato d'Asti
and Asti Spumante sparkling wines. It is the most widely planted
white grape in Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   Arneis, grown in the Cuneo province, is considered by some to be
Piedmont's best white grape. Elegant and perfumed, it has finesse
and personality. Cortese is the other Piedmont white grape with
character and personality. Cortese is the grape of Cortese di Gavi
or Gavi and is used for still and sparkling wines.
</P>
<P>
   Piedmont is blessed with excellent growing conditions for a
variety of wine grapes. While reds, like Barolo and Barbera,
continue to get better with each vintage, Piedmont whites are the
wines to watch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Year 2000 Calendar &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Peak Vineyards, the Napa Valley producer of Sangiovese
wines and owned by Tuscany's Marchese Piero Antinori, has just
published a four-color Year 2000 Calendar, depicting the seasons of
Atlas Peak's hillside vineyards, the winery's aging caves and
images of winemaker John Falcone. The calendars are $12.95

 LEARNING TO COOK: Teach Them to Bake and They'll Eat For Life   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; One of the best gifts you can give young children
is a lesson in baking cookies. We all know that Santa Claus doesn't
bake, so cookies make a welcome present that children can give.
<P>
   Many years ago I taught baking classes to Brownies and Girl
scouts in Southern California. This recipe for Christmas Nut Chews
was the best _ and easiest _ recipe to make.
</P>
<P>
   To begin, read the recipe entirely. Turn the oven on to 350
degrees. Put all the ingredients on your work counter. For baking
this recipe, I like to use an 8-inch Pyrex pie dish. (The proper
way to measure pie plates or pans is to measure across the bottom,
not the top.)
</P>
<P>
   Because these are soft, chewy cookies, often called ``bar''
cookies, you can also cut them into large pieces and serve them as
dessert with a little whipped cream on top.

   1/3 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Instruction: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Have ready an
8-inch diameter pie plate or an 8-inch square baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Put the butter into a small saucepan and place over low heat.
Stand right by the stove and tilt the pan as the butter begins to
melt so it all melts evenly. Pour the melted butter into the pie
plate (or pan) and tilt and turn the plate until the bottom is
completely covered with butter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mixing the Batter:  &LR; Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and using
a fork, beat them until they are all one color and look well
blended. Add the sugar, flour, baking soda, salt and vanilla. Using
a large spoon, beat the cookie batter until it is completely
blended and smooth. Stir in the walnut pieces. Pour the batter into
the buttered pie plate (or pan).
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Because ovens vary in temperature,
check at 10 minutes by touching the center gently. If it feels
firm, double-check by inserting a toothpick into the center; if it
comes out clean and not damp and sticky, the cookies are done.
Better to bake an extra minute or two if you are in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. Cut into
wedges or squares.
</P>
<P>
   These freeze well if wrapped in 2 or 3 layers of plastic wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 12 to 14 cookies.

 &HT;    Delta improves its bumping rate
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines cut its chronically high passenger
bumping rate during the third quarter but still led the industry
for the first nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The government's latest Air Travel Consumer Report also shows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hartsfield International Airport had the lowest percentage of
on-time arrivals among major U.S. airports during October. Airline
officials blamed the delays on runway repairs and bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumer complaints about big airlines tailed off in October
compared with the previous two months but continue to run well
ahead of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as major airlines today enact a slate of
service-enhancement measures ranging from higher liability caps for
lost luggage to better information about delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   The industry offered the measures _ some of which only formalize
existing procedures _ to avoid calls for congressional action that
followed a wave of airline service horror stories last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary bumping, which occurs when planes are overbooked and
some passengers are put on later flights, has been a stubborn
statistical problem for Delta for two years. In the third quarter
Delta had the seventh-highest rate among the 10 major airlines. The
airline denied boarding to 1,567 passengers, or 0.61 per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   That was down sharply from 5,519 such bumpings and a rate of
2.07 during the second quarter, when Delta was 10th. For the first
nine months of 1999, Delta bumped 15,230 passengers for a rate of
1.98, highest in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest quarter was the first to reflect the changes we're
making,'' said spokesman John Kennedy. ``We're en route to where we
want to be.'' He said Delta expects a rate of around 0.30 for the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While only a tiny percentage of passengers are involuntarily
bumped, a comparatively high rate suggests an airline is too
aggressive in overbooking to hedge against no-shows. Bumping
aggravates gate pileups and delays as agents sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Delta _ after lengthy delays _ has installed new
software to better manage overbooking. He said it is offering
incentives earlier to volunteers when bumping may be necessary,
usually credit toward a future flight.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has had more success improving on-time ratings, which many
passengers rate as their biggest concern. For the 12 months ended
in October, it was fourth out of 10 major airlines, with 77.8
percent of flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled
time.
</P>
<P>
   But in October Delta fell to seventh, which Kennedy attributed
to runway work and bad weather at Hartsfield, its biggest hub. Only
68.2 percent of all Hartsfield arrivals were on time during the
month, down from 77 percent in September. Kennedy said operations
rebounded in November.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints to the U.S. Department of Transportation about major
carriers dropped to 1,086 in October from 2,265 in September. But
in October 1998 there were only 485.
</P>
<P>
   There were 142 gripes about Delta for the month, down from 290
in September but more than double the 68 of October 1998. Delta's
complaint rate was third-best in the industry, the same rank as a
year earlier.

professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.  
 
 TASTER'S CHOICE: Let Them Eat Cake _ If It's From Pillsbury   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Your holiday guests are arriving and there's no
time to whip up a homemade dessert. Will your guests know you took
a shortcut?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depends on which brand of cake mix you've bought, according to
The Chronicle's tasters. Today's panel tasted five yellow cakes
made from mixes. The name brands were close in price, depending on
the store. One lesser-known mix and a store brand were
significantly cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   We prepared the cakes according to package directions and served
them without frosting.
</P>
<P>
   The panel overwhelmingly agreed on a favorite, finding most of
the rest too sweet and artificial-tasting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pillsbury Moist Supreme  &LR; (181/4 ounces, $1.89-$2.29 at many
supermarkets) took top honors. Three panelists particularly enjoyed
the texture. Most liked the flavor, which one described as
``clean.'' But one panelist thought the cake was a bit sweet. Four
would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place was a tie between  &UR; Betty Crocker Super Moist &LR; 
(131/4 ounces, 99 cents-$2.29 at many supermarkets) and  &UR; Duncan &LR; 
 &UR; Hines Moist Deluxe  &LR; (181/4 ounces, $1.99-$2.29 at many
supermarkets). Panelists didn't care for the overly sweet flavor of
Betty Crocker, and complained that the cake was so moist that it
was gummy. Two panelists said the cake tasted like coconut (coconut
is not one of the ingredients). Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists also detected an overwhelming coconut flavor in
the Duncan Hines (coconut is not an ingredient). Others disliked
the artificial flavor _ one compared it to butter-flavored
microwave popcorn. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jiffy &LR;  (9 ounces, 65 cents at Safeway) came in fourth. Three
panelists disliked the dry, crumbly texture, which one likened to a
cotton ball. Others thought its flavor was too mild; another found
it salty. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lucky &LR;  (181/4 ounces, $1.19 at Lucky, now Albertson's) came in
just below Jiffy, putting it in fifth place. One panelist liked the
moist texture, but others found the cake sticky and gummy. Two
panelists noted an eggy taste; others were put off by the
pronounced artificial flavor. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot,
chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and
Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber,
chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are tasted
blind. &QL;

 German Christmas Cookies Evoke Heartfelt Holiday Memories  &HT;        By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; No matter how avant garde we are the rest of the
year, the winter holidays _ Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas _
are times that evoke nostalgia. It's unlikely anybody wants fusion
gingerbread men. The season calls for the kind of cookies you'd
expect Clara's parents to serve in cut-glass dishes in their parlor
in the Nutcracker.
<P>
   Of all the nationalities that have culinary Christmas
traditions, few are more deeply rooted than Germany's Christmas
cookies. Many families of German heritage follow an annual schedule
for making the sweets that accompany afternoon coffee or tea and
are brought out for visitors who drop by, right up to Epiphany or
Three Kings' Day on January 6.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in early November, pfeffern &LR; u &LR; sse, lebkuchen and other
honey-based cookies that need to ripen are stashed in tins. Later
come the marzipan confections, the macaroons, the tiny jam tarts
and butter and sugar cookies, some of which can be eaten the day
they are baked.
</P>
<P>
   We were given some old family recipes for the kinds of Christmas
cookies that can be made now by a Berkeley baker of German
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lenore Griffin retired from the marathon baking she
used to do before Christmas (just as her octogenarian mother, Wilma
Schenk of San Francisco, did before her) some years ago. But she
passed the mantle on to her grown sons and nieces, especially Dion
Griffin, 39, an Alameda business executive who now regularly brings
trays of cookies to his parents' North Berkeley home.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls how in his youth, after all the cookies were cooked
they would cool for a day and the next day he and his brother would
decorate whatever they and their dad hadn't already devoured.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, mom would store the cookies in various cookies
cans . . . I would ravage through all of the cans and take as many
as possible and try to cover my tracks by stacking the cookies in
such a way as to give the illusion that the cans were still full,''
he chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year, I went a bit too far and mom barely had enough
cookies to serve on Christmas Eve. . . from that point forward, mom
would hide the cookies throughout the house, and when we wanted
some, she would slip away and get a plateful at a time from her
secret hiding places.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother's own early recollections of holiday baking have all
the elements of a Christmas tale. Born in San Francisco to
German-American parents, she was taken to Germany as a small child
for a visit to her father's ailing mother. The visit turned out to
be ill-timed. As the clouds of war gathered over Europe, the Schenk
family was not allowed to return to the United States and ended up
spending the war years in Germany, first in her father's native
city of Ulm and, after bombing raids claimed the family home, in
the nearby village of Langenau.
</P>
<P>
   In Ulm, she recalls, their 17th-century house had the
convenience of ``running cold water _ that was all.'' In Langenau,
the family ended up in an old farm house of similar simplicity.
Neither house had an oven. ``You made an appointment with the
baker,'' she says. ``When he was done with his bread baking, you
carried your cookie pans there and later brought them home _
through wind and snow and storm.'' Children were enlisted to this
chore, and while it may have engendered some physical discomfort
(warm clothing was hard to come by in war-time Europe), it added to
the mystique of holiday celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, once the family returned to the United States after
the war and Lenore married, she started perusing German cookbooks
published in this country to translate her old family recipes into
more standardized terms. Her sons _ Dion and his brother _ are
among the beneficiaries of these efforts. Instead of calling for a
nice lump of sweet (unsalted) fresh butter and 250 grams of sugar,
the Griffin family recipes now specify cups of sugar and cubes of
butter _ though it still has to be fresh and sweet.
</P>
<P>

(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Try These Simple Tips and the Perfect Cookie is Yours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Baking holiday cookies is an ancient tradition, and you need not
be a Houdini of the kitchen to produce wonderful results. But there
are a few do's and don'ts that will help assure success:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Use only top-quality ingredients.  &LR; For most Christmas
cookies, that means unsalted butter, preferably European-style. Be
sure eggs are fresh and of the size specified in the recipe. Use
only pure cane sugar (that eliminates most store-brand sugars),
since beet sugar does not react the same in baking. Use
high-quality flour _ if you are an infrequent baker and your bag of
flour has been languishing in your pantry for a year, purchase a
new bag.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Be sure spices are fresh and fragrant.  &LR; If you bake with
two-year-old cinnamon or cloves or ground nutmeg, you might as well
be using sawdust. Baking powder needs to be used before the pull
date or the results will be decidedly flat. (To test, dissolve 1
teaspoon in 1/4 cup water _ if it doesn't bubble, it's lost its
oomph.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Grind your own nuts and almonds.  &LR; Unless they are extremely
fresh, preground nuts also tend to resemble sawdust. And always
taste nuts before using them. Stale nuts can spoil the finest
recipe. A nut grinder _ it resembles a small meat grinder _ is
ideal for grinding, but a food processor works fine if you don't
let the nuts liquefy. When possible, add a little of the sugar or
flour from a recipe to the nuts in the processor to help keep them
dry and fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Make the dough ahead, if you like.  &LR; Most doughs can be made a
day or two ahead _ some, in fact, have to rest at least overnight _
and many can be frozen for up to a month. You can make the dough
when you have a little spare time, then bake cookies when needed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Handle dough carefully.  &LR; Berkeley's Lenore Griffin, who has
passed her German cookie recipes on to her sons and nieces,
recommends a simple technique common in central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For buttery doughs, dust the rolling surface and rolling pin
with a mixture of 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/3 cup flour. The sugar
keeps the flour from clumping and facilitates handling delicate,
rich doughs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Use baking parchment.  &LR; Long used by European home bakers,
baking parchment is becoming increasingly available in the United
States. There are several brands available in cookware shops;
Reynolds now also makes one that is carried in many supermarkets.
It is the single biggest time saver and shortcut to success in
cookie baking. There is virtually no cleanup: Whatever might stick
to baking sheets _ bits of dough, spilled sugar, chocolate run-off
_ sticks to the parchment instead and can just be tossed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Handle cookie sheets properly.  &LR; If you don't own many cookie
sheets, grab the used sheet with a pot holder as soon as the
cookies are removed, discard parchment and run cold water over the
back of the sheet. It will cool it for almost immediate reuse
(never place cookies on a hot sheet) without getting the baking
surface wet. Just slap on another sheet of parchment, and you're
ready to bake the next batch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Avoid mixing cookie dough in a food processor.  &LR; The speed of
these machines means that little air is incorporated into mixtures,
which drastically changes cookie dough texture _ and final results.
Electric mixers are generally fine, but don't overmix, especially
when creaming butter and sugar. If you cream as thoroughly as you
would for a cake, the cookies will flatten out when they bake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GRIFFIN FAMILY GERMAN BUTTER COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   These cookies and the macaroons are a natural pair _ both in
terms of taste and texture contrast and because this recipe calls
for 10 egg yolks and the macaroons 8 egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   10 yolks from large eggs
</P>
<P>
   21/4 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   71/2 cups sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   1 pound unsalted butter (no substitutes), softened
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup flour mixed with 2 tablespoons sugar for rolling out
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Food coloring (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Beat the yolks until light and lemon-colored; beat in the sugar
until very creamy, about 5 minutes with an electric mixer at medium
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Mound the flour on a pastry board or in a very large bowl. Cut
the butter into thin slices and work into the flour with a pastry
blender or your fingertips, until the mixture is the consistency of
coarse meal. Add the yolk mixture and fold in, using first a
spatula and then your fingers. Knead until a smooth dough is
formed. Shape into a smooth ball, flatten slightly, wrap in wax
paper and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Sprinkle a
board with a little of the flour/sugar mixture to prevent sticking.
Lightly coat a rolling pin with the same mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Using one quarter of the dough at a time, roll out to about
1/8-inch thickness and cut with cookie cutters to desired shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Reroll scraps with next dough quarter and proceed until all
dough is rolled out and cut.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cookies on ungreased baking sheets and bake for 8 to
10 minutes, until the edges just turn golden. Remove cookies to
racks to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the powdered sugar and lemon juice, adding enough
water to make a spreadable mixture. Divide between 2 or 3 small
bowls or cups and add different food colorings as desired. These
are delicate cookies, so pastel shades seem more suitable than
bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not wish to color the cookies, either brush unbaked
cookies with an egg wash made from 2 yolks mixed with about 1
teaspoon water, or sprinkle them with colored sugar crystals before
baking.
</P>
<P>
   Store cookies in airtight containers for a few days or freeze
for up to a month.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 8 to 12 dozen cookies, depending on size.

GERMAN HAZELNUT MACAROONS
</P>
<P>
   These cookies should not be hurried. Don't skip either the
resting time for the unbaked dough and cookies or the ripening. If
you start them by this weekend, they'll be perfect at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 cups hazelnuts or filberts
</P>
<P>
   8 whites from large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   21/4 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 cup powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Grate 4 cups of the nuts, preferably with a European nut grater.
If using a food processor, use on/off pulse, making sure you don't
over-process to the point of creating nut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric beater
until stiff, starting at low speed and switching to medium as soon
as whites start to mound. Gradually add the sugar and continue
beating until very smooth and glossy, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fold in the vanilla and grated nuts. Refrigerate for from 2 to 6
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the batter by heaping teaspoons onto ungreased cookie
sheets lined with parchment paper or foil, dull-side up, spacing
about 11/2 inches apart. Press a whole nut in the center of each
cookie. Let stand overnight in a cool room.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in a 300 degree oven until the cookies are gently browned
and can be easily lifted from the paper with a spatula, about 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the cookies to racks. Have ready the powdered sugar mixed
with enough water to make a smooth glaze. Brush this over cookies
while they are still warm. Cool completely, then store in an
airtight container, adding 1/2 apple to retain moisture. Age in a
cool place for 5 days to 1 week, checking to make sure the apple
doesn't rot.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 6 dozen cookies.

VIENNESE CRESCENTS
</P>
<P>
   These Austrian cookies have become part of the holiday
repertoire all over central Europe. Some recipes call for almonds.
This one uses walnuts or pecans or a mixture of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 pound powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 vanilla beans, broken into pieces
</P>
<P>
   The Dough
</P>
<P>
   1 cup walnuts or pecans, finely ground
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsalted butter (no substitutes), softened
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   At least 2 days before making the cookies, combine the powdered
sugar and vanilla beans in a tightly closed jar. Let stand at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all dough ingredients in a large bowl and mix into a
smooth dough. Shape into a ball, wrap in wax paper and refrigerate
at least 1 hour for easier handling. (If you refrigerate the dough
overnight, let it sit at room temperature 1/2 hour before shaping.)
</P>
<P>
   Break off pieces about 1 teaspoon in volume. Roll into balls,
then into ropes about 3 inches long, tapering ends. Place on
ungreased cookie sheets (covering them with parchment makes cleanup
a snap), bending them into a crescent shape.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in a 350 degree oven until cookies just turn golden, 10 to
15 minutes. As soon as the cookies are cool enough to handle, roll
them in a bowl of the vanilla sugar. Place on a rack to cool. When
completely cool, roll in sugar again, then store in an airtight
container.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in a cool place for 5 days to a week, or freeze up to 1
month.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4 to 5 dozen cookies.

</P>
<P>
   1 cup blanched almonds, finely ground
</P>
<P>
   1 cup walnuts, finely ground
</P>
<P>
   13/4 cups sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup flour mixed with 2 tablespoons sugar for rolling out
</P>
<P>
   Topping
</P>
<P>
   11/4 cups powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark rum or orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Food coloring and colored sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Cream the butter in a large bowl until light. Gradually add the
sugar, beating until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the lemon
zest, mace, allspice and salt along with the egg yolks. Beat until
blended.
</P>
<P>
   Using a rubber spatula, fold in the nuts and flour. Briefly
knead to form a smooth dough. Shape into a ball, flatten slightly,
wrap in wax paper and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The dough will still be sticky, so cover a board with wax paper
or baking parchment and sprinkle it and the rolling pin liberally
with the flour/sugar mixture.

thickness. Cut out with star or other cookie cutters.
</P>
<P>
   Reroll the trimmings with the second part of dough and proceed
to cut and roll until all dough is used up.
</P>
<P>
   Using a thin spatula, carefully move the cookies to ungreased
baking sheets covered with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in a 350 degree oven until the cookies turn light brown at
edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool a couple of minutes, then
carefully remove to racks.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the powdered sugar with the rum, adding enough water to make
the mixture a spreadable consistency. Add food coloring if desired.
Glaze cookies while they are still warm and sprinkle with colored
sugar if desired.
</P>
<P>
   When completely cool, store in airtight containers for at least
2 days and up to 10 days, or freeze for up to a month.

HISPANIC GROUPS URGE POLICE TO HIRE MORE LATINOS AS WAY TO END
`RACIAL PROFILING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police harassment of Hispanics nationwide will
continue largely unabated until law-enforcement agencies recruit,
hire and retain more Latino officers, Hispanic civil rights and
police organizations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A greater Hispanic presence on police forces will reverse the
rising tide of instances when officers single out young Latino men,
they said. The victims are targeted for traffic stops and verbal
and physical abuse based on the invidious stereotype that all
youthful Hispanics are criminals, said Raul Yzaguirre, president of
the National Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   This ``racial profiling'' of Latinos by police is symptomatic of
law-enforcement agencies that, while ostensibly serving Hispanic
communities, have few Latino officers, added Houston police Officer
Adrian Garcia, president of the National Latino Peace Officers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic groups' call for more Latino officers mirrors a
similar plea from the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, which has said young black men have also been
targeted by police based on the same nefarious stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of racial profiling has led Hispanic and
African-American rights groups to suggest jokingly that the police
have created a new traffic offense _ ``driving while brown'' or
``driving while black'' _ that allows officers to pull over
minority motorists summarily.
</P>
<P>
   Yzaguirre, while denouncing racial profiling, said officers who
harass minorities because of their race are an ``aberration'' and
threaten the reputations of the overwhelming majority of officers
who valiantly strive to protect all residents, regardless of their
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Garcia, who directs Houston Mayor Lee Brown's anti-gang office,
added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Many officers don't come from the background of the community
they're policing. This could create an issue of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To increase the number of Hispanic officers, Yzaguirre and
Garcia said their groups will encourage young Latinos to consider
law-enforcement careers. The Hispanic American Police Command
Officers Association will join the groups in the recruitment
effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia said the Latino groups ``have a lot of work to do''
to ensure the proportion of Hispanic officers mirrors the
percentage of Hispanics in the cities they serve. For example, the
Houston population is 26 percent Hispanic, but Latinos hold fewer
than 8 percent of the police force's supervisory positions, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Houston Police Department's 5,439 officers as of Dec. 1,
960, or 18 percent, were Hispanic, HPD reported.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the National Council of La Raza nor the police groups
had figures on the number of Hispanic officers nationwide. But the
council said other large-city police departments have staff
inequities similar to Houston's.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which is 33 percent Hispanic, has a police force in
which Hispanics comprise 22 percent of the officers and 14 percent
of the supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro-Dade Police Department serves Miami and neighboring
Florida cities, a community that is nearly 50 percent Latino. But
fewer than 14 percent of the department's supervisors are Hispanic,
the council reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are more and more (being) targeted by police abuse,''
Yzaguirre said. ``We need to have officers from our own
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmakers are considering legislation that would protect
from retaliation officers who blow the whistle on colleagues who
harass people solely because of their race. Congress is also
weighing a bill that would require the Justice Department to
collect data on instances of racial profiling nationwide.

 &HT;    PERCEIVED U.S. SNUB ASIDE, PANAMA COMMEMORATES TRANSFER OF CANAL
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Water cannons fired into the air, tugboats
blasted their whistles and a choir sang the ``Hallelujah Chorus''
Tuesday as Panama moved closer to taking full ownership of the
famous canal that bears its name.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter represented the United States at a
ceremony overlooking the 50-mile-long waterway, signing documents
with Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso as Spain's King Juan
Carlos and the presidents of a half-dozen Latin American countries
looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a historic occasion, perhaps the most
significant that has occurred in this hemisphere,'' Carter said.
the canal ``Was a source of great pride in my country from the time
I was a child until I became president.''
</P>
<P>
   The final, legal hand-over mandated by treaties negotiated by
Carter in 1977 won't come until noon on Dec. 31. Panamanian
officials pushed up the ceremony to avoid conflicts with millennium
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last we have reached victory, the canal is ours,'' said
Moscoso, noting the event was a profound moment in her young
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour ceremony marked an important milestone in the
96-year relationship between the United States and Panama _ and
reflected some of the tensions that have beset that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
declined to attend, leaving many Panamanians miffed at what they
see as a snub of their debut on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Clinton announced he wasn't coming, it was like, 'OK, he
has a domestic political problem,''' said Roberto Eisenmann,
founder of La Prensa, one of Panama's largest newspapers. ``But
when Albright announced she wasn't coming, it was a real slap in
the face. It showed a lack of interest in the whole region.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton said the U.S. remains committed to the
canal's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ceremony underscores our confidence in the government
of Panama and the Panamanian people's ability to manage this vital
artery of commerce,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. retains the right to intervene if there is a threat to
the canal's safety. But a dozen U.S. military bases within the
10-mile-wide canal zone have been closed and turned over to Panama,
leaving the country of 2.8 million responsible for day-to-day
security.
</P>
<P>
   American critics of the canal transfer fear that the Panamanians
will let the 86-year-old waterway fall victim to poor maintenance,
corrupt politics, terrorism or influence by foreign governments.
They are particularly upset by a contract giving management of two
ports at either end of the canal to a company they believe has ties
to the Chinese military _ a charge downplayed by current U.S.
military officials, and denied by the Hong Kong-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is action by the leadership of Panama and the
U.S. to restore a U.S. military presence here, there's a great
danger this magnificent canal could be threatened within a short
time,'' said Howard Phillips, head of the Conservative Caucus, who
lobbied against the hand-over in the 1970s. ``It will do us damn
little good to send in the Marines after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnover is a bookend to what many historians have called
``the American Century.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. construction of the canal between 1904 and 1914 marked
America's emergence as a world power, signaling the country's
engineering prowess and financial might while providing a crucial
economic and military link.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a powerful symbol of U.S. domination of the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Slicing through a 500-foot-tall mountain range, the canal also
sliced across a nation that was never comfortable with the
overwhelming presence of its more powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Panama was a part of Colombia until 1903, when a group of
residents declared independence _ under the watchful eye of U.S.
Marines who steamed into a Panamanian port as the revolt unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The new Panamanian government quickly signed a treaty allowing
the U.S. to finish building the canal _ and also to run it and the
canal zone, which effectively became a strip of U.S. soil within
the midst of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, thousands of Americans lived and worked in the
360,240-acre zone, enjoying subsidized housing and high pay in
exchange for hard work far from home. Panamanian workers were paid
less and subjected to U.S. laws within the zone.
</P>
<P>
   But they also enjoyed higher paying jobs than they would have
found in Panama's native industries.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting emotions many Panamanians feel about the canal,
the turn-over and the United States are still readily evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the Americans in all forms,'' said Fulgencio Bonilla,
53, a Panama City resident. ``We need their experience in running
the canal, and we need their military to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, worrisome clashes have flared along the border
between Panama and Colombia. Just last weekend, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, attacked a Colombian outpost on
the border, while other unidentified armed bandits _ possibly drug
traffickers _ have crossed into Panama and attacked rural villages.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's army was disbanded in 1989 after the United States
invaded to depose strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. He was
whisked to Miami, tried and imprisoned for aiding Colombian drug
traffickers. The country now relies on an 18,000-person police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show 60 to 70 percent of Panamanians wish the
United States would retain a military presence here.
</P>
<P>
   The canal is considered one of the engineering marvels of the
modern age. It carries roughly four percent of the world's
shipping, and earns nearly $600 million in tolls per year. About 12
percent of U.S. shipping passes through the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter acknowledged that the hand-over was
unpopular in the United States, but has said repeatedly that it was
``the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who headed a 29-member U.S. delegation that also
included Army Secretary Louis Caldera and Ambassador Simon Ferro,
criticized the doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country and in this one there were demagogues who
exaggerated problems and spoke about catastrophic events,'' he
said. ``There are still some in my country spreading false stories
about security of the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Carter told the crowd, ``We're celebrating a new
relationship between your country and mine. Today we come together
in a spirit of mutual respect acknowledging without question the
complete sovereignty of Panama. It's a very important moment for
all of Latin America.''

 &HT;    ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS TO OPEN WITH MIDDLE EAST PEACE AT STAKE
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Still hoping to broker lasting peace in the Middle
East before leaving office, President Clinton aims to jump-start
long-stalled Israeli-Syrian negotiations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will host Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa for morning talks at the White
House, followed by planned face-to-face talks after lunch between
the Israeli and the Syrian officials at the historic Blair House.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand will be Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
has worked for months trying to nurse the tenuous Mideast peace
process back to something resembling good health.
</P>
<P>
   That process _ key to U.S. political and strategic interests in
the oil-rich Middle East _ has been a central goal of U.S.
diplomacy for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching an Israel-Syria accord _ centered on Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights in return for security guarantees
from Syria _ is seen as one key to an overall peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital, because Syria has a large army, Syria controls
Lebanon and it has to do with Israel's entire northern border.,''
said Jon Alterman, Mideast analyst with the U.S. Institute for
Peace, a quasi-governmental think tank. ``It's a question of
whether Israel is surrounded with neighbors with which it is at
peace, or has enemies on its northern border.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high stakes, or perhaps because of them, the
Israel-Syria track has been stalled since talks collapsed nearly
four years ago. At issue are complicated territorial and security
concerns that have divided the two neighbors since Israel's
inception in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   After months of intensive U.S. diplomacy, Barak and Syrian
President Hafez Assad agreed last week to resume negotiations under
White House auspices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process,
one that can shape the face of the region for generations to
come,'' Clinton said in announcing the talks last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace has long been within our sight,'' he said. ``Today, it
is within our grasp, and we must seize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who is 69 and in failing health, is sending al-Sharaa to
represent Syria. Both he and Barak were scheduled to arrive in
Washington overnight.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement is expected this week. Instead, Sharaa and Barak
are slated to focus on process matters and a road map for another
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly no expectation that they can reach a broad,
wide-ranging agreement on issues that are quite difficult and
long-standing,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
``But I think what they will hope to do over the next two days is
work hard to find a process that allows them, over a period of
time, to reach a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the two officials will return to their
respective capitals after two days of talks here and schedule a
next-step summit in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict how long this will take,'' a senior
administration official told reporters at a White House news
conference. He spoke to more than 60 reporters on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we feel there's momentum and we are going to want
to be building on the momentum,'' the official said. ``But I think
the first two days will be much more geared towards organization
and the process than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the Israeli-Syrian dispute is the occupied Golan
Heights, a large and strategically valuable piece of high ground
where Israel's northern border abuts against southwestern Syria.
</P>
<P>
   After Syria joined Jordan and Egypt in attacking Israel in 1967,
Israel countered with a fierce return blow, seizing the Golan
territory _ a strategic prize for armies dating to antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the Golan has given Israeli troops a commanding
foothold in Syria. It has also provided a valuable listening post
for eavesdropping into Syrian military conversations and for
monitoring the activities of groups such as Hezbollah, regarded as
a terrorist outfit by Israel and its ally, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan also contains the Sea of Galilee _ the single largest
source of fresh water in the desert region.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Israel's continuing occupation of the Golan, though, has come at
a price.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for one thing, remains in a state of undeclared war
against Syria and its army of 400,000 forces.
</P>
<P>
   A deal on the Golan would come with security guarantees for
Israel _ including dramatic reductions in the number of Syrian
forces arrayed near the Israeli borders _ as well as valuable
trade, investment and diplomatic ties with a land bridge linking
Israel to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, Israelis will be able to drive to Europe,
they will be able to trade with Syrians and Syrians will be able to
trade with Israelis,'' if an accord is reached and relations are
normalized, said Alterman. ``Syria will open up to Israel and
Israel will open up to Syria. Exactly how that works is something
to be negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Syria have been at loggerheads over the issue since
1967. Following that year's Six-Day War, the United Nations called
for the so-called ``land for peace'' formula at the heart of this
week's talks. That appeal, enshrined in U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242, still lies near the epicenter of the complex quest
for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   A second component is Israeli-Lebanon relations. Israel
continues to occupy Lebanese territory it seized in 1982 as part of
an offensive against Palestine Liberation Organization operations
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which has based troops in Lebanon since 1976, is
effectively in the driver's seat on the Lebanon-Israeli
land-for-peace front. A deal between those two countries would
likely fall into place, Mideast experts agree, once Israel and
Syria reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   The third and most troublesome part of the equation is the
remaining gap between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have set a
mid-February deadline for reaching a framework for so-called final
status talks, aimed at addressing the most contentious outstanding
issues between them, including the future of Jerusalem and the
question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the two men have committed to winding up final
status talks by next October _ conveniently in time for Clinton to
claim a foreign policy victory on the eve of November's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for Americans, however, stretch far beyond politics
and presidential legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Israel remains the staunchest U.S. ally in the fractious Middle
East, supplier of a substantial amount of the crude oil that fuels
the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, nestled between Israel and another U.S. ally, NATO member
Turkey, has the potential to be a bridge or a chasm between
southeastern Europe and the volatile Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And Israeli security concerns still darkly complicate U.S.
relations with the Arab world, something American diplomacy has
sought for decades to move beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S.-brokered accord that would end half a century of enmity
and bloodshed in the fractious Middle East would bode well not just
for the region.
</P>
<P>
   If there are benefits to the United States, there will most
assuredly be costs as well. Israeli press reports have suggested in
recent days that Barak will ask Clinton for a commitment for what
could amount to more than $10 billion over time to help finance
</P>
<P>
   operations associated with Israel's withdrawal _ if one is
agreed upon _ from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart neither accepted nor rejected those figures on Tuesday,
but he made clear that the White House was prepared to entertain
some sort of assistance request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always stood ready to help our friend, Israel,'' said
Lockhart. ``As we move forward, those questions, I'm certain, will
be discussed.''

 &HT;    ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS TO OPEN WITH MIDDLE EAST PEACE AT STAKE
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Still hoping to broker lasting peace in the Middle
East before leaving office, President Clinton aims to jump-start
long-stalled Israeli-Syrian negotiations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will host Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa for morning talks at the White
House, followed by planned face-to-face talks after lunch between
the Israeli and the Syrian officials at the historic Blair House.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand will be Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
has worked for months trying to nurse the tenuous Mideast peace
process back to something resembling good health.
</P>
<P>
   That process _ key to U.S. political and strategic interests in
the oil-rich Middle East _ has been a central goal of U.S.
diplomacy for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching an Israel-Syria accord _ centered on Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights in return for security guarantees
from Syria _ is seen as one key to an overall peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital, because Syria has a large army, Syria controls
Lebanon and it has to do with Israel's entire northern border.,''
said Jon Alterman, Mideast analyst with the U.S. Institute for
Peace, a quasi-governmental think tank. ``It's a question of
whether Israel is surrounded with neighbors with which it is at
peace, or has enemies on its northern border.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high stakes, or perhaps because of them, the
Israel-Syria track has been stalled since talks collapsed nearly
four years ago. At issue are complicated territorial and security
concerns that have divided the two neighbors since Israel's
inception in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   After months of intensive U.S. diplomacy, Barak and Syrian
President Hafez Assad agreed last week to resume negotiations under
White House auspices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process,
one that can shape the face of the region for generations to
come,'' Clinton said in announcing the talks last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace has long been within our sight,'' he said. ``Today, it
is within our grasp, and we must seize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who is 69 and in failing health, is sending al-Sharaa to
represent Syria. Both he and Barak were scheduled to arrive in
Washington overnight.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement is expected this week. Instead, Sharaa and Barak
are slated to focus on process matters and a road map for another
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly no expectation that they can reach a broad,
wide-ranging agreement on issues that are quite difficult and
long-standing,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
``But I think what they will hope to do over the next two days is
work hard to find a process that allows them, over a period of
time, to reach a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the two officials will return to their
respective capitals after two days of talks here and schedule a
next-step summit in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict how long this will take,'' a senior
administration official told reporters at a White House news
conference. He spoke to more than 60 reporters on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we feel there's momentum and we are going to want
to be building on the momentum,'' the official said. ``But I think
the first two days will be much more geared towards organization
and the process than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the Israeli-Syrian dispute is the occupied Golan
Heights, a large and strategically valuable piece of high ground
where Israel's northern border abuts against southwestern Syria.
</P>
<P>
   After Syria joined Jordan and Egypt in attacking Israel in 1967,
Israel countered with a fierce return blow, seizing the Golan
territory _ a strategic prize for armies dating to antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the Golan has given Israeli troops a commanding
foothold in Syria. It has also provided a valuable listening post
for eavesdropping into Syrian military conversations and for
monitoring the activities of groups such as Hezbollah, regarded as
a terrorist outfit by Israel and its ally, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan also contains the Sea of Galilee _ the single largest
source of fresh water in the desert region.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Israel's continuing occupation of the Golan, though, has come at
a price.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for one thing, remains in a state of undeclared war
against Syria and its army of 400,000 forces.
</P>
<P>
   A deal on the Golan would come with security guarantees for
Israel _ including dramatic reductions in the number of Syrian
forces arrayed near the Israeli borders _ as well as valuable
trade, investment and diplomatic ties with a land bridge linking
Israel to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, Israelis will be able to drive to Europe,
they will be able to trade with Syrians and Syrians will be able to
trade with Israelis,'' if an accord is reached and relations are
normalized, said Alterman. ``Syria will open up to Israel and
Israel will open up to Syria. Exactly how that works is something
to be negotiated.''

 &HT;    PERCEIVED U.S. SNUB ASIDE, PANAMA COMMEMORATES TRANSFER OF CANAL
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Water cannons fired into the air, tugboats
blasted their whistles and a choir sang the ``Hallelujah Chorus''
Tuesday as Panama moved closer to taking full ownership of the
famous canal that bears its name.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter represented the United States at a
ceremony overlooking the 50-mile-long waterway, signing documents
with Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso as Spain's King Juan
Carlos and the presidents of a half-dozen Latin American countries
looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a historic occasion, perhaps the most
significant that has occurred in this hemisphere,'' Carter said.
the canal ``Was a source of great pride in my country from the time
I was a child until I became president.''
</P>
<P>
   The final, legal hand-over mandated by treaties negotiated by
Carter in 1977 won't come until noon on Dec. 31. Panamanian
officials pushed up the ceremony to avoid conflicts with millennium
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last we have reached victory, the canal is ours,'' said
Moscoso, noting the event was a profound moment in her young
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour ceremony marked an important milestone in the
96-year relationship between the United States and Panama _ and
reflected some of the tensions that have beset that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
declined to attend, leaving many Panamanians miffed at what they
see as a snub of their debut on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Clinton announced he wasn't coming, it was like, 'OK, he
has a domestic political problem,''' said Roberto Eisenmann,
founder of La Prensa, one of Panama's largest newspapers. ``But
when Albright announced she wasn't coming, it was a real slap in
the face. It showed a lack of interest in the whole region.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton said the U.S. remains committed to the
canal's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ceremony underscores our confidence in the government
of Panama and the Panamanian people's ability to manage this vital
artery of commerce,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. retains the right to intervene if there is a threat to
the canal's safety. But a dozen U.S. military bases within the
10-mile-wide canal zone have been closed and turned over to Panama,
leaving the country of 2.8 million responsible for day-to-day
security.
</P>
<P>
   American critics of the canal transfer fear that the Panamanians
will let the 86-year-old waterway fall victim to poor maintenance,
corrupt politics, terrorism or influence by foreign governments.
They are particularly upset by a contract giving management of two
ports at either end of the canal to a company they believe has ties
to the Chinese military _ a charge downplayed by current U.S.
military officials, and denied by the Hong Kong-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is action by the leadership of Panama and the
U.S. to restore a U.S. military presence here, there's a great
danger this magnificent canal could be threatened within a short
time,'' said Howard Phillips, head of the Conservative Caucus, who
lobbied against the hand-over in the 1970s. ``It will do us damn
little good to send in the Marines after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnover is a bookend to what many historians have called
``the American Century.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. construction of the canal between 1904 and 1914 marked
America's emergence as a world power, signaling the country's
engineering prowess and financial might while providing a crucial
economic and military link.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a powerful symbol of U.S. domination of the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Slicing through a 500-foot-tall mountain range, the canal also
sliced across a nation that was never comfortable with the
overwhelming presence of its more powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Panama was a part of Colombia until 1903, when a group of
residents declared independence _ under the watchful eye of U.S.
Marines who steamed into a Panamanian port as the revolt unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The new Panamanian government quickly signed a treaty allowing
the U.S. to finish building the canal _ and also to run it and the
canal zone, which effectively became a strip of U.S. soil within
the midst of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, thousands of Americans lived and worked in the
360,240-acre zone, enjoying subsidized housing and high pay in
exchange for hard work far from home. Panamanian workers were paid
less and subjected to U.S. laws within the zone.
</P>
<P>
   But they also enjoyed higher paying jobs than they would have
found in Panama's native industries.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting emotions many Panamanians feel about the canal,
the turn-over and the United States are still readily evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the Americans in all forms,'' said Fulgencio Bonilla,
53, a Panama City resident. ``We need their experience in running
the canal, and we need their military to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, worrisome clashes have flared along the border
between Panama and Colombia. Just last weekend, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, attacked a Colombian outpost on
the border, while other unidentified armed bandits _ possibly drug
traffickers _ have crossed into Panama and attacked rural villages.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's army was disbanded in 1989 after the United States
invaded to depose strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. He was
whisked to Miami, tried and imprisoned for aiding Colombian drug
traffickers. The country now relies on an 18,000-person police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show 60 to 70 percent of Panamanians wish the
United States would retain a military presence here.
</P>
<P>
   The canal is considered one of the engineering marvels of the
modern age. It carries roughly four percent of the world's
shipping, and earns nearly $600 million in tolls per year. About 12
percent of U.S. shipping passes through the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter acknowledged that the hand-over was
unpopular in the United States, but has said repeatedly that it was
``the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who headed a 29-member U.S. delegation that also
included Army Secretary Louis Caldera and Ambassador Simon Ferro,
criticized the doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country and in this one there were demagogues who
exaggerated problems and spoke about catastrophic events,'' he
said. ``There are still some in my country spreading false stories
about security of the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Carter told the crowd, ``We're celebrating a new
relationship between your country and mine. Today we come together
in a spirit of mutual respect acknowledging without question the
complete sovereignty of Panama. It's a very important moment for
all of Latin America.''

BUSH EXPECTS TIGHT RACE FOR GOP NOMINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ On the heels of an energetic debate exchange
with chief rival John McCain, presidential hopeful George W. Bush
said Tuesday that he expects the race for the Republican nomination
to heat up but hopes it will not turn ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also reaffirmed his support for the ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy of allowing homosexuals to serve in the
military, despite complaints from the White House and elsewhere
that it isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Bush discussed those issues and received the endorsement of
former presidential contender Lamar Alexander in a news conference
the morning after turning in his liveliest debate performance so
far in his White House race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose earlier debate appearances had been criticized as
lackluster, said he liked the ``free-flowing'' format of Monday
night's televised forum in Iowa, which featured sharp exchanges
between him and McCain over ethanol tax breaks, tax cuts and
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed myself last night,'' Bush said. He said he liked the
opportunity to directly question his opponents and looked forward
to future ``interchanges'' in the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the early Republican front-runner, is believed still to
have a large lead in Iowa, the state that holds the first
nominating contest Jan. 24, and one that McCain has virtually
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But recent polls indicate that McCain, a senator from Arizona
and a former POW in Vietnam, has surpassed Bush in New Hampshire,
site of the nation's first primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he expected a ``tight'' race for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a good fight,'' he said. ``I like competition. That's
what the primaries are about. The question is will the candidates
pledge not to let them deteriorate into mudfests, and I'm going to
keep it positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he hoped the other candidates would take time during
the upcoming holidays to ``reflect'' about positive campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK for someone to be feisty, but there is a difference
between feistiness and ugliness,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he still supported the ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy for gays and lesbians in the armed services, even though the
Defense Department has ordered a review of complaints that gay
service members are being harassed.
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore, a candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, has called for the policy to be abolished
and homosexuals allowed to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support don't ask, don't tell, and I think it ought to be
made to work,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the next commander-in-chief has got to send one
clear signal. We're not going to tolerate abuse. We expect people
to be treated with respect throughout the military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a former Tennessee governor who ended a six-year
quest for the presidency in August after finishing sixth in an Iowa
straw poll, said he was now backing Bush because his performance
has been ``solid'' and ``presidential'' and he had experience as an
elected, executive officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   When he dropped out of the race, Alexander had suggested that
Republicans were in too big a hurry to nominate Bush and said they
may discover later that he was too inexperienced to be president.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, with Bush standing nearby, Alexander said Bush had
``earned my respect the old-fashioned way _ he defeated me.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters persisted in asking Alexander questions about his
apparent change of heart about Bush's qualifications, Bush stepped
in to end the news conference. ``Quit harassing the man,'' said
Bush, grinning.

45,000 CIVILIANS TRAPPED AS RUSSIANS BLAST GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Thousands of civilians were trapped in
Chechnya's capital, Grozny, Tuesday after Russian forces launched a
fierce artillery assault on separatist militants holed up in the
besieged city.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of heavy fighting between Russian troops and Chechen
militia fighters cast doubt on the ability of up to 45,000
civilians in Grozny to reach safe corridors that Russia promised to
set up to allow them to escape the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Facing international pressure to give people more time to get
out, Russia last week delayed an ultimatum that its troops would
kill anyone who remained in the city after Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred civilians left the city following the
ultimatum. Refugees who did said that many of those left inside are
old or have small children and are afraid or unable to leave their
basement shelters and make the long trek to the Russian checkpoints
outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, reports from Grozny described constant artillery fire.
An Internet Web site run by a rebel leader said the assault on the
city by Russian forces ``is under way practically at full scale.''
A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman denied that report, but the
Interfax news agency quoted military sources as confirming that
clashes had taken place near the airport, on the eastern side of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders deny they will launch a head-on assault of
Grozny, a tactic that resulted in heavy Russian losses in Moscow's
failed 1994-1996 campaign against the rebels. Instead, the
commanders said, they will use special forces commandos, and
pro-Moscow Chechen irregulars to take the city bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   The military Tuesday also acknowledged the loss of a Su-25 jet
and two helicopters in fighting in southern Chechnya. The rebel-run
Web site (www.Kavkaz.org) said Chechen fighters had shot down two
jets and three helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, about 100 refugees, many of them elderly women, left
Grozny on foot and made their way to a checkpoint established by
the Russians in Alkhan-Yurt, 2 miles southwest of the capital.
There, they were picked up by a bus and five trucks sent by Russian
Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Shoigu said at a briefing that only about 2,200
civilians had been able to leave through the corridors. He said
8,000 to 30,000 more remained in the city. Moscow's senior envoy to
Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said on Saturday that 45,000 civilians
were still in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu, repeating Russian charges that the separatists are
preventing civilians from escaping, called on Chechen leader Aslan
Maskhadov to help get them out.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based organization Human Rights Watch said Tuesday
that Russian troops along the safe corridor were exacting bribes
from people wishing to leave Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees are like Taisa Shamkanova, who said she had been
living in a basement and was unaware of the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have left earlier, but I really didn't believe it
would be so bad,'' Shamkanova told the Associated Press, referring
to the daily attacks on Grozny. ``And then I was just afraid to
leave the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Elections for Russia's parliament will be held Sunday, and
opinion polls show most people approve of the campaign against the
Chechen rebels, who twice last summer invaded the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan and whom Moscow accuses of bomb blasts
in Russian cities that killed almost 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders have criticized Moscow's tactic of pounding
rebel positions from afar with such weapons as antipersonnel
rockets. Such strikes, which cannot be aimed accurately, have sent
more than 200,000 Chechen civilians fleeing, destroyed entire
towns, and killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, all while largely
sparing the rebel fighters, who are better able to protect
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Knut Vollebaek, the Norwegian foreign minister who is
chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, visited Dagestan and called for an immediate cease-fire.
Russian officials rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who attended the launching of a
new strategic missile in northern Russia Tuesday, used the occasion
to warn the West against criticizing its offensive in breakaway
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's popularity ratings in polls have soared during the
fighting in Chechnya, and few Russian leaders have dared speak out
against the campaign. Tuesday, a rare voice of concern was raised
by Adolf Shayevich, Russia's chief rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in Grozny there are 50,000 people. Will the remaining
50,000 be exterminated to get rid of those three or four thousand
fighters? . . . The state should not act like this,'' the rabbi
said in Moscow. ``They are Russian citizens as well. . . . Why is
society so calm about what is going on there?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian General Gennady Troshev said his troops had
cleared Chechen rebels from Shali, the last major lowland town
apart from Grozny they had yet to seize. Russian forces have also
begun heavily bombing and shelling the foothills and mountains in
the south.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels there are well dug-in, according to the crew of a
Mi-8 helicopter that was shot down on Monday while on a mission to
find the pilot of the downed Su-25 jet.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels ``fought well,'' said the helicopter's commander, who
asked that only his first name, Slava, be used. ``They had an
entire firebase set up. They hit us with a heavy machine gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Slava managed to crash-land the aircraft safely enough for his
crew and nine Russian commandos to avoid serious injury. But as
soon as they dragged themselves from the wreckage, they came under
heavy fire from rebels.
</P>
<P>
   They held on for 30 minutes until they were rescued by two more
helicopters that chased away the rebels with rocket fire. Not far
away, two other helicopters were shot down, killing six Russians.

MOTOROLA OPENS DESIGN LAB NEAR MIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Looking to tap into one of the nation's
hottest technology-development areas, Motorola Inc. says it wlil
open a $5 million consumer product design laboratory near the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be closer to where there's a lot of action,''
Motorola president Robert L. Growney said in an interview Tuesday.
``There's just lots and lots of ideas around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge is among eight sites chosen by the Schaumberg,
Ill.-based company for consumer product design labs. The others
include San Francisco, Milan, Seoul and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's stock and corporate reputation took a beating during
the mid-1990s amid stalled earnings and a disastrous investment in
the now-bankrupt $3 billion Iridium satellite-phone project.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last 16 months, a turnaround effort has boosted
Motorola stock from less than $43 a share to as high as $129, and
company officials hope to turbo-charge efforts to develop new
wireless communications devices by tapping in to the MIT and
Kendall Square tech communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a company with 70 years of history, and we've done some
fantastic things, and we've done some dumb things,'' Growney said.
``We've just exited one of our dumb periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also will use its new office at Two Cambridge Place,
opening in February, as a field office for its venture-capital arm,
which has taken stakes quietly in more than 20 local startup
companies involved in communications, semiconductor research and
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Growney would not identify local recipients of Motorola
investment, saying, ``My competitors would love to know the precise
direction we're headed in.'' But he said he sees ``significant
opportunity'' for more investments locally, aimed at supporting
Motorola product development and research.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Motorola designers have been demonstrating a
prototype Dick Tracy-style wristwatch phone and super-cheap phone
handsets that are activated by a credit card with a number keypad
built in. Wireless companies could sell calling time through the
cards and give away the matchbook-size handset.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola expects to employ 20 designers at the 8,000-square-foot
lab on the outskirts of Kendall Square, including people who now
work at its Advanced User Interactions Lab in Illinois. Motorola
has 1,000 Massachusetts employees now, chiefly at a Mansfield
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking to capture the Cambridge buzz,'' said Dan
Williams, director of consumer design and innovation. One focus of
the new lab will be improving ``wearable,'' voice-controlled
communications devices that could be as small as a collar stay in a
shirt, a pendant or a cufflink.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones and related gear accounted for about 42 percent of
Motorola's 1998 net sales of $29.4 billion. Radio devices were 18
percent, and pagers and other information and media products
accounted for 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the Schaumburg, Ill., company has
sponsored a group of seven to nine ``Motorola Fellows'' associated
with MIT's Media Lab who have been developing new concepts for
wireless communication.
</P>
<P>
   Current fellow Rob Poor, an MIT PhD candidate, has been working
on a concept he calls the ``embedded network'' _ equipping a vast
array of objects, and even people's bodies, with devices that
communicate by low-power radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday there will be network connections in almost everything
in our world, not unlike the way there is printing on almost
everything in our world,'' said Poor, a Silicon Valley expatriate
whose past jobs include working for the Grateful Dead rock band and
George Lucas's film studio.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, Poor thinks wireless phone systems could be
developed that would use each phone to relay calls throughout the
system, eliminating the need for base stations with tall antennas
and sharply reducing power needs for each phone.
</P>
<P>
   Once radio transmitters become cheap enough, Poor also has ideas
for equipping individual Federal Express packages and FedEx drop
boxes with chips to communicate the location of packages. Lost
packages literally could tell carriers where they were to be
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Growney said the company also sees huge new markets in adapting
wireless devices for use in people's cars. ``The auto is going to
become like the office and the home. It is going to have an
enormous information content,'' Growney said. People must be able
to get at by voice-recognition systems or other options that
require minimal distraction from driving, he said.

JAPAN RESTORES FOOD AID TO NORTH KOREA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a move that could help North Korea feed its hungry
people this winter, the Japanese government said Tuesday that it
would lift restrictions on food aid to the Communist country and
begin formal negotiations to establish diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the lifting of sanctions, Japan's chief cabinet
secretary, Mikio Aoki, said Japan and North Korea planned to hold
preliminary talks by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring food aid to North Korea, which is in desperate need
after years of shortages and famine, is seen as a necessary first
step toward diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo suspended all food aid after North Korea fired a
multistage rocket that flew over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean
in August 1998, setting off fears across East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the dire hunger situation in North Korea, it would be
difficult for Japan to come to the diplomatic table without at
least offering some help,'' said Hajime Izumi, a professor of
political science at Shizuoka University. ``Lifting sanctions is
important because it clears the way. The question now is what will
North Korea do with this new opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoki said the government would not immediately restore food aid
to North Korea but instead would ``make a comprehensive decision
after closely addressing the progress of the preliminary talks and
North Korea's responses.'' There was no immediate comment from
North Korea Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There is still strong opposition in Japan to providing food to
North Korea. Many Japanese are still upset that North Korea fired a
missile over their territory and that the country has not accounted
for the whereabouts of 10 Japanese citizens that intelligence
officials here maintain were abducted by North Korean agents in the
1970s and  &UR; ' &LR; 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has proposed that during the talks, the Red Cross
organizations of both countries hold discussions on issues
including food aid, visits to Japan by Japanese spouses of North
Koreans and the disappearance of the Japanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement underscores a remarkable improvement in
historically bitter relations between North Korea and Japan, which
only a few months ago appeared to be archenemies.
</P>
<P>
   In August, much of Japan was jittery after North Korea said it
planned to test a new long-range ballistic missile. In retaliation,
Japan threatened to bar Koreans living in Japan from sending cash
and goods to North Korea. The remittances, estimated to be as much
as $1 billion a year, are a major source of capital for North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But the missile crisis came to an abrupt end when North Korea
agreed to suspend future missile launchings in exchange for
Washington's relaxing its own sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea then began a major effort to improve its foreign
relations to gain economic assistance, holding talks with the
United States, Britain, Japan, other countries and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, political leaders from Japan and North Korea,
meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, reached an
agreement to ask their governments to return to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still considerable hurdles to overcome before
diplomatic ties are restored, and almost no one expects the
negotiations to be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``With today's announcement we have basically returned to where
we were in August 1998 before the missile was fired,'' said Sadaaki
Numata, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry. ``This is the
start of what may be a long process.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development that also underscores the improving
state of relations with North Korea, the Japanese government said
Tuesday that an international consortium planned to sign an
agreement on Wednesday in Seoul, South Korea, to begin construction
of two nuclear power plants in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, which is led by the United States, was formed in
1994 to build two Western reactors and provide shipments of fuel
oil in exchange for North Korea's promise not to pursue its own
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, Japan and the European Union are shouldering the
bulk of the $4.6 billion project, and the United States is
supplying the fuel oil. The project ran into trouble last year
after North Korea test-fired its first missile and the Japanese
government immediately withdrew its $1 billion contribution.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan restored the financing several months later at the
urging of the United States and South Korea.

GORE EMPHASIZES CLOSENESS TO LABOR IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ Surrounded by dozens of working women at an
AFL-CIO facility here, Vice President Al Gore had an opportunity
again last Friday to demonstrate his affinity with organized labor,
a connection that Bill Bradley is finding difficult to break in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting conversations while walking about the floor, Gore
empathized with the women's stories of hardship and unfulfilled
aspirations in the job market. At the same time, he expressed
support for child care programs, Medicare coverage for prescription
drugs, equitable pay for women, and other working-class issues.
Wearing a mustard-colored, long-sleeve knit shirt and slacks, the
vice president almost looked as though he had come off the loading
dock himself.
</P>
<P>
   The event in Waterloo, a blue-collar, union town in eastern
Iowa, dramatized Gore's alliance with the AFL-CIO. After winning
the national organization's endorsement in October, Gore has been
aided significantly on the local level in Iowa by the support of
the 150,000-member state group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Democratic contest, labor is extraordinarily important in
Iowa,'' said Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat. ``They have the
mechanism, the organization and the experience to get people out,
and they have people in every part of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor's embrace of Gore has somewhat frustrated Bradley's
efforts to cut into Gore's lead here. The former New Jersey
senator, Gore's only rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Bradley established a beachhead in Iowa over the summer
during a period when ``Gore ignored us,'' said Dan Lucas, director
of Bradley's campaign here. ``It enabled us to pick up ground and
build a precinct organization across most of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas acknowledged that Gore's recent attack _ abetted by
organized labor _ on Bradley's proposal for a national health
insurance program had ``raised doubts'' about Bradley among Iowa
voters. Gore has suggested that the Bradley initiative is too
costly and would lead to higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aide said their campaign had been victimized by a
leaflet filled with erroneous charges that was distributed by the
United Auto Workers here. The one-page document compares Gore and
Bradley on several issues and charges Bradley, among other things,
with voting ``against already struggling seniors by trying to raise
the retirement age of both Medicare and Social Security to 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas felt compelled to send a memo to Democratic officials
around the state on the subject: Titled ``Setting the record
straight,'' the Lucas memo said the UAW broadside ``distorted Sen.
Bradley's positions on public education, Social Security, medicine,
agriculture and his work to oppose President Reagan's efforts to
cut taxes for the rich in the early 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   The intervention by the UAW in Iowa was not authorized by the
international auto workers headquarters, which opposed AFL-CIO's
endorsement of Gore, and labor sources here say that Dave Neill,
the UAW political director in Iowa, was reprimanded by union
officials in Detroit for the move.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the UAW boycotted a Democratic dinner in Des
Moines where Gore was the guest speaker because of the vice
president's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
which the UAW opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Neill could not be reached for comment, but Chuck Gifford, a
veteran UAW political leader in Iowa, said the pro-Gore leaflet
accurately reflected the union's views in Iowa. ``It caused some
flap, but Gore is clearly more satisfactory to us than Bradley,''
he said. ``If Richard Gephardt,'' the House Democratic leader who
led the fight against NAFTA, ``could endorse Gore, we felt like we
could, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gore holding the support of organized labor and the
endorsement of most of the state's top Democrats, including Sen.
Tom Harkin, Bradley has been forced to look for different sources
of help.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls in the state give Gore a comfortable double-digit
lead. But Lucas contends that undecided Democrats constitute ``this
huge egg'' that their telephone canvasses show growing bigger.
``Our challenge is to find and motivate them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said Bradley was ``doing very well'' in small communities
and among middle-to-upper income groups, an observation ratified by
a Des Moines Register poll which found Bradley leading Gore in
Democratic households with incomes topping $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, who is remaining neutral, said in an interview that
Bradley should ``focus on the non-traditional _ young people, the
college campus, the dissatisfied family that's not necessarily
Democratic but has concerns about the conservative nature of the
Republican Party and is looking for a candidate.''

MOST SCHOOLS TEACHING SAFE SEX BUT ABSTINENCE-ONLY PROGRAMS
GAINING, REPORTS SHOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most public schools teach students about
contraceptives and safe sex, despite federal and state government
financial incentives to get schools to adopt abstinence-only
messages, say two studies released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the federal government is currently investing
a lot of money impounding the abstinence-only message,'' said Cory
Richards, who co-wrote one study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute,
an affiliate of the pro-choice Planned Parenthood. ``At the end of
the day, there was no change in the abstinence-only movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports, the other by the Kaiser Family Foundation, provided
the first extensive glimpse at the status of sex education in the
nation's schools. The studies were released as conservative groups
continue to push, with some success, for less birth control and
contraception instruction in classrooms _ in recent years, more
federal and state funds have become available for schools to
promote abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser Family Foundation study found that 34 percent of all
schools now teach an abstinence-only message. But the study showed
58 percent of high schools and middle schools endorse abstinence
but also discuss contraception and safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, proponents of abstinence-only programs believe the
findings indicate a rise in the number of public schools that
promote chastity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's encouraging news to have 34 percent of the
schools promoting an abstinence-only message, especially
considering this movement is a recent development,'' said Teresa
Wagner, a legal and policy analyst for the Family Research Council,
a conservative Washington-based group. ``If you ask average
American parents what they want their students to learn, it's not
going to be contraception usage. This survey shows there is support
out there for a strong abstinence message.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas took in about $6 million this year from the federal
government for abstinence-only programs, and the state, under Gov.
George Bush, added about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said as he campaigns for the GOP presidential
nomination that he wants to increase the current amount of federal
dollars available to states for abstinence-only programs from $50
million to $135 million. Most of this money came from a provision
within 1996 welfare reform legislation, which allocated $250
million to states for five years.
</P>

   Influence from teachers and principals largely dictates what
kind of policy schools will choose, but pressure from states and
the federal government to adopt abstinence-only curricula has
increased in recent years, researchers acknowledge.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas state law requires that schools use abstinence-based
curriculum but does not restrict schools from talking about other
issues. Most larger school districts in Texas take part in some
type of federal or state-funded program.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Independent School District, for example, gets about
$173,000 from the federal government to encourage teen parents to
put off future pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   HISD officials were unwilling to provide information on their
sex education policy.
</P>
<P>
   An official at Planned Parenthood described HISD's policy as
inconsistent, saying that it was on a school-by-school basis. ``You
have some sexuality messages that students may or may not get,''
said Meryl Cohen, vice president of education and counseling for
Houston's Planned Parenthood. ``We may have some lip service with
comprehensive sex education, but it's really the teachers and
principals who decide,'' what to teach in the classroom, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts, such as the Corpus Christi Independent School
District, teach a strong abstinence message in middle school, while
discussing contraception and birth control in high school. CCIS
this year used almost $200,000 in federal funds to pay for a
$342,812 middle school sex education class, which teaches young
people to ``say `no' and make healthy choices,'' according to a
summary of the program filed with the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   While Corpus Christi receives substantial federal funds for
abstinence-only classes, Lopez said he didn't think such a strict
philosophy will help curb the teen-age pregnancy rate in Texas.
Despite a 12.3 percent drop in the rate of pregnancies among 15- to
19-year-olds from 1992 to 1997, Texas has the fifth-highest rate of
all states, up from sixth in 1992, according to statistics from the
Alan Guttmacher Institute.
</P>
<P>
   There were 113 pregnancies for every 1,000 teen women in 1996,
down from 123 pregnancies in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with the realities that children aren't
receiving sex education at home,'' Lopez said. ``You have people
that say teaching certain things opens the door to promiscuity. But
it's not that simple .... In the end, we want more information, not
less.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion many medical professionals have made,
adding that there is little evidence to demonstrate that such
abstinence-only curriculum works.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association recently endorsed a report that
says there is evidence that free distribution of condoms, coupled
with discussions on safer sex, does not lead to earlier
experimentation with sexual intercourse. The AMA report concludes
that some abstinence only programs ``substitute opinion for fact,
rely on fear and scare tactics ... and ignore the fact that many
adolescents are sexually active and do not live in two-parent
families.'' The report was approved at the AMA's interim meeting
last week in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of bringing contraceptives into the classroom say
it is a moral issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to talk about contraception, mention how it
so often fails at what it is supposed to do,'' said Wagner of the
Family Research Council.

<P>
   &LR;  The researchers presented their results earlier this month at
a meeting on the importance of perishables in prehistory that was
held at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ``One of the most
common reactions we heard was, `How could we have missed that stuff
all these years?''' Dr. Adovasio said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret W. Conkey, a professor of anthropology at the
University of California at Berkeley, and co-editor, with Joan
Gero, of ``Engendering Archaeology'' (Blackwell Publishers, 1991)
said, ``They're helping us to look at old materials in new ways, to
which I say bravo!''
</P>
<P>
   Not all scholars had been blinded by the Venutian morphology.
Dr. Elizabeth Wayland Barber, a professor of archaeology and
linguistics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, included in her
1991 volume ``Prehistoric Textiles,'' a chapter arguing that some
of the Venus figurines were wearing string skirts. The recent work
from Dr. Soffer and her colleagues extends and amplifies on the Dr.
Barber's original observations.
</P>
<P>
   The new work also underscores the often neglected importance of
what Dr. Barber has termed the ``string revolution.''
Archaeologists have long emphasized the invention of stone and
metal tools in furthering the evolution of human culture. Even the
names given to various periods in human history and prehistory are
based on heavyweight tools: the word ``Paleolithic'' _ the period
extending from about 750,000 years ago to 15,000 years ago _
essentially means ``Old Stone Age.'' Duly thudding and clanking
after the Paleolithic period were the Mesolithic and Neolithic, or
Middle and New Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the
Industrial Age.
</P>
<P>
   But at least as central to the course of human affairs as the
invention of stone tools was the realization that plant products
could be exploited for purposes other than eating. The fact that
some of the Venus figurines are shown wearing string skirts, said
Dr. Barber, ``means that the people who made them must also have
known how to make twisted string.''
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of string and the power to weave, people
could construct elaborate yet lightweight containers in which to
carry, store and cook food. They could fashion baby slings to
secure an infant snugly against its mother's body, thereby freeing
up the woman to work and wander. They could braid nets, the better
to catch prey animals without the risk of hand-to-tooth combat.
They could lash together wooden logs or planks to build a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The string revolution was a profound event in human history,''
Adovasio said. ``When people started to fool around with plants and
plant byproducts, that opened vast new avenues of human progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new report, the researchers argue that women are likely
to have been the primary weavers and textile experts of prehistory,
and may have even initiated the string revolution in the first
place _ although men undoubtedly did their share of weaving when it
came to making hunting and fishing nets, for example. They base
that conclusion on modern crosscultural studies, which have found
that women constitute the great bulk of the world's weavers,
basketry makers and all-round mistresses of plant goods.
</P>
<P>
   While vast changes in manufacturing took the luster off the
textile business long ago, with the result that such ``women's
work'' is now accorded low status and sweatshop wages, the
researchers argue that weaving and other forms of fiber craft once
commanded great prestige. By their estimate, the detailing of the
stitches shown on some of the Venus figurines was intended to
flaunt the value and beauty of the original spinsters' skills. Why
else would anybody have bothered etching the stitchery in a
permanent medium, if not to boast, whoa! Check out these wefts!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made immortal in stone,'' Dr. Soffer said. ``You don't
carve something like this unless it's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The detailing of the Venutian garb also raises the intriguing
possibility that the famed little sculptures, which rank right up
there with the Lascaux cave paintings in the pantheon of Western
art, were hewn by women _ moonlighting seamstresses, to be precise.
``It's always assumed that the carvers were men, a bunch of guys
sitting around making their zaftig Barbie dolls,'' Dr. Soffer said.
``But maybe that wasn't the case, or not always the case. With some
of these figurines, the person carving them clearly knew weaving.
So either that person was a weaver herself, or he was living with
her. He's got an adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Durable though the Venus figurines are, Adovasio and his
co-workers are far more interested in what their carved detailing
says about the role of perishables in prehistory. ``The vast bulk
of what humans made was made in media that hasn't survived,''
Adovasio said. Experts estimate the ratio of perishable objects to
durable objects generated in the average culture is about 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reconstructing the past based on 5 percent of what was
used,'' Dr. Soffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the items that have endured over the millennia
are things like arrowheads and spear points, archaeologists
studying the Paleolithic era have generally focused on the ways and
means of that noble savage, a k a Man the Hunter, to the exclusion
of other members of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, in Paleolithic studies we hear about Man the
Hunter doing such boldy wonderful things as thrusting spears into
woolly mammoths, or battling it out with other men,'' Adovasio
said. ``We've emphasized the activities of a small segment of the
population _ healthy young men _ at the total absence of females,
old people of either sex and children. We've glorified one aspect
of Paleolithic life ways at the expense of all the other things
that made that life way successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest examples of fabric yet discovered are some
carbonate-encrusted swatches from France that are about 18,000
years old, while pieces of cordage and string dating back 19,000
years have been unearthed in the Near East, many thousands of years
after the string and textile revolution began.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to study ancient textiles in the absence of
textiles, Dr. Soffer, Dr. Adovasio and Dr. Hyland have sought
indirect signs of textile manufacture. They have pored over
thousands of ancient fragments of fired and unfired clay, and have
found impressions of early textiles on a number of them, the oldest
dating to 29,000 B.C. But the researchers believe that textile
manufacture far predates this time period, for the sophistication
of the stitchery rules out it's being, as Dr. Soffer put it, ``what
you take home from Crafts 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Adovasio estimates that weaving and cord-making probably goes
back to the year 40,000 B.C. ``at a minimum,'' and possibly much
further.
</P>
<P>
   Long before people had settled down into towns with domesticated
plants and animals, then, while they were still foragers and
wanderers, they had, in a sense, tamed nature. The likeliest sort
of plants from which they extracted fibers were nettles. ``Nettle
in folk tales and mythology is said to have magic properties,'' Dr.
Soffer said. ``In one story by the Brothers Grimm, a girl whose two
brothers have been turned into swans has to weave them nettle
shirts by midnight to make them human again.'' The nettles stung
her fingers, but she kept on weaving.
</P>
<P>
   But what didn't make it into Grimms' was that when the girl was
done with the shirts, she took out a chisel, and carved herself a
Venus figurine.

COMMENTARY: BUGS BUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to: Vyacheslav Trubinokov, Director, KGB (now called SVR)
From: TLF.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Vyacheslav: This is a joke, right? You guys were bugging
the conference room of the State Department's Bureau of Oceans and
Environment? What were you thinking? You could bug the entire State
Department _ they could put a microphone on every floor and pipe
the conversations directly over to the Russian Embassy like Muzak _
and it wouldn't help you. What are you going to bug next? George W.
Bush's foreign policy library? The International House of Pancakes?
C-Span?
</P>
<P>
   People say that your bugging of the State Department means the
Cold War is still on. Wrong. It means the Cold War is truly over.
How else can one explain that you sent a Russian diplomat, in a car
with diplomatic license plates, to regularly park right in front of
State and then walk around suspiciously in a trench coat? Why
didn't he just wear a Sputnik hat and a sandwich board saying:
``Hi, I'm Boris. I'm spying for Russia. Could you please speak
louder?'' The KGB would  &UR; never &LR;  have been so sloppy if the Cold War
were still on.
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for you guys. You're making it too easy for the
FBI. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to give you a list
of the offices you should bug if you want to understand U.S. power
today.
</P>
<P>
   1. If you insist on bugging a Clinton cabinet member, then start
with Charlene Barshefsky, the top U.S. trade negotiator. She's got
real power. In this free-market age, she can shut down your steel
business with a stroke of her pen, if she accuses you of dumping
steel here at below market prices. What she thinks affects real
jobs and people in your country.
</P>
<P>
   2. If you can't get into Charlene's office, just go down three
blocks to that nice marble building next to the State Department.
It's the office of a guy named Alan Greenspan. Got that? Greenspan.
He's also known as ``The Master of the Universe.'' Trust me on this
one, what he thinks about interest rates and IMF loans to Russia
really matters.
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you know the way to San Jose? Go there, to 300 East Tasman
Dr., and bug the offices of Cisco Systems. It makes the routers
that connect the Internet, and the Internet is how we will
increasingly communicate, educate and do business in the coming
century. Yes, I know, missile size still matters _ if you plan to
launch a nuclear war with us that will obliterate your country,
too. But if you want to know what will drive day-to-day power, it's
bandwidth _ how much installed Internet capacity your country has
and how fast you can push stuff through it, which is Cisco's
specialty. Vyacheslav, you didn't lose the Cold War because you
didn't steal enough secrets from the State Department. You lost it
because you didn't steal enough secrets from Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bug the New Mexico home of the nuclear weapons engineer Wen
Ho Lee. This guy allegedly downloaded, from the Los Alamos nuclear
labs, America's most critical nuclear weapons secrets, then put
them on portable tapes and took them home. If the charges against
him are right, you could have downloaded more secrets from his home
computer than you ever would have found at the State Department _
and you wouldn't even have had to change the molding on his walls
to implant a bug. All you would have needed was a floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   5. The most important thing you could bug would be any tour bus
that takes you around to the institutions and monuments of
Washington, D.C. I would recommend visiting the Supreme Court, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the
Federal Communications Commission, the FBI, the Jefferson Memorial,
the Lincoln Memorial and Congress. These offices hold the real
``secrets'' that Russia needs _ and they're all hiding in plain
sight. The secret of our strength is that we are a democracy and
free market built on the rule of law, with real oversight and
regulatory institutions. We're not built on corruption, arbitrary
rule and the smashing of Chechnya. Yes, I know Russia has real
elections, but your people don't have real democrats to vote for
yet, and even if they did, those democrats don't have real
institutions to operate. That's what you need to steal.
</P>
<P>
   You can catch the Tourmobile Sightseeing bus at 18th and
Pennsylvania. It's $16 for a narrated tour _ and the guides don't
even mind if you bring a tape recorder.

   BRADLEY-WHITMAN (Washington) _ It once seemed that the word
failure was not a part of Bill Bradley's lexicon. He had been a

on his first foray into politics in 1978, the winner of a Senate
seat from New Jersey. In 1984, he won re-election by one of the
largest margins in state history. So in 1990, when Bradley came
within 3 percentage points of losing his once safe bastion to an
unknown, poorly financed Republican named Christie Whitman, he was
devastated. To many of his critics and supporters alike, the
disastrous 1990 campaign _ both sides use the adjective _
represents the most important event in Bradley's political life. By

STUDY CITES STRESS HAZARDS OF CARING FOR ELDERLY LOVED ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caring for an elderly loved one can be hazardous _ even fatal _
researchers warned Tuesday in the first study to document higher
death rates among family caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly caregivers who reported feeling stressed by attending
for a disabled spouse were 63 percent more likely to die over the
next four years, compared to elders did not saddled with such a
burden.
</P>
<P>
   The study is part of a growing research effort to document
health effects of caregiver stress. Other recent studies have found
that family caregivers have more heart disease, high blood
pressure, impaired immune function, and metabolic abnormalities
than people the same age who don't have to attend to ailing family
members.
</P>
<P>
   The toll that family caregiving takes is an issue of mounting
importance not only to the invisible army of 15 million family
caregivers in this country, but to society, which often must pick
up the cost through Medicaid-paid nursing home care when family
care systems collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by the National Alliance for Caregiving
estimated that family caregiving saves society from $113 billion to
$286 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, conducted by University of Pittsburgh scientists
and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
followed 392 elders who cared for their spouses and another 427
elders who lived with their spouses but did not have provide care.
</P>
<P>
   The study subjects, from 66 to 95 years old, were from North
Carolina, Maryland, California, and Pennsylvania. The caregivers
had spouses with diseases such as Alzheimer's, heart failure,
stroke, and cancer. However, many of the recipients of care were
not severely disabled.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers took into account the levels of underlying
disease among the different groups of elders, they found that
something about the stress of caregiving imposes an additional risk
of death, irrespective of whatever underlying disease the caregiver
suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have evidence that this group of strained caregivers had
higher levels of depression and anxiety, and reported higher rates
of not getting enough rest, not having time to exercise, not having
time to rest when they get sick,'' said Scott R. Beach, who did the
study with Richard Schulz. Both are at the University of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think being in this stressful situation prevents people
from being able to take care of themselves,'' Beach said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Beach and Schulz found that 13 percent over their total group of
819 elders died over a four-year period. Among those who were not
providing care to their spouses, the death rate was only 9 percent;
but among caregivers who reported being strained by the job, the
death rate was 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After adjusting for differing levels of underlying disease and
other factors, the stressed caregivers were 63 percent more likely
to die in four years compared to those not providing care for a
family member. The risk of death was not significantly higher among
caregivers who reported little stress, or those who had a disabled
spouse but were not providing care.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vitaliano of the University of Washington said elders are
not equally vulnerable to the health-destroying effects of
relentless caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to be a caregiver,'' Vitaliano said. ``You
have to be vulnerable, and you have to have poor social supports''
to suffer ill effects. ``We need to find out which types of
caregivers are at risk,'' so additional resources can be targeted
to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington State researcher hypothesizes that having high
rates of anger and hostility and low social supports lead to a high
risk of what is known as Syndrome X, a metabolic disorder the makes
people prone to heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and her husband Ronald Glaser, from Ohio
State University, wrote in an accompanying editorial that
physicians should question caregivers about their health and stress
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Glasers added that the new study ``is likely to fuel the
debate about the financing of long-term care'' since caregiving
``will become an increasingly prominent problem as the baby boom
generation ages.''

 William Harris writes about avant-garde art, theater and dance.  
 By WILLIAM HARRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the painter Fred Tomaselli pulls out a drawer
from a flat file in his studio, a visitor gasps. Inside are
cardboard palettes with meticulously cut out photos of birds,
flowers and insects scavenged from field guides and arranged by
size, color and species.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pictures of lips and eyeballs clipped from
fashion magazines and palettes of pressed leaves and organic
narcotics likes hemp, datura and ephedra. These items, along with
scores of pills and tablets _ over-the-counter remedies as well as
prescription and recreational drugs _ are Tomaselli's primary
materials. The drugs are stored nearby, sorted in old aspirin
bottles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tomaselli is known for collaging these water-soluble bits on
dark backgrounds, then sealing them in several coats of resin.
Pictorially the work veers between the figurative and the abstract,
but the result is usually the same: eye-popping imagery that is
dense, decorative and witty.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and largest example, ``Gravity's Rainbow (Large),''
is now on view at the Whitney Museum of Art at Philip Morris on
42nd Street through Jan. 7. (It will soon be added to three other
Tomaselli works in the Whitney's permanent collection.)
</P>
<P>
   This piece, named for Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel and
constructed out of five 4-foot-by-8-foot sections, is an exuberant
explosion of line and color with beaded swags sweeping across the
surface. It is remarkably seductive, yet some of its beauty is
derived from illicit drugs, which makes the work highly
provocative. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a dialogue about art heightening awareness
or modifying consciousness,'' said Tomaselli, who has never had
problems caused by his choice of materials. ``I started seeing some
interesting correlations between the rhetoric that surrounded
modernism _ of losing oneself in the sublime _ and the rhetoric
that surrounded drug culture.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about being bad or transgressive,'' he continued.
``Drugs were an aspect of my life. I don't take drugs anymore; I
just smoke cigarettes and drink coffee. What I'm really up to is a
giant act of sublimation. My work allows me to use drugs, to obsess
and be compulsive about them the way druggies are _ counting,
sorting, arranging, weighing. But the only way you can get their
psychoactivity is through your eyeballs, not your bloodstream.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tomaselli, 43, is at a key juncture in his career. Ten years
ago, when he first started incorporating pharmacological references
in his work, he also had to hold a day job to support himself.
(Back then, he was an installation artist, and one of his pieces
from that period remains on permanent view at the Hall of Science
in Flushing Meadow, Queens.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a waiting list for his work. His output is modest,
because his process is labor-intensive. A 2-foot-square Tomaselli,
purchased for $2,800 four years ago, since sold at auction for
$11,000. Meanwhile, he recently joined a new dealer, James Cohan,
after being courted by a dozen galleries.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred is a hybrid of several different sensibilities,'' said
Cohan, whose three-month-old gallery also represents, among other
artists, Ron Mueck, Richard Patterson and Bill Viola as well as the
estate of Robert Smithson. ``He has great conceptual ideas and also
makes remarkably convincing pictures. He really believes art has
the ability to transform and transcend the everyday.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The earliest drug works were whimsical drawings, goofing on
astrology. Tomaselli asked sitters to name their birthday and list
all the drugs they remember taking _ everything from aspirin,
alcohol and amyl nitrate to caffeine, chocolate or cannabis.
</P>
<P>
   The birth date would correspond to an astrological sign, which
in turn corresponded to an astrological chart. Tomaselli recreated
those charts and renamed the stars on them for the drugs consumed.
``They were portraits of inner space and outer space,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are much more elaborate and the process is
painstaking. With ``Gravity's Rainbow (Large),'' for instance, he
began by using an 18-foot-long beaded pull cord, creating
catenaries, or chains, on the wood surface that pleased his eye,
then traced them with a white pencil. Pills and cutouts were
arranged and rearranged, then glued to the surface. Next came the
resin, squeegeed on and blow-dried, before new catenaries were
etched into the surface, creating another layer to be filled in.
The piece took five months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In a sly wink to one of Philip Morris' most controversial
products, Tomaselli experimented with using cigarette butts in the
garlands. Dissatisfied with the result, he ended up using cigarette
butts as stamps to create little circles of color.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep the viewer as off-balance as possible to
the reality of what they're seeing,'' said Tomaselli. ``I freely
mix the painted, the photographic and the real as seamlessly as
possible in the same picture plane. I like the textural contrast of
the hard geometric manufactured pills against the soft shape of
nature.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tomaselli grew up in Southern California in a working class
family, not far from Disneyland. His parents were Swiss immigrants.
By his own admission, he spent his high school years either stoned
or tripping on psychedelic drugs. ``The slippage of reality was
part of the way I grew up,'' he noted. But he also remembers being
exposed to Conceptualist artists like Bruce Nauman, Chris Burden
and James Turrell, and the pull they had on him as a rebellious
teenager interested in punk rock. He graduated from the California
State University at Fullerton in 1982 with a BA in painting and
drawing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a Turrell show where there appeared to be a
black-painted rectangle on the wall in a dimly lit gallery,''
Tomaselli said. ``Me and my friends were laughing and saying,
`Stupid modern art.' I went over and touched it, and my hand went
into limitless space. I went from ridiculing it to going ooooh.
That was a critical moment for me. I loved being fooled, it was
like magic. That double take has been germane in my work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tomaselli moved to New York 14 years ago, having never been here
in his life. Today, he lives with his wife, Laura Miller, and
20-month-old son, Desmond, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn,
where he also has his studio.
</P>
<P>
   He finds the recent feeding frenzy among dealers wanting to
represent him both flattering and unnerving. ``I never expected
that this late in the process I'd still have some juice left in my
career,'' he said. ``I've had a below-radar career for a long time,
and it's only in the last few years that things have escalated. My
stock seems to be rising. But I've also been around long enough to
know that this stuff goes away.''

AN AIRPORT ARCHITECT'S GREAT LEAP FORWARD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Having designed 30 airport terminals around the world,
Paul Andreu can hardly escape being known as an airport architect.
Not that there is anything amiss with that.
</P>
<P>
   Airports today are what railroad stations were at the turn of
the century, gateways that every year provide tens of millions of
travelers with their first and last impressions of a city. And if
Andreu keeps being invited to build airports, it is because this
engineer-turned-architect enjoys a worldwide reputation for
designing visually striking and passenger-friendly terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Parisians above all have come to appreciate his work (without
necessarily knowing his name) as the designer of five elegant
modules for Air France's ever-expanding Terminal 2 at Charles de
Gaulle airport north of Paris. Elsewhere in France, he has built
new airport terminals in Nice, Bordeaux and Guadeloupe, while his
works abroad include terminals in Cairo, Jakarta, Shanghai,
Dar-es-Salaam, Bangkok and Athens.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he also designed the high-speed train station
at Charles de Gaulle airport and the cross-Channel railroad
terminal in Calais.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the age of 61, this slim, bearded Frenchman would like
to be remembered for more. After all, every architect has his
vanity. And, let's face it, in today's architectural celebrity
circuit, airports are simply not as sexy as, say, museums or opera
houses.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, he took the plunge, entering a design competition
for a new national theater complex in Beijing, just the kind of
cultural building that would assuredly change his image. The
problem was that a Chinese architect was the logical choice. And if
not, several other foreign architects seemed like stronger
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Andreu was right about one thing. Having won the
competition in August, his image is already changing. And now, like
I.M. Pei with his glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum in Paris,
Richard Meier with the Getty Center in Los Angeles and Frank Gehry
with the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Andreu is destined to be
identified with a building that will leave its mark on Beijing for
generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   With construction scheduled to start in March, the $360 million
egg-shaped complex, with its opera house, concert hall and two
theaters, is set to open by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project has everything,'' Andreu said in an interview at
his office near Orly Airport outside Paris. ``It is in a great
country. It is at the heart of a great city. It's an immense
cultural project. It has an ellipsoid form that has fascinated me
for a long time and that I can now build. I can't think of anything
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for his gamble to pay off, he must eventually please
two quite separate audiences: the Chinese, both its government and
its theatergoing public, and Western architecture critics and
scholars. But those tests are still some time away.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Chinese authorities informed him that his design had
been selected, for instance, they have yet to announce the decision
at home. Similarly, though his design will soon start appearing in
specialist magazines, architecture critics tend to wait until
buildings are almost completed before pronouncing their verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the project has been mooted for so long that no one
was quite ready for it to go ahead. As far back as 1958, Prime
Minister Zhou Enlai sponsored the idea of an opera house in
downtown Beijing, and some foundations were even dug. Work stopped
during the famine that followed the disastrous Great Leap Forward
in 1960, and though digging resumed in the mid-1960s, the project
was again halted by the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, more buildings were razed to clear the way for the
complex, but the plan remained bogged down in political debate.
Then, after the student killings in Tiananmen Square in 1989, it
was considered risky to draw large crowds to an adjacent theater
district. Finally, President Jiang Zemin himself apparently
approved the project.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the proposed site of the complex has remained
unchanged: a large near-abandoned lot with a few unseemly holes and
run-down houses, separated from Tiananmen Square by the Great Hall
of the People and catty-corner from one side of the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1998, when the Chinese authorities in the shape of the
Grand National Theater Committee organized the design competition,
they not only spelled out where the complex should stand and what
it should contain but also required that it not be higher than the
Great Hall of the People. In terms of material and shape, though,
they made no recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Andreu learned of the competition by chance while visiting the
construction site of ``his'' new Shanghai-Pudong Airport, which was
inaugurated this fall during celebrations of the 50th anniversary
of China's Communist regime. It transpired that some big-name
architects had already been invited to participate, among them Jean
Nouvel of France, Carlos Ott of Canada, Hans Hollein of Austria and
Arata Isozaki of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Andreu, however, had to seek permission to be included among the
44 architects, more than half of them Chinese, allowed to present
designs and models for the theater complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architects generally like very selective competitions, with
six or seven people, but this was perfect for me,'' Andreu said.
``I had no important references in the cultural area. I am building
Osaka's new Museum of the Sea in Japan, but people like to put you
in boxes, and I was the one who built airports. So a more open
competition suited me. At first, I didn't join with the idea of
winning. I viewed it as a way of getting new oxygen into my system.
So I entered the competition. There was the first round, the second
round and then suddenly I thought, perhaps I can win this.''

MCCAIN HEALTH CARE PLAN LACKS DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Senator John McCain Tuesday unveiled a health
care plan that provides increased prescription drug payments and
puts new money into Medicare and veterans' benefits, while relying
mostly on tax breaks to expand coverage to the 44 million uninsured
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech was filled with broad statements about how it
was unacceptable to have so many uninsured people, but his language
was vague in many areas and he left out some detailed cost
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after his speech to say how many of the uninsured
Americans would be covered under his various proposals, he
responded: ``Off the top of my head, half of them.'' He also said
he didn't know how much his plan would cost, saying he had
misplaced his estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The setting of the speech said much about the direction of the
campaign. McCain has staked his campaign on winning both the New
Hampshire primary and the South Carolina contest 18 days later. He
joked at a press conference Tuesday that his strategy book is
highly complex: ``Every page says `South Carolina.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His senior aides said earlier this week that McCain would
probably drop out if he loses the contest in South Carolina, which
is considered friendly territory for the former Vietnam prisoner of
war because it has the nation's highest per-capita number of
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech before more than 500 members of the Charleston
Rotary Club at the Charleston convention complex, McCain invoked
his favorite theme about the evil of special interest
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be realistic,'' McCain said. ``The reform we need is not
possible as long as special interests control Washington. As long
as the special interest agendas are greased with unlimited amounts
of soft-money contributions to our campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, for example, that trial lawyers want unlimited
ability to seek big liability awards from care providers, which he
said hurts both the health care provider and consumers in general.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said that he would try to expand coverage to
the uninsured by expanding the availability of health insurance to
small business and by expanding the use of Medical Savings Account,
an IRA-like program that provides a tax break for funds used to pay
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not say how much this expanded tax break would cost,
nor did he explain how much he would expand the current $500 per
year tax break available under the Medical Savings Account program.
After his speech, he said he would increase it to $1,000. Asked
whether that would be enough to cover annual medical expenses for
many people, McCain said he would consider raising it further if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Slass, a spokesman for the non-partisan group Families
USA, which seeks affordable access to health care, said that
McCain's omission of a specific plan to provide coverage to all
Americans ``is a big hole in his proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan relies heavily on the current HMO system, which he
noted has been criticized for putting cost-containment before
providing some necessary health benefits. McCain said he can solve
that problem by allowing independent boards to mediate disputes,
and to allow patients to sue HMOs over a denial of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs were designed to bring new efficiencies to our health
care system, but for millions of Americans, the cure has become
part of the disease,'' McCain said. ``Cost containment has become a
goal in and of itself, rather the means toward better, more
affordable health services.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, as he has in the past, endorsed a version of the
``Patients Bill of Rights'' that allows patients to sue HMOs. But
McCain spent much of his speech warning that he wasn't endorsing a
runaway flood of lawsuits. ``I will demand reform that tames legal
predators and addresses the problem of runaway punitive damage
awards,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush, has not yet
announced his health care plan, while another leading Republican
candidate, Steve Forbes, has proposed a plan that, like the McCain
proposal, expands the use of Medical Savings Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain plan relies far less on government funds than the
proposals put forward by the two Democratic candidates. Vice
President Al Gore has proposed a plan that would cover all children
and gradually lead to universal coverage, while former Senator Bill
Bradley has proposed a sweeping measure that includes coverage for
95 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Under McCain's plan:
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy percent of the budget surplus would be dedicated to
shoring up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   --Senior citizens who are struggling financially would
beeligible for expanded drug coverage. A ``regional pilot project''
would extend catastrophic drug coverage to senior citizens
regardless of income, but McCain did not specify how many people
would be covered under such a program. He said later that the $6
billion program would be run on a trial basis in five states.
</P>
<P>
   --McCain said that many of the nation's 11 million uninsured
children could get coverage under existing programs and if families
take advantage of the tax breaks that he has proposed. Then, in a
statement that characterized much of his speech Tuesday, McCain
added: ``If the package of reform I've outlined isn't enough to do
the job, we'll do more.''
</P>
<P>
   --An additional $2 billion would be allocated to fund what
McCain called a shortfall in veteran's health care benefits.

 PARIS: win this.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The selection process took 18 months, longer than usual in such
competitions. After the first round, the 44 models were displayed
at the Museum of Revolutionary History on Tiananmen Square. The
organizing committee then invited all 44 participants to make new
presentations that took into account criticisms and
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Retaining his original design of a massive rectangular building,
Andreu was chosen in May this year as one of four finalists, along
with Carlos Ott, Terry Farrell from Britain and the Architectural
Design Institute of Qinghua University. Only then did Andreu
radically revise his proposal, abandoning his ``shoe box'' for the
titanium-and glass-covered ellipsoid shell that was approved.
</P>
<P>
   As currently designed (things can always change), the
430-foot-long and 135-feet-high building will be surrounded by a
large, shallow lake and will be approached through an underwater
glass-roofed tunnel through which the complex should be
shimmeringly visible. The public will then arrive in a cavernous
lobby where, like a city within a city, the 2,500-seat opera house,
the 2,000-seat concert hall and the 1,200-seat theater will appear
as separate structures (the 520-seat minitheater is below ground).
</P>
<P>
   A transparent gilt metal netting will surround the opera house
to suggest something slightly ethereal, while the auditorium itself
will have dark red as its dominant color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always attached to the idea that you don't enter an
opera house as you might push open the door of a supermarket,''
Andreu explained. ``You need time to enter the world of opera. The
Palais Garnier in Paris does that, it gives you time to breathe.
That's what I'm aiming for here. Going to the opera is a
processional process. Opera becomes ridiculous it you don't have
time to enter a world of dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Andreu hopes that the area around the theater
complex will become a park, not only for environmental reasons (he
has frequently integrated gardens into his airport terminals), but
also because trees will soften the impact of his unusually shaped
building on the surrounding neighborhood. While this is out of his
hands, however, he has been told that he will be responsible for
construction of the theater complex itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Shanghai-Pudong airport, we did the drawings but did not
intervene in the construction,'' he said. ``Here we'll have Chinese
associates, apparently the Institute of Beijing City, with some
role for Quinghua University. But they said: `You're in charge of
this project. You'll work with Chinese, but you're responsible. We
want you to be there.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, several thousand miles away, a team of
French architects are working on detailed drawings of the new
complex in the offices of Aeroports de Paris, the government-owned
agency that operates the Paris airports.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely location mirrors Andreu's unusual career: since the
late 1960s he has been an employee of Aeroports de Paris and, as
such, has been hired to build airport terminals around the world.
In Beijing, he is working in his own name, but even there Aeroports
de Paris is associated with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incomprehensible,'' he admitted with a laugh. ``It's
unthinkable in any other country: Aeroports de Paris and Paul
Andreu Architect, together but separate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Andreu knows that when the Beijing project is completed,
he alone will take credit or blame. And at this stage of his life,
this is the gamble that he is evidently eager to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have unanimity on such a project is impossible,'' he said.
``I expect quite a number of people in China will say they don't
like it. But a creation is bound to be something that disturbs. If
it is just a reproduction, it is handicraft. My purpose is to do
something original. I can only hope that it disturbs in a positive
way.''

THE BOOM IN STOCKS REVERBERATES IN COLLECTIBLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ As stocks soared this year, the New York market for
antiques, collectibles and 20th-century objects eclipsed even the
levels reached in the boom years of the 1980s. Auctions, fairs and
exhibitions at museums and galleries attracted new collectors and
dealers as well as a new art fair to Manhattan, heightening the
awareness of the decorative arts, especially in the Art Deco style.
</P>
<P>
   Why New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of our clients are American, and most of them
live in Manhattan,'' said Bob Vallois, a prominent Paris dealer in
Art Deco, explaining why he and his wife, Cheska, opened an annex
of their Left Bank gallery in Manhattan. The shop is a partnership
with Barry Friedman, a dealer in 20th-century works. On view now at
Friedman &AMP; Vallois are a 1930s silvery aluminum desk and chair by
Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, priced at $420,000; a 1940 brass and glass
lamp with parts from a Ford V-8 engine by Jean Perzel, at $22,500,
and a 1930s Daum glass lamp, at $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Art Deco objects, as well as most decorative arts and
collectibles, have had a good year in galleries, fairs and flea
markets small and large, including the Pier Shows. But the best
gauge of the market's health are auctions, because there the prices
paid by buyers are published, unlike those at private sales.
</P>
<P>
   And auctions this year included some record prices: $3 million
for the baseball Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run, at
Guernsey's, and $4.7 million for one of Edward Hicks' ``Peaceable
Kingdom'' paintings, at Christie's, both in January; $684,500 for
an American Indian mask in October, and $11 million for a 1930s
Patek Philippe pocket watch two weeks ago, both at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   At Art Deco auctions, several pieces brought the sort of
six-figure prices usually paid for French 18th-century furniture.
Last month, Barbra Streisand's Art Deco piano by Ruhlmann was sold
for $607,500 at Christie's, and in June, a set of gilded chairs by
Armand Rateau went for $927,000, five times the price expected, at
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Art Deco also starred at New York's newest art show, the
International 20th Century Arts Fair, held on Thanksgiving weekend.
Organized by Brian and Anna Haughton of London, the five-day
bazaar, the fourth Haughton show now in New York, attracted 12,500
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twentieth-century art is the one area we did not cover in our
fairs,'' Haughton said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman exhibited at the fair and sold a third of the objects
in his booth. ``It was the best fair for us in a long time _ since
1989,'' he said. ``A lot of people made a lot of money in the stock
market this year and were spending some of it at this fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the style or period, decorative arts and collectibles
seemed to sell well this year at New York's largest auction houses,
both of which expanded: Christie's moved to much larger, more
glamorous quarters at Rockefeller Center, and Sotheby's doubled the
size of its 20-year-old house.
</P>
<P>
   Records were wracked up in sales of decorative arts and
collectibles at both houses. Sotheby's announced that the total for
New York sales _ $180 million _ was its highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom, antiquing in New York, the largest center for
antiques and collectibles in the world, is not always easy. The
sheer abundance makes many collectors ecstatic but frustrates
others, when they have difficulty finding exactly what they seek _
an American 19th-century trotting-horse weathervane, a Gutenberg
Bible, a Ming vase, an 18th-century desk from Versailles or a
Mickey Mouse toy.
</P>
<P>
   These days fewer New York dealers are storekeepers than in the
past. While you can still walk into antiques shops along Lafayette
Street in SoHo and Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village or on and
off Madison Avenue from the 60s to the 80s, they are far less
visible than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, antiques dealers have followed art dealers out
of storefront galleries to do business instead out of town houses,
gallery buildings, converted factories, warehouses and their own
apartments. Rents are lower, spaces larger and more secure. Many
dealers now see clients by appointment only.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques shops may be less visible, but antiques and art fairs
are on the increase. New York is host to about 60 antiques and art
fairs each year, 10 times the number held in the mid-1960s. Dealers
come from throughout the world to show their wares at the Park
Avenue and Lexington Avenue armories or at the Pier shows.
</P>
<P>
   The International Asian Art Fair, a spring event, is often
described as the best art show in Manhattan, and the reason is
obvious, said the pre-eminent dealer in Asian art, Robert H.
Ellsworth. ``Even if you spent a year going around the world,'' he
said, ``you would never be able to see all the fine Asian art
exhibited here.''
</P>
<P>
   So hot are the fairs and auctions that foreign dealers like
Giuseppe Eskenazi, London's leading dealer in Chinese art, rent
galleries to present private exhibitions. As antiquity collectors
gathered in Manhattan for the auctions a few weeks ago, Robin
Symes, a London dealer, took over a town house to exhibit 30
ancient Greek portraits in stone, bronze, jasper, garnet and
silver, many of which he sold at prices from $800 to seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now antiquing is changing again,'' said William W. Stahl, Jr.
an executive vice president of Sotheby's. ``We've added 10,000 new
clients since we began auctioning on the web a few weeks ago.''

JUST A NICE WASHINGTON DOCTOR AND HER RUIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   LOS ANGELES _ The scene is a brunch in an elegant living room in
Georgetown, the upper-class Washington enclave. But Christine Lahti
and a half-dozen actresses and actors are actually filming ``An
American Daughter'' in a home in the upscale Hancock Park section
of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Washington _ the town's hypocrisies, its self-important
journalists and snarky politics _ serves not only as the setting
for the Wendy Wasserstein comedy-drama-turned-television-movie but
also the catalyst for the special personal and professional
pitfalls that face women in and around government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, television may be the right form for this play
because it's about the television medium,'' said Ms. Wasserstein,
author of ``The Sisters Rosensweig'' and ``The Heidi Chronicles,''
whose Washington drama opened at Lincoln Center in 1997 to mixed,
if not poor, reviews and has since been revised by the author.
``Maybe Monicagate, maybe all the things we've seen in the last two
years in Washington, has given the play a resonance that it never
had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama, which explores the corrosive effects of a private
life turned public before the television cameras, is now completing
production in Los Angeles, and is to be shown next spring over
Lifetime. It is the network's first adapted Broadway play.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime _ with mainstream, if soft-hued, series like ``Any Day
Now'' and ``Oh Baby'' _ may be the No. 1 cable network for women's
programming (now available in 73 million households), but it is
hardly a bastion of feminist sensibility. Despite that, Dawn
Tarnofsky-Ostroff, Lifetime's executive vice president for
entertainment, says the Wasserstein play fits perfectly into the
network's efforts to lure women viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is a very contemporary and relevant story that
will appeal to our viewers, who are women from all walks of life,''
said Ms. Tarnofsky-Ostroff. ``Our viewers are hungry for knowledge
and information. We want projects that can teach them.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``The American Daughter'' teaches is, in fact, a fairly
bleak lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The play deals with an eminently qualified Washington physician,
Lyssa Dent Hughes (Ms. Lahti, who lobbied hard to snare the role),
who faces an onslaught of media and political scrutiny after the
president nominates her to be surgeon general. A mistake from the
past _ she once discarded a jury summons _ comes back to haunt her.
</P>
<P>
   Characters in the drama include Lyssa's husband, Walter (played
by Tom Skerritt), a sociologist and author who has affairs on the
side; a gay, conservative pundit (Mark Feuerstein) who easily
betrays her; an arrogant feminist in her 20s who's popular on the
talk show circuit (Blake Lindsley) and a slippery television news
reporter (Jay Thomas) who's seeking a scandal. Many of the
characters are quite despicable.
</P>
<P>
   The play itself was written in the aftermath of the
controversies involving President Clinton's failed appointments of
Zoe Baird, Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier, and was criticized in a
review in The Boston Globe, for example, as ``a smug comedy about
unbearably smug people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserstein has reshaped the play in several important ways.
She has sharpened the focus on the Lyssa character, making her
stronger, as well as clarifying her relationship to her husband.
The ending of the drama has changed to make her more resolute. And
the character of the gay Republican pundit has been made less
vengeful; he is now almost bewildered by his own horrific behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, some aspects of the play seem somehow more
timely, especially in the aftermath of Monica Lewinsky and the
humiliation of Hillary Rodham Clinton. At one point, Lyssa
excoriates her husband for betraying her with another woman in
their own home. ``A lot of people then thought, `Oh, come on,'''
said Ms. Wasserstein. ``It has a different resonance now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lahti put it another way. ``The media and public humiliation
of the president and Monica Lewinsky seems to add weight to what
Wendy is wrestling with here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The television film, directed by Sheldon Larry, also stars Lynne
Thigpen, who won a Tony Award for her role as Lyssa's best friend,
Judith B. Kaufman, a black Jewish oncologist desperate to have a
child.
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Wasserstein, who is 49 and recently gave birth to her first
child, Lucy Jane, said the Kaufman character was a deeply personal
portrayal after years of struggling with infertility. Ms.
Wasserstein, who is not married, has declined to reveal the name of
the father.)
</P>
<P>
   In taking on the role, Ms. Lahti, an Emmy Award winner for the
CBS medical series ``Chicago Hope,'' said the play's themes had
appealed to her and she had actively sought out the part. It began
with a telephone call to the director, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bugged Sheldon,'' she said with a laugh, in her cramped
trailer on a street in front of the house where she had just
completed the scene of a Georgetown brunch. ``I called Wendy. I
made a complete pest of myself. This was one of the dream parts. I
knew they were going after Meryl Streep and somebody else. And I
thought, well, maybe it'll come to me if she doesn't want to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lahti said she had been captivated by the original Lincoln
Center version of the drama. In fact, when the play was not
nominated for a Tony Award, Ms. Lahti said, she sat down and wrote
an Op-Ed piece for The New York Times criticizing the decision.
(The piece was turned down.) But once she was offered the
television role, Ms. Lahti said, she suggested to Ms. Wasserstein
that in one scene she could make the lead character less passive,
less a victim. Ms. Wasserstein agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The play, Ms. Lahti said, resonates with two themes: how
excessive media scrutiny can sabotage the appointment of qualified
public servants and, on a personal level, how feminism has been
afflicted by the generational divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dismayed that so many younger women find the term
`feminism' somehow embarrassing or outdated,'' said Ms. Lahti, who
appeared on the New York stage in Ms. Wasserstein's ``Heidi
Chronicles.'' ``I'm dismayed also by the lack of support that women
have for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether acting on television is different from the stage,
Ms. Lahti shrugged and said no. ``I really believe in what Jimmy
Cagney once said,''she added. ```You stand there and tell the
truth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lahti, whose film career has included ``Running on Empty,''
``Housekeeping'' and ``... And Justice for All,'' recently
completed a four-year stint as a doctor on ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mutual decision,'' she said. ``I could have gone on
one more season but they wanted to revamp the whole show and bring
in new people and I just felt it was time to move. And as much as I
loved that gig on `Chicago Hope,' and I did, there would be days
where I'd be going, `How many more times can I say, ``Pass the
scalpel and sponge''? And how come I'm not with my kids?''' (Ms.
Lahti is married to the director Thomas Schlamme; they have
boy-and-girl twins, who are 6, and an 11-year-old son.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lahti, who is to start directing her first feature film,
``My First Mister,'' a comedy starring Albert Brooks, in January,
said that except for cable television parts, strong dramatic roles
for women over 40 were difficult to find: ``I get offered a lot of
moms in movies. A lot of doctors. And that's one of the reasons I'm
directing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actresses like Sally Field and Diane Keaton are directing now,
she pointed out. ``It's a fabulous avenue,'' she said. ``I love
acting, but if I'm going to play supporting, underwritten mom parts
in a movie that I can do in my sleep, I may as well be home with my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Ms. Lahti's trailer, Robert Schwartz, an executive
producer of the film, and Larry, the director, said that as much as
they had yearned to make the movie in Washington, the costs and
complications were prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's issues of permits and what seems like 16 different
police agencies, and it's not easy,'' said Schwartz. The play
itself, he said, has been trimmed considerably by Ms. Wasserstein,
who adapted her 1989 Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ``The Heidi
Chronicles,'' for TNT in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the important Sunday morning brunch scene, where
the characters collide and the play's themes emerge, has been cut
in half.
</P>
<P>
   Larry, a theatrical and television director who has known the
author for 20 years, said that using cameras for a play that is, to
some degree, about television had strengthened the drama. At one
point near the finale, the Lahti character goes before a national
television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is viewed from inside a television studio (it was
filmed at the CBS studios) where Ms. Lahti appears on 30 screens at
once, at various angles. The scene was meant to display the
pervasiveness of the scrutiny that the characters undergo. This
was, of course, impossible onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has an opinion now and feels they have a right to
know about anything,'' said Larry, preparing for his next scene.
``The result is that lives get ruined and we're the losers. And to
some degree I think that's what this play is about.''

   TRUMP-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Donald Trump builds buildings. I
write about them. So far, he hasn't given me an occasion to write
glowingly about his architectural projects. It would be great if
this changed. I'm not hopeful. But I love the color,
contentiousness and comedy Trump brings to the contemporary urban
scene. Adrian Stokes, the British art critic, once wrote that
``Architecture is limited to forms without events.'' I disagree. As
a social, public and urban art form, architecture can't be
separated from the events that buildings contain, shape and
provoke. Architecture criticism, in written appraisals or the
comments of sidewalk superintendents, qualifies as an event in this
sense. Even when criticism is negative, it is part of the fabric
that holds a great city together. I don't hate Trump's buildings,
but even if that were the case, I would still see them as a
challenge to examine my preferences in relation to his. By Herbert
Muschamp. Photo.

   DOCUMENTARY-FILMS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ The Fantasy building has
been the birthplace of cinematic flights of fancy _ to the Sahara,
to the concert halls of 18th-century Vienna, to the Amazon jungle.
But this seven-story glass and concrete structure, also houses a
different breed of filmmaker. For more than a decade, the film
producer, Saul Zaentz has offered low-cost space to local
documentarians, making his building a center for San Francisco's
growing, well-regarded documentary community. By Edward Wong.

<P>
   SNOW-ON-CEDARS-FILM (Hollywood) _ ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' is
a complex story that spreads across many years and while it is, at
heart, a love story, it also contains elements of epic historical
importance, like the incarceration of Japanese-Americans in
detention camps during World War II. And there are three main plot
threads, according to Scott Hicks, the film's director. A murder
mystery (the Japanese-American fisherman is accused of murdering a
white fisherman, with whose family he had been embroiled in a
soured land deal), a love story (between Ishmael, a war veteran and
editor of the island's newspaper, and the accused fisherman's wife)
and the story of how the war had affected each of them and their
community. The film opens Wednesday. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   SHOAH-VIDEO (Undated) _ Time doesn't fly in Claude Lanzmann's
monumental film; it melts. A chronicle of the Holocaust, ``Shoah''
(``annihilation'' in Hebrew) proceeds deliberately, inexorably, for
9 hours and 23 minutes, set always to the click-clack of boxcars
that carried Jews to the gas chambers and crematoriums. Released in
theaters in 1985 and now back on video after seven years out of
distribution, the documentary focuses primarily on the death camps
in the Polish towns of Treblinka and Auschwitz. By Peter M.
Nichols.

   PARSONS-DANCE (New York) _ As the choreographer for ``Times
Square 2000,'' Manhattan's round-the-clock salute to the
millennium, David Parsons is putting the finishing touches on
nearly a dozen new dances by the end of the month. Colleagues say
he has kept his part of the program on track _ despite a trip to
the hospital to be treated for dehydration _ with shrewd planning,
a lively imagination and undisguised pragmatism. The outdoor
celebration will start around sunrise on Dec. 31 and continue for
24 hours. By Christopher Reardon. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-TECHNIQUE (Undated) _ A musical observer a century ago
could have looked around at a number of living composers whose
works were being regularly performed wherever Western classical
music was known. And most of those composers were relatively young.
We live in a different world. Most of the composers who are widely
admired today are over 50, and some are over 90. Once John Cage had
produced his silent piece ``4' 33'','' in 1952, there was perhaps
nowhere to go but sideways. The only progress made after that was
in electronic music and in the recovery of large form, whether by
erstwhile Serialists, such as Pierre Boulez, or by the new
Minimalists, such as Steve Reich. And even in these areas, not much
has changed in the last 20 years. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-CITY-CHRISTMAS (New York) _ Once my critical colleagues
have dispatched themselves to various ceremonies of carols, the
``Messiah'' of the day or the latest ``Christmas Oratorio,'' I
check to see that no one is looking and make a beeline for Radio
City Music Hall. I like the ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular''
because it tells me how the season is progressing. I like a Santa
not afraid to loosen his hips to a boogie beat. The Rockettes make
my heart beat fast. There is in this year's show a dance sequence
of multiplying Santas: so many that by the end they barely fit
onstage. It's comforting to know that there will be enough Kriss
Kringles available for every borough and congressional district in
New York City, with some left over for the immediate suburbs. By
Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   GREAT-GATSBY-OPERA (New York) _ When John Harbison began working
on his third opera, ``The Great Gatsby,'' he faced a particular
musical challenge that has stymied many opera composers. The iconic
F. Scott Fitzgerald novel on which the opera is based is set in the
early 1920s, the Jazz Age, and the narrative is filled with music.
What was Harbison to do? If he incorporated pop standards into his
opera, the familiar tunes would probably have blotted out his own
music and interrupted the musical-dramatic flow. Far from being
intimidated by the challenge, Harbison welcomed it. The technique
of evoking vernacular music has a long heritage in opera, and
Harbison conceived ``The Great Gatsby,'' which will receive its
premiere on Monday evening at the Metropolitan Opera, with James
Levine conducting, as an extension of that tradition. By Anthony
Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Country music almost by definition
exists in a convoluted, almost duplicitous relationship with its
past. Inherently reactionary _ that's the whole point _ country on
the surface is all about roots, constancy, shared references both
in terms of the music and the lyrics. But, from its beginnings as a
commercial force country has always been an intensely marketed
amalagm of old and new, real and contrived that was willed into
existence in the 1920s by the modernizing influences of radio, new
recording technology and urbanism. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-DECO-ANTIQUES (New York) _ As stocks soared this year, the
New York market for antiques, collectibles and 20th century objects
eclipsed even the levels reached in the boom years of the 1980s.
Auctions, fairs and exhibitions at museums and galleries attracted
new collectors and dealers as well as a new art fair to Manhattan,
heightening the awareness of the decorative arts, especially in the
Art Deco style. By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT-ARCHITECT (Paris) _ Having designed 30 airport terminals
around the world, Paul Andreu can hardly escape being known as an
airport architect. Not that there is anything amiss with that.
Airports today are what railroad stations were at the turn of the
century, gateways that every year provide tens of millions of
travelers with their first and last impressions of a city. And if
Andreu keeps being invited to build airports, it is because this
engineer-turned-architect enjoys a worldwide reputation for
designing visually striking and passenger-friendly terminals. By
Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   TOMASELLI-ART (New York) _ The painter, Fred Tomaselli, uses
cutout photos of birds, flowers, insects and pictures of lips and
eyeballs clipped from fashion magazines as materials for his
collages, which are sealed in several coats of resin. Pictorially
the work veers between the figurative and the abstract, but the
result is usually the same: eye-popping imagery that is dense,
decorative and witty. The latest and largest example, ``Gravity's
Rainbow (Large),'' is now on view at the Whitney Museum of Art at
Philip Morris on 42nd Street through Jan. 7. By William Harris.

 &HT;    Investors unimpressed by BellSouth European deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the case of the stock that did not rise.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hound that did not bark in the Sherlock Holmes story,
BellSouth's stock price seems to have said at least as much during
several quiet days as it would have by making a lot of noise.
</P>
<P>
   The provocation to howl came late Thursday, when BellSouth
announced a deal that would help Dutch-based KPN Telecom NV buy a
German wireless provider and _ eventually _ give BellSouth a
sizable piece of the Dutch company.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth would spend virtually no money but would end up with
an interest in KPN Telecom that _ at current prices _ is worth
nearly $6 billion more than its current interest in E-Plus, the
German wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   Although complex, the deal won praise for being a clever bit of
maneuvering. Not only would it boost the value of BellSouth's
European business, it would make the company an investor in an
aggressive player with plans to expand.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deal, Duane Ackerman spoke eagerly of
``unlocking'' the value of BellSouth's stake in E-Plus. He cited
the apparent gain in the value of BellSouth's holdings as nearly
$2.80 per share of company stock. He stopped short of predicting
that the stock would get a ``bump'' skyward by that amount, but
when asked about the company's reputation after the KPN deal, he
suggested that shareholders would be especially pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reacted by calling the deal ``a savvy
piece of financial engineering.'' The Financial Times gushed that
``the math of the transaction shows just how fabulous a deal
BellSouth has struck'' and said that BellSouth ``has pulled off one
of the most extraordinary financial coups in recent times.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Chief Staff Officer Gary Forsee, who is responsible
for strategic planning, said the deal puts BellSouth in position to
dramatically expand its role in Europe as the Continent's telecom
business booms. Without committing to a deeper entanglement or even
a merger, BellSouth can grow as KPN does, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assumption is that European wireless values will continue
to grow. They will be our partner of choice to expand our footprint
in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly KPN Telecom investors greeted the news with wild
enthusiasm. The Dutch company stock, trading at $61 a share as the
news began to break, has soared since to $84 a share. And KPN was
the company about to shell out $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sound that you did not hear was the cheering of
BellSouth investors. The company stock Friday moved from $47.25 to
$47.52. On Monday, it dipped back to $47.12 1/2 and Tuesday,
BellSouth was up slightly to $47.50.
</P>
<P>
   Woof?
</P>
<P>
   Forsee said BellSouth is willing to be patient, to see the
market value the deal gradually. But BellSouth officials clearly
were disappointed that Wall Street's initial reaction was so
lackluster. But what was the explanation? Had BellSouth overhyped
the deal to the public or maybe oversold itself? Was BellSouth just
caught in some larger market tide? Or were investors passing up
BellSouth for some other, more fundamental reason?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the deal was just too darned complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes to pinpoint when something is significant
and what the market is going to think is significant,'' said
Douglas Christopher, analyst for Crowell, Weedon &AMP; Co. ``I am
looking at this and thinking it's a pretty good investment for
BellSouth. I just don't think that this deal is well-understood
here in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst David Burks of Hilliard Lyons said such a deal always
means more to the smaller company _ in this case, KPN Telecom,
which is about one-third the size of $24 billion-a-year BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   He praised BellSouth for becoming more aggressive, calling the
company's recent unsuccessful bid for Sprint ``a watershed event.
The company is becoming more proactive, more aggressive than in
years past.''
</P>
<P>
   But little of that aggressiveness is reflected in the stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   Through 1999, BellSouth stock has been unspectacular, seesawing
between $40 and $51. In contrast, during each of the two years
before, BellSouth stock grew by more than 60 percent in value. Over
three years, BellSouth is up 147 percent, Forsee said. ``That
record speaks loud and clear about our financial performance.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of brokerage houses have recommended buying BellSouth
stock, predicting that shares will rise. Most optimistic is Lehman
Bros., which sets a target price of $61. Maybe BellSouth stock this
year might be suffering by comparison with the market's high-flying
Internet plays, as many investors look for a quick return.
</P>
<P>
   But some telecom stocks have also outpaced BellSouth. AT&AMP;T,
which had slid through the summer, climbed steadily from $41.75 on
Oct. 1 to a high of $60 before pulling back to the mid $50s. In
that same period, U S West, which is merging with Qwest
Communications, has seen its stock climb from about $57 to more
than $70. MCI WorldCom, which outbid BellSouth for Sprint, saw its
stock rise from about $68 to $92, although it slid back to the
mid-$70s.
</P>
<P>
   Some of BellSouth's telecom rivals have also seen erratic
treatment from investors. SBC dropped from $59 in July to $44.25 in
October before rallying back above $50. Bell Atlantic stock has
swung back and forth between a $69.50 high in early October and a
$62 low, closing Tuesday at $65.06 1/4 a share.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock had been slowly climbing, rising from below $42
a share in October to $47 before the KPN deal was unveiled. Yet a
series of massive industry combinations has left BellSouth the last
of the seven regional Bells with no major partnership pact. The bid
for Sprint might have reinforced the anticipation of investors that
something big will happen, Burks said. ``They have raised the bar
of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Marc Bacurin of JC Bradford said BellSouth might have
been caught up in its own excitement, forgetting that the payoff _
when BellSouth gets stock in KPN _ will not come for at least 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take doing the conversion to see the stock value
reflect that,'' he said. ``It's just unclear how much you could
read the value to be at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for BellSouth, some analysts believe the company's
bid for Sprint was an admission that it must make a dramatic move
to become much bigger _ and those analysts don't think gradual
expansion in Europe will fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet that within the next six months, we will have an
announcement involving BellSouth and one of those two companies,''
Bacurin said. ``The world is moving fast. They are going to have to
do something.''

 &HT;    Eagles' defense healthy, unlike last year
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As he prepared his team for last year's Division 1-AA
championship game against UMass, Georgia Southern coach Paul
Johnson knew his Eagles were on shaky ground defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy hitter Daryl Morrell, a sophomore linebacker, had
sustained a career-ending neck injury earlier in the playoffs.
Linebacker Dante Harrow was still slowed by the effects of a torn
knee ligament suffered in the fourth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   To worsen matters at linebacker, starter Larry Rogers had gone
out with a knee injury in the second playoff game, and the
separated shoulder of Josh Smithers limited his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The shaky ground on which Georgia Southern's defense stood gave
way as running back Marcel Shipp rushed for 244 yards and three
touchdowns to lead Massachusetts to a 55-43 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, when Georgia Southern (12-2) faces Youngstown State
(12-2) in both teams' quest for a fifth national title at
Chattanooga's Finley Stadium, Johnson hopes to trot out a defensive
unit capable of forcing the opposition to punt at least three
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as beat up and injured going into this championship
game as we were last year,'' Johnson said. ``But more than that, I
don't think it's any question that we've played better on the
defensive side of the ball. We've had a bunch of guys over there
who've stepped up and made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those guys are three linemen _ seniors Voncellies Allen
and Eugene Phillips and redshirt freshman Fred Pesqueira _ who have
combined for 55 tackles behind the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   At linebacker, sophomore Jason Neese out of McEachern High has
98 tackles, while redshirt freshman Michael Ward has 72. The other
backers are sophomore Jamar Jones of Douglasville, a healthy Harrow
and sophomore Corey Middlebrooks of Riverdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've definitely got better athletes out there than we had a
year ago,'' Johnson said. ``I mean, guys who can run, and are
capable of making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in the Eagles' previous two wins _ 38-21 over
UMass and 28-17 victory over Gateway Athletic Conference champion
Illinois State. Take away the 10 points Illinois State scored on
turnovers in Georgia Southern's territory, and the defense the past
two weekends has limited opponents to two touchdowns a game.
</P>
<P>
   The statistic that most impresses Johnson involves the
opposition's rushing. In the rematch against UMass, Shipp and his
teammates were limited to 81 yards on the ground. The Eagles'
defense cut that down to 69 yards against Illinois State.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy in coaching, which is probably dinosaur today,
is that to win football games you have to be able to run the ball,
and you have to be able to stop the run,'' said Johnson. ``There
might be some exceptions somewhere along the line, but it's been my
experience that if you do those two things, you usually win the
football game.''

 &HT;    Samaranch prepares for House grilling
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch faces his accusers today armed with a reform
package he hopes will deflect any further criticism and protect his
beloved Olympics from Congress' heavy hand.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. lawmakers have no authority over the Olympic movement, but
have held two hearings and have threatened to cut off the flow of
television and sponsorship revenues to the IOC. Such a move would
be a deadly blow to the Olympics, which is bankrolled by U.S.
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House Commerce
subcommittee studying the Olympic site selection process and
considering legislation to revoke tax-exempt status for Olympic
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic chiefs Billy Payne and Andy Young testified
before the same panel in October. Samaranch postponed his
appearance until he felt he could convince lawmakers that the IOC
has enacted substantial reforms.
</P>
<P>
   At the earlier hearing, there was widespread bipartisan
criticism of the bid cities that lavish expensive gifts and favors
on the IOC members whose primary function is voting for future
Olympic sites.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms were prompted by the Salt Lake City and Atlanta bid
scandals that have battered the IOC's reputation and credibility.
In the past year, the IOC has ousted 10 members implicated in the
Salt Lake City affair, set up a quasi-independent ethics
commission, published its financial accounts and opened its
sessions to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we promised,'' Samaranch said before heading for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniard is expected to testify with the aid of an
interpreter, even though he speaks fluent English. Some of his
loyalists on the IOC expect a grilling from the panel _ an event
they deem unfair and beneath the dignity of Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers could ask Samaranch about his political role during
the Franco regime and the $12,000 trip his wife and friends made to
Charleston, S.C., and Savannah in 1990 at the expense of Atlanta's
Olympic bid team.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch will be followed by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, former Senate majority leader George Mitchell and Sen.
Howard Baker. Kissinger headed the IOC 2000 reform panel that
drafted the reforms; Baker serves on the new ethics commission.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the IOC has voted to give up their life terms and
lavish perks, many members think Congress should leave them alone
and take action against bidders in Salt Lake City and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two to tango,'' said Peru's Ivan Dibos. ``I would
like it if the commission of the U.S. Congress punished the people
in its country that got us involved in this whole affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibos is the member who accepted Atlanta's gift of a used MARTA
bus and who hoped to get another 50 promised on the eve of the vote
in Tokyo for the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Mendoza of Colombia says he considers bid city
representatives as ``no longer respectable people for my family.
It's as if they were lepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza made two trips to Georgia _ one more than alloted under
IOC rules at the time.Melissa Turner writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga. The Associated Press contributed
to this report.

 &HT;    Nigerian to bring physical presence
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For those NHL talent scouts who might have missed this
on the usual Red Deer-Moose Jaw-Medicine Hat road swing, we offer
this travel primer:
</P>
<P>
   Zaria, Nigeria, was the capital city of the ancient kingdom of
Zazzau and was named after the daughter of a ruler near the end of
the 15th century. The town lies at the intersection of roads from
Kaduna, Jos, Kano and Funtua. Or, if you're not driving, Zaria is
conveniently located at the rail junction between Nguru and Lagos.
Just in case you're also looking at a goalie in Nguru.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many people back there know about hockey,''
Rumun Ndur said, laughing. ``I don't think I'd see too many skating
rinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumun Ndur (pronounced ROO-muhn EN-dur) was claimed on waivers
Saturday by the Thrashers from the New York Rangers. He is a
6-foot-2, 222-pound defenseman whom coach Curt Fraser hopes will
add a physical presence on defense. Ndur is one of 15 black players
in the NHL and certainly the only one that comes from Nigeria _
though he didn't hang around long enough to develop an accent.
</P>
<P>
   Other than his name, Ndur is as Canadian as back bacon. His
father, a pediatrician, sought a better life for his family in 1976
and moved with his wife and son to Toronto in 1976. At the time,
Ndur was 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come to North America, and it was between Austin,
Texas, and Toronto,'' Ndur said. ``If we moved to Austin, there's
no way I'd be sitting here talking to you in a hockey uniform. It
just worked out that I grew up like every other Canadian kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndur might have ended up in Texas but the Ndurs ran into
problems obtaining visas for the U.S. So came their Northern
Exposure. Five years in Toronto, then even further north to Hearst,
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask people in Canada and even they don't know where Hearst
is,'' Ndur said. ``The only thing to do up there is play hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The blacks he has seen in the NHL are about a dozen or so more
than he saw growing up. ``It's actually gotten a lot better,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few incidents of racial slurs in the NHL in
recent years, but Ndur said, ``Since I've been in the pros, nothing
really (has been said to me). Growing up, maybe a couple of times.
But we were just kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndur allows that he might have been more of a target if he
didn't grow up in Canada. ``My parents speak with a thick accent,
but I don't have it,'' he said. ``It wasn't like I came in and
couldn't speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 24, he is trying to blend into the NHL landscape. He was
drafted by Buffalo in the third round in 1994, and played most of
three years with the Sabres' AHL team in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Finesse is not his game. In games from 1995-98, Ndur totaled
eight goals, 35 assists and 799 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He played only eight games for the Sabres before being waived
last December and claimed by the Rangers. On the last year of his
contract, Ndur felt he played well for the team down the stretch.
But he ran into problems in negotiations when he sought a one-year
and/or one-way contract, which pays an NHL salary, even if the
player is sent to the minors. New York offered a two-year, two-way
deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a month into the season before Ndur signed _ at the
Rangers' terms: a prorated salary of $365,000 this year and
$400,000 next, but only $50,000 in the minors. Ndur agreed to a
two-week conditioning stint with Hartford (AHL), but the Rangers
then had to make a decision to keep him or pass him through waivers
before sending him back to Hartford. They chose the latter, but
Ndur didn't clear _ the Thrashers plucked him.
</P>
<P>
   Ndur said, ``It feels good to be wanted again.'' He had hoped to
land here in the expansion draft but the Rangers had him on their
protected list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to have a fresh start,'' he said.

FRIENDS AND FOES AGREE: NEAR LOSS IN '90 WAS PIVOTAL EVENT FOR
BRADLEY
</HEADLINE>
   (jt) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It once seemed that the word failure was not a part
of Bill Bradley's lexicon. He had been a Rhodes Scholar, Olympic
gold medalist, two-time NBA champion and, on his first foray into
politics in 1978, the winner of a Senate seat from New Jersey. In
1984, during the Reagan landslide, he won re-election in a lark.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1990, when Bradley came within 3 percentage points of
losing his once safe bastion to an unknown, poorly financed
Republican named Christie Whitman, he was devastated. For weeks, he
wandered the state in a sullen funk, asking friends what had gone
wrong. Over coffee, Michael J. Breslin, a Hackensack, N.J., lawyer,
summed it up for him in one word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `the public thought you were arrogant,''' Breslin
recalled, referring to voters' anger with Bradley for not taking a
position on a $2.8 billion state tax increase that year. ``He
looked at me as if he was startled. Because he can't stand arrogant
people. I said, `Nobody's told you that?' And he said, `No, you're
the first guy to mention that word, arrogant.'''
</P>
<P>
   To many of his critics and supporters alike, the disastrous 1990
campaign _ both sides use the adjective _ represents the most
important event in Bradley's political life. Almost no one had
expected the race to be close, Bradley had widely been touted as
presidential contender and he outspent Whitman by 12-to-1. Yet he
nearly lost.
</P>
<P>
   The election he later called ``a terrible blow'' shook his
confidence in himself and his staff, triggering an intense bout of
introspection that helped change the course of his career, Bradley
and his friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, he revamped his Washington staff and cut his ties
with some of his oldest political advisers. He removed his name
from the list of 1992 presidential contenders. His interest in the
Senate waned, and he began work on a memoir, ``Time Present, Time
Past,'' that eventually consumed more of his time than legislating.
By 1995, he had decided to retire, announcing in a now famous
speech that ``politics is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after two lucrative years of consulting, teaching and
lecturing, Bradley returned to the political arena as a candidate
for the Democratic presidential nomination. Yet as much as ever,
the 1990 race continues to color his view of politics, and his
critics' views of him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Bradley says, he relied too much on expensive pollsters
and consultants who failed to notice the electorate's fury. ``The
lesson of 1990,'' he said recently, ``is you can have too much
money in a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the race also helped him understand the importance of
listening more directly to voters, of speaking from his heart and
not worrying about the advice of handlers, of being bold. All are
lessons he claims to have incorporated into his current race, where
he has campaigned against conventional politics and made campaign
finance reform a central issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never be where he is today if not for 1990,'' said
Michael Kaye, Bradley's media adviser in 1990. ``He had to fail. To
see that that could happen, and that he could be humiliated. And I
think 1990 totally liberated him. He said to himself, `From this
point on, I'm going to do it the way I want to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans say they took a somewhat different lesson from
1990. To them, Bradley's refusal to distance himself from Gov. Jim
Florio's tax plan _ the issue Whitman built her campaign around _
simply proved that he was too aloof to understand the anger of
average voters and too regimented to adjust when he finally did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting him to blow me out of the water any day, which
he could have done with just a couple of sentences distancing
himself from that tax hike,'' said Whitman, who is now in her
second term as New Jersey's governor. ``But the fact that he didn't
became a bigger issue. If you are going to represent the people of
New Jersey, you have to respond to their concerns, you have to
listen to them. He just never responded.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The impression I got was that once he locks onto a
game plan, he won't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Whitman entered the Senate race in January 1990, the
campaign really began in March, when Florio, a first-term Democrat,
unveiled his plan to close a yawning state budget gap with a $2.8
billion tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, coming in the midst of a spreading economic
downturn, touched off a storm of protests. Angry homeowners rallied
outside the statehouse, ``Impeach Florio'' bumper stickers spread
like brush fire and radio talk shows devoted hours to railing
against the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Florio released his proposal, Whitman's campaign
strategists had mapped out a plan for attacking Bradley as an
out-of-touch Washington insider more concerned about global affairs
and presidential politics than his home state. The tax plan
provided more fodder than they ever had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Whitman began demanding that Bradley take a
position on the tax increase, which was in the news almost daily as
Florio pushed it through the legislature. To their delight, he
refused time and time again, saying that it was a state issue that
had no place in a U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this self-styled tax expert to say, `I have an opinion but
I'm not going to say it, I'm not going to tell you,' well, people
thought that was unbelievably arrogant,'' said Willliam Palatucci,
a New Jersey lawyer who was Whitman's principal political
consultant then.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the tax issue raised some very difficult political
and personal problems. His aides say he really believed that it was
improper for him to weigh in on a state issue, even though he told
them privately that he thought the tax increase was ``too much, too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, Bradley felt deep loyalty to Florio, who had
bucked Democratic Party leaders by supporting Bradley in 1978 over
the state organization's favored Senate candidate. ``Some people
said we had to answer these Florio questions,'' said Bob McHugh,
Bradley's campaign press secretary at the time. ``But Bradley just
wasn't going to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one of Bradley's closest political advisers, Douglas
Berman, his 1984 campaign manager, was Florio's state treasurer and
an architect of the tax increase. It would have been hard for
Bradley to criticize the plan without appearing to repudiate his
old friend, now the chief strategist for Bradley's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a number of relatively inexperienced consultants
were running Bradley's 1990 campaign instead of Berman was an
indication to many people that Bradley was not too worried about
Whitman. Nicholas Donatiello, Bradley's 30-year-old Senate press
secretary, was the manager, though he had never run a campaign
before. Kaye, the media consultant, spent much of the year in Santa
Fe, N.M., and Los Angeles. And Joseph Peritz, a pollster, was a
specialist in consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a campaign people were anxious to run, because
expectations were sky high,'' Donatiello said in a recent
interview. ``You couldn't beat 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bradley's friends also say he seemed to be more
interested in the 1992 presidential campaign than in his
re-election. Leading up to the 1990 campaign, he had spent $1
million on polling voters around the country and buying computer
equipment to analyze the data. He also raised much of his $12
million Senate war chest outside of New Jersey, particularly in
California, an indication that he was trying to create a national
base of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   All of those things fit neatly into Whitman's line of attack.
Yet by the fall, polls showed Bradley still leading her by 20
points or more. So his advisers maintained their cautious strategy
of refusing to engage Whitman and running positive advertisements
about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Optional material)
</P>
<P>
   But even those commercials seemed to fall flat. One spot
featured Bradley in his Senate office, kicking his sneaker-clad
feet up onto his desk; another showed him sinking a basketball shot
before cheering students. In both cases, the ads seemed oddly out
of sync with the bad mood of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked frivolous,'' Kaye said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also often seemed slow or ineffective at responding to
Whitman's repeated thrusts on issues, ranging from his campaign
contributions to his environmental record. When she challenged him
to take a position on flag burning, he spent two weeks studying the
matter before announcing that he considered it a constitutional
right.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional material)
</P>
<P>
   By the last two weeks of the campaign, Bradley, who had been in
Washington for Senate votes during much of the fall, finally
returned home for full-time campaigning. For the first time, he
heard voters' anger in person. Soon after, his campaign ran its
first negative ad against Whitman, accusing her of supporting taxes
as a Somerset County freeholder. He defended the ad with a line he
still uses today, ``Get an elbow, give an elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, Bradley did little to alter his strategy
down the stretch. Yet more and more voters were switching their
allegiances to Whitman every day, and Bradley had no knowledge of
it. His own campaign had stopped doing tracking polls in October,
confident that their big lead would hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing, but no one smelled the coffee,'' McHugh said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Following the election, Bradley became withdrawn, his friends
and former aides say. He blamed his advisers, himself and even
voters. ``For many months to come,'' he wrote in ``Time Present,
Time Past'' (Knopf, 1996), ``I looked at each person who approached
me as if he or she had voted against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, as his disappointment lifted, he came to look at the
1990 election as ``the best thing that ever happened in my
political career,'' he wrote in his memoirs. ``It forced me to face
up to what I needed to change, both organizationally and
personally. It forced me to go deeper into my emotions and to speak
from values and convictions in ways I had avoided before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's friends say they think Bradley has become more playful
and unbuttoned now as a result of 1990, doing little things like
grabbing the glasses off Larry King's face or asking Sam Donaldson
whether he ever smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But some also wonder whether he completely understands what
happened in 1990, and whether he has accepted his own role in his
poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt betrayed,'' said one friend. ``And he blamed everyone.
He saw how vulnerable he was to people giving him advice. I felt
bad for him because I saw how wounded he was. But in the end, he's
the boss. They gave him bad advice, but he's the one who took it.''

SUIT CHARGES HMO KEPT EXCESS COPAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, New England's largest HMO,
has a new worry.
</P>
<P>
   On top of projected $100 million losses this year and
controversy over a state-guaranteed bond issue to raise needed
capital, a class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in US District Court
alleges that Harvard Pilgrim has been ``secretly'' pocketing the
profit when prescriptions cost the HMO less than the $5 copayment
it charges subscribers for common generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're alleging that for many commonly prescribed drugs, such
as penicillin, Harvard Pilgrim is only paying approx $3 per
prescription, not counting further volume discounts, but it's
charging a $5 copayment,'' said Fredric L. Ellis, a Boston lawyer
who filed the suit on behalf of two Harvard Pilgrim members.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO, he said, ``has misrepresented to consumers that they
are making a copayment on a prescription and that health insurance
is covering the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMO's chief spokesman, Alan Raymond, called the charge
``inflammatory and inaccurate'' and countered that Ellis and his
clients have ``a fundamental misunderstanding of how things work.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond said Harvard Pilgrim's policy is to charge the
subscriber less than the $5 copayment if the pharmacist's ``usual
and customary charge,'' or the standard retail price, is less than
$5. He said that does occur in practice, both within the larger
Harvard Pilgrim network of independent drug stores and at
Harvard-Vanguard Health Center pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Raymond said the HMO does not pass on all the savings
from its drug discounts because it uses those savings to subsidize
losses on more expensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing fraudulent going on. That's the nature of
insurance,'' Raymond said. ``They're saying we should pass along
all the savings but none of the extra costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said Harvard Pilgrim subscribers should pay no more than
the discounted price that the HMO enjoys on many common drugs _ not
the retail price for those drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been secretly profiting from their $5 copayments
that most members pay for Rx drugs,'' Ellis said. His clients are
seeking return of ``millions of dollars because we believe this has
gone on for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a legal brief filed Tuesday with US District Court
Judge Patti B. Saris, at least 11 commonly prescribed generic drugs
cost Harvard Pilgrim approximately $3 for a 30-day supply. These
drugs include penicillin, the antibiotic amoxicillin, the
antidepressant amitriptylin, the antifungal medicine nystatin, and
the high blood pressure medicine atenolol.
</P>
<P>
   The named plaintiffs in the suit are two Harvard-Vanguard
subscribers, James Alves of Mattapoisett and Hillel Stavis of
Cambridge. Neither of them was available Tuesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said the suit originated from a doctor's report that
Harvard Pilgrim officials were urging his physician group to
prescribe drugs that cost less than the $5 copayment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allege that they have met with their groups of doctors and
urged them to prescribe `for-profit drugs,' the ones they make a
profit on,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond said there is nothing wrong with urging physicians to
prescribe lower-cost drugs. ``Like everyone else, Harvard Pilgrim
is trying to bring costs down,'' the HMO spokesman said. ``If part
of that is providing information to pharmacists and physicians,
that's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, a prominent
critic of HMOs, said the lawsuit raises ``a legitimate issue, no
question about it.'' But Galvin also worried that the suit comes at
a bad time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern I have is that in their current fragile situation,
I'm not sure Harvard Pilgrim can withstand a class-action suit,''
Galvin said. ``With all the problems I have with Harvard Pilgrim, I
think it's important for them to remain alive. But this points up
the need for more regulation of the operations of HMOs in
general.''

PAUL CADMUS, ARTIST WHOSE WORK SPANNED 70 YEARS, DEAD AT 94 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Ohio) (rk) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Cadmus, an American artist noted for a virtuosic figurative
style that he applied to subjects ranging from biting social satire
to moralizing allegories to sensual, sometimes sentimental male
nudes, died on Sunday at his home in Weston, Conn. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Cadmus found his inspiration in the art of Italian Renaissance
painters like Mantegna and Luca Signorelli. His career was
remarkable for its unruffled stylistic consistency over 70 years,
from his days as a precocious student in New York in the 1920s
through his incendiary stint in the 1930s with the federal Public
Works of Art Project, later folded into the Works Progress
Administration, and up to the present. Although he stopped painting
a few years ago, he continued to sketch until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a slow, meticulous worker who favored the
complicated, time-consuming medium of egg tempera, he finished an
average of only two paintings a year. He was, however, more
prolific in other forms, including drawing, printmaking and, early
on, photography.
</P>
<P>
   His narrative subject matter _ he proudly referred to himself as
a ``literary painter'' _ and his near-illustrational style, which
often veered between grotesque caricature and high-pitched
melodrama, fell out of favor with the art establishment during and
after the rise of Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s. But by that
time Cadmus had already achieved more than one widely publicized
succes de scandale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, when he was employed by the Public Works of Art
Project, his painting ``The Fleet's In,'' depicting uniformed
sailors, prostitutes and a homosexual pickup in progress was
included in an exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.
Outraged officials from the Navy saw a newspaper reproduction of
the painting and pulled the work from the exhibition. It was kept
from view until 1981 and is now temporarily on view at the
Wolfsonian Museum in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   More agitation followed. When Cadmus' cartoonish, Bruegelian
``Coney Island'' appeared at the Whitney Museum of American Art in
1935, Brooklyn realtors threatened to file a civil suit to protest
what they perceived as a slur on the neighborhood. And the sardonic
scenes of suburban life that the artist sketched out for post
office murals in Port Washington, N.Y., in 1936 resulted in the
cancellation of the original commission. (It was carried out in
easel painting format.)
</P>
<P>
   Cadmus, who was personally unconfrontational, went into retreat
in the wake of these controversies. But the public was fascinated:
his first one-man show in New York, at Midtown Galleries in
Manhattan in 1937, attracted more than 7,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cadmus was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Dec.
17, 1904. His father, who had little money, was a commercial
lithographer who had studied with Robert Henri; his mother was an
illustrator of children's books. At 15, before he finished high
school, he was enrolled in art classes at the National Academy of
Design. Within two years he was admitted to the life drawing
classes and by 1926 had completed his course work, having won
numerous prizes and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   He took jobs in advertising until 1931, while continuing his
studies at the Art Students League. There he met painter Jared
French, who encouraged him to abandon commercial art. The two
artists became lovers and traveled together to Europe, staying on
the island of Majorca, where Cadmus executed two of his best-known
early pieces, ``Shore Leave'' and ``YMCA Locker Room,'' raucous,
mock-classical tableaux vivants that anticipate ``The Fleet's In.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadmus returned to the United States in 1933 and was soon hired
by the Public Works of Art Project. After the furor that greeted
his work in the 1930s, interest in him quieted down and his
conservative, anti-modernist style _ ``I have never been part of
any avant-garde,'' he said _ left him all but invisible in the
postwar art world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he continued to produce work at a steady pace and was part
of a cosmopolitan circle of writers, artists, musicians and
choreographers whom he considered colleagues and friends. They
included Christopher Isherwood, W.H. Auden, Donald Windham, George
Balanchine, George Platt Lynes, George Tooker, Lincoln Kirstein
(the husband of Cadmus' sister, Fidelma), and E.M. Forster who, the
story goes, read his homoerotic novel ``Maurice'' aloud to Cadmus
while the artist was painting his portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cadmus' work is in the collections of most major
American museums, he has received scant institutional attention in
terms of solo exhibitions. He was included in a handful of
important group shows, among them ``American Realists and Magic
Realists'' at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, but has been the
focus of only a few one-person museum showcases. His cycle of
paintings titled ``Seven Deadly Sins'' was exhibited at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1995; his ``Sailor'' series at the
Whitney Museum of American Art in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A career retrospective was organized in 1981 by the Miami
University Art Museum in Ohio; It traveled to the Hudson River
Museum in Yonkers, N.Y. An exhibition titled ``Men Without Women:
Paul Cadmus as Curator'' appeared at the National Academy of Design
last summer. He was elected an academician of the National Academy
in 1980 and a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts
and Letters in 1974. This year received the first annual
international arts award from Pridefest America, an annual gay
cultural festival, in Philadelphia. His work is represented by D.C.
Moore Gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Cadmus was, at the time of his death, a senior exemplar of a
vital, if submerged, academic realist tradition in American
painting, one that has meandered in various guises from Thomas
Eakins to Ivan Albright and Reginald Marsh and has resurfaced, yet
again transformed, in the work of younger painters today.
</P>
<P>
   But Cadmus, with his cordial personality and handsome features
sustained into old age, wore his Old Master status with aplomb.
When he was photographed by Bruce Weber for Italian Vogue in 1996 _
his eyes bright, his skin clear and his silver hair long _ he
easily held his own among the youthful models who surrounded him.
When complimented on his well-preserved appearance he gave full
credit ``to Mother Nature and Father Time.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Jon Anderson, who was the model
for many of his most serene figurative studies.

JUDGE RULES TRIPP NOT PROTECTED IN TAPING OF LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time they publicly spoke to each other,
Linda R. Tripp was playing out the final act of a betrayal for the
ages, luring Monica S. Lewinsky into a trap that would snare the
former White House intern in scandal and forever mark President
Clinton's place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lewinsky may exact some revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years after Tripp handed federal prosecutors the
infamous audiotapes of Lewinsky confiding her sexual affair with
Clinton, Tripp is caught in a legal vise, fighting charges that she
criminally recorded her phone conversations with her former friend.
</P>
<P>
   And Lewinsky is poised to help Maryland prosecutors seek
convictions that could land Tripp in prison for as long as 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that clears the way for Lewinsky's possible testimony,
a state circuit court judge Tuesday ruled that Tripp was not
protected by an immunity agreement when she gave independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr tapes of her secretly recorded phone
conversations with Lewinsky in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawyers argued that she gave Starr the tapes on the
condition that she would not be prosecuted for recording them. She
faces two counts of breaking a Maryland wiretap law that prohibits
recording telephone conversations without the consent of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for Mrs. Tripp,'' Howard County Judge Diane O.
Leasure said in her ruling, Tripp's immunity deal did not take
effect until a federal judge signed it on Feb. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a nation weary of the Lewinsky saga may face
another chapter repelete with the intimate details of the former
intern's illicit liaisons with Clinton. It was the Tripp tapes that
effectively launched Clinton's impeachment odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lewinsky is on the prosecution's witness list for a
pretrial hearing this week, lawyers said she is unlikely to appear
in court before the trial begins Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, too, has been absent from the pretrial proceedings.
However, she has used her Web site to portray her prosecution as
the product of a vengeful White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for me, they have been able to ensure that retribution is
full and long lasting,'' Tripp said in a message she posted Monday
on her Web site. She claimed that the Clinton administration has
deliberately scaled back her duties at the Pentagon and ``caused me
to amass hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal debt.''
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli, testified Tuesday
that he helped to build his case against Tripp with her own words.
He quoted Tripp as telling her weekly bridge club that she had
recorded her conversations with a woman named ``Monica,'' but that
she did not fear criminal charges ``because no one ever gets
prosecuted'' under the wiretap law.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Tripp recorded Lewinsky's words, she hinted at the
prospect of enmeshing Lewinsky in her plan to expose Clinton's
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm sticking a knife in your back,'' Tripp told
Lewinsky in a taped phone call. ``I know at the end of this, if I
have to go forward, you will never speak to me again and I will
lose a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp had that thought right. When a grand juror asked Lewinsky
last year how she felt about Tripp, she said, ``I hate her.''

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ From New York to Nashua, Bill Bradley and Al Gore
battled over health care, campaign finance and gays in the military
Tuesday, with each candidate aggressively taking on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in vote-rich southern New Hampshire, Gore told a
group of local doctors, patients, and health-care providers that he
would never criticize Bradley personally, but that his health-care
plan falls short of what the American people deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man,'' Gore said. ``He's a good man with a bad
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``Good Morning America,'' Bradley said Gore has
been misrepresenting his proposal to replace Medicaid with
subsidies for private insurance. ``People are fed up with
politicians who know the truth but only tell a part of it,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the former New Jersey senator is spending his week
talking about the need for campaign finance reform and questioning
the vice president's commitment to overhauling the law. On
Thursday, Bradley and Republican Senator John McCain will meet in
Claremont to re-create the famous handshake between President
Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich agreeing to support
a ban on soft money in elections. (No such ban has been enacted.)
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Fordham University Tuesday, Bradley said Gore
``is wedded to the ways of Washington. He talks about his support
for reform, but does little to advance it. On the campaign trail he
pays lip service to reform, but that's all he pays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley noted that when Gore announced his candidacy for
president, he delivered a 2,836-word speech. But, Bradley said, he
never uttered three words: campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, said it is Bradley who is
a latecomer to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is Bill Bradley waited 6,219 days after joining the
Senate to author a campaign finance reform bill,'' Lehane said.
``Compare that to Al Gore who was elected in 1978 and by 1979 was
co-sponsoring legislation on campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore received an assist from McCain on the subject. While
campaigning in Charleston, S.C., the Arizona senator said his own
interest in the joint New Hampshire appearance with Bradley was
``made up of long-standing convictions.'' But Bradley's, McCain
said, ``may be based partly on attacking Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this week marks a turning point for Bradley and his
campaign. After being pounded by Gore and his surrogates on the
issues for more than a month, Bradley is beginning to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bradley said it is ``dismaying'' to see Gore question
his commitment to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He said
Gore is only interested in tinkering around the edges of big
problems, instead of tackling them head-on.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, Bradley's campaign has begun issuing
critiques of Gore to the press, tagging him on campaign finance,
off-shore drilling and his ``lack of leadership'' on fighting for
the right of gays to serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said
Gore decided to abandon the administration's ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the armed services because of political
rather than principled considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his opposition were so strong, why did he wait until
December to declare publicly that his views had changed?'' Hauser
asked. ``Why did he wait until well after Bill Bradley called for
an end to the policy and the president and Hillary Clinton
acknowledged its failure?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Bradley campaign's criticism that he did
not show leadership on the subject, Gore said, ``Actually, I've
held that view for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the policy was adopted, I argued for it to be implemented
as well as possible. I think the evidence clearly shows it has
failed and I think it should be changed,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston Tuesday, Bradley relied on political allies to
underscore his criticisms of Gore as a latecomer to campaign
finance reform and as untruthful in his attacks on Bradley's health
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Gore is certainly misrepresenting Bill Bradley's
health care plan,'' said Jim Shannon, the former Massachusetts
congressman and a co-chair for Bradley in the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has clearly made a decision,'' said George Miller, the
California congressman. ``He is going to try to scare poeple, and
he is going to deliberately misrepresent Bradley's plan. That's a
cornerstone of their campaign.''

TREASURY YIELDS CLIMB AMID NEW INFLATION CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury yields rose sharply Tuesday as investors
chose to ignore November's moderate consumer price data and instead
focused on stronger-than-expected retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has said it will raise interest rates again
if there is evidence of continuing strong growth, even if the
inflation rate remains tame. For that reason, Treasuries had their
biggest decline in months Tuesday as investors grew concerned that
the central bank would indeed raise rates to try to brake the
economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 11/32,
to 97 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
the price, increased to 6.30 percent from 6.20 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in the yield of the long bond was the largest since
August, as buyers moved to the sidelines amid concern that strong
holiday retail sales would bolster fourth-quarter growth and help
build inflationary pressure, increasing the odds that the Fed would
soon raise rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clues of budding wage pressures and potential labor strife are
beginning to build,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at
Chase Asset Management, ``and with gas prices at the pump
continuing to rise amid surging economic growth, the specter of
rising inflationary expectations down the pike is very likely to
translate into higher bond yields.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine said these concerns had not gone unnoticed by the Fed.
While the central bank is expected to leave short-term rates alone
at its next policy meeting Dec. 21 to avoid rocking the boat during
the Year 2000 transition period, he said, another increase is
expected during the first quarter unless there is evidence of a
slackening economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, long-term interest rates could come under pressure
as the year unfolds, and could weaken stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries fell Tuesday after the Commerce Department reported
that retail sales rose 0.9 percent in November. Combined with
upward revisions in previous months and reports of stellar
Christmas shopping nationwide, the report suggested that consumer
spending remained extremely strong.
</P>
<P>
   Also leading the bond selloff were investors' liquidation of
their long positions before the end of the year. Although such
selling was relatively small in size, such volume allowed it to
cause large swings in prices, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cooper, chief economist for Nesbitt Burns Securities,
said early reports suggested no let-up in personal spending in
December. ``The trend in consumer spending remains too hot for the
bond market's liking,'' she said. ``Retailers have entered the
critical Christmas shopping season with considerable momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Ms. Cooper added, ``is that on balance, the
pervasive strength in retail sales outweighs the good news on the
CPI for bonds, but the mix of a strong consumer and still-tame
inflation is positive for stocks.''

CROSSING BACK TO GOOD OL' COUNTRY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Country music, almost by definition, exists in a convoluted,
almost duplicitous relationship with its history. It's both a
thoroughly reactionary form of cultural Kabuki, making elaborate
bows to the past, and an intensely marketed reinvention, skittering
wildly after the demographic or musical fashions of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Even by country's standards, Nashville finds itself in a
particularly conflicted moment. It is spawning bigger stars with
more mainstream appeal, selling more albums than was imaginable
just a few years ago. Its most successful stars, like Garth Brooks,
Shania Twain and Faith Hill, are mass-marketed pop culture figures
in a way that would have been unthinkable in the past, and the big
Nashville labels are falling over themselves to come up with the
next crossover blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   True, Nashville's other big breakthrough act, the Dixie Chicks,
has developed an intriguing hybrid _ half banjo, fiddle and twang,
half hip chick marketing. But no one doubts that the serious money
is in the ``Friends'' demographic, not ``Hee Haw'''s, so without
the sexiness, the twang will take you only so far.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as if obligated to provide yin to the crossover yang,
there is suddenly a gaggle of performers, ranging from huge stars
to niche artists, competing to out-retro one another, not just
re-interpreting the past but assiduously digging up old bones. And
amid the crossover fever, there's now a backlash boomlet, not just
of traditional music, but of revivals of classic songs. Just as
authentic country music seems on the verge of finally expiring, the
ghosts are ambling around all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this constitutes a revival, a calculated
marketing move or a nostalgic bow to the past. And the answer is _
yes. The most conspicuous of the bows to the past is Alan Jackson's
``Under the Influence,'' (Arista 07822-18892-2) which finds him not
just under the influence of Merle Haggard, George Jones, Charley
Pride, Johnny Paycheck et al. but redoing their songs. It makes
sense. Jackson has been the most self-consciously traditional of
the new breed of Nashville success stories. If Garth tried this, it
would exceed even his usual chutzpah quotient.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Jackson it rings true, especially since the songs, a
mix of the familiar and the obscure, seem, for the most part, to
come from Jackson's vision, not from some formula. And the best of
it, the rollicking drinking song ``Pop a Top'' or Hank Williams
Jr.'s ``Blues Man'' clearly comes from the heart, not the head.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how much the world needs Jackson or anyone else
to redo classic George Jones or Merle Haggard songs, especially
when the originals are still around to do them. And there's one
real stinker _ the totally superfluous duet with Jimmy Buffet on
``Margaritaville'' that sticks out as the one totally cynical note.
Jackson doesn't bring much new to the album, but the music is
affecting, the agenda seems genuine, and he could have done worse
than bring new fans to old country.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson's seems more dutiful than magical, Dolly Parton's
``Grass Is Blue'' (Sugar Hill 3900) takes traditional bluegrass and
makes it her own in an utterly luminous way. Bluegrass seems the
favored path for the current wave of retro excursions, as evidenced
by Steve Earle's collaboration with Del McCourey and Jim
Lauderdale's with Ralph Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   This one ranks with ``The Mountain'' by Earle as one of the most
riveting bluegrass albums in recent years, with truly inspired
playing and vocals that seem to come right from Ms. Parton's East
Tennessee roots without the adorable Nashville chirp. There are
some first-rate originals, classics like the Louvin Brothers ``Cash
on the Barrelhead,'' or Lester Flatt's ``I'm Gonna Sleep With One
Eye Open'' even Billy Joel's ``Travelin' Prayer,'' which somehow
sounds like something scavenged off an old Decca 78.
</P>
<P>
   The players include bluegrass aces like the dobro king Jerry
Douglas, Sam Bush on mandolin and Stuart Duncan on fiddle, and
Dolly's singing hasn't sounded as vital in years. She doesn't just
pay her respects to the ancient spirits _ she summons them up.
Dolly's taken a lot of calculated detours into pop-land, but when
she finally hangs it up, she'll look back on this and think it's
one she really got right.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum is LeAnn Rimes' royally
eponymous new album ``LeAnn Rimes'' (Curb D2-77947), a stunningly
crass attempt to sell country classics to the Back Street Boys and
'N Synch constituency. After her dazzling retro debut, ``Blue'' and
a pop foray, ``Sittin' on Top of the World,'' this is Ms. Rimes'
comeback album at 17.
</P>
<P>
   From the cavalcade of come hither, ``Teen Beats'' photos to the
completely predictable array of blockbuster classics like
``Crazy,'' `Your Cheatin' Heart'' and ``Lovesick Blues,'' this
album feels like an attempt to become the Britney Spears of
country. It's not that Ms. Rimes' big, preternaturally mature voice
isn't worthy. Instead, like a French-speaking dog or a
polka-dancing hog, Ms. Rimes shows off her big voice and country
roots to no point or affect whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   This is pop traditionalism of the silliest sort, veering from
Patsy Cline to a hyperventilating Janis Joplin turn without
bringing anything remotely new to the table. Indeed, the most
interesting song is the only new thing on the album, a rockish
``Big Deal'' written by Al Anderson, late of the rock group
N.R.B.Q., now a top Nashville songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to assume Don Walser won't play Ricky Martin to
LeAnn's Britney Spears. Walser, who took up music fulltime at the
age of 60 after a career in the Texas National Guard, dedicates
``Here's to Country Music'' (Watermelon 31074-2) to ``my children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.'' And if anyone deserves a
free ride on the retro express it's Walser, who combines the girth
of a retired Texas sheriff and the talents of a champion yodeler
and has become an unlikely cult hero.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If even ``Under the Influence'' seems an essentially
contemporary retro excursion, Walser's album feels like a
comfortably moldy visitation from a lost world. He yodels in fine
form on his own ``My Ride With Jimmie'' (Rodgers that is). He dusts
off old Marty Robbins and Floyd Tillman chestnuts. And when he says
in his notes for ``Oakie Boogie'' that ``I have been singing this
old song since the 1940s,'' you don't doubt it for a second.
</P>
<P>
   His own band sounds like it's been playing this stuff since the
days of Bob Wills, and the fiddler Buddy Spicher joins them for
some virtuoso turns. It's not for everyone, but it's the most
honest mossback music on the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as eccentric is John Prine's ``In Spite of Ourselves''
(Oh Boy OBR-019), a series of classic country duets. It recreates
not the glory days of George and Merle, but the world of George and
Tammy and Conway and Loretta in duets with both contemporary
singers like Lucinda Williams, Tricia Yearwood and Emmylou Harris
and names from the past like Connie Smith and Melba Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   You know there's a retro moment afoot when there are not one but
two remakes of the old weeper, ``We Could, You and I'' out there at
the same time, with Walser's with Crystal Gayle dueling with
Prine's with the peerless Iris DeMent. Prine's raspy jalopy of a
voice has its limits, and when he has to carry most of the load, he
sometimes falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   But the songs are mostly wonderful artifacts of country's
acutely grown-up take on the frustrations of love, and the notion
of duets provides an unexpected twist to the project, making it
more than just another resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   There's something admirable in contemporary country artists
taking time to show they respect to their elders _ or at least
their elders' musical traditions. But redoing the music of the '50s
and '60s _ or further back in Walser's case _ can only take you so
far, as if the Wallflowers or the Foo Fighters decided to crank out
redos of ``Satisfaction,'' `A Hard Day's Night,'' `Purple Haze''
and ``My Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The current retro rage is a reminder how enduring country's
traditions remain, even as the music's face is increasingly that of
some made-for video starlet. And there's something valuable in
having big names fly the flag for the real stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Ms. Parton's, these are more or less
worthy tributes that lead amiably backward when the real trick,
like the best of Jackson's work, for example, is to take the old
and make it new.
</P>
<P>
   And amid the gazillion-selling crossover acts, there are plenty
of examples of traditional music renewing itself in fresh ways.
They may just have to do most of it off the Nashville big label
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Pilgrim,'' (MCA 70057), Marty Stuart takes the country
canon apart and artfully puts it back together in 20 songs and
snatches of sound that touch almost all the diverse traditional
country streams. Along with Johnny Cash, George Jones, Earl
Scruggs, Ralph Stanley and other co-conspirators, he retells a true
story from his Mississippi youth in new songs that remind you where
all that hyperbolic country emotion comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Perfect World'' (Tornado TTX 011) by Ed Burleson is a
primal bit of Texas honky-tonk, which sounds as unaffected as the
kind of music you might hear at any roadside joint in the Texas
Panhandle. It's too small bore to be revelatory, but it is a
reminder that plenty of people are plowing new furrows in old
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Moon'' (HighTone HCD8111) by Buddy Miller, a protege of
Emmylou Harris, goes several steps further, taking disparate pieces
of honky-tonk, hillbilly, bluegrass and country and weaving them
together into a propulsive, stripped-down howl. It puts him right
up there with Steve Earle, Jim Lauderdale (both of whom wrote songs
and sang on ``Cruel Moon'') and the other essential voices creating
compelling hybrids from country's roots.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much howl but plenty of impeccable musicianship on
``New Grange,''(Compass 42802), an assemblage of top string-band
musicians including Alison Brown on banjo and Tim O'Brien on vocals
and various instruments.
</P>
<P>
   It mixes bluegrass with the Windham Hill world of tasteful
Americana and might be too arty for some traditionalists _ more
National Public Radio than Louisiana hayride. But it's an evocative
melding of modern and traditional musics and a reminder of how
relevant and adaptable an old form like bluegrass can be.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of others zigging and zagging around kindred,
rootsy orbits. They're a reminder that respectful bows to the past
have their place, but the real action exists in the quirky corners
somewhere between the pop frontier and the classics of twang.

<P>
   MIRAFLORES LOCKS, Panama _ With a choir singing ``Ode to Joy''
as the prelude, almost a century of U.S. power and presence along
the shores of the Panama Canal symbolically ended Tuesday when
former President Jimmy Carter exchanged diplomatic notes with
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso and said simply, ``It's
yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two words spoken at Tuesday's subdued celebration ushered
in a new era in Panamanian life, a journey that began in 1977 when
Carter and Gen. Omar Torrijos signed the two treaties to give
Panama full sovereignty and responsibility for the canal and to
give the two countries joint responsibility for guaranteeing its
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   President Moscoso pledged to meet the immense challenges that
came with the treaties, which she praised during the low-key midday
gathering as a model for resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the entire world I would like to say that the completion of
the Panama Canal Treaty is proof that mutual understanding between
peoples and diplomatic negotiations are the correct avenues for the
resolution of conflicts between nations,'' she said. ``Anything
else only produces pain and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The decades of U.S. presence had been marked with flare-ups,
from daily resentment of U.S. control of the canal and its
surrounding land to the nationalist riots in 1964 in which several
students died trying to fly the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Those clashes led the Panamanian government to temporarily break
off relations with the United States and prompted U.S. officials to
begin the process that resulted in the treaties, which officially
take effect at noon Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carter was greeted with applause when he arrived at the ceremony
with Ms. Moscoso and several other heads of state riding in one of
the gleaming new locomotives that are used to guide boats through
the passage.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Calling the treaties a passage to a new relationship, Carter
offered encouragement to both sides and voiced the hope that
cooperation would continue with investment as Panama began to
transform the military bases that the United States was giving up
into businesses that would benefit the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be part of the development of the canal,'' Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some tensions remain on both sides. Panamanian officials felt
slighted by the absence of President Clinton at this singular date
in their nation's history of close, if sometimes testy, relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And some U.S. politicians who never supported the canal's
transfer warn that the Panamanian government may endanger the
waterway's security through poor management and the awarding of
concessions to a Hong Kong port operating company.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that blended nationalistic pride with thanks to the
late Torrijos and Carter _ but not Clinton _ President Moscoso went
out of her way to respond to her nation's critics and reassure the
canal's customers.
</P>
<P>
   She touched upon most of the important aspects of the
modernization projects that will deepen and widen parts of the
route, as well as vowing to not rely on canal revenues to finance
unrelated government projects. Her objective, she said, was to
insure the uninterrupted and safe operation of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterate most strongly, that as of midday, December 31st,
the responsibility to administer the Panama Canal in a safe and
efficient manner will be solely the responsibility of the Republic
of Panama and will be accomplished without any interference or
interest of any political party,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As of to underscore those pledges, the area around the locks at
the Pacific entrance to the canal had been spruced up with fresh
paint and banners that proclaimed ``A Canal for the new
Millennium.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dignitaries gingerly walked in single file over the gates to the
control tower, where they were given a brief tour of the center
where the ships are guided into the canal and through the gates.
</P>
<P>
   As the audience waited for the dignitaries to return, two
announcers took to the podium and began a kind of scripted exchange
of canal factoids that seemed like the color commentary for the
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. There were even moments of
commercial name-dropping when they discussed the ``mules,'' as the
locomotives are known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential delegation arrived in one of the new mules
constructed by Mitsubishi of Japan,'' said one announcer.
</P>
<P>
   As the official acts began, a huge carrier slipped into one of
the locks, laden with cars. It slowly rose until the towering
letters on its side were at eye level with the audience: TOYOTA.
</P>
<P>
   Those names were probably better known to most Panamanians than
some of the 29 members of the U.S. delegation, which ranged from
Commerce Secretary William Daley and David Rockefeller, to Reps.
Gary Ackerman and Major Owens, both D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the ceremony, U.S. officials scrambled
to assemble a delegation, a proposition that was fraught with
concern for how it would play back in the United States, especially
during the presidential campaign, with conservatives still griping
about the handover.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some U.S. officials were miffed by what they
saw as a lack of gratitude inside Panama, where some people and a
few politicians stubbornly insist that the United States will never
completely give up control of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   President Moscoso did express her gratitude at least to Carter
but Roberto Eisenmann, one of her advisers, said that was not the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it is a question of `thank you,''' he said.
``Our relations with the United States were a love-hate
relationship. When you finally solve that, it is difficult to say
thank you. Fortunately, we are in a love stage.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that the United States invaded Panama a decade ago to
overthrow and arrest Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, he said, ``So
soon after an invasion, when our national psyche should be
affected, 70 percent of the Panamanian people are pro-Yankee. You
can only call that love.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were moments of contrast that echoed past
relations.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the ceremony, a singer performed a somewhat
mangled version of ``The Star Spangled Banner.'' Nonetheless, two
Americans in ties stood at attention with their hands over their
hearts while a nearby Panamanian canal worker in a jumpsuit kept
his arms crossed over his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Panamanian anthem was sung, ending in a crescendo of
blaring air horns from locomotives, and tugboats in the locks. Arcs
of water sprayed from fire hoses on the boats descended onto the
canal like a misty curtain that shrouded the hills, as a choir sang
the Alleluia Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   As the dignitaries went off to a celebratory banquet, Juan
Antonio Samudio stood in the sunny plaza dressed in the folkloric
costume of the countryside and holding a large Panamanian flag.
</P>
<P>
   This was the culmination of a personal journey for him: every
time the United States handed over a military base, he would walk
from his home with his flag and bear witness to the treaty's
unfolding events. Tuesday morning, he had stood outside the
entrance to the locks, barred from entering, he said, until
President Moscoso said he should be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important because were are seeing only the Panamanian
flag,'' he said. ``It will be only our flag that flies over the
canal.''

CARTER PRESIDES OVER SYMBOLIC TURNOVER OF CANAL TO PANAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CANAL ZONE _ It was the engineering marvel that opened
the American Century: a 50-mile waterway through the heart of this
tropical country connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Columbus had the vision on his last journey to the
New World in 1502. But it would take another 400 years before a
roughriding United States president, Teddy Roosevelt, would make it
a centerpiece of American foreign policy and a symbol of modern
Yankee ambition.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the steamship Ancon made the first passage through
the Panama Canal on August 15, 1914, the United States had invested
$400 million and the sweat and blood of 75,000 workers enlisted
from 97 countries. About 5,000 died.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at the twilight of a century that has seen American
triumphs and blunders in every corner of the world, the United
States symbolically handed control of the canal and its surrounding
360,000 acres to Panama, an act which will legally take effect at
noon on Dec. 31 and end 96 years of US control over one of the
world's most important shipping routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're celebrating an event which will lead to a new
relationship betweeen your country and mine,'' former US President
Jimmy Carter, co-author of the 1977 treaty that pledged American
withdrawl from Panama, said in Spanish during the ceremony. Later,
he said Panama could become ``the Singapore of this hemisphere for
education, commerce and tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter led a US delegation made up of two current cabinet
secretaries as well as past and present diplomats. Leaders of six
other countries, including Spain's King Juan Carlos, Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo, and Andres Pastrana of Colombia also
attended.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the absence of President Bill Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore, and Secretary of State Madeline Albright, all reportedly
because of scheduling conflicts, that dominated much of the
discussion here this week. It drew harsh words from Panamanian
officials, who said the decision showed the US no longer cares
about the canal or about Panama.
</P>
<P>
   With the transfer of the canal, Panamanians will finally control
the facility that became their national symbol after they gained
independence from Colombia in 1903. The feeling of pride was
evident from the capital city's high-rise glass buildings to the
narrow streets of the historic Chorrillos section, where Christmas
decorations hung Tuesday alongside Panamanian flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have three independence days,'' said Jorge
Cabrera Diaz, a 34-year-old salesman in a women's clothing store in
Panama City. ``One for our freedom from Spain, another from
Colombia, and the third from the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the pomp and promise that rang through Tuesday's
ceremonial speeches, there were also undertones of doubt and even
dread as Panamanians contemplated their future _ along with the
loss of American economic and military support, the challenge of
efficiently managing the canal and its dozens of now-abandoned
military sites, and the question of how this small Central American
country will handle full sovereignty for the first time in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials have gone to great lengths to reassure the
world that the canal and the country will be fine without the
Americans, noting that more than 90 percent of the canal's 7,500
employees are already Panamanian and that the agency overseeing its
operations will be independent of the government and nonpolitical.
</P>
<P>
   They have plans for expanding the waterway to accomodate modern
ships that are too wide and too long to fit into the canal's locks,
which move about 13,000 ships a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our final objective is to guarantee the secure, efficient and
uninterrupted operation of the canal to satisfy our clients and the
wellbeing of our country,'' said President Mireya Moscoso during
the ceremony at the canal's Miraflores Locks.
</P>
<P>
   Canal officials are also heavily promoting development plans for
the hundreds of old military buildings, airfields and schools _
valued at about $3.5 billion _ abandoned by the US.
</P>
<P>
   A contract awarded by canal administrators to a Hong Kong-based
firm to operate two large ports on either end of the passage has
raised worries among conservatives in the US and elsewhere that
communist China will become a growing presence in the canal and the
region. But supporters of Hutchison Port Holdings, which also runs
major ports in England, insist such fears are unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   There are also concerns that without its own armed forces, which
were disbanded after the US invaded the country in 1989 and removed
the dictator Gen. Manuel Noriega, Panama is ill-equipped to
guarantee its own national security and that of the canal. Many
Panamanians are especially worried about the threat of leftist
rebels from neighboring Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such doubts, John Coatsworth, director of the David
Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard
University, called the Carter-Torrijos treaty one of the few
triumphs of American policy toward Latin America in the last 200
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need it anymore, and it's the right thing to do,''
Coatsworth said said by telephone from Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, which Carter signed with
former Panamanian strongman Gen. Omar Torrijos, the two countries
are supposed to sign a pact to address matters such as security.
Although so far no agreement detailing security arrangments has
been reached, it is widely understood that the US would intervene
militarily in the face of any threat to the canal's neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panamanian democracy will be stronger than ever and its
citizens will demand competent politicians,'' Coatsworth added.
``But the United States is acting like security is a unilateral
issue that it will handle without the Panamanians, and that's not
the spirit of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts believe the canal is simply not as important today
as it used to be. It was a key strategic possession that allowed US
battleships to pass from one ocean to the other during two world
wars and a Cold War, but none of today's aircraft carriers can fit.
More and more trade is being conducted via air, ground and
telephone lines, and the waterway carries less than 15 percent of
US trade that still travels by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the canal continues to be an mechanical and engineering
wonder for many who ride along its curves and lakes _ even for many
of the country's 3 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had this big, impressive thing in our country for years,
but so many Panamanians have never been allowed to even ride
through it,'' said Tania Cantis, a volunteer who helped shuttle
visitors on canal tours this week, while standing on the stern of a
small craft that made its way along a section of the canal known as
the Gaillard Cut. ``This is my first time, and I hope it's not the
last.''

REMINDERS OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Italy)  (Eds: Amy Domini is managing principal of Domini Social
Investments.) 
(DW) 
 By AMY DOMINI with ALISA TANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child, I saw how hard it was on my father, who came to this
country in the '50s when Italians were a scorned minority group, to
be an unwanted immigrant. My American grandfather, on the other
hand, was a Wall Street insider who taught me how to read an annual
report when I was about 16 years old. He complained bitterly about
the inflated salaries and fees that executives and directors made
in the '70s. I think he'd be sick at heart today.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the combination, my father, the outcast, and my
grandfather, the insider who railed at fat cats, formed me more
completely than I guessed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I run a mutual fund that has as its philosophical
underpinning the concept that corporations are emerging as the
dominant social force on the planet. We select companies that are
good citizens and talk directly with them about issues ranging from
diversity on the board of directors to manufacturing in sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   The big picture might sound glamorous, but the nuts and bolts of
my job can get pretty tedious. Sometimes I forget why I do what I
do.
</P>
<P>
   Then my children remind me. A couple of years ago my son, who
was about 13, woke up at 8:30 on a Saturday morning. He had just
hit the point of not waking up unless he was dragged out of bed, so
I was pretty startled to see him ready to go, splendidly dressed in
black. He even had on his dress shoes.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him why, he said, ``Mama, don't you know that the
president of China is going to be at Harvard today?''
</P>
<P>
   We live about a five-minute walk from Harvard Yard, and I had
noticed fliers up on lampposts, though I hadn't taken any special
interest. He hurried out with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He returned some hours later, with a sort of a glow of pride,
and carrying over his shoulder a large hand-made sign reading,
``Free Tibet.'' Suddenly I felt my activist and parent worlds
collide. We don't talk much about the greater goals of socially
responsible investing or the mutual fund industry. Nonetheless,
this kid felt that what he did on a Saturday morning half a world
away might matter to someone. My son was addressing world
globalization in his own way, just as I, through my work, try to
leave the planet a little better for him.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Domini Social Investments took a table at a trade
show. We had our literature there, printed on bamboo paper, using
soy inks. When we planned for the event, we wanted some sort of
gift for conference participants and decided to purchase baseball
caps made from organically grown cotton. We discovered some
terrific sources, but on closer examination found that they were
all made in China, where the human rights of the work force could
not be certified. It took dozens of calls before we found a source
that did the sewing in America. It may not matter a hill of beans
in the greater scheme of things, but if a 13-year-old boy can get
out of bed on a Saturday out of concern over human rights in China,
I can think about where we buy our corporate goods.

CARTER ON HAND AS U.S. BIDS GOODBYE TO PANAMA CANAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ At the site of one of America's greatest
engineering triumphs, the United States on Tuesday bid goodbye to
the Panama Canal, marking the close of a dominating, century-long
presence on the isthmus.
</P>
<P>
   As a cargo ship moved through Miraflores Locks at the Pacific
Ocean entrance to the canal, former President Carter stood nearby
and called the transfer of the waterway from U.S. to Panamanian
control ``one of the most significant moments that has ever
occurred in the hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashing his trademark smile, Carter, who signed the 1977 Panama
Canal treaties mandating the turnover, said Washington now
recognizes ``the total sovereignty of Panama over this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Though emotional, Tuesday's act was largely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaties, the actual transfer of canal operations will
occur at noon EST Dec. 31. The ceremony was bumped up to Tuesday to
avoid conflicts with millennium celebrations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a light drizzle, this tiny nation of 2.7 million was in
the mood to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page editorial in the Panama City daily La Prensa said:
``Today, a dream that generations of Panamanians have shared since
the beginning of the republic becomes reality.''
</P>
<P>
   At Miraflores Locks, a choir sang Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy,''
and Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso smiled broadly at the 1,500
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to her conversation with Carter moments before,
Moscoso said: ``He told me, ``It's yours.' Thank you President
Carter, because that's what all Panamanians feel today. We are very
happy because at last we have achieved victory. The canal is
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton and other high-level U.S. officials
declined to attend, Panama's long struggle to wrest control of the
waterway from the United States was heralded around Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In attendance Tuesday were the presidents of Bolivia, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico, as well as King Juan
Carlos of Spain. They arrived aboard one of the canal's high-tech
locomotives that pull ships through the canal locks.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-over was a long time in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1903 treaty, Panama granted the United States the right
to build and operate a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans. It was a monumental task, and thousands of laborers died
during construction.
</P>
<P>
   When the Panama Canal opened in 1914, it instantly became a
symbol of Yankee know-how. The canal helped to make the United
States a naval power on both oceans and allowed ship captains to
avoid making the long, perilous trek around the tip of South
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a source of great pride in my country from the time
when I was a child,'' Carter said. ``But we didn't understand
clearly enough the feelings of many Panamanians that the
arrangement implied an element of colonialism and subjugation.''
</P>
<P>
   The canal treaties, signed by Carter and the late Panamanian
leader Gen. Omar Torrijos, called for the gradual transfer of canal
operations to Panama over 20 years as well as the elimination of
the 10-mile-wide U.S.-run Canal Zone that straddled the canal. The
documents also required the closure of all U.S. military bases in
the zone and the pullout of 10,000 U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso called Carter ``a man of great vision,'' saying that he
did the right thing despite the treaties being unpopular in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country and in Panama, there were demagogues who made
false statements, exaggerated the problems, and predicted
catastrophe,'' Carter recalled. ``There are still a few of those,
unfortunately, today who are implanting incorrect or false stories
about the security of the canal and how it is being operated.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Republican lawmakers in Washington who have
recently portrayed Panama as a corrupt backwater and claimed that,
due to the U.S. pullout, China could wind up with control of the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   They are especially concerned about the Hong Kong firm Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd, that in 1997 won a 25-year contract to administer
ports at both ends of the canal.
</P>
<P>
   However, canal experts point out that ship traffic will be
controlled by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous Panamanian
agency that will replace the Panama Canal Commission, the U.S.
agency that has run the canal since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, under neutrality provisions in the treaties, the
United States retains the right to intervene militarily to protect
the waterway. Even so, many analysts believe that the controversy
and concerns that it could hurt the Democrats in the 2000 election
may have convinced President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to skip Tuesday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, who took office in September, pledged that the
transition would be a smooth one.
</P>
<P>
   She also described a $1 billion modernization program to protect
the canal's status as a safe and efficient route for ship traffic.
More than 14,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, paying
$545 million in tolls.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso pledged that the bulk of the canal's profits would be
plowed back into operations and maintenance rather than to cover
government costs.
</P>
<P>
   Current projects include the widening of the Gaillard Cut _ the
narrowest portion of the canal _ to allow for two-way traffic. The
canal authority is also expected to increase the size of the
canal's protected watershed, since each ship passage requires 52
million gallons of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canal will be a model operation for the continent,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton expressed confidence in Panama's ability
to manage the canal. In a statement, he also pledged that the
United States would maintain a ``continuing commitment to the
security of the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Carter, the U.S. delegation to Panama included Secretary
of Commerce William Daley and Peter Romero, the acting assistant
secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And in a nod to the canal's early history, Panama invited Touni
De Lesseps. She is the granddaughter of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the
French mastermind of the Suez Canal who tried and failed to build a
waterway across Panama in the late 1800s.

HOLIDAY RUSH INTRUDES ON JINGLE BELLS SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh, o'er the
hills we go, laughing all the way _ ha, ha, ha.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, I'm really not a cold-weather person, but that sleigh
is sounding pretty good to me right now.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I thought that cute little Christmas song was about
this happy family gliding along the snow-covered avenues in their
gaily decorated sleigh. There would be a mom, a dad, and two
adorable children snuggled together on the wooden seats with
blankets on their laps and mittens on their hands. Smiles would
adorn their faces as the stars twinkled in their eyes. The horse _
a big, brown, happy horse _ wore a Santa Cap atop his head, the
silver bells on his harness making a lovely melody as he galloped
along.
</P>
<P>
   I always wondered where they were going with all that jingling
and happiness. I'm sure it was a good place, like grandma's house,
which may be part of the lyrics but I never knew the whole song,
just that jingle bell part. Besides, we always drove to my
grandma's house. I did ask my mom to roll down the windows one
chilly day on the way to grandma's because I wanted to get that
open-sleigh feeling. After a mile or two, we closed the windows
because mama's eyes started tearing up and she couldn't see. I was
cold by then anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Well, time has passed and I've celebrated a few of these
holidays as an adult with a growing family. I've acquired a whole
new perspective on that song. All that dashing, ringing, and
laughing is not about going to grandma's. Here's what really
happened:
</P>
<P>
   Some poor mother has just spent three weeks preparing for
Christmas and it's now the night before Christmas. After a royal
battle, the tree is up and decorated. It leans to one side and
several ornaments are broken, but it's up. The side of the tree
facing the front window is beautiful and the rest of the tree looks
terminal, but it's up. Half of the candy canes have mysteriously
disappeared, but who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The gifts still need to be wrapped, and she can't remember where
she hid that video game but it's somewhere in the house. Her
youngest son has just given her a new Christmas list because he
changed his mind about that other stuff and he wants her to call
Santa before he packs the sleigh. She couldn't find any chestnuts
to roast so she has put some pecans in the microwave and realized,
too late, that 10 minutes was a bit long.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, there's an electrical short in the Christmas lights and
half of the strand isn't blinking. The Santa cutout keeps falling
over and someone has hung the wreath upside down again. And let's
not even talk about the Christmas cards that still need to be
addressed and mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she's trying to cook a nice, big dinner for
Christmas, but she can't find her meat thermometer for the turkey
because her daughter is using it on her doll that has a fever. And
the lingering odor from those burnt pecans is making her nauseated.
</P>
<P>
   When she hears the sickening thud of her lovely tree hit the
ground for the third time because the cat was climbing it, trying
to escape from the dog, she just snaps. She loses it. She goes
outside, hops in the family sleigh and takes off in a mad dash. She
hasn't gone a mile when the cell phone in her apron starts ringing.
She tosses the phone into a snowbank and laughs and laughs and
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I think happened.
</P>
<P>
   I could be wrong, but if you hear a news story about a woman
skateboarding on the freeway on Christmas Eve, don't say I didn't
warn you.
</P>

NO PLACE FOR COWBOY DANCIN' LIKE ANSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANSON, Texas _ Fort Worth had its Cowboy Ball at Bass Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Waco had one last week. Tyler was having one Tuesday night. But
the real Cowboy Christmas Ball, the one that started the multicity
circuit, happens this weekend in Anson.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Michael Martin Murphy is the featured entertainer now,
but more than a hundred years ago, New Jersey-born, New York-raised
William Lawrence Chittenden wrote of ``Windy Billy,'' a Swenson
Ranch cowboy who was calling the tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Folklorists say it was 1885 when Chittenden first observed a
bunch of clumsy cowboys dancing with a group of shy country girls.
It was in Anson, out in West Texas, at the Star Hotel. Chittenden's
poem ``A Cowboy's Christmas Ball'' was published in the Anson paper
in 1890. Later, it appeared in several eastern papers for whom
Chittenden served as a correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way out in western Texas, where the Clear Fork's waters flow,
</P>
<P>
   Where the cattle are a-browsin' and the Spanish ponies grow,
</P>
<P>
   Where the northers come a-whistlin' from beyond the Neutral
Strip,
</P>
<P>
   And the prairie dogs are wheezin' as though they had the grippe,
</P>
<P>
   Where lonesome, tawny prairies melt into airy streams,
</P>
<P>
   While the Double Mountains slumber in heav'nly kinds of dreams,
</P>
<P>
   Where the antelope is grazin' and the lonely plovers call,
</P>
<P>
   It was there that I attended the cowboy's Christmas ball ...''
</P>
<P>
   Chittenden's poem appeared in a collection of his works called
``Ranch Verses'' in 1893 (it's gone through 16 printings). Gordon
Graham, a cowboy folklorist, set the poem to music at the Anson
ball in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The yearly Christmas dance was an event of major note in Anson.
The seriously religious town actually outlawed dancing within the
city limits. The ball was the only festivity where it was legal to
dance a square, a polka, a waltz, two-step or schottische.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on dancing was lifted in 1987, but old habits die hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be mostly people from out of town coming to the
ball,'' said Nettie Lee of the Anson Chamber of Commerce. ``This is
a very religious town, and there's still `no dancin' in Anson.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but Pioneer Hall, built especially to hold the ball, can
handle about 850 people, and tickets for Friday night were sold out
last January. Next month they'll be sold out again.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to test the flavor of the West Texas event,
tickets to the Thursday and Saturday night dances are available.
Jerry Sneed and his Up The Creek Band will perform on those nights.
It's Michael Martin Murphy's performance on Friday night that is
sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people were not supportive of the Cowboy's
Christmas Ball because of their feelings on dancing,'' said Tom
Isbell, a local historian. ``It was a real challenge to keep that
tradition alive. If you ask the children today, they wouldn't know
who Chittenden was. One of the tragedies of our day is that we lose
touch with our past.''
</P>
<P>
   The townsfolk who do remember Chittenden were probably students
of Lenora Barrett, a teacher and folklorist who helped form a group
of Anson residents who re-enacted the old dance customs. They
performed at the White House in 1938. Barrett made her students
memorize Chittenden's poem.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas ball hasn't changed much over the years. Cowboy
hats can't be worn on the dance floor, and liquor is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The ball begins with newly married couples leading the ``grand
march'' to The Eyes of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me `bout cotillions, or Germans, no sir-ee!
</P>
<P>
   That whirl at Anson City jes' takes the cake with me.''

SPOKEN MEMORIES OF THE UNSPEAKABLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Title of video may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHOAH 1985; directed by Claude Lanzmann. New Yorker. Part I: 273
minutes; Part II: 290 minutes. Four cassettes, $299.98. In Polish,
German, Hebrew, Yiddish, French, English and Italian with English
subtitles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time doesn't fly in Claude Lanzmann's monumental film; it melts.
A chronicle of the Holocaust, ``Shoah'' (``annihilation'' in
Hebrew) proceeds deliberately, inexorably, for 9 hours and 23
minutes, set always to the click-clack of boxcars that carried Jews
to the gas chambers and crematoriums.
</P>
<P>
   Released in theaters in 1985 and now back on video after seven
years out of distribution, the documentary focuses primarily on the
death camps in the Polish towns of Treblinka and Auschwitz. In its
meticulously built concentration of detail lies the awful
fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Doing most of the interviewing himself, Lanzmann pulls the story
from survivors and eyewitnesses who lived near the camps. Of
400,000 prisoners in Chelmno, Poland, two survived, and the film
begins with one of them, Simon Srebnik.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he avoided execution because he sang well and won
foot races with his feet shackled. In the film he sings as he is
poled by a boatman along a river through stretches of countryside
near Treblinka. It's peaceful now, but, as one witness notes, it
was peaceful then, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans did things smoothly. Throughout, the film pauses for
long, silent looks at empty landscapes, leafy and verdant in summer
and bleakly beautiful in winter. Scenes linger but never lag. The
very slowness generates a kind of momentum, as do the contrasts _
and the boxcars.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, witnesses relate what they remember. Stacked in the
backs of trucks, dead bodies got flatter layer by layer. Sacks of
powdery bone ash were emptied in the river. The boxcars began
arriving at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Treblinka began as a crude operation but was quickly fine-tuned.
``They'd finish off 3,000 people in two hours,'' says a former SS
Unterscharfuhrer. ``It worked well, the production line of death.''
</P>
<P>
   German guards were sworn to secrecy. Prisoners were to arrive
with no realization of what was to happen to them. Lies were told
to get them to undress. Panic would lead to a massacre right on the
train platform. That would be disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   The film's power is in the minutiae: numbers, time periods,
vehicles used, construction techniques. Was the road asphalt? How
far was the road from the burial pits? People were gassed in vans
driven slowly. How slowly? Who drove? The Germans used Poles as
workers, getting them drunk so they would complete their tasks.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the Poles make matter-of-fact witnesses, responding
candidly and sometimes offhandedly to Lanzmann's aggressive
prodding. As they themselves point out, it was impossible not to
know what was going on. ``At first it was unbearable, then you got
used to it,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   At one famous point in the film, Srebnik, wearing a faint smile,
stands on the steps of a Catholic church surrounded by Poles who
recall the era. Some even remember the young boy who sang in the
fields for the Germans. They smile and chat excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzmann asks why this happened to the Jews. ``Because they were
the richest,'' someone says. A man talks about Jews condemning
Christ to death. Of the Holocaust he says, ``It was God's will,
that's all.''

NEW VISION OF THE IMF IS PROPOSED; LESS LONG-TERM LENDING, MORE
CANDOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany , Britain)   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Clinton administration, which has defended the
International Monetary Fund against vocal critics at home and
abroad for many years, has proposed that the fund redefine its
mission, become less secretive, and end some lending programs _
changes that critics have long demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes, the most thorough rethinking of the IMF's
role in the world since the financial instability of the early
1970s, would limit its core mission to making emergency loans to
countries that face short-term currency crises. In recent years,
the IMF has assumed a broader role in advising and lending to poor
and developing countries, but has been widely criticized as
ineffectual in administering some longer-term programs.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, speaking at the London
Business School on Tuesday ahead of a Berlin meeting of both
advanced and developing economies, said the monetary fund should
phase out long-term lending and cede some of its aid to developing
countries to its sister agency, the World Bank. The fund should
also be quicker to step aside when a country has ready access to
private capital, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the IMF is indispensable is not to say that we can
be satisfied with the one we have now,'' Summers said in a speech
outlining the proposals. ``Going forward, the IMF needs to be more
limited in its financial involvement with countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint for change is intended to serve as a mandate for a
new managing director of the fund. Michel Camdessus, the current
managing director, announced his resignation before the end of his
term and will leave the IMF in February. Choosing a new managing
director, a post that has customarily been held by a European, will
be an informal topic of discussion at the meeting in Berlin
beginning on Thursday, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan appears to be a response to a growing
chorus of critics of the fund, including economists and members of
Congress, who have said that the IMF could have done more to
detect, prevent and contain the emerging-markets financial crisis
that began in mid-1997. Though the crisis has passed without the
worst fears of the IMF's critics having been realized, its lending
programs to a few countries, most notably Russia, were widely
considered to be failures.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have tied their support for a highly
touted Clinton administration goal _ forgiving the debt of some of
the poorest countries _ to an overhaul of the IMF. Others have
called for changes similar to those Summers outlined Tuesday. Rep.
Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who monitors the fund, said that its long-term
lending programs are conducive to corruption in poor countries and
should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing the changes, Summers rejected calls for turning
back the clock on the IMF to a time when its mission was solely to
help countries shore up foreign-exchange reserves, a measure taken
to protect a currency from declining too sharply in value. The
Treasury secretary said the fund should still provide some
long-term credit and guidance to poor countries. He also said that
the fund deserves praise for how it handled the financial crises of
the last several years, even in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But he nonetheless prescribed a thorough revamping. Most
notably, he said the fund should phase out low-interest-rate
financing, forcing most countries to raise money from private
sources at prevailing interest rates. If that were carried out in
full, it would affect dozens of the fund's lending programs around
the world. Some programs, like the one for the Philippines, have
run as long as 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also said the fund should become more open to the
public, by publishing its annual budget, for example. He said that
the fund should compel member countries to disclose many kinds of
financial data they now provide on the condition that it remain
secret. Though that change sounds simple, it would involve a
cultural revolution at the IMF, which has operated more as an
exclusive club of nations than a conduit of information to
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The fund welcomed Summers' comments in a statement issued
Tuesday. ``He has touched on a number of critical areas that need
to be considered as we draw the lessons of the recent crisis and
prepare for the future,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But Camdessus, writing in an IMF publication that predated the
Summers speech, said the growth of the fund's lending programs was
in response to a need among poor countries. He said proposals to
drastically narrow the scope of the fund's work were misguided.
``This would obviously be a recipe for irrelevance in today's
world,'' Camdessus wrote. He could not be reached for comment on
Summers' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the fund said the proposed changes are on
target. But Jeffrey Sachs, who heads Harvard's Institute of
International Development and has been a vocal opponent of IMF
practices, said that the fund, often with American support,
continues to expand its mission in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, the fund seems determined to hold on to a very
broad agenda that impacts the lives of hundreds of millions of
people,'' Sachs said. ``The question here is whether we will see
follow-through.''

BAY STATE SENATOR TO JOIN DIETARY GUIDELINES BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State Senator Dianne Wilkerson of Boston is expected to
join a predecessor, Bill Owens, and others in a lawsuit against the
federal government, alleging racial bias in US dietary guidelines
because of minorities' difficulty in digesting milk.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, it is ``unethical for the government to be pushing
milk, based on the knowledge that it has about the effects that it
can have on people of color,'' Owens said Wednesday. He will attend
a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington,
Wednesday morning, along with other plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, initiated by the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine, based in Washington, also alleges a conflict of interest
among some members of a government-appointed advisory committee
that is revising the US dietary guidelines. According to the suit,
some members have received dairy or meat industry grants or
otherwise been involved in industry-funded programs.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson, a Democrat, said she is planning to join the suit,
although as of Tuesday she had not yet formally signed on. The
state Legislature has just approved a $50,000 study that she
proposed to assess US-subsidized nutrition programs featuring milk
in schools and elsewhere, and their effects on people who have
difficulty digesting lactose, or milk sugar. Among the symptoms of
lactose intolerance are abdominal cramps, diarrhea and bloating.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Asians, 70 percent of blacks and Native
Americans, and 15 percent of whites have difficulty digesting
lactose, according to a review of the literature by the Physicians
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy industry representatives, US health officials and some
researchers say people who have difficulty digesting lactose can
comfortably and safely drink a glass of milk a day, or they can use
one of the products with reduced lactose. Milk and other dairy
products are a rich source of calcium necessary for strong bones,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Agriculture reimburses schools for meals
only if they follow USDA recommendations. For elementary
schoolchildren, that means they're required to take milk unless
they have a doctor's note, according to the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   Other plaintiffs in the suit include the owner of a grocery
story in a predominantly minority neighborhood in Chicago, who said
she was cut off from the US food stamp program because she didn't
carry dairy products; parents of children who have difficulty
digesting lactose; and others, according to Mindy Kursban, staff
counsel for the Physicians Committee, a nonprofit advocacy group
made up of 5,000 physicians and 100,000 lay people. The defendants
are the USDA and the US Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS), the two agencies overseeing the revision of the dietary
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   While US officials said they could not comment on the suit
because they have not yet seen it, a spokeswoman from the
agriculture department defended the process by which US dietary
guidelines are made.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the dairy industry criticized the Physicians
Committee for trying to impose a ``vegetarian agenda'' on the
American public, with this suit as well as its other objections
over the prominence of milk in US dietary advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pushing a vegetarian diet,'' said Gary Wheelock, chief
executive officer for the New England Dairy and Food Council. He
criticized the media for continuing to ``overlook the hidden
agenda,'' in reporting on the Physicians Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee, said
his group's support of a vegetarian diet as healthy is no secret.
But it is not demanding that dairy be removed from US dietary
advice, only that milk be made optional, especially when so many
minorities have difficulty digesting lactose, he said.

CEREMONY MARKS TRANSFER OF CANAL TO PANAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ As a fine mist fell and large ships sailed
by, the Panama Canal became on Tuesday Panama's canal in a symbolic
ceremony that put an end to a troubled U.S. military era that had
partitioned and anguished this Central American nation for most of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The historic ceremony marked the start of a new chapter in
U.S.-Panamanian relations, a fact that became evident already with
the absence of high-ranking members of the Clinton administration,
who didn't attend the occasion as a debate swirled in Washington
over the transfer and security of the waterway that links the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 29-member American delegation was led by former
President Jimmy Carter, who helped negotiate two treaties in 1977
by which the United States relinquished control of the 50-mile
channel _ an emblem of American engineering that remains
state-of-the-art today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a source of great pride in my country until the time I
became president and even now,'' Carter told several thousand
Panamanian and foreign dignitaries who congregated on the banks of
the Miraflor Locks, one of three gateways in the canal that connect
the two oceans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't understand clearly enough that the arrangement
implied an element of colonialism and subjugation, and not an equal
representation of two sovereign countries,'' Carter continued amid
great applause from those in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Although the transfer was conducted Tuesday, the Panama Canal
doesn't become the property of Panama until Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Panama is a strategically located nation of 2.8 million that
also links Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Carter arrived with Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, King
Juan Carlos of Spain, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and the
presidents of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   As honorary witnesses to the transfer of the canal, they made a
grand entrance aboard one of the electrical locomotives, called
``mules,'' that guide ships with ropes as they make their way
through the narrow locks of the murky channel.
</P>
<P>
   A mammoth cargo ship emblazoned with the Toyota logo waited to
pass as the ceremony concluded. It was one of the nearly 40 ships
that cross the canal daily, slithering from one ocean to another in
a shortcut that bypasses having to navigate around South America.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever questioned the American resolve and know-how it
took to start building the canal in 1903, a feat compared in scope
to Egypt's pyramids or the Great Wall of China. When it was
finished in 1914, nearly 30,000 people had died trying to build it,
many succumbing to the tropical ailments of malaria and yellow
fever.
</P>
<P>
   But many have questioned the uneasy coexistence of U.S. troops
and Panamanian citizens that came out of the turn-of-the century
accord allowing the United States to build the canal. It was signed
just a few days after Panama became independent of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, Panama's first woman president, said her country has
sought independence throughout its history. She thanked Carter and
the late Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos, who forged the canal
treaties despite great opposition to it in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a popular treaty,'' Carter agreed, adding that of
the 20 senators facing re-election and who ratified it at the time,
only seven returned to office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked very closely with Omar Torrijos, in our country and
also in Panama,'' Carter said. ``There was then demagogues who made
false statements, exaggerated problems, predicted catastrophes in
order to upset and disturb the people of my country. There are
still a few of those, unfortunately, in my nation today.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was referring to recent statements made by several
conservative Republican lawmakers that Panama, which has been
running the canal for last decade, was unfit to administer it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they have raised the specter of the Chinese
Communist menace because a Honk Kong-based company was awarded a
concession to run two cargo ports along the canal.
</P>
<P>
   There are also concerns that leftist guerrillas in neighboring
Colombia could pose a terrorist threat to the canal. Carter and
Moscoso said those fears are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the U.S. Panama Canal Commission has been overseeing
operations, it will become the Panama Canal Authority at the end of
the year. Both nations have been in transition since the treaties
of transfer went into effect 20 years ago, a period that
effectively ends on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Panama and the United States have made great efforts to
realize a transition that would be imperceptible to users of the
canal,'' Moscoso said. ``Our final objective is to guarantee safe,
efficient and uninterrupted operation of the waterway.''

US AGENCY URGES FDA TO MANDATE ADVERSE DRUG-REACTION REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prompted by estimates that more than 100,000 people die each
year from adverse reactions to prescription drugs, federal
officials have recommended that the Food and Drug Administration
require hospitals to report all serious drug reactions to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA should also work proactively to more rapidly identify
harmful effects of new drugs, said a report being released
Wednesday by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department
of Health and Human Services. The agency should also encourage
health care providers to pick up the phone and directly call the
FDA with information about drug side effects, said the report.
</P>
<P>
   And, as new drugs are introduced at increasing rates, the FDA
will likely need more resources to protect the public from
hazardous drug side effects, said the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do more to correct the serious problems revealed by
this report,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), in a statement
Tuesday, referring to shortcomings in the FDA's adverse effects
reporting system. ``Clearly, Congress has a responsibility to give
high priority to these important reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was in response to a set of questions posed by
Kennedy in 1998 to the Inspector General's office, which was
preparing to evaluate the FDA's adverse drug effects reporting
system. Kennedy's concerns were raised in part by a study in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, estimating that in
1994, some 2.2 million hospital patients had serious adverse drug
reactions and 106,000 patients died because of them.
</P>
<P>
   The new report noted that the FDA's own records of deaths and
hospitalizations reported to it seem unrealistically low. In 1994,
for example, the FDA said it received reports of 23,890
hospitalizations and 7,127 deaths from adverse drug reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations in the report urge the FDA to encourage greater
voluntary reporting of adverse effects from physicians and
pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that hospitals routinely collect information on
adverse drug reactions and store them in databases. The FDA could
require hospitals to report all serious and unexpected drug side
effects to it ``as a condition for participation in Medicare and
Medicaid,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy health aide said that some of the stronger
recommendations would require new legislation.

`PEANUTS' CREATOR SCHULZ, BATTLING CANCER, CALLING IT QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years after its debut _ after half a century of doghouse
soliloquies, tattered security blankets, flubbed kickoffs (``You
blockhead, Charlie Brown!''), and sweetly rendered musings on the
foibles and frustrations of childhood _ ``Peanuts'' is calling it
quits, ending a singular run in American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schulz, the comic strip's 77-year old creator, announced
his retirement Tuesday, effective Jan. 4. Schulz, who was diagnosed
with colon cancer earlier this year, said in a statement released
from his Northern California home that although he felt better
since having had surgery recently, ``I want to focus on my health
and my family without the worry of a daily deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Peanuts' truly remade the cartooning landscape,'' said
historian Richard West of Northampton, Mass., who has written
several books on cartooning. ``When Schulz came along, adventure
strips like Flash Gordon were all the rage. Schulz brought back the
gag strip, but he imbued it with a wisdom and heart it never had
before. And behind it all, he's such a gentleman, so incredibly
solicitous of his fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip, which made its debut Oct. 2, 1950, currently appears
in more than 2,600 newspapers worldwide. It reaches 355 million
readers in 75 countries and 21 languages, making ``Peanuts'' truly
a global phenomenon, an American export akin to Coca-Cola and
bluejeans.
</P>
<P>
   And the strip conquered more than just the comics. Greeting
cards, novelty records, home accessories, animated television
specials, feature films, more than 1,400 books (300 million copies
sold), and even a hit Broadway musical made up a
billion-dollar-a-year industry that borrowed its charm from a
simple four-panel comic strip, one that stayed fresh as it
meandered its way, like a toddler in a pumpkin patch, from the
postwar era to the hip-hop age.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about her husband's feelings on putting
``Peanuts'' out to pasture, his wife, Jean Schulz, said, ``I think
we have to say he's sad about it.'' Schulz had worked on the strip
daily untill illness intervened, forcing him to draw upon a backlog
of material he'd prepared. The final Sunday ``Peanuts'' strip is
scheduled to run Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's retirement marks an abrupt, if not entirely unexpected,
finish to the ongoing adventures of Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus,
Schroeder, Pig Pen, Snoopy, and others, a cast of characters
impervious to the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Crabby Lucy never really mellowed or stopped dispensing
``professional'' advice, at a nickel an insight. Poor old Charlie
Brown kept right on believing that just this once, he could kick
that stupid football through the uprights or get that opposing
batter out with his best pitch. Snoopy never lost his taste for
fantasizing, Walter Mitty-like, on World War I aviation exploits
and other adventures. Pig Pen never bathed much, and Schroeder
seldom left his piano bench.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture that seemed to turn itself upside down every five
years or so, the ``Peanuts'' gang stayed remarkably true to their
original nature, and, by extension, true to their fans. The world
they inhabited was adult-free, but in their innocence they gave
voice to the same fatalism that drives so much adult discourse. And
that worldliness only made them all the more lovable.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, who insisted on drawing every panel himself and thus
kept the franchise very much his own, became a beloved figure in
his own right. Fellow cartoonists worship Schulz as a good guy _ he
is universally known as ``Sparky'' _ who treats fans, business
partners, and peers with the utmost respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most successful (comic strip) artist in the history
of mankind, period, by every available measure,'' said Daryl Cagle,
president of the National Cartoonists Society. ``Artistic success,
influence on the business, number of fans, monetary rewards _ pick
any great artist, and Sparky wins every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that more people worldwide read ``Peanuts'' on a daily
basis than anything else, Cagle added, ``There's simply no more
important cartoon out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The prolific Schulz also managed to outlast many of the Baby
Boomer cartoonists who followed in his footsteps. Berke Breathed
(``Bloom County''), Gary Larson (``The Far Side''), and Bill
Watterson (``Calvin and Hobbes'') all opted for early retirement.
Gary Trudeau of ``Doonesbury'' fame has taken several sabbaticals
to refresh his mind and pen. Not Schulz, who kept at his drawing
table for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way came numerous honors, including two Reuben Awards
for cartooning excellence in 1955 and 1964 and a 1978 International
Cartoonist of the Year citation. In 1990, Schulz was named a
Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's highest awards for
excellence in the arts. ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' originally
broadcast on CBS in 1965 and often replayed, won an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really shocking. I just thought he would go on and on
forever,'' said Mort Walker, creator of the venerable ``Beetle
Bailey'' strip. ``It's like losing a child or something. I looked
forward to reading the strip every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker added that he was surprised by Schulz's decision,
suggesting it will be hard for the cartoonist to walk away from the
characters he has guided for 50 years. ``Old cartoonists never
retire. They just erase away,'' Walker said.

ABSTINENCE IS FOCUS OF U.S. SEX EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sex education in the nation's schools is
increasingly focused on abstinence, with more than one in three
districts using an abstinence-only curriculum that permits
discussion of contraception only in its failures, according to two
national studies released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of schools urge students to delay intercourse until
marriage but to use birth control and practice safe sex if they do
not.
</P>
<P>
   More than 95 percent of public school principals say AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases are discussed in their sex
education classes. Fewer than half offer information on where to
get birth control (45 percent) or how to use condoms (39 percent).
A smaller number mention abortion (37 percent) or sexual
orientation (36 percent) as part of the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abstinence, teaching children to wait to have sex, is a core
element of most sexuality education programs today,'' said Tina
Hoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the research
along with the Alan Guttmacher Institute. ``The question is, What
context are you teaching it in?''
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations advocate more discussion of birth control
devices and distribution of them.
</P>
<P>
   The twin surveys, of secondary school principals and school
district superintendents, are the first effort to measure the
prevalence of the abstinence message in sex education.
</P>
<P>
   The Guttmacher poll, of superintendents, shows that most school
districts have changed their sex education policies over the past
decade, with a third increasing the emphasis on abstinence. This
reflects a national political move that culminated in legislation
in 1996 allocating nearly $440 million in state and federal money
over five years for abstinence-only programs; Congress added
another $50 million in a separate bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential
contender, has called for even more financing, suggesting that
federal spending on an abstinence message equal the $135 million a
year now supporting education on contraception. Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, Bush's brother, recently set aside $10 million for
abstinence education in his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, abstinence wasn't even considered; it was
laughed at,'' said Amy Stephens, a spokeswoman for the National
Coalition for Abstinence Education, which is affiliated with Focus
on the Family, an organization in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``A lot
of avenues have opened up for kids to hear this message. That's a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guttmacher survey found significant regional differences: In
the South, 55 percent of school districts report abstinence-only
policies, and only 5 percent offer comprehensive sexuality
education; in the Northeast, only 20 percent of districts teach
abstinence-only.
</P>
<P>
   Cory L. Richards, vice president for public policy at the
Guttmacher Institute, said: ``I think parents should be concerned.
I think the public should be concerned, and I think policy-makers
should be concerned. As much as they might not want their
teen-agers to begin to have sex while a teen-ager, their teen-ager
is going to have sex some time. What is the impact of hundreds of
thousands of kids across the country being taught that
contraception doesn't work well?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stephens, of the pro-abstinence forces, said ``it's
unethical to not talk about failure'' in discussing contraception
with students, and she denounced the Guttmacher Institute as a tool
of the birth-control and abortion industries.
</P>
<P>
   The institute began as the research arm of Planned Parenthood,
and while the two groups have been separated for two decades, they
share some board members and financing.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Parshall, a spokeswoman for the Family Research Council,
which advocates abstinence, said sex education should resemble the
``Just Say No'' anti-drug education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that the abstinence message can be effectively
conveyed alongside the so-called safer-sex gospel is absurd,'' Ms.
Parshall said. ``There are many holes in the condom enthusiasts'
arguments, and it's time for them to be exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Research into the effectiveness of abstinence-only and
comprehensive sex education programs in reducing teen-age pregnancy
and disease has shown mixed results. Teen-age pregnancy rates have
declined since 1991, but the shift toward abstinence has, in many
cases, been only in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the abstinence view point to surveys showing that
parents want their children to be taught to delay sex until
marriage. Those advocating discussion of contraception and safer
sex say parents want abstinence to be at the core of a broader
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and adults are prepared for a far more realistic
policy than are members of Congress, who seem more concerned with
posturing and simple solutions to complex issues,'' said James
Wagoner, president of Advocates for Youth, a Washington group that
supports the comprehensive approach,
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't just numbers _ they're our sons and our
daughters,'' Wagoner said. ``In too many school districts around
the country, young people are being denied critical information
about contraception that could protect their health and save their
lives.''

 &HT;    New company to provide online technical support
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One of the founders of Motive Communications
Inc. of Austin is starting a new company that plans to offer online
tech support to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Abel, who helped found Motive two years ago, has started
all.com Inc. and is its chief operating officer. The company, which
has 25 employees, has licensed technology from Motive and is
expected to officially unveil the company today.
</P>
<P>
   While the company is still in its infancy _ it's looking for a
chief executive and venture capital _ it already has a pretty
substantial investor: Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's an excellent group of people with an excellent
product that provides efficient and affordable support,'' said Carl
Everett, senior vice president of Dell's personal systems group.
Dell has invested in numerous small companies in recent years,
ranging from software startups to Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which is a Motive customer, has made an undisclosed
investment in the company and has devised a certification process
for all.com's tech support workers, who will be employed as
independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   All.com will use the Internet to connect users having computer
problems to tech support specialists, who will attempt to diagnose
and solve the problem online.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the promise of easier-to-use PCs, tech support remains
an expensive headache, with worldwide help desk costs reaching $23
billion last year. Motive has focused on providing software for
diagnosing tech problems to large corporations including Microsoft
Corp., Walt Disney Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   While more and more tech support providers have been utilizing
the Internet, industry analysts said the small office/home office
market, which spent $203 billion last year on technology, has been
left to fend for itself when it comes to tech support, and is ripe
for a solution like all.com's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going after a major untapped market in an innovative
way,'' said Rich Ptak, an analyst with Hurwitz Group in Framingham,
Mass. ``The challenge will be maintaining a top-quality tech
support staff. They'll only be as good as the people solving the
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   All.com customers will be charged based on the size of the snafu
_ ranging from $3 to $4 for simple configuration questions to $15
to $20 for general desktop support. High-end server problems could
run in the $100 range. A percentage of the fee goes to the
contractor, and all.com collects a commission on each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Blair, an investment representative with Edward Jones
Investments in Austin who has tested all.com's system, said he
doesn't mind paying for fast service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly computer literate. When problems do
occur, I don't have time to mess with them,'' he said. ``When you
call a computer service, you pay $200 or $300 a shot, and you may
wait three hours for them to show up. This way I don't have to wait
for anyone to show up. I can go right to the site and get help
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   All.com plans to make its software available to consumers for
testing at the end of January, and will begin charging for the
service in early spring.

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

THE MORAL OF THE SHOW: BE HAPPY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once my critical colleagues have dispatched
themselves to various ceremonies of carols, the ``Messiah'' of the
day or the latest ``Christmas Oratorio,'' I check to see that no
one is looking and make a beeline for Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Music in this town has Christmas covered in every direction:
Baroque, medieval, Victorian, Edwardian and Currier &AMP; Ives. The
Waverly Consort offers music from medieval Spain, France, England
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Lionheart, the male ensemble, brings us ``Tydings Trew: Feasts
of Christmas in Medieval England.'' From the Vox Vocal Ensemble,
``An Italian Renaissance Christmas''; from the Gabrieli Consort and
Players, music by Praetorius.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful may be these sounds, but none have much to do with us
right now. Maybe it is the nostalgia, the historical distance, that
makes us cherish the traditional carol so. Our hearts warm to the
sound of fictitious sleigh bells and angel-voiced carolers in the
snow. A lot of these things never happened but should have, so we
decide that they did.
</P>
<P>
   I like the ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular'' because it tells
me how the season is progressing on Sixth Avenue or around the
corner at Saks Fifth Avenue. I like a Santa not afraid to loosen
his hips to a boogie beat. The Rockettes make my heart beat fast.
</P>
<P>
   There is in this year's show a dance sequence of multiplying
Santas: so many that by the end they barely fit onstage. It's
comforting to know that there will be enough Kriss Kringles
available for every borough and congressional district in New York
City, with some left over for the immediate suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   This is Christmas in the world I understand, the one going on
above my head as I ride the subway every day. I never came across a
wassail cup on 34th Street or haloed Arabs trekking across the
deserts of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The only false note in the ``Christmas Spectacular,'' although
it is undertaken with obvious sincerity, is the Nativity scene. Its
mangers, cribs and wise men are like bad illustrations from
children's books brought to life. There is something removed and
neutral, almost lifeless, about it: this in contrast to a two-hour
show that brims with life.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe trying to show Christmas as it originally happened falls
flat because of what our Christmas celebrations are really about.
Through iconography and texts, the details of Christ's birth and
its significance are attached to all the other things we do at this
time of year. But behind a 2,000-year-old religion lies an older
festival: a midwinter rejoicing in plenty and well-being during the
bleakest season of the year.
</P>
<P>
   If the city's churches are telling their stories well, and they
are, the ``Christmas Spectacular'' conveys the rest of the truth
with a refreshing candor. Toward the end of the show we are in
Santa's workshop as Mrs. S. bellows confidently, ``You'll get
yours!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite our stabs of religious sentiment and the genuine joy in
making someone else happy, at the core of our Christmas is
gratification. Christmas exists to make us happy.
</P>
<P>
   I would extend this thought to the most deeply pious of
Christmas music. Victoria and Britten _ or indeed, ``Silent Night''
_ fill us with a sensuous pleasure. They are the ear's equivalent
of good food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church has caused a furor among its members by
trying to replace the old language of its Book of Common Prayer
with 20th-century plain speaking. I don't blame the howlers, but I
don't blame the church either.
</P>
<P>
   For so mesmerized had parishioners become with the beauty of the
old texts that spiritual supplication gave way to sheer pleasure.
The confession, the creeds and the responses rolled off the tongue
with a delight perhaps more appropriate to a musical concert or a
poetry reading.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Christmas Spectacular,'' with its up-front, no-excuses
cheer, does not suffer such problems. Its nine scenes fly like the
wind. Everything is touched on (from ``Swan Lake'' and ``The
Nutcracker'' to the ``Hallelujah'' chorus); nothing is dwelt upon.
This show is not about spiritual growth or serious attention spans;
it's about having a good time, about feeding one's eyes and ears
with the bounty of a harvest safely stowed away.
</P>
<P>
   It is also immensely clever and carried off with astonishing
precision. Given how much is going on, the coordination of music
and dance should be the envy of any stage enterprise anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockettes, bless them, never miss a step; and when they
smile out at us, the orthodontists of Manhattan can be collectively
proud. As toy soldiers, they are a delight; as Santa's reindeer,
they have antlers that light up for takeoff. Such touches could be
vulgar, but the ``Christmas Spectacular'' has the knack of being
amused by its own flashiness.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that none of the above is construed as an attack on
Christmas as Christian enterprise. The church has superimposed its
message on the seasonal urges of primal man and, in the process,
created a beauty and a sensibility that have made their marks on
this ancient celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular'' keeps us honest in its
way. It says that we should remember the events of the Christian
calendar without feeling guilty about overextended credit cards and
unwise ingestion.
</P>
<P>
   The renovated theater is a delight, with infinite care paid to
the details that bring us pleasure. Christmas means us to have a
good time, to let go a little. I can't wait to go back next year
and hear those two big Wurlitzer organs roaring back and forth
across the theater at each other. Gabrieli, eat your heart out.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOHACS, Hungary _ In the soggy lowlands along the Danube, where
war raged less than a decade ago, biologists and engineers from
three nations are working on an unusual project using nature to
promote peace.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is Central Europe's largest wetland, a great flood
plain formed by the meeting of the Danube and the Drava rivers.
Here, colonies of fish spawn among the reed beds. Wild boar, storks
and otters, whose numbers are dwindling elsewhere, thrive in the
mosaic of forests and lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   The ecosystem is one, but three countries _ Hungary, Yugoslavia
and Croatia _ meet here. The area became a front line in the war of
the early 1990s when Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia. Gun
positions and scores of land mines still lurk among the water
plants.
</P>
<P>
   But even as many border crossings remain closed here and
political tensions persist among the three governments, an
ambitious effort is under way to rehabilitate the area. The program
is environmental, but its implications are political.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, the three countries have agreed to
create a cross-border nature reserve that will encompass at least
250,000 acres, which is large by European standards. Hungary and
Croatia are to sign a cooperation agreement Dec. 15, the first step
toward joint management. The World Bank and other institutions have
pledged close to $10 million in loans and grants to manage the park
and create tourist facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our big chance to recover,'' said Darko Varga, the
mayor of Bilje, a village on the Croatian side of the border. ``We
can't produce computers, and we have nothing to sell on the world
market. But we have wonderful nature and animals. We want to bring
back the tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, managers of two contiguous parks on the
Hungarian-Croatian border are scheduled to begin to work together.
Yugoslavia has already delineated 25,000 acres to be linked to the
two other parks. But the economic boycott against the country has
until now excluded it from most international funds and regional
plans. But unofficial talks are going on with Yugoslav biologists
and ecologists.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fighting, communications were cut among more than
20 villages and hamlets that skirt the wetlands. The war deepened
traditional distrust and local rivalries. Large areas are still
blocked off because of unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   But the communities have been nudged toward reconciliation from
the outside. The U.N. Development Program has run workshops for the
last two years to encourage village mayors to work with one
another. The Worldwide Fund for Nature has mapped the area and
trained local teachers in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now pressing the governments to open more border
crossings,'' said Varga, who coordinates the mayors' group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The planned reserve is part of a broader effort to rethink the
management of Europe's rivers.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a century of straightening and hemming in
waterways to control them, engineers and ecologists want to return
to a more natural approach. They want to reopen blocked flood
plains to serve as outlets and make better use of wetlands, which
can act as filters and cleanse polluted streams. The Danube,
Europe's longest river, is very much a case in point. Almost half
of its 1,800 miles has been lined with levees or concrete. Along
much of the way, it is shackled by dams.
</P>
<P>
   Near Mohacs, 100 miles south of Budapest, where the northern
edge of the nature reserve begins, the Danube becomes an impressive
600 to 1,000 yards wide. Creeks and inlets meander on both sides of
the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the war, some land has been reflooded and we hope
to keep it that way,'' said Philip Weller of the Worldwide Fund for
Nature, an adviser to the project. He said the area was crucial for
wildlife and one of Europe's most important flooded forests.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, parts of the wetlands that were drained in the
past will be restored. Engineers will flush out silted-up channels
and open up old side arms of the river to let the water run more
freely. The river spills into its flood plains here for about three
months each year, creating ideal breeding places for fish and small
reptiles and for the many wading birds that feed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Stands of willows and oaks harbor the shy white-tailed eagle and
black stork. These birds are threatened elsewhere in Europe as
their habitats have disappeared. More than 270 bird species appear
in this region.
</P>
<P>
   As the waters recede, the vegetation attracts mammals like red
deer, foxes and boar, which in turn attract hunters and poachers.
There is illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to get more protection now,'' said Tibor Mikuska, a
biologist involved in the project. ``We want the authorities to cut
back logging and hunting licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected support has come from some rich families, who have
offered private land to extend the reserve, provided it remains
protected. ``This is a unique chance to protect the area,'' said
Karl Draskovic, whose family has pledged to donate some of its
forest holdings along the Drava River. ``There are still few roads,
few people, a lot of lakes and a lot of wildlife. It's magnificent
for bird watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The local mayors plan to spend part of the World Bank loan on
tourist projects, such as building observation towers and bicycle
routes and converting some of the century-old farmhouses into inns.
</P>
<P>
   Around Mohacs, on the Hungarian side, the land seems peaceful
enough. Herons and storks wheel overhead and thousands of Siberian
geese have arrived for the winter. On the high ground, farmers have
neatly stacked their wheat and corn harvest.
</P>
<P>
   But across the border in Croatia, lands near Osijek and Bilje
are still off limits and rife with mines, planted by both the
Yugoslav and Croatian armies.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the hundreds of mines may be the reserve's greatest
challenge. The Croatian Center for Demining estimates that fewer
than 10 percent have been removed so far. Military maps have proved
inaccurate, and experts said that removing mines that have sunk
into the soggy soil will be extremely costly and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearing the parts we will open to the public, the roads
and the trails,'' said Mikuska, the biologist who is also a project
coordinator. ``Those will be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that this policy, while not without risk, may
inadvertently help to protect the reserve from poachers and
loggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should just include all the minefields of the area into the
park and warn that they are off limits,'' Draskovic said. ``That's
the best answer. If a wild boar steps on a mine, we'll have one
wild boar less. So be it.''

 &HT;    University of Texas trying to get nuclear reactor satisfactionBy
Sharon Jayson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Maybe they should have asked about an extended
warranty.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer, in this case, was the University of Texas. The
purchase: a nuclear reactor, now on the fritz after about seven
years in operation. A manufacturer's welding defect is the likely
cause, which is why the factory rep is headed to Austin to take a
look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have replaced it for free in the first year. Now it's
an out-of-warranty-type item,'' said Tony Veca of General Atomics,
who will visit Austin in the next few weeks from the company's San
Diego, Calif.-headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Veca said his company, which has built 65 nuclear reactors in
use around the world, provides a year's worth of free repairs or
replacement of defective parts in reactors it produces. UT paid
about $2 million for the reactor, which has operated at the J.J.
Pickle Research Campus in Northwest Austin since 1992. UT's
reactor, which is of the type commonly found at colleges or other
research institutions, is referred to as a pool reactor because it
sits submerged in a swimming pool-like concrete vat of water. The
water and concrete absorb the radiation, allowing UT students and
researchers to observe experiments without a safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty component is the reflector, a graphite ring enclosed
in an aluminum jacket that looks like the drum of a washing
machine. The stainless steel-encased radioactive fuel rods, which
normally stand upright inside the cylinder like pencils in a jar,
have been removed from the core but remain in the 25-foot-deep pool
of water that surrounds the reactor. UT officials say there is no
safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   Although the building that houses the reactor is still occupied,
the reactor itself has been off-limits since October, when
scientists noticed a swelling near its core and traced it to a
pinhole-size welding defect in the donut-shape reflector. Officials
say no radiation leaks occurred; however, a small amount of water
from the pool seeped into the reflector.
</P>
<P>
   During reactor operation, radiation from the core goes into the
reflector but doesn't escape the pool of water, which acts as a
backup radiation shield. The water that leaked into the normally
dry reflector, combined with the radiation, created hydrogen and
oxygen gas. The gas mixture, which produced the bulge in the
aluminum reflector container, exceeded Nuclear Regulatory
Commission limits. That's why an NRC inspector spent last week in
Austin monitoring UT's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've concluded there is no present risk to the public or the
students or the staff at this facility,'' said Marvin Mendonca, who
is based at the commission's headquarters near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Veca said the one-megawatt reactor generates the same amount of
heat as 10,000 100-watt light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   UT researchers, eager to get the reactor started again, are
planning a temporary solution that involves drilling a quarter-inch
hole in the reflector to vent the gases. Once the gases are
released under NRC safety guidelines, UT can reinstall the fuel
rods and restart the reactor. Given the continuing presence of a
hole and seepage of water, the reactor's performance and the
quality of some experimental data may be hindered, said Sean
O'Kelly, associate director of UT's Nuclear Engineering Teaching
Laboratory at the Pickle site.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short-term fix, however. The long-term answer likely lies
with a new part. A new reflector will cost between $100,000 and
$200,000. Considering that a normal reactor's life span is at least
40 years, and that the problem developed in less than a fifth of
that time, UT officials say they're looking for some customer
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something the university has to work out with the
manufacturer, and it relates to who pays for it. That's something
that the lawyers will work out,'' said Ben Streetman, dean of UT's
College of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But Veca, whose company has constructed reactors since 1958,
said the defective reflector at UT is a first for his company. The
NRC confirms that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it left our warehouse, it had been tested. All the
records show it passed the certification tests that we perform,''
Veca said.
</P>
<P>
   UT scientists are stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done anything to abuse it,'' O'Kelly said. ``The
manufacturer tested the reflector for leaks before they delivered
it to us, but we have not done anything to cause the leak, so the
question of what happened is still to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Red tape aside, the reactor shutdown has implications for
students such as Magdy Abdelrahman, who needed it to conduct
research to complete his Ph.D. in May. Although UT officials have
tried to help graduate students by suggesting computer simulation
and alternative reactors as backups, Abdelrahman said his research
will suffer until the reactor is back on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer simulation is not ideal. It will not produce the
same results,'' he said.

`PEANUTS' CREATOR SCHULZ, BATTLING CANCER, CALLING IT QUITS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Fifty years after its debut _ after half a century of doghouse
soliloquies, tattered security blankets, flubbed kickoffs (``You
blockhead, Charlie Brown!''), and sweetly rendered musings on the
foibles and frustrations of childhood _ ``Peanuts'' is calling it
quits, ending a singular run in American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schulz, the comic strip's 77-year old creator, announced
his retirement Tuesday, effective Jan. 4. Schulz, who was diagnosed
with colon cancer earlier this year, said in a statement released
from his Northern California home that although he felt better
since having had surgery recently, ``I want to focus on my health
and my family without the worry of a daily deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Peanuts' truly remade the cartooning landscape,'' said
historian Richard West of Northampton, Mass., who has written
several books on cartooning. ``When Schulz came along, adventure
strips like Flash Gordon were all the rage. Schulz brought back the
gag strip, but he imbued it with a wisdom and heart it never had
before. And behind it all, he's such a gentleman, so incredibly
solicitous of his fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip, which made its debut Oct. 2, 1950, currently appears
in more than 2,600 newspapers worldwide. It reaches 355 million
readers in 75 countries and 21 languages, making ``Peanuts'' truly
a global phenomenon, an American export akin to Coca-Cola and
bluejeans.
</P>
<P>
   And the strip conquered more than just the comics. Greeting
cards, novelty records, home accessories, animated television
specials, feature films, more than 1,400 books (300 million copies
sold), and even a hit Broadway musical made up a
billion-dollar-a-year industry that borrowed its charm from a
simple four-panel comic strip, one that stayed fresh as it
meandered its way, like a toddler in a pumpkin patch, from the
postwar era to the hip-hop age.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about her husband's feelings on putting
``Peanuts'' out to pasture, his wife, Jean Schulz, said, ``I think
we have to say he's sad about it.'' Schulz had worked on the strip
daily untill illness intervened, forcing him to draw upon a backlog
of material he'd prepared. The final Sunday ``Peanuts'' strip is
scheduled to run Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's retirement marks an abrupt, if not entirely unexpected,
finish to the ongoing adventures of Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus,
Schroeder, Pig Pen, Snoopy, and others, a cast of characters
impervious to the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Crabby Lucy never really mellowed or stopped dispensing
``professional'' advice, at a nickel an insight. Poor old Charlie
Brown kept right on believing that just this once, he could kick
that stupid football through the uprights or get that opposing
batter out with his best pitch. Snoopy never lost his taste for
fantasizing, Walter Mitty-like, on World War I aviation exploits
and other adventures. Pig Pen never bathed much, and Schroeder
seldom left his piano bench.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture that seemed to turn itself upside down every five
years or so, the ``Peanuts'' gang stayed remarkably true to their
original nature, and, by extension, true to their fans. The world
they inhabited was adult-free, but in their innocence they gave
voice to the same fatalism that drives so much adult discourse. And
that worldliness only made them all the more lovable.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, who insisted on drawing every panel himself and thus
kept the franchise very much his own, became a beloved figure in
his own right. Fellow cartoonists worship Schulz as a good guy _ he
is universally known as ``Sparky'' _ who treats fans, business
partners, and peers with the utmost respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most successful (comic strip) artist in the history
of mankind, period, by every available measure,'' said Daryl Cagle,
president of the National Cartoonists Society. ``Artistic success,
influence on the business, number of fans, monetary rewards _ pick
any great artist, and Sparky wins every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that more people worldwide read ``Peanuts'' on a daily
basis than anything else, Cagle added, ``There's simply no more
important cartoon out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The prolific Schulz also managed to outlast many of the Baby
Boomer cartoonists who followed in his footsteps. Berke Breathed
(``Bloom County''), Gary Larson (``The Far Side''), and Bill
Watterson (``Calvin and Hobbes'') all opted for early retirement.
Gary Trudeau of ``Doonesbury'' fame has taken several sabbaticals
to refresh his mind and pen. Not Schulz, who kept at his drawing
table for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way came numerous honors, including two Reuben Awards
for cartooning excellence in 1955 and 1964 and a 1978 International
Cartoonist of the Year citation. In 1990, Schulz was named a
Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's highest awards for
excellence in the arts. ``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' originally
broadcast on CBS in 1965 and often replayed, won an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really shocking. I just thought he would go on and on
forever,'' said Mort Walker, creator of the venerable ``Beetle
Bailey'' strip. ``It's like losing a child or something. I looked
forward to reading the strip every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker added that he was surprised by Schulz's decision,
suggesting it will be hard for the cartoonist to walk away from the
characters he has guided for 50 years. ``Old cartoonists never
retire. They just erase away,'' Walker said.

   LONDON _ After 36 years, Paul McCartney went back to, as the
sign above the entrance to the Cavern Club puts it, the place
``Where it all began.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Cavern Club, the small, sweaty, subterranean
Liverpool nightclub that launched the Beatles, last saw its most
famous progeny on Aug. 3, 1963. After that, it was auditoriums,
stadiums, and history for the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new album, and a new attitude after emerging from an
extended period of mourning the death of his wife Linda two years
ago, McCartney decided to go back to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, only 300 people could squeeze into the Cavern,
which is a replica of the old club that was torn down 26 years ago.
But another 12,000 crammed into a nearby park to watch the concert
on closed-circuit television, and it was beamed to 25 other
countries and a TV audience that its promoters said could total 500
million. The concert was also broadcast live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Beatles ever got big, we started out playing rock
n' roll at the Cavern,'' McCartney said before the show. ``I'm
going back as a nod to the music that always and will ever thrill
me. I cannot think of a better way to rock out the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The promoters hoped to break the all-time record for a TV
audience, which the Beatles set in 1967 with a concert called ``All
You Need is Love'' despite the inability then to broadcast it
behind the Iron Curtain. Now, with the Cold War over and the Soviet
bloc collapsed, McCartney can't be back in the USSR, but the
concert was beamed to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Baker, McCartney's spokesman, said the Russian audience
was expected to make the gig the most watched TV show ever.
</P>
<P>
   Between March 1961 and August 1963, the Beatles played the
Cavern no fewer than 275 nights. The original Victorian warehouse
at 10 Mathew St. was demolished for an underground railway that
never got built. Seeking to capitalize on the tourists who came to
Liverpool looking for the birthplace of the Beatles, a replica of
the Cavern, including bricks from the original, was built at the
site and opened in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 who watched the show inside the Cavern got their tickets
by lottery. Among them was John Ono Lennon, an 18-year-old
Englishman who legally changed his name to reflect his devotion to
what he calls ``the greatest band ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles remain more popular here with the parents of
18-year-olds, but McCartney, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth
II, occupies a special place in British society compared to the
other two surviving Beatles, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr didn't even join the Beatles as the drummer until after
the band had graduated beyond the claustrophobic confines of the
Cavern. McCartney first played the Cavern in 1958 with John
Lennon's band, The Quarrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is more common for the Cavern to host a disco with
recorded music than a live show, but McCartney treated a select
audience, and an estimated half-billion electronic onlookers, to
the club's and the Beatles' roots.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the wrinkly-faced grandfathers in other band reunions,
McCartney said getting on stage was not as natural as some might
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always about to give up, because it seems so unseemly,''
McCartney said, ``but then it seems so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatles traditionalists may have been disappointed by the play
list, which was heavy on the new songs of McCartney's new band and
album of the same name, Run Devil Run, and light on the familiar
Lennon-McCartney tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But the band included some heavyweights, including Pink Floyd's
guitarist David Gilmore, and the place rocked when McCartney sang
``I Saw Her Standing There,'' which he introduced as a song that
could have been from the 1950s or the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Sir Paul shouted, ending the gig. ``See you next
time.''

NUNZIO JOSEPH PALLADINO, NUCLEAR ENGINEER AND REAGAN APPOINTEE,
DIES AT 83  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Conn., Tenn.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nunzio Joseph Palladino, a retired nuclear engineer who steered
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission through some rough years after
the nuclear power accident at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg,
Pa., died on Sunday at Centre Community Hospital in College Park,
Pa. He was 83 and lived in College Park.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a long illness, said officials at Pennsylvania State
University, where he was dean emeritus of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of a cooling valve to open allowed the radioactive
core of a reactor at Three Mile Island to overheat on March 28,
1979, causing thousands of people to flee in fear of a nuclear
meltdown. Fuel rods melted, spilling their radioactive contents
into a containment structure, where the radiation was largely
confined.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis at Three Mile Island lasted 12 days and the accident
took more than a decade to clean up, but there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation found that the accident was caused by human,
mechanical and design failures. The accident led to changes in
reactor licensing and personnel training, as well as in the
structure and function of the nuclear commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, President Ronald Reagan chose Palladino as the
commission's chairman to put the changes into effect; he served
until 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Palladino's specialties were the thermal and hydraulic problems
encountered in the design of nuclear reactor cores and the
mechanical problems associated with such designs. His expertise
made him a natural for coping with the aftermath of Three Mile
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Palladino was born in Allentown, Pa., graduated from Lehigh
University in 1938 and received a master's degree in mechanical
engineering from Lehigh in 1939. He then became an engineer at the
Westinghouse Electric Co. near Philadelphia, designing steam
turbines. In World War II he was as a captain in the Army, and
served in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Palladino worked as a reactor designer and manager
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Argonne National Laboratory
and the reactor design division of Westinghouse, where he headed a
group that designed the reactor for the world's first nuclear
submarine, the Nautilus. He joined the Penn State faculty in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Palladino was the first chairman of the university's department
of nuclear engineering and was dean of the College of Engineering
from 1966 to 1981, when he became the chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of articles in professional journals and, in
retirement, served as a member of the National Nuclear Accrediting
Board for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Palladino is survived by his wife of 54 years, Virginia
Marchetto Palladino; three daughters, Linda S. Oswald of Somers,
Conn., Lisa A. Ghaner of Elisabethtown, Pa., and Cynthia M. Maund
of State College; a sister, Judge Madaline Palladino of Allentown;
a brother, Robert, of Chambersburg, Pa., and five grandchildren.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises announced more management
changes Tuesday as President and Chief Executive Officer Henry
Schimberg prepares to step down in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Coke system's largest bottler named four new senior vice
presidents, including a new special assistant to the CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``These appointments not only reflect the talents of each
individual, but they also demonstrate the depth of the management
team at Coca-Cola Enterprises,'' Chairman Summerfield K. Johnston
Jr. said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Management depth is an important issue as CCE goes forward
because losing Schimberg, one of the most respected executives in
the beverage industry, has been a concern on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The changes reflect the bottler's effort to restructure
management in the wake of Schimberg's October decision to retire
four months earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, Johnston, 66, will take over Schimberg's CEO duties
on an interim basis until the company names a permanent
replacement. Chief Operating Officer John Alm will take over as
president Jan. 1. Many analysts expect Alm, 53, to eventually be
named CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The following promotions were announced Tuesday after the board
meeting at the company's headquarters:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vicki R. Palmer, currently vice president and treasurer, was
named senior vice president, treasurer and special assistant to the
CEO. In the newly created position as special assistant, Palmer
will oversee corporate affairs and help with organizational
development efforts. She will continue managing CCE's $11 billion
debt portfolio, $3 billion pension plan and 401(k) investments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrick J. Mannelly, who was named chief financial officer in
April, was named senior vice president and chief financial officer.
He is a former corporate vice president for finance and
administration and chief financial officer for CCE's Western North
America Group.
</P>
<P>
   _ John R. Parker Jr., who was named general counsel in July, was
named senior vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   _ John H. Downs Jr. was named senior vice president of public
affairs. He has been vice president of public affairs since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   CCE's stock closed at $61.43 3/4 Tuesday, down 6 1/4 cents.

DECISION ELIMINATES RACE-BASED POLICE PROMOTION IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT AND ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Faced with yet another court ruling saying that race
should not be a factor in personnel decisions, the Boston Police
Department will abandon a 19-year practice of bypassing white
officers to promote minorities, a policy that has divided a
generation of officers.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a ruling by Suffolk Superior Court Judge John
Xifaras, Boston Police Commissioner Paul F. Evans said Tuesday he
will no longer skip over white officers with higher Civil Service
scores to promote minority officers with lower scores in order to
meet affirmative action goals.
</P>
<P>
   Evans will also immediately promote about two dozen white
officers who were passed over for promotion to sergeant and
lieutenant in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to appeal Xifaras' ruling, Evans was acknowledging
what a series of court rulings have concluded: that a 1980 consent
decree requiring affirmative action in promotions to address
decades of past discrimination against black officers should be
ended.
</P>
<P>
   While Evans must now adhere to strict Civil Service rankings in
promotions, he wants the right to consider race for promotional
purposes in order to ensure diversity and avoid the situation that
originally prompted the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, when the discrimination case that led to the consent
decree began, black officers were five percent of the force but
there were no blacks among the 222 sergeants. Currently, minorities
account for 30 percent of the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things being equal, is race a legitimate criteria?'' Evans
asked. ``I'm for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans has asked a task force to craft a broader procedure for
promotions that takes into account factors besides Civil Service
test scores, such as job performance and management skills.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he will continue to fight federal court cases where
he has used race as a tie-breaker between officers who scored the
same on Civil Service exams. And, while the consent decree for
promotions has ended, the department is still bound by another
federal court order requiring it to search out minority candidates
for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Xifaras' decision, in which he affirmed a Civil Service
Commission ruling against the affirmative action promotions, was
the most recent blow to race-based policies in the city. Last year,
a federal appeals court threw out an admissions policy at Boston
Latin School that used race as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, reaction was mixed as officials on both sides of
the issue viewed the ruling as a triumph or a terrible setback.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilor Charles C. Yancey said that while white males
account for just 30 percent of the city's population, they control
the majority of high-level jobs in the police and fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This society has a long way to go before we achieve a level
playing field,'' said Yancey, who has been holding hearings this
year to try to prevent a rollback in affirmative action hiring and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling must be viewed as a setback for those who believe
in any type of justice, in terms of having a police department that
reflects the makeup of the city -- at all levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Council President James M. Kelly applauded the ruling as a
proper continuation of the legal mindset that rejected the
race-based student assignment plan at Boston Latin. ``The courts
are clearly sending a message...that the end is near for race-based
hiring and promotions,'' he said. ``I consider it a positive step
towards a colorblind society, where people are judged based on
their qualifications and ability to do the job, rather than the
color of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he will move immediately to promote six white
officers, who were passed over in 1996, to lieutenant, and also do
the same for 25 white officers who would have been promoted to
sergeant that same year.
</P>
<P>
   While Xifaras' ruling only requires the city to promote the
officers, unions representing the men are seeking back pay and
other damages in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Money was not the issue for John M. McLean, who will now be
promoted to lieutenant. ``I think that the decision is good for the
department,'' said McLean, who was bypassed in 1996. ``I think it
gives everybody a fair and equal chance and I think the playing
field is level now. I don't think anybody who is in the police
department who wants to get ahead should be held back because of
the color of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sgt. William Bradley of the Massachusetts Minority Law
Enforcement Organization, which sought the original consent decree,
said he was ``appalled'' by the loss of affirmative action in
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minority citizen in the Commonwealth needs to be
outraged over this decision,'' Bradley said. ``We have been doing
race-based promotions for hundreds of years in this city. That's
why we have a Boston police department run by all white males. Now,
all of sudden, there's a problem when you are hiring blacks,
Asians, Hispanics and women.''

 &HT;    AutoNation stumbled over used-car hurdles
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AutoNation may have learned an old lesson: If you
can't beat 'em, join 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Its innovative approach to selling used cars _ no-haggle
pricing, salaried sales people and computer kiosks showing
inventory, all in a mall-like setting _ couldn't overcome the
serious advantages franchised new-car dealers have.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason the Fort Lauderdale-based company is
selling most of its used-car superstores and concentrating on its
new-car dealership empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very competitive business, and (new-car) dealers have
the advantage of first crack at cars coming off leases, from
trade-ins and in manufacturers' auctions,'' said Tom Thomson, an
analyst with First Union Securities in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, AutoNation announced that it was closing 23
superstores nationwide, and integrating the rest with new-car
dealerships. Its three other metro area stores either have been or
will be combined with new-car franchises, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the big box used-vehicle-only superstore is not
dead, but it's certainly lying on its deathbed,'' said Chris
Denove, an analyst in Los Angeles with J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with 409 new-car dealerships in 19 states, AutoNation is
several times the size of any other dealership group in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts and observers agree that the move was overdue,
because the superstores had dragged down the company's earnings for
years, they differ on how AutoNation went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   First Union's Thomson said AutoNation built stores that were too
large for their markets, didn't merchandise their vehicles properly
and didn't control costs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, competitor CarMax, a unit of Richmond-based Circuit
City, ``is doing a lot of little things better,'' he said. The
company has focus, the size of the stores is better tailored to the
markets, and it does a better job of customer service, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But like AutoNation, CarMax is turning to new cars to help the
bottom line and bring in inventory for its used-car stores. Many of
its superstores have new-car franchises. As a result, CarMax is
breaking even, but the jury is still out on its ultimate success,
Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power's Denove said AutoNation was having difficulty
selling used vehicles in a booming new-car market where
manufacturers can offer strong incentives to maintain market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price-conscious consumers who start looking for a used vehicle
soon learn that they can purchase a new model with a full warranty
for very little additional money,'' Denove said.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation populated its inventory with vehicles in what Denove
called the ``nearly new'' segment, which customers often substitute
for new vehicles, J.D. Power has determined from its analysis and
consumer satisfaction surveys.
</P>
<P>
   When manufacturers cut prices through incentives, it makes
nearly new vehicles less attractive. Compared with traditional
dealerships that renew leases and accept trade-ins on new cars, the
superstores have had to buy inventory on the open market at higher
cost and sell in a more competitive environment, resulting in lower
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles are coming into the nearly new market as leases expire
from a peak leasing period two to four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of bad timing,'' Denove said. ``There's a huge
supply of nearly new vehicles entering the system in conjunction
with heavy new-car incentives. It's a double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   While traditional dealers say they don't like to see any of
their colleagues fail, James A. Willingham, president of the
National Auto Dealers Association, said he thought AutoNation's
business model ``was wrong from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Salaried sales people, one-price selling _ over the long pull,
it just doesn't work,'' said the Long Beach, Calif.,
Buick-Pontiac-GMC dealer whose store is three miles from a closed
AutoNation superstore. ``They had too much overhead, and their
vehicle reconditioning was way too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Willingham pointed out that, in spite of AutoNation's size, it
never came close to selling as many used cars as franchised new-car
dealers. ``They had maybe 1 percent of all used cars and were not a
major player.''
</P>
<P>
   The used-car superstores were high-cost operations with no
chance of ever generating profits proportionate to their risk,
Michael Jackson, who joined AutoNation as chief executive in
October after running the North American operations of
Mercedes-Benz, told The New York Times. Even if AutoNation had been
willing to invest heavily, devote a lot of management time and wait
for years, he said, ``the cost structure in those stores would
still have been very high, leading to marginal operations.''
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation shares closed down 18 3/4 cents to $8.81 1/4 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation's annual sales are near $20 billion, and the closing
of the superstores will pare that by only $1 billion, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that these operations remained strong, but that
their profitability had been eroded by high costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``AutoNation faces a critical juncture,'' Robertson Stephens
analyst Jordan Hymowitz said in a research note. ``We believe that
Mr. Jackson will have to quickly take additional steps to secure
management retention and focus their energies on improving
franchised dealer margins.''

CLINTON PREPARES FOR RESUMPTION OF ISRAELI-SYRIAN PEACE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of secret maneuvering aimed at finally
ending the 50-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict, President Clinton
will play host Wednesday at the White House to a historic
resumption of Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Although no dramatic announcement is expected at the end of the
two-day meeting, the Clinton-sponsored talks will likely ``fast
track'' negotiations between the two enemies over the next several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hoping that the sides will reach a deal early next
year that will finally return the Golan Heights to Syria and
greatly reduce Arab military and terrorist threats to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly no expectation that they can reach a broad,
wide-ranging agreement on issues that are quite difficult and
longstanding. But I think what they will do ... is work hard to
find a process that allows them over a period of time to reach a
peace agreement,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent Tuesday preparing for the talks, which will run
through Thursday, by holding a series of meetings with his top
national security advisers and Middle East experts. Aides said the
president would open the talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Charaa but will not lead
them.
</P>
<P>
   The session is designed to let Barak and Charaa, who will be
acting on behalf of Syrian President Hafez Assad, talk out their
differences and lay out their requirements for resolving such
issues as the timing and security for what will amount to an
exchange of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Their one-on-one conversations will be a historic first. The two
sides have never held such high-level political talks before.
</P>
<P>
   The primary purpose of the talks is to decide when and how much
of the Golan Heights _ the hilly territory in southwestern Syria
bordering the Sea of Galilee that was captured by Israel in the
1967 war _ will be returned and what kind of security guarantees
Syria is prepared to give Israel. But the two men will also work on
a framework for normalizing relations between their two countries,
including the establishment of trade ties as well as diplomatic and
cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, along with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, will be available to
enter the discussions at any time.
</P>
<P>
   That the two sides are even talking at the moment is a testament
to Clinton's tenacity in trying to establish a comprehensive Middle
East peace encompassing all of the Arab states that border Israel.
The Syrians and Israelis broke off their talks in early 1996, but
Clinton kept pressure on both sides to resume their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who has been dealing with the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, has also been shuttling between Syria and Israel in
an attempt to strike up a peace agreement on that front as well.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clinton also began a series of phone conversations
with Assad and Barak in an attempt to gauge what each wanted in an
agreement that would finally end 50 years of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while,'' one Clinton aide said Tuesday, ``we began to
get a picture of what it would take from Assad's perspective and
Barak's to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, this official added, decided ``the timing was right''
to get the two sides together. Assad agreed to send Charaa to
Washington during a meeting last week with Albright in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, had been searching for an opening with the
Syrians since he was elected in May. In a move that Clinton
administration officials said ``got Assad's attention,'' Barak
started talking more publicly about pulling Israeli forces out of a
nine-mile-deep buffer zone in southern Lebanon, which they have
occupied for nearly 20 years fighting a war with Islamic guerrillas
tied to the Syrian-backed militant group known as Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Any peace agreement will have to include Syrian promises to
curtail the activities of Hezbollah and implement other security
guarantees that protect Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But while the situation in Lebanon will be an important issue in
the talks, the main subject will be the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured from Syria during the Arab-Israeli conflict. About 18,000
Israelis have since settled in the Golan, and Assad wants them
removed. He also wants all the territory returned that was taken
during the war, which would the land bordering the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   That demand poses some real problems for Israel because the
Galilee is an important source of fresh water for the Jewish state.
The Israelis have proposed drawing the final boundary line 30 feet
back from the water's edge to allow for access. So any final deal
would also have to include Israeli rights to the water or the
guarantee of a supply from some other source.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are formidable. But White House officials said
they are confident that the two sides can overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't believe their needs could be met, they probably
would not be at the table,'' said one senior administration
official during a briefing for reporters. ``They obviously believe
their needs can be met, but there's still a difference ... between
can be met and actually being met.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, this official said that ``we feel there is momentum
and we are going ... to be building on that momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there's a sense of urgency on both sides. I know
there's a sense of a commitment and a clear determination. But
there are differences,'' he added, citing the high-level of talks
as evidence that both sides ``are serious'' about coming up with a
formula for peace that works.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Barak has talked openly about some of the
``painful'' decisions that will have to be made to finalize a deal
with Syria. One of the most difficult, he said, will be moving
Israeli settlers out of the Golan Heights, where many of them have
called home for 18 years. But what Israelis fear more than anything
is giving up the strategic piece of territory where Israel has
maintained a defensive military positions for 32 years against a
possible military assault from Syria.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Knesset, Israel's parliament, put aside those
concerns Monday to vote its approval of Barak's trip to Washington
in search of peace. In a speech before the vote, Barak acknowledged
that Israel would likely have to pay ``a heavy price'' for an
agreement. But he said failure would only end up costing Israel
more ``in blood'' over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Clinton praised Barak for reaching out to Syria
at the same time he is trying to implement the peace agreement with
the Palestinians. But he said that ``whatever agreement he reaches
is going to be an agreement that makes Israel stronger, not
weaker.''

<P>
   LONDON _ After 36 years, Paul McCartney went back to, as the
sign above the entrance to the Cavern Club puts it, the place
``Where it all began.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Cavern Club, the small, sweaty, subterranean
Liverpool nightclub that launched the Beatles, last saw its most
famous progeny on Aug. 3, 1963. After that, it was auditoriums,
stadiums, and history for the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new album, and a new attitude after emerging from an
extended period of mourning the death of his wife Linda two years
ago, McCartney decided to go back to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, only 300 people could squeeze into the Cavern,
which is a replica of the old club that was torn down 26 years ago.
But another 12,000 crammed into a nearby park to watch the concert
on closed-circuit television, and it was beamed to 25 other
countries and a TV audience that its promoters said could total 500
million. The concert was also broadcast live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Beatles ever got big, we started out playing rock
n' roll at the Cavern,'' McCartney said before the show. ``I'm
going back as a nod to the music that always and will ever thrill
me. I cannot think of a better way to rock out the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The promoters hoped to break the all-time record for a TV
audience, which the Beatles set in 1967 with a concert called ``All
You Need is Love'' despite the inability then to broadcast it
behind the Iron Curtain. Now, with the Cold War over and the Soviet
bloc collapsed, McCartney can't be back in the USSR, but the
concert was beamed to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Baker, McCartney's spokesman, said the Russian audience
was expected to make the gig the most watched TV show ever.
</P>
<P>
   Between March 1961 and August 1963, the Beatles played the
Cavern no fewer than 275 nights. The original Victorian warehouse
at 10 Mathew St. was demolished for an underground railway that
never got built. Seeking to capitalize on the tourists who came to
Liverpool looking for the birthplace of the Beatles, a replica of
the Cavern, including bricks from the original, was built at the
site and opened in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 who watched the show inside the Cavern got their tickets
by lottery. Among them was John Ono Lennon, an 18-year-old
Englishman who legally changed his name to reflect his devotion to
what he calls ``the greatest band ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles remain more popular here with the parents of
18-year-olds, but McCartney, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth
II, occupies a special place in British society compared to the
other two surviving Beatles, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr didn't even join the Beatles as the drummer until after
the band had graduated beyond the claustrophobic confines of the
Cavern. McCartney first played the Cavern in 1958 with John
Lennon's band, The Quarrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is more common for the Cavern to host a disco with
recorded music than a live show, but McCartney treated a select
audience, and an estimated half-billion electronic onlookers, to
the club's and the Beatles' roots.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the wrinkly-faced grandfathers in other band reunions,
McCartney said getting on stage was not as natural as some might
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always about to give up, because it seems so unseemly,''
McCartney said, ``but then it seems so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatles traditionalists may have been disappointed by the play
list, which was heavy on the new songs of McCartney's new band and
album of the same name, Run Devil Run, and light on the familiar
Lennon-McCartney tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But the band included some heavyweights, including Pink Floyd's
guitarist David Gilmore, and the place rocked when McCartney sang
``I Saw Her Standing There,'' which he introduced as a song that
could have been from the 1950s or the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Sir Paul shouted, ending the gig. ``See you next
time.''

RULING INCREASES CHANCES THAT LINDA TRIPP WILL FACE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. _ A Maryland judge ruled Tuesday that the
immunity granted to Linda Tripp by the independent counsel's office
did not apply to state wiretapping charges against her, making it
increasingly likely that she will face trial for the secret
tape-recordings of Monica Lewinsky that led to the impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Diane Leasure of Howard County Circuit Court, ruled
that the immunity, granted during the special prosecutor's
investigation of Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton, only
prevented the state from using evidence gathered by federal
prosecutors after Feb. 19, 1998, which she ruled was the date that
the agreement took effect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Maryland prosecutors disclosed in court that
they had learned that as early as October 1997, Mrs. Tripp had
regaled women in her weekly bridge game in her neighborhood with
the information that she was secretly tape-recording telephone
conversations with a young woman named Monica who was having an
affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing Tuesday, the prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli, also
told the court that Mrs. Tripp's bridge companions had told a grand
jury that she spoke about the tapings at almost every game and that
she even invited Ms. Lewinsky to a Christmas party at her Columbia,
Md., home so that the neighbors could meet and gaze upon the woman
who was unwittingly being taped.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling on the effective date of the immunity is
potentially devastating to Mrs. Tripp's case. Lawyers for Mrs.
Tripp and the independent counsel's office have said that they
believed her immunity took effect on Jan. 16, 1998, when a lawyer
from the counsel's office told her she had been given protection
from prosecution after handing over the first of the tapes. But
Judge Leasure ruled that the immunity began on Feb. 19, 1998, when
a federal judge confirmed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Since prosecutors must prove that none of their evidence against
Mrs. Tripp was a result of work by the independent counsel's office
after the immunity, the ruling lets them cite the many news
accounts about the tapes that were printed or broadcast before Feb.
19.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli, the special state prosecutor bringing the case
against Mrs. Tripp, said he was ``delighted with the victory'' of
Judge Leasure's decision. He lost no time in telling the court how
he learned from several news accounts that Mrs. Tripp may have
violated Maryland's laws against taping someone without that
person's consent.
</P>
<P>
   One notable article, he said, was published in Newsweek on Feb.
2, 1998. Under Judge Leasure's ruling, the Newsweek account as well
as several others that appeared that January could be used by the
state to argue that prosecutors had learned of Mrs. Tripp's actions
independently.
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli's account of how Mrs. Tripp kept three bridge
companions informed of the taping meant that even if he had been
unable to use the news accounts from Jan. 16 to Feb. 19, he had at
least one other way in which he learned through his own
investigation that Mrs. Tripp had tape-recorded Ms. Lewinsky.
Montanarelli testified that one woman told the grand jury that she
saw Mrs. Tripp changing the batteries in the special machine she
used to record her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, and that she
asked if the taping was illegal. He said the woman, Kathleen
Manuel, testified that Mrs. Tripp told her, ``Yes, but no one is
ever prosecuted for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Maryland law, prosecutors must prove that Mrs. Tripp knew
that her secret tape recordings were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the week is likely to be taken up with further
prosecution efforts to show that its information used in indicting
Mrs. Tripp on two felony counts of violating Maryland's wiretapping
laws did not come from the work of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Murtha, Mrs. Tripp's lawyer in the criminal proceeding,
questioned Montanarelli intensively in the hope of demonstrating
that members of the prosecution team relied on the Starr report or
news reports about the independent investigation to help their own
investigation.

FRANCE CALLS FOR MORE TALKS BEFORE U.N. VOTE ON IRAQ

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Hours before the Security Council was to vote
on a new arms inspection system for Iraq Tuesday, France suddenly
asked to stop the clock, stunning council members, and irritating
some, by calling for more talks on a resolution that had been under
discussion for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official described the move as ``tragic,'' coming as it
did just after Russia's deputy representative here, Gennady
Gatilov, had told reporters that Russia would abstain, thereby
removing the threat of veto from a measure that could send arms
inspectors back to Iraq for the first time in a year.
</P>
<P>
   No new date was set for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about the resolution,'' a diplomat said, adding
that France appeared unable to take a stand that might damage its
relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very irritated, very angry that France is
prolonging this needlessly,'' the diplomat said. Another envoy said
that the council was being held hostage to ``domestic French
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which demands that a nine-year-old embargo be lifted
before inspections begin, threatened France last week with a
diplomatic break and the loss of oil contracts being sought by
French companies if France supported the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The French decision was conveyed late in the day in London to
the British, the sponsor of the resolution creating the new
inspection commission, and this month's Security Council president.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Americans offered no explanation why they
acquiesced to the French, after insisting for the last week that
the resolution was ready for a vote, and that there would be no
further negotiations. Richard Holbrooke, the chief U.S.
representative, has not been involved in negotiations on the Iraq
resolution, saying he had other pressing affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspection plan has been fine-tuned several times to
take Russian and French concerns into account, including the
addition of provisions that arms control experts say could reduce
the independence of the inspection commission.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appeared to confirm
the apprehensions when he told reporters that the U.N. disarmament
department would help him draw up a list of staff members for the
new commission. Arms experts say that should be left to the
commission's executive chairman, to be chosen by Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Annan pointedly did not mention the last chairman of Unscom, the
now-defunct original inspection commission, when talking about what
kind of candidate he was seeking for the new position. The last
chairman, Richard Butler, was known for his aggressive, direct
style in dealing with the Iraqis, who are accused of trying to
mislead and hamper the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected council setback on Iraq came as the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is responsible for all nuclear
inspections in Iraq, was also meeting resistance in Baghdad as it
tried to carry out monitoring unrelated to past or future U.N.
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, based in Vienna, said that if Iraq does not allow
inspectors to check the Iraqis' store of low-enriched uranium this
week, President Saddam Hussein will again be in violation of the
1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Iraq violated the treaty
consistently before the 1991 Gulf War, but those violations were
not discovered until after the war, when clandestine caches of
highly enriched uranium and plutonium were removed from the country
by U. N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the agency assembled a team of inspectors to make a
routine annual inspection of Iraq's remaining permitted uranium
stocks, which must be regularly monitored, David Kyd, spokesman for
the agency, said Tuesday. The Iraqis have not issued them visas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has said that it does not
have proof that the Iraqis have resumed building prohibited weapons
_ nuclear, biological or chemical _ independent disarmament experts
say that given a year without international inspections, it is more
than likely that Iraq has continued to look for ways to reconstruct
programs.
</P>
<P>
   No agency inspectors have been permitted to work in Iraq since
they and the inspectors of Unscom, which monitored biological,
chemical and missile systems, were evacuated ahead of American and
British airstrikes a year ago this week. At the Nuclear Control
Institute, an independent organization in Washington, Paul L.
Leventhal, the president, said that he feared that the atomic
agency's proposed visit to Iraq would be no more than an effort to
re-establish ``a formal and largely symbolic inspection
arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal, a consistent critic of the agency's record in Iraq,
said the IAEA had the power to conduct a more vigorous search under
the nonproliferation treaty.

 &HT;    Big fish Griffey Jr. still in water as baseball meetings roll on
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They relocated 38 players in a sequence of 14
trades. A couple of significant free agents _ Greg Vaughn and Todd
Zeile _ found new jobs. A few teams _ the Colorado Rockies, Tampa
Bay Devil Rays and Chicago Cubs _ significantly changed themselves
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when all the suits filed out of the Anaheim Marriott Tuesday
at the conclusion of the 98th baseball winter meetings, they
encountered the same apparition that greeted them when they arrived
last Friday: Ken Griffey Jr., available yet unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings' biggest deal was the one that collapsed early
Tuesday morning, when the New York Mets reached tentative agreement
with Seattle to exchange Octavio Dotel, Roger Cedeno and Armando
Benitez for Griffey. The Mets had the notion, but not the devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey rejected the deal by telephone, the tail again wagging
the dog as the Mariners reached another impasse in their
considerable efforts to deal away one of the most desired players
in the game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the longer you go, things change,'' Mariners
general manager Pat Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 of the 30 major league clubs declined to deal at the
meetings and the Atlanta Braves were one of them. Still, Atlanta
management maintained there was more at stake in their presence
here than frequent flyer miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk with every club here because I did that at the
general managers meeting,'' Braves GM John Schuerholz said. ``But
we talked to the clubs that we felt we had a chance to do something
with and one of these still remains a possibility. Another
possibility developed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it wasn't fruitless.''
</P>
<P>
   Customarily, Schuerholz refuses to be specific, but with free
agents outfielder Gerald Williams and shortstop Jose Hernandez
poised to leave the team, the Braves' needs are widely known. The
Braves discussed shortstop Alex Gonzalez with Toronto but came away
with stronger impressions for Los Angeles veteran infielder Jose
Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   Another target in the Dodgers' payroll purge, Viscount can
player third, shortstop or second base. And with $3.5 million
coming in 2000 salary, he is not cheap but affordable. But L.A.
cannot be certain of his availability until after the Adrian Beltre
ruling later in the week, which could declare the third baseman a
free agent because he was underage when signed.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard
</P>
<P>
   Trading was up at these winter meetings after eight trades for
22 players last year. But free agents signing were down two big
names (Vaughn and Zeile), compared to eight a year ago (including
Kevin Brown and Rickey Henderson).
</P>
<P>
   This was a function of two conditions. Primarily, it was a poor
free agent crop. Almost as important, a group of available pitchers
is waiting for left-hander Chuck Finley, the most attractive free
agent pitcher to set a market price. Seattle, Baltimore and
Cleveland are pursuing him, but none is willing to sign him at his
asking price for a three-year, $27 million contract. Once Finley
signs, Aaron Sele would probably be the next to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam has been orchestrated by agent Scott Boras, who
represents many of the best of the available pitchers: Kenny
Rogers, Darren Oliver, Omar Olivares and Andy Benes. He is
purposely waiting on Finley's contract before he will negotiate
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the meetings' highlight came when fellow agent Tommy
Tanzer challenged Boras to a parking lot fistfight late Saturday
night over an alleged case of client raiding....Oakland, suddenly a
force in the AL West, continues to push Anaheim for center fielder
Jim Edmonds, who could be had for pitcher Brett Laxton and two
prospects. . . . Appropriately, the ATM located in the lobby of the
Anaheim Marriott was broken as executives checked out Tuesday.

BOEING UNVEILS ITS JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER JET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ At a top-secret plant here in the Mojave
Desert, Boeing on Tuesday unveiled what could be its most important
airplane of the early 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a commercial jetliner, but a futuristic military jet
called the Joint Strike Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   And the competition is not European airplane maker Airbus
Industrie, but U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any measure, this is a great day,'' Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit told several hundred people who gathered at Boeing's JSF
assembly plant here to salute the company's entry in what could be
a $300 billion sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, its suppliers, its JSF partners and the military all are
involved in a project that Condit said is redefining how airplanes
of the future will be made.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 Boeing JSF workers in Seattle watched the event via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the future,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Boeing's 777 has been called a 21st Century
commercial jetliner. ``I'm here to tell you the Joint Strike
Fighter, which builds upon what was done on the 777, and improved
dramatically on what was done, is the 21st Century tactical
fighter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prize that Boeing and Lockheed Martin are after could be the
most lucrative military procurement program ever _ upwards of $200
billion for nearly 3,000 Joint Strike Fighters for the U.S. Navy,
Air Force and Marines and the British Royal Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Defense experts estimate potential foreign sales of between
2,000 to 3,000 planes, which could make the JSF contract worth more
than a third of a trillion dollars over the next four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter would not enter service until around 2008 or 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes competition will be decided by the Pentagon in
2001, following a six-month flyoff between two concept
demonstration planes built by Boeing and two built by Lockheed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing demonstration jets are known as the X-32A and X-32B.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had been expected to unveil only the X-32A on Tuesday,
but when a large black curtain was pulled back at the ceremony,
both aircraft, painted white, were parked nose to nose.
</P>
<P>
   The X-32A is about to enter a ground test program, leading to
its first flight in the spring. Construction on the X-32B began
several months later but assembly has gone so well that it has
closed the gap to about six weeks. It is still missing the engine,
the pilot seat and some wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ceremony was not the traditional rollout that Boeing
holds for new models of its commercial passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the event was billed as a special salute to what Boeing
calls its JSF One Team in Palmdale, Seattle, St. Louis and around
the world. The unveiling ceremony also was to mark the
``ton'' of the X-32A into the flight test phase of the
program, including initial ground testing.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly building where the two planes were unveiled is a
windowless, nondescript hangar that is officially called the High
Desert Assembly, Integration and Test Center. It is on Site 1 of a
sprawling tract of arid California desert known as Plant 42,
operated by the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing leases the space. A few hundred feet away is the Boeing
Orbiter Major Modification Facility, where NASA's space shuttles
are hauled in on the back of 747s for refurbishing.
</P>
<P>
   Ground testing and first flights of the X-32A and X-32B will
take place here. Then tests will move to nearby Edwards Air Force
Base and eventually to the Navy's Patuxent River test facility in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The X-32A will demonstrate the requirements for the conventional
take off plane to be flown by the Air Force and Navy. The X-32B
will demonstrate the short take off and vertical landing
requirements of the plane needed by the Marines and British Royal
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Although final assembly of the two X-planes is in Palmdale, the
headquarters for Boeing's JSF effort is Seattle. Key sections of
the X-32 were built in St. Louis and Seattle. The one-piece wing
skins were manufactured in Seattle and taken to Palmdale on
military cargo planes. Parts come from suppliers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Long before final assembly began on a hanger floor, the two
planes had been put together by engineers many hundreds of times in
computer simulations in St. Louis and in Seattle. Design flaws were
spotted and fixed. The virtual reality system was developed for
Boeing's 777. With JSF, it has been taken to the next level and
beyond, Boeing says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You folks are going to define how we design, build,
manufacture, assemble, test and qualify aircraft of the future _
because you know how to do it,'' Frank Statkus, Boeing vice
president and general manager of its JSF program, said in opening
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Vavrik, a 33-year-old engineer from Auburn, Wash.,
represented the 700 or so Seattle JSF team members at the unveiling
ceremony. He got to make the trip because his name was pulled from
a hat _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   His job is to help design the cockpit at the Boeing
Developmental Center near Boeing Field in Seattle. Just as Boeing
talked with its customers about what they wanted to see in the 777,
Boeing is talking with fighter pilots about what kind of cockpit
they want for the JSF. The pilots meet with Vavrik and his team
about every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's cockpit concept is to free the pilot to be a
``tactician'' who can concentrate on weapons deployment, Vavrik
said. The pilot would not have to waste time processing data from
the fighter's many sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Boeing needs to beat Lockheed Martin before the full
cockpit design becomes a reality. The demonstration planes do not
have weapons systems installed.
</P>
<P>
   Vavrik and other members of the Boeing team are confident of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, at least, the competition is close. Only a mile
and a half of sagebrush and Joshua trees separate Boeing's facility
and Lockheed Martin's famed Skunk Works plant that is home to its
two JSF demonstration aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   JSF could be the last fighter that the United States builds
until well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pentagon insists this is a ``winner take all''
competition, many defense experts and industry analysts don't
believe it. They say both contractors will share production to
preserve the U.S. defense industrial base.
</P>
<P>
   Lean manufacturing practices and cost-cutting initiatives are
driving the JSF competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affordability is the key to the program,'' Statkus said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Pentagon has opted for performance over cost.
The Air Force's new air superiority F-22 stealth fighters now in
flight testing will cost nearly $200 million each.
</P>
<P>
   With JSF, the Pentagon is demanding that Boeing or Lockheed
Martin build a fighter with cutting-edge stealth and capability
that will cost from $28 million to $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's about what a Boeing F-18 cost today, and far less than a
Boeing F-15 costs. Both those fighters have been around for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   And the challenges for the two companies just begin there.
</P>
<P>
   The new fighter must be able to fly at supersonic speed. And as
the name implies, it must meet the requirements of more than one
branch of the service.
</P>
<P>
   Marine, Navy and Air Force versions will be nearly identical.
Commonality helps keep the cost down.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Lockheed Martin were awarded about $700 million each
to build their demonstration planes. Statkus said Tuesday that
Boeing's JSF program is on budget, on schedule and has a surplus in
case of any last-minute snags.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins the competition, the production planes
will look different than the concept demonstration jets. In
Boeing's case, the difference is significant.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Boeing redesigned its plane to save weight and
money, and to improve the fighter's stealth and and
maneuverability.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-foot-wide diamond-shaped wing will now look more like a
conventional swept wing. The fuselage has been lengthened by two
feet and a second horizontal tail has been added. Boeing also
changed the huge engine air intake on the front of the fighter from
a forward sweep to a rearward sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Those design changes came too late to be included in the two
concept demonstration planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has further evolved its design in the last couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is willing to accept computer models that can
predict the flying characteristics of the design without flying the
new wing in the demonstration phase.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced last year that should it win the JSF
competition, it will produce the fighters in St. Louis,
headquarters of its military aircraft and missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   Some defense experts and analysts say Boeing is the underdog in
its competition with Lockheed, even if it is found to have the
winning JSF design.
</P>
<P>
   If the competition is close, the thinking goes, the Pentagon
will pick Lockheed Martin because it can least afford to lose. If
Boeing wins, it would become ``America Aerospace,'' said Richard
Aboulafia, senior aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, a market
research and consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be No. 1 for both military and commercial,'' he
said. ``From an industrial base point, that's why Lockheed Martin
probably has the edge. It's difficult for anyone to accept the idea
of a single America Aerospace.''

ANALYSIS: CANAL TRANSFER MARKS END OF `AMERICAN CENTURY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIRAFLORES LOCKS, Panama _ Millennium celebrations may still be
a couple of weeks away, but the American Century symbolically ended
here Tuesday with a ceremony marking the transfer of the Panama
Canal to Panama.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, nothing compared with Washington's decision to build
the canal as a statement of U.S. determination to stand as a world
power, even if it meant assisting Panama's secession from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   And while the phrase American Century was actually coined by
Henry Luce in 1941, it could have been the motto of President
Theodore Roosevelt, who dominated the organizational, medical and
engineering tour de force that connected the Atlantic and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six years later, Tuesday's ceremony noting the imminent
turnover reflects the more patient and, above all, more cooperative
role in the world that the United States now says it seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a late 20th-century sense of sovereignty and respect for
somebody else's national pride, a great power is in fact
voluntarily giving a piece of valuable national property to a tiny
nation with no capacity to seize it.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, the venturesome role of presidents
like the Theodore Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson seems to have given
way, if not fully to the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist views
of Woodrow Wilson, then at least to a sense of the importance of
consultation and coalition before bombs are dropped. In Korea and
Vietnam, the United States acted first, then looked for allies. In
the Persian Gulf and Kosovo, it sought allies first.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton's decision to stay away from the
ceremony, though it caused disappointment and even criticism in
Panama, meant that the United States would not dominate the day.
</P>
<P>
   That star role was left to Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso,
who used the occasion to build political bridges by hailing the
Panamanian architect of the turnover, the late Gen. Omar Torrijos,
even though he seized power by a coup that ousted her late husband
from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's events went without a hitch, except for a soloist who
mangled the words to ``The Star Spangled Banner.'' But these events
were entirely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of canal authority has been going on since the
treaties were ratified in 1978, and indeed the final step will not
be taken until Dec. 31, with far less hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso and former President Jimmy Carter, leading the U.S.
delegation, signed a piece of paper in essence promising to keep on
implementing the transfer treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But the almost casual U.S. approach to giving away the canal
that cost it $352 million and 5,609 lives should not obscure the
difficulties that Carter had in winning Senate ratification, with
only one vote to spare _ even though then, as now, not a single
U.S. aircraft carrier would fit into the canal and nuclear
submarines never used it.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's rhetoric that ``We bought it. We built it. It's
ours and we are going to keep it'' resonated with Republicans
(despite support for the treaty from ex-Presidents Richard M. Nixon
and Gerald R. Ford), and fears of Cuban and Soviet aggression made
some Senate votes to ratify into tickets to electoral defeat.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Carter scoffed at treaty opponents as ``demagogues''
and said, ``There are still a few of them in my nation today.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, critics of Panama's administration of the canal
have made no impact. One longtime foe of the handover, Howard
Phillips of the Conservative Caucus, was in Panama on Tuesday
calling for a new treaty to re-establish U.S. bases, and offering
to help clean up unexploded ordnance in the jungle in return.
</P>
<P>
   He also demanded that Panama cancel a port-management contract
with Hutchison-Whampoa, a worldwide company based in Hong Kong,
which he charged would provide a foothold for China to threaten the
canal's security.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Tuesday's talk was of cooperation. Moscoso spoke of
efforts to make the canal ``a world class enterprise that will
permit it to continue offering safe, efficient and competitive
service to the international maritime community.'' Carter said the
United States wanted to be ``a full partner, a harmonious partner,
an equal partner to answer any request to come from Panama to make
the canal even greater in the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   On most international issues, from global warming to trade to
poison gas or atomic bombs, the U.S. government seeks agreements
among many or all nations. It often fails, and frequently does not
convince its own people of the need for sacrifice some see in these
agreements. But even when it acts unilaterally, as by raising
tariffs on some French luxury foods, it follows procedures
authorized internationally.
</P>
<P>
   The engineering may have been harder, but the world was a
simpler place for Roosevelt. No one except the Colombians and a few
U.S. senators, many of whom favored a different canal route,
objected to the U.S. help given the Panamanian revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But some things remain the same. The United States could dream
of a canal because it was the world's foremost economic power. The
huge steel plates for the gates of the Miraflores locks came from
Pittsburgh, while the hardware _ bearings, valves, gears and struts
_ came from Wheeling, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Today the U.S. economy is still the world's greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was boldness the only measure of Roosevelt's foreign policy.
In 1905, settling on a new chief engineer for the canal distracted
him at least briefly from efforts to mediate the end of the
Russo-Japanese War, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of role has remained a U.S. value as the American
Century ends. Clinton did not come to Panama on Tuesday, but he
will be trying to help Israel and Syria make peace in Washington on
Wednesday.

COUNTDOWN BEGINS FOR SHUTTLE LAUNCH TO REPAIR HUBBLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ After weeks of setbacks, the countdown
for what NASA bills as an urgent shuttle mission to replace the
Hubble Space Telescope's faltering gyroscopes was finally under way
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery, with seven astronauts aboard, is
scheduled to blast off at 9:18 p.m. EST Thursday from the Kennedy
Space Center for a 10-day repair mission. Successive failures of
the Hubble's gyroscopes, a crucial component of the telescope's
precision pointing system, forced astronomers to halt celestial
observations a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The flight will mark only the third shuttle mission of the year,
the fewest since 1988, when a beleaguered NASA was recovering from
the fatal 1986 Challenger accident.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency officials say this year's slower pace is driven by
a new sense of caution prompted by the electrical short that
jeopardized the July launching of the shuttle Columbia with the
Chandra X-Ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted NASA to suspend future launch plans while
it looked for the cause and to inspect its shuttles for other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are taking a very close look at everything,'' said
Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program manager. ``Maybe something we
would have flown with in the past and maybe not brought up as a big
deal _ these things are under a microscope and elevated to the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's short was traced to damaged insulation on the
electrical wiring buried in the shuttle's fuselage. When shuttle
managers ordered inspections of Discovery as well as Endeavour and
Atlantis, similar insulation nicks were found. Engineers concluded
the damage was inadvertent but caused by shuttle ground personnel
as they repeatedly placed work platforms against the wiring as they
prepared the winged spacecraft for past missions.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, 57 repairs to the fuselage wiring of Discovery were
required, and NASA is revising the procedures and modifying the
equipment its ground forces use to work on the shuttle as a result
of Columbia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, plans announced by NASA in March for a mid-October
shuttle visit to Hubble to fix the ailing gyros slipped seven times
as shuttle managers dealt with the wiring problems and learned of
other safety threats.
</P>
<P>
   The new problems ranged from a bent fuel line and a rocket
engine containing a broken drill bit that had to be replaced to a
leaking hydraulic system that had to be fixed. Wiring harnesses
outside the fuselage also required unscheduled replacements or
repairs. The launchings of Endeavour and Atlantis that were planned
for late this year have slipped into late January and mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   As Discovery's countdown began, shuttle managers were hopeful
the obstacles were behind them.
</P>
<P>
   They have prepared for consecutive launch attempts Thursday,
Friday and Saturday, if necessary, before postponing Discovery's
launching until mid-January. Typically, NASA makes two consecutive
launching attempts, then allows its personnel to rest on the third
day before resuming the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the space agency wants Discovery's crew back on the ground
no later than Dec. 28. Though it has ensured the shuttle's software
is Y2K compliant, the space agency does not plan to risk any
computer problems by flying on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That means several hundred personnel in the mission control
facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston will work over
Christmas, a rarity for NASA but something that will become common
place as it assembles the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   According to forecasters, the prospects of favorable weather
conditions for Thursday and Friday are 80 percent, with low clouds
the only concern. Conditions deteriorate slightly Saturday, when
rain is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, Discovery's crew plans to rendezvous with the
42-foot-long telescope and grapple it with the shuttle's
50-foot-long robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   After the telescope has been secured in Discovery's cargo bay,
astronauts Steve Smith, John Grunsfeld, Mike Foale and Claude
Nicollier will begin a series of four lengthy spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble is one of the world's most powerful observatories. Since
its launch in 1990, it has enabled scientists to study the
frontiers of the universe. It circles the Earth every 90 minutes at
an altitude of about 360 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The gyros will be replaced first, and the task can be completed
with a single spacewalk. But the astronauts also plan to install
another guidance system device, a new flight computer, battery
voltage regulators, a transmitter and data recorder. If time
permits, they will attempt to patch the exterior insulation of the
telescope which was damaged by solar radiation and corrosive
elements in the Earth's thin upper atmosphere.

GERMANS AGREE TO ESTABLISH $5-BILLION FUND TO COMPENSATE SLAVE
LABORERS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After months of bitter negotiations, German industry
and government officials agreed on Tuesday to establish a fund of
roughly $5.1 billion to compensate slave laborers during the Nazi
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Though important details were still being ironed out,
negotiators on both sides said on Tuesday night that they had
reached an agreement on the central question, the amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the effort could ultimately affect more than one
million surviving victims of Nazi Germany's systematic use of
forced labor, though nobody is yet sure how many people may
ultimately file claims.
</P>
<P>
   American government officials estimate that there are about
240,000 surviving slave laborers, about half of them Jewish, who
were held in concentration camps and forced to work under
nightmarish conditions. The fund would also compensate a much
larger number of ``forced'' laborers, most of whom were not Jewish
and were brought in from the Soviet Union, Poland and other East
European countries to work in German factories. Officials estimate
that this group numbers anywhere from 700,000 to 1.5 million
people. In both cases, compensation would be paid to victims who
were alive as of last February.
</P>
<P>
   Although fewer than 100,000 of the former forced workers are
Americans, the negotiations were driven almost entirely by American
class-action attorneys and Jewish groups, as well as the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   German industry executives have been worried about the suits,
but even more by the prospect of a conflict with American customers
and business partners.
</P>
<P>
   American and German officials said they now hope to finish
negotiating the main elements of the plan on Friday in Berlin.
German corporations will contribute at least half of the money for
the new humanitarian fund, and the German government will
contribute the rest. American companies with German subsidiaries,
including General Motors and Ford Motor Co., are also expected to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the fund could provide as much as $7,500 for each
surviving slave laborer and most likely smaller amounts for forced
laborers. But attorneys involved in the talks predicted some
bruising disputes about the rules governing how former workers will
qualify for those payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement, there is absolutely no doubt about
that,'' said Michael Witti, an attorney in Munich representing
former workers. ``But anybody who thinks this will all go through
smoothly is living in a dream world.''
</P>
<P>
   Though about three-quarters of the fund's money will be used to
compensate forced workers, the settlement is also intended to
resolve other unresolved claims arising from the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also will be used to compensate victims of so-called
``Aryanization'' programs _ Jews and other non-Germans who were
forced by the Nazis to sell their property at firesale prices. And
it will be used to handle lingering claims against insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reached after marathon bargaining over the
telephone between Jewish groups, American class-action lawyers,
German industry and the German government. It was mediated by
Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy secretary of the Treasury, and
Otto Graf Lambsdorff, a former economics minister of West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are scheduled to arrive in Berlin on Friday to work out
final details and formally announce an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for contributing to the fund, German industrial
companies, ranging from DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen to Siemens,
will be given immunity from future lawsuits over the use of forced
labor. German banks will be freed from claims arising from the the
``Aryanization programs.''
</P>
<P>
   All companies will contribute to a common humanitarian fund set
up by an independent German foundation, which will then transfer
money to designated organizations representing surviving workers in
the United States as well as in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that an agreement has been reached,'' said
Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for the German industry foundation.
``I hope that the money will come relatively quickly to the
surviving victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement on establishing a fund of roughly 10 billion
German marks entailed big compromises on both sides. Attorneys
representing former workers had demanded 20 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
   German negotiators, as well as Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, had
insisted as recently as last week that there would be no money
beyond the eight billion marks proposed last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, advocates for former workers said they were
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a measure of justice for slave laborers who have
waited a very long time,'' said Gideon Taylor, executive vice
president of the Jewish Conference on Material Claims Against
Germany, which has been collecting and distributing funds from
Germany on behalf of forced workers for the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn Weiss, one of the Americanclass-action attorneys
representing former slave laborers, said he was unhappy about
accepting 10 billion marks, but felt he had had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good about it, but it is a pragmatic decision,''
said Weiss. ``At this point, we don't have a choice because of the
needs of aging victims and the pressure from governments to get
this resolved.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may be only a matter of days before a new round of bickering
breaks out over how to distribute money to victims. Class-action
attorneys are already incensed over the draft of a German law that
would establish the rules for running the new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Witti sharply attacked a provision of the draft law that would
prohibit a person who had received compensation from other programs
for victims of the Holocaust from receiving any money from the new
humanitarian fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the agreement will fall apart because of these
issues, but that rule is totally unacceptable and there will be
significant disputes over it,'' he said.

MONTANA SENATE CANDIDATE HITS THE ROAD WITH HEALTH-COSTS CRUSADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FERNIE, British Columbia _ Al Gonder had a heart attack a few
years ago and now takes six different prescription drugs every day.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Blalock is recovering from hip replacement surgery.
Her husband, Luke, recently had heart surgery. Both take several
medicines regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Tombarge needs expensive inhalants. Vince Megaro takes drugs
to lower his blood pressure and cholesterol level.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 35 retired people from Montana, all of them on
Medicare and all with out-of-pocket pharmaceutical bills of well
over $1,000 a year, who took a day-long bus trip Tuesday to buy
medicine in this ski-resort town across the U.S. border with
Canada. Typically in Canada, filling a prescription costs a third
to a half of what it costs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was organized by Brian Schweitzer, the Democratic
candidate for the U.S. Senate from Montana, who has made the high
cost of drugs to uninsured retirees in the United States the
centerpiece of his uphill campaign to unseat Republican incumbent
Conrad Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about embarrassing Congress,'' Schweitzer told the
group, ``so your pharmacist can get drugs for the same price as
pharmacists around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Schweitzer promises, he will fight to repeal the law
that prohibits prescription medicine from being imported into the
United States, and he will work for Medicare coverage of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Schweitzer is the only Democratic Senate candidate to
focus on the issue. But James Jordan, political director of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he expected the cost
of prescription drugs to the uninsured elderly to be a central
campaign issue across the country next year.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, running for a third term, opposes repealing the law
against importing drugs on the ground that Americans could be
subjected to adulterated and inferior medicine. His spokesman, Matt
Raymond, said the senator favored Medicare coverage of prescription
drugs in principle but had not seen legislation he could support.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Clinton proposed expanding Medicare to
cover part of the cost of prescription medicine, but the
Republican-controlled Congress never seriously considered the
measure. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the plan
would cost $168 billion over two years, much more than Republicans
were prepared to spend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schweitzer's bus left Missoula before dawn with 10 passengers
and picked up more at small towns all along Route 93 to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Over the bus' loudspeaker, Schweitzer said he understood that
pharmaceutical companies needed to make healthy profits to pay for
their valuable research. Then he added, referring to the fact that
uninsured old people must pay full cost for medications: ``But why
do senior citizens in this country pay 100 percent of the cost of
research and development, and everyone else gets a free ride?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the only developed country without a
national health care system. In Canada and the other developed
countries, the government buys American drugs, and puts a fixed
price on them well below the unregulated price in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies in the United States also negotiate lower
prices for their customers. So essentially the only people in the
world who pay top dollar are Americans who do not have insurance
that covers prescription medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The people on the bus, of course, were all on Schweitzer's side.
``I don't know that I'm smart enough to say what needs to be
done,'' said Gonder, who boarded the bus at Polson. ``But it's a
whale of a burden on people who are retired and on a fixed income
to expect them to subsidize the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonder, 72, is a retired merchant marine radio operator who
lives on Social Security and a modest private pension. Here in
Fernie on Tuesday, he paid $280.32 for a three-month supply of each
of six drugs he takes regularly. In Montana, the cost would have
been about $450.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law against bringing prescription drugs into the
United States for one's own use.
</P>
<P>
   To buy drugs in Canada, Americans need a prescription from a
Canadian doctor. Schweitzer's brother, Mike, is a physician in
Billings and a past president of the Montana Medical Association.
He arranged for Dr. Ron Clark here to meet the Americans, look at
their prescriptions and write identical ones.
</P>
<P>
   Clark saw each of the Americans for two to three minutes,
charged them $10 apiece and gave them new prescriptions. They then
walked across the street to the IGS Value Drug Mart, to have their
prescriptions filled.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second bus trip for drugs Schweitzer has organized
this fall, and he is getting from them the kind of statewide
publicity essential for a 44-year-rancher who has never held public
office.
</P>
<P>
   He trails Burns by 2-to-1 in opinion polls, but Democrats in
Washington see this race as one of their best chances to pull an
upset.

 &HT;    What's missing from our picture of the world 1,000 years ago? A
sense of the experience of everyday life: the sights and sounds and
sensations that time washes away almost instantly.
 &HT;    And so, in an effort to try to document the texture of life
today, at least in a single place in a single moment, the New York
Minute was born.
 &HT;    On Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its
symmetry, a variety of writers fanned out to document a single
minute _ the same minute _ in the life of The Big Apple.

along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan
Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: ``gru, gru, grug, gu-grug,
groooaaaaar.'' Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls
in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed
on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph
Lauren shirt behind four kids with backpacks and baggy jeans. All
easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young
Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored
tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled
crowd, cutting a path. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks
and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the
light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt
turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the
truck's path. The driver stops; she nods and hurries on, into her

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Moscow's embattled and combative Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
held a rally at the foot of the Kremlin on Tuesday night, under the
nose of opponents who for weeks have been orchestrating his
political hanging.
</P>
<P>
   With five days to go before an election in which he is running
both as mayor and as a leader of an anti-Kremlin parliamentary
bloc, Luzhkov told tens of thousands of people, most of them city
workers mobilized by pro-Luzhkov trade unions, that he would take
his fight against President Boris Yeltsin and his entourage to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are afraid of us because we will call them to account
because they robbed the country and stole our money,'' Luzhkov
roared, stabbing the chilly air with his finger. ``But we are not
afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If Luzhkov sounds defensive and angry these days, he has good
cause. For the last two months, he has been the unlucky star of a
Sunday night program on a Kremlin-friendly television channel where
he has been attacked, lampooned, exposed and accused of most crimes
imaginable in Russia today.
</P>
<P>
   The steady barrage of attacks, broadcast by Sergei Dorenko, a
journalist disavowed by the Russian journalists' union for his
attack-dog style and slippery use of the facts, has already cut
into support for Luzhkov's Fatherland-All Russia electoral bloc,
which he heads together with former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance, once a favorite in Sunday's parliamentary
elections, has now slipped to third place, behind the Communist
Party, the largest bloc in Parliament, and a new pro-Kremlin
alliance headed by Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoygu, according to
several public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The negative publicity has also chipped away at Luzhkov's once
overwhelming lead in the Moscow mayoral race, which he had moved up
one year to ensure himself a solid position ahead of next summer's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, who won re-election in Moscow three years ago with more
than 90 percent of the vote, is still by far the most popular
candidate in a crowded field. But some polls suggest that two other
candidates with tacit Kremlin backing _ former Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and Pavel Borodin, the affable head of the
Kremlin's property management department _ may together get enough
votes to force Luzhkov into a humiliating runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Such an outcome would permanently damage Luzhkov's reputation as
Moscow's can-do political boss, the man who has swept the city
clean, erected thousands of new housing units, and bamboozled
builders and businessmen into backing ambitious schemes that have
changed the city's landscape. The most monumental of these is the
giant Cathedral of Christ Our Savior, rebuilt in record time on a
spot where an original 19th century church was destroyed in the
1930s by Stalin, in the Communist Party's campaign against
religion.
</P>
<P>
   For this and more, many Muscovites remain unquestionably loyal
to Luzhkov. ``He has brought back order to the city,'' said Raisa
Riabova, a pensioner who holds down a part-time job at a city
school. ``Do you remember the dirt there was everywhere before? It
was enough to make you cry.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when he first founded his Fatherland party (All
Russia came later with an alliance with a handful of powerful
regional governors), Luzhkov had clearly set his sights on the
Kremlin itself. But when Primakov, then Russia's most trusted
politician, agreed to join his team last August, Luzhkov willingly
gave Primakov the top spot on the party's parliamentary ticket and
a clear shot at the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Dorenko and financier Boris Berezovsky, a
Kremlin insider and friend of the Yeltsin family, turned their
media guns on the mayor with ORT, Russia's top television channel,
controlled by Berezovsky, which reaches virtually every household
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brought back on the air for the election campaign, Dorenko has
been merciless, as he examined Luzhkov's use of patronage, his
administration's record for browbeating businesses, his quick
change of political colors (Luzhkov was once a vociferous Yeltsin
supporter) and his alleged involvement in the murder four years ago
of an American businessman, Paul Tatum.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Christ Our Savior Cathedral has come in for blistering
criticism of its use of cheap materials.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as a parting shot, Dorenko _ who delivers his lethal
blows with a light touch of irony _ sent a helicopter flying over
Luzhkov's country estate, with its tennis courts, stables and
riding arena and mansions for his deputies. In the meantime,
Borodin, shrugging off charges that he accepted kickbacks from
Mabetex Project Engineering Group, a Swiss construction firm that
did work in the Kremlin, has been giving sweeping promises to
voters, while Kiriyenko has been methodically critiquing Moscow's
murky finances.
</P>
<P>
   Fumbling to keep pace with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his
allies, Luzhkov and Primakov have moved closer to the Communists,
with whom they are likely to unite in an anti-Kremlin alliance in
the new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But Luzhkov has also been put on the defensive in his own city.
Kiriyenko _ a member of Yeltsin's team of economic reformers and
leader of a new right-wing party _ said recently on a Moscow radio
program that his criticism of the city's administration is sure to
change the way Moscow is run, regardless of who is elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov's biggest mistake, some analysts say, was in trying to
supplant the Communists as the chief critic of Kremlin policies,
and in fanning a wave of scandals that last summer enveloped
members of Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else did Luzhkov expect from the presidential clan,''
wrote Natalya Arkhangelskaya in an article in the weekly magazine
Expert. ``If he set out to wash the Kremlin's dirty linen in
public, he should have been prepared for a public display of his
own dirty linen.''

IRS WORKERS REPORT BEING PRESSURED TO LAY OFF TAX CHEATS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is reducing its efforts to find
cheating by businesses and high-income individuals, and stepping up
investigations into two forms of cheating that are more likely to
involve the working poor than the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Congress to help taxpayers more, the IRS is
also moving employees who audit and collect taxes from companies
and high-income individuals to answer telephones around the clock,
work counters at walk-in centers and resolve the tax disputes of
estranged couples.
</P>
<P>
   The number of audits will be cut in the fiscal year that began
this autumn by 30 percent to 40 percent from the record low number
of two years ago, the latest for which data are available, the IRS
commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, said. Not even one in 300 tax
returns will be audited this fiscal year, down from one in 217 two
years ago and one in 63 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS plans to continue giving its highest priority to
auditing the 1,600 largest corporations. But it will sharply reduce
audits of the other 16 million businesses in America, the vast
majority of them privately owned, and of the rapidly increasing
ranks of high-income Americans, who tend to file complex returns
that create opportunities to shortchange the government.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fifth of IRS employees, the equivalent of nearly
21,000 people working full time, will be assigned to customer
service, up from 12,000 four years ago by one measure and nearly
18,000 by another. By either measure there are thousands fewer
workers available to conduct audits and collect overdue taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to find tax cheating is being reduced even more than
these numbers suggest, according to more than four dozen IRS
employees. In interviews they described pressure from managers to
avoid upsetting taxpayers, to overlook complex issues and to close
audits quickly. Some agents have coined a term for these
once-over-lightly examinations of tax returns: audit lite.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these sharp cuts in personnel to enforce the tax laws,
the tax agency is planning a new assault on abuse of the Earned
Income Tax Credit, in which the working poor can collect up to $323
for individuals and up to $3,556 for a family of four. The credit
was created to offset the sharp rise in Social Security tax rates
that began two decades ago. Some people make false claims to
increase their payment from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also plans a major new hunt for people who failed to
file tax returns. While anyone can fail to file a tax return, tax
workers said the last such search, early in this decade, focused on
people of modest means, and they expect the same this time. The IRS
says it intends to focus this search on people who owe substantial
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The tax agency also plans one new initiative aimed squarely at
the wealthy, an attack on abusive trusts to avoid estate taxes, but
this program will not begin until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the crackdown on abusive trusts, these changes all
grow out of a series of new tax laws sponsored by the Republicans
who control Congress. The most significant of these laws, the IRS
Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, was passed after Senate
Finance Committee hearings in which the IRS was described as out of
control and routinely abusive of taxpayers. Much of the most
explosive testimony has since been discredited and a subsequent
General Accounting Office report found no evidence of systematic
mistreatment of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., who sponsored the IRS overhaul
legislation, would not comment beyond a statement that the changes
taking place were the kind of temporary issues that should be
expected when an agency is undergoing a major transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings, the new laws and Rossotti's policies together have
had a profound effect on the agency's employees, especially the
low-level managers whose daily decisions determine how the tax laws
are administered. Many of these managers have concluded that they
are supposed to wilt before the rich and powerful, especially those
who can get a politician on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't aggravate taxpayers _ that's what our managers are
telling us,'' said one veteran revenue agent in New York. As he
spoke six colleagues nodded in agreement and offered similar
comments from their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   A revenue agent in Florida said his manager told him: ``Don't
probe deeply. Just find three or four obvious items and close the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   An IRS worker in Nashville, Tenn., said anyone there could get
their tax case resolved favorably if they have enough influence to
get their senator or congressman to complain to the IRS on their
behalf. ``We just collapse,'' the 14-year veteran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't call us tax collectors in the newspaper,'' said
one veteran revenue officer in New York. ``We don't collect taxes
anymore. We aren't allowed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief of IRS operations, John Dalrymple, said ``none of
these comments shock me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was given a synopsis of comments from interviews with IRS
workers in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Michigan, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, nearly all of
whom spoke on condition that they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also am hearing things that have the same general tone,''
Dalrymple said. He added that he would characterize their comments
this way: ``Hey, what is the service's policy going to be around
compliance and enforcement? And how are we going to balance the
need for good customer service on an individual basis with our
responsibility to make sure that people are paying their fair
share?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it is a discussion that we have been having at the
highest levels of the organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said in a statement responding to questions about
the changes: ``Without question, it will take time for IRS agents
who have done things one way for the past 40 years to learn the new
approach, which is built on better serving taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple said he and other key agency executives had traveled
the country telling IRS workers that enforcement is important and
that all taxpayers are to be treated alike, without regard for
their economic or social standing.
</P>
<P>
   He said this message was not getting through and that efforts to
stamp out the mistaken belief that the new policy favors the
wealthy had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles and I have been talking about this for quite
sometime,'' he said, adding that Rossotti agreed with him that the
only way to change such a widely held belief in the bowels of the
organization was for the commissioner to personally to make
repeated, clear and forceful corrective statements, which he said
Rossotti began doing in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers and employees are looking for some definitive
statements from Charles about what to do in certain circumstances
that are fairly egregious in terms of not complying with the law,''
Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on serving customers, as taxpayers are now called,
comes not only from Congress but also from Rossotti, a management
and computer systems expert who was brought in two years ago to
modernize the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In his first and so far only mission statement for the agency,
which focused on helping people pay their taxes, Rossotti made no
mention of enforcing the law or collecting taxes, omissions that
have been viewed widely within the agency as reflecting a decreased
emphasis on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But now even Rossotti is worried that enforcement has slipped
too far. He told a Senate subcommittee in October that such a low
audit rate ``poses the risk of increased unfairness in
administration of the law, and ultimately, undermining our entire
system of voluntary tax compliance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rossotti has had to strip down audit units to obey Congressional
dictates to expand customer service and resolve a deluge of
so-called innocent spouse cases, most of which involve divorced
women who say their former husbands cheated on their taxes and left
them holding the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Whole audit teams in Brooklyn and Seattle have been reassigned
to innocent-spouse cases, and corporate audit teams across the
country that once had as many as 12 highly trained examiners have
shrunk to as few as four people, tax workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Highly trained IRS auditors who are paid up to $77,000 annually
to examine corporate tax returns have been detailed to answer
telephones and greet people at IRS offices, even though their years
of specialized work have left them ill equipped to handle mundane
questions from the public. One IRS customer service clerk said it
took these auditors so much time to research answers to questions
that, when she was away, it took five of them to do her job.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, revenue officers, whose job is to collect
taxes that are past due, said they were having difficulty getting
supervisors to approve enforcement actions, such as foreclosing on
property, because of a perception by managers that they were not to
upset customers, even if they are major tax cheats.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ended Sept. 30 the IRS seized property just 161
times, down from 10,000 times two years earlier. Levies of bank
accounts and paychecks fell to 504,000 from 3.1 million two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Two revenue officers outlined cases they built against
individuals who each cheated the government out of millions of
dollars in taxes, only to be frustrated by the refusal of their
superiors to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   These officers described elaborate schemes to place assets in
the names of relatives to thwart tax collection and, presumably,
hide money from creditors. ``Every badge of fraud was there, but
Criminal Investigation Division told me the U.S. attorney was not
interested,'' one of these revenue officers said.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue officer said that because the case was rejected for
prosecution, requests for permission to force the taxpayer to pay,
which Congress now requires be approved by high level managers,
have been ignored. ``No one will do anything'' to collect the
taxes, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple said he had heard, fourth or fifth hand, similar tales
of inaction and was troubled by them. He said he would like to hear
directly from revenue officers who think their superiors are
failing in their duty to enforce collection.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the cuts in audits is amplified by other factors,
including a steady rise in the number of tax returns and a very
sharp increase in returns filed by high-income Americans, who are
the most likely to have income and deductions from businesses and
investments, which can involve complex audit issues.
</P>
<P>
   The number of returns reporting an income of $1 million or more
jumped to 142,500 in 1997 from 87,000 just two years earlier. These
returns often include income from businesses that the taxpayer
controls, capital gains and other sources that are not subject to
the mandatory reporting systems that apply to the forms of income
reported by most people like wages, interest on savings and
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But under tight budgets set by Congress the full-time IRS staff
has shrunk to about 82,000 people, down 14 percent from 1995. When
the growing number of tax returns, the increased volume of money
and the 1,260 tax code changes that Congress enacted in 1997 and
1998 are taken into account, Rossotti calculates, the IRS has had
its resources cut nearly 29 percent.

ANALYSIS: TURNING POINT FOR THE MIDDLE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israelis do not stand on ceremony or bow to
courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   But, in an exceptional show of support, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's large, squabbling Cabinet showed up in force on Tuesday to
see him off as he flew here to resume Israel's negotiations with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   There couldn't have been a clearer demonstration of how Israelis
_ like many others in the Middle East _ perceive the import of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment of truth, as they see it, and it can be felt in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and its neighbors have arrived at a critical turning
point. If, as expected, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
shakes hands with Barak at the White House on Wednesday, Syria, the
longtime anchor of Arab hostility toward the Jewish homeland, will
be taking a giant step toward recognizing the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   With that, whatever its self-interests, Syria will be sending a
signal to the rest of the Arab world about Israel's permanence in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And Israel, which faces the prospect of simultaneously
relinquishing territory in the Golan Heights to the Syrians and the
West Bank to the Palestinians, will be taste-testing the
bittersweet fruits of those moves: Peaceful relations with all its
immediate neighbors would mean shrinking back into a truly tiny
country.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Golan leaders Tuesday morning, Barak sought
in a brief departure speech to embrace the warring emotions that
leave many Israelis feeling guarded: Some are hesitant to believe
that this time will be any different, others are unwilling to pay
the price and most are wary of another internal conflagration in an
intensely fragmented nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a difficult task,'' Barak said Tuesday morning at the
farewell ceremony. ``I carry with me to the negotiations all the
pain of the conflict _ the victims, the graves, the memorial days _
but also all the dreams and hopes of Israelis who wait for the day
when we look from a position of power and strength at a different
Israel, an Israel at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts see in this juncture an unusual and perhaps
fleeting synchronization of the determination of three
strong-willed political leaders. Syrian President Hafez Assad,
Barak and President Clinton, who is serving as their broker, all
want, for their own reasons, to seize the moment and overcome the
obstacles that previously derailed the Israeli-Syrian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the new effort, which is likely to be blistering and
intense, will do little more than get under way this week. After a
ceremony at the White House on Wednesday morning, the Israelis and
the Syrians will retreat to Blair House for two days to pick up
where they left off _ that in itself being the first point of
disagreement _ when negotiations were suspended nearly four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if preliminary, this week's talks are likely to
prove a crucial opportunity for each side to gauge the other's
genuine points of flexibility. At issue are not just land, security
arrangements and water resources but a fundamental mutual distrust
and, on the part of Assad at least, deep-seated enmity.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Assad will not be here for the opening round
starts things off on a lopsided basis. Some think that Assad, who
is 69 and debilitated by illness, is too weak to make a
trans-Atlantic journey. But he is also reportedly unwilling to step
into the negotiations until they are further along.
</P>
<P>
   In al-Sharaa, the Syrian president is sending his highest-level
emissary, but that emissary will sit down with the top leader of
Israel, and the imbalance in their status makes everything
tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak sacrificed something on the tactical level, when he
decided that he would meet with Farouk Ashara,'' Nahum Barnea, a
leading Israeli political columnist, wrote Tuesday morning. ``This
is an asymmetrical meeting: Every word Barak speaks will be
recorded in the Syrian mind as a promise. Every word that Ashara
speaks will await Assad's final ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   On taking office, Barak pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from
Lebanon, which Syria effectively controls, by next July, whether or
not there is a Syrian-Israeli agreement. In so doing, he forced
Assad's hand and showed his own.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Barak would prefer to pull out of Lebanon with Syria's
promise to restrain Islamic guerrilla forces from attacking
Israel's northern border, Syria does not want to lose this
bargaining chip in its decades-long quest to win back the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Assad first approached the negotiating table eight years ago,
and there is a legacy of negotiations on all the issues involved.
That legacy represents not only a historical record of past
positions and compromises but a bank of experience that brings both
sides to the table well informed.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has noted several times that there are ``microscopic''
differences on Syria between him and his predecessors, including
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who conducted
back-channel talks through an intermediary, Ronald Lauder, an
American businessman.
</P>
<P>
   All apparently agreed that the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau that is home to 17,000 settlers, not to mention ski resorts
and wineries, would have to be abandoned in the context of such a
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians are ready to get it back, and their president knows it.
He dispatched workers to the streets of Damascus in the last few
days with banners heralding the rebirth of talks: ``We fought
honorably, we negotiated honorably. We will make peace honorably.''
He will guide Syrian public opinion as he has for years.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, facing Israel's restive democracy, will not have it so
easy. For however difficult are the negotiations with his
adversaries in the Arab world, what he faces domestically can be
just as daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have black hair when I dealt only with the Arabs,''
Barak, a former general, said jokingly in a recent interview. ``Now
that I'm beginning to deal with the Israelis too, the gray is
coming out by the day.''

 &HT;    Richardson lobs 1st salvo at `third-rated' Hampton
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern University coach Pete Richardson fired the
first shot heading into the McDonald's Heritage Bowl on Saturday at
the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, whose team finished 11-1 and will represent the
Southwestern Athletic Conference in the event for the fifth
consecutive year, referred to opponent Hampton University as ``a
third-rated team.'' Hampton (7-4) finished third in the Mid-Eastern
Athletic Conference behind North Carolina A&AMP;T and Florida A&AMP;M, but
was chosen to compete in the Heritage Bowl after the other two
teams advanced to the Division I-AA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The remark upset Hampton coach Joe Taylor, who got the copier
machines busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the comment run off, and it's up on the walls in our
locker room,'' Taylor said. ``No question about it. We're really
looking forward to this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern defeated Hampton 26-6 during the regular season. Its
lone loss _ a 65-18 shellacking _ came against Florida A&AMP;M, the
second-place team from the MEAC.
</P>
<P>
   Well-rested
</P>
<P>
   Hampton hasn't played since Nov. 20 against Morgan State and
will be well-rested entering the game. Southern, on the other hand,
faced Grambling on Nov. 27 in the Bayou Classic in New Orleans and
Jackson State last weekend in the first SWAC championship game in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, you would say that if you've recently played, it's
an advantage,'' Taylor said. ``But the fact that we're healthy
should really help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gift bags
</P>
<P>
   Sports &AMP; Entertainment Direct has prepared 50,000 bags of
assorted gifts to be handed out at the Heritage Bowl. If that many
people attend the game, bowl executive director Craig Cason would
be ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Bowl
</P>
<P>
   The third Pioneer Bowl, which will match SIAC representative
Tuskegee against CIAA champion Winston-Salem State, will follow the
Heritage Bowl in the Georgia Dome at 6 p.m. Saturday. Tickets to
the Pioneer Bowl are $15 and separate from the Heritage Bowl.

BUSH RECEIVES RINGING ENDORSEMENT FROM FORMER RIVAL LAMAR
ALEXANDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ When Lamar Alexander was running for
president this summer, he made a point at every stop about his
chief rival, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, Alexander would say in one Iowa hamlet after
another, is not ready for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, that changed.
</P>
<P>
   Using adjectives such as ``steady'' and ``solid,'' the former
Tennessee governor endorsed Bush the morning after the first
Republican presidential debate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's ready for the presidency,'' Alexander said at a
news conference with Bush standing at his side. ``I think he has a
clear view of the future. He's the only Republican with executive
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, regarded as a moderate Republican, brushed off
questions about what had changed in the months since he abandoned
the race without endorsing a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said a lot of things in the primary,'' Alexander said. ``I
did everything I could to test Governor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He earned my respect the old-fashioned way. He defeated me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did that despite some tough rhetoric from Alexander leading
up to the Iowa Straw Poll in August. Back then, Alexander often
said of Bush, ``I was a one-term governor once about 15 years ago,
and I'm not sure I was ready to be president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   With a big lead in early Iowa polls and scores of endorsements
from public officials nationwide, the GOP front-runner hardly needs
Alexander's backing. Perhaps buoyed by a stronger showing in the
latest debate, Bush made a bold prediction about how well he'll do
in Iowa. The state's Jan. 24 caucuses rank as the first major test
on the road to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most vote anybody has ever gotten, I think, is 37
percent,'' Bush said. ``I hope to do that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Tuesday's transfer of the Panama Canal, Bush vowed
to use ``whatever means necessary'' to stop other powers, such as
China, from controlling the passageway. ``The Panama Canal is in
our national strategic interests,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On another subject, Bush said he supported the military's
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gay soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it ought to be made to work,'' the governor said. ``I
believe the next commander in chief has got to send one clear
signal: We're not going to tolerate abuse. We expect people to be
treated with respect throughout the military.''

 WASHINGTON: the day.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, the Israeli Parliament gave Barak a bare plurality
supporting his initiative. That doesn't mean he doesn't have
broader support. It does mean, though, that in an incredibly
partisan Parliament where many parties represent sectarian
interests, peace carries a price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The internal political considerations are incredibly
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the opposition is led by the Likud party now run by
Ariel Sharon, the indomitable but aging former general who picked
up the reins that Netanyahu dropped when he lost to Barak last May.
But Netanyahu's negotiations, although the record of what
transpired is secret, will tie his party's hands. And these days
Sharon, determined but slow-moving, is not the most stirring
opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Within his coalition, Barak faces three challenges: the National
Religious Party, which represents the settler movement; the Russian
immigrant party of Natan Sharansky, and, as always, Shas, a
17-member, rigorously Orthodox Sephardic party that has the power
to make or break his government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are spearheading the Golan defense, which Sharansky
explains as a residual mistrust of ``dictators,'' among other
things. About a quarter of the residents of the Golan are Russian
immigrants, but they are not believed to be as adamant as their
leaders. Their roots in the area are not very deep.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Shas has thrown its weight around clumsily, under the
leadership of a relative novice in politics, Eli Yishai. Yishai,
whom Barak has tried with difficulty to groom, replaced Aryeh Deri,
who stepped down following his conviction for corruption last
spring. But Deri remains something of a force behind the scenes,
and a ruling that is expected on his appeal next month could
provoke his party either way.
</P>
<P>
   Shas party members are split in their allegiances to political
leaders, but also to rabbis. While all technically abide by the
rulings of Shas' spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, there is an
aging kabbalist rabbi, Yitzhak Khedouri, who also commands
loyalties. Yosef, who is considered dovish, has not made it clear
where he stands on the concession of the Golan. Khedouri, however,
has stated his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Barak has the power to buy Shas' support, literally,
by rescuing its religious school system, which educates some 20,000
children, from huge debts caused by mismanagement and worse. So
far, he has been unwilling to do that, on principle and because he
would then face a backlash from the secular Israelis who elected
him and chanted, ``No Shas'' on the day he won.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yishai, in a show of good faith, joined the farewell
ceremony at the airport Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Golan settlers themselves are revving up for a fight, but
they too are divided. The radical leadership defiantly dedicated a
new neighborhood this week while a Golan peace camp registered as a
political movement. In the middle are a substantial number whose
hearts are at war with their heads, and they are concerned with the
bottom line: Will they get financial compensation from the
government for their move, and where will they go?
</P>
<P>
   Giving his backing to Barak, President Ezer Weizman has urged
his people not to be carried away by their emotions. He has a
nephew who lives in the Golan Heights, Weizman said, and if he were
opposed to leaving, what would he do? ``Buy a tank? Rent an M-16?
What's this talk of war?''

WITH A NEW CENTURY, A PROMISE OF NEW SOUNDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for MUSIC-TECHNIQUE)  
 (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state of classical music now is strangely appropriate for
the turning of a millennium. After a period of rapid change, from
late Brahms to electronic music and John Cage within a lifetime,
music in recent decades has been relatively stable, and the
achievements of composers have been correspondingly solid.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot from the 1990s, in particular, to be carried into
the next century. But there are signs, too, of imminent change.
Economic conditions threaten concert life and the record industry
with a purge that one can only hope will be refreshing; composition
is bound to be affected, perhaps radically again.
</P>
<P>
   The art is ready for a new generation of composers, who are
likely to be dissatisfied with the increasing marginalization
accorded their predecessors of this century.
</P>
<P>
   A musical observer at the start of the 20th century could have
looked around at a number of living composers whose works were
being regularly performed wherever Western classical music was
known. And most of those composers were relatively young.
Tchaikovsky, Bruckner and Brahms had all died within the decade;
Verdi, Dvorak and Grieg were near the end. A generation was
passing, and the newcomers were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Puccini, famous as the composer of ``La Boheme,'' was 41;
Leoncavallo (``Pagliacci'') and Mascagni (``Cavalleria Rusticana'')
were about the same age. Debussy and Richard Strauss, both in their
30s, were well past the works that had brought them into the
international repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous listeners might even have heard music by composers
still in their 20s: Scriabin, Schoenberg, Reger. And with a
reputation more local, Edward MacDowell, at 39, had written
everything by which he would be known.
</P>
<P>
   We now live in a different world. Most of the composers who are
widely admired today are over 50, and some are over 90. If
Tchaikovsky had lived to Elliott Carter's age, he might have heard
Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring'' as a young man of 73 and gone on
composing into the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The fervor that greeted the appearance of the English composer
Thomas Ades a few years ago was due in part to the rarity these
days of a young man writing at full strength within the classical
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Ades, now 28, spoke of freshness and change _
though still within familiar boundaries, for it seems that one
great age of innovation is over. It began a few years before World
War I and ended a few years after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Once Cage had produced his silent piece, ``4'33'','' in 1952,
there was perhaps nowhere to go but sideways. The only progress
made after that was in electronic music and in the recovery of
large form, whether by former serialists, like Pierre Boulez, or by
the new Minimalists, like Steve Reich. And even in those areas, not
much has changed in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier excitement stimulated a lot of talent, which has
been harder to motivate since; thus the aging of the population of
composers. And that excitement can still be felt. Where popular
music of the 1980s sounds quaintly retro (Boy George), classical
music of the 1950s can often seem breathtakingly audacious (Jean
Barraque) _ more so than most of the music written since, because
so many composers during the last two or three decades have chosen
to travel not so much sideways as backward.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving aside those who try to imitate Shostakovich, Bruckner or
other earlier masters, advance in musical technique even among the
most progressive composers has stalled or reversed during the last
30 or 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the nondevelopment of the orchestra. Between 1800
and 1900, and perhaps even more so between 1700 and 1800, the
orchestra changed radically in its constitution, size and social
role, and a generation ago it seemed that comparable change was
being accomplished in the 20th century, with the introduction of
electronic components, the alteration of platform placement, the
addition of new instruments from alien traditions (electric
guitars, ocarinas), the scoring for unconventional groupings and
the presentation of performances in offbeat settings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, most composers write for an orchestra very like
that of Debussy, Strauss or Mahler, playing onstage in a normal
concert hall, the only differences being in the loss of national
schools of instrument building (a homogenization, therefore) and
the increased role of percussion (an expansion pretty much achieved
by 1925, in the music of Stravinsky, Varese and Berg).
</P>
<P>
   One can blame economics. Orchestras today, in Europe as well as
North America, can rarely afford to present such typical works of
the 1970s as Boulez's ``Rituel,'' with its 11 percussionists and
novel layout, or Karlheinz Stockhausen's ``Trans,'' which needs
special staging, electronics and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, perhaps financing could be found if the
musical necessity were there. Generally it is not. Boulez has
returned to writing for relatively regular, if large, orchestral
forces in his ``Notations'' series, and Stockhausen has come to
prefer small groups, which can give him adequate rehearsal time.
Neither composer seems now to feel that the orchestra, as a
dominant institution, must be carried forward on the wave of
musical advance. Neither (italics)could(end italics) feel that,
because the wave has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There have been other periods of comparative calm and stability
in the language of music. Nothing too much changed, for instance,
during the quarter-century after Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde''
appeared, in 1865. Life went on, and it continues to go on. But
after a time of such extreme and rapid change as happened between
1908, when Schoenberg began writing atonal music, and the early
'50s _ a period during which music moved forward all the time to
take on new challenges _ composers may well feel the lack of a
driving force, whether they exult in that lack or bemoan it.
</P>
<P>
   The current vogue for religious music is a symptom. With no
arrow from musical history now to point the way ahead, composers
may gain a sense of purpose from God, whose directives, it appears,
are often comfortingly regressive. Certainly there are few
religious composers who emulate Olivier Messiaen in taking it as
their sacred duty to embrace any and every sound.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources of purpose are hard to find. Few composers can
draw strength from a sense of serving an audience, since the
audience, in the main, has shown itself perfectly capable of
getting along without them. Nor is there much support to be had
from political forces. Socialism and nationalism, which once
energized so many composers, do so no longer.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is the domain of the personal, and the widespread
return to the conventions of Romantic music can perhaps be
explained as a searching for means of expression. Especially during
that earlier period of placidity following ``Tristan,'' music had
great rhetorical power, a wide expressive range and the stylistic
breadth to give voice to such diverse personalities as Brahms and
Liszt, Verdi and Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the example of a previous reinvocation of the late
Romantic style, in the 1930s, when composers across the range from
Schoenberg to Prokofiev went back to it. Nothing is new in
postmodernism except the name.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be, though, that means of expression for today are to
be found only in a musical language well over a century old,
understandable though such a return may be in terms not only of the
Romantic style's allure but also of the comparative underselling of
expression by the 20th-century modernists. Stravinsky and Cage, at
an extreme, explicitly disclaimed subjective expression, though
their music argues loudly with their manifestos.
</P>
<P>
   And the composers who emerged right after World War II had their
sights on levels of abstraction that would enable them to write a
new, clean music. Since what had recently happened was
inexpressible, the only appropriate course was to express nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Expression, though, is unavoidable. And especially at a time
like now, when expression has come to the forefront again, one can
hear the anger in Boulez's early music, the fastidious wit in
Milton Babbitt's, the sense of wonder in Gyorgy Ligeti's. From a
modern, expressive viewpoint, too, the music Luigi Nono wrote in
the 1950s has come to have greater importance, for Nono absented
himself from the contemporary drive to theorize, insisting that he
could and must express the sufferings, struggles and hopes of his
time. And he did so not by resurrecting Romanticism but by pursuing
a fiercely modern musical language.
</P>
<P>
   Nono's subjects, if not his means, have become general. Nearly
half a century after his ``Canto Sospeso,'' in which he set
extracts from prison letters by Nazi victims, many composers are
coming to attend to the experiences of war and totalitarianism, not
to pretend, in a new century, that the old century's dangers will
be over.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Werner Henze's recent Ninth Symphony, he has said, ``deals
with the German homeland as I experienced it as a young man during
and before the war,'' and ``portrays an apotheosis of terror and
grief.'' Other composers, lacking Henze's direct contact with
Nazism, have looked to the testimony of two European Jewish poets
who used their writing as a strategy for survival and, when that
failed, committed suicide: Paul Celan (a model and a source in the
work of the Swiss composer Heinz Holliger and the Czech-German
Peter Ruzicka) and Primo Levi (set by the English composer Simon
Bainbridge).
</P>
<P>
   Yet other composers, without referring directly to the events of
the 1930s and '40s, have kept on projecting musical visions
essentially tragic, bleak or constrained. Gyorgy Kurtag is one.
Like Nono, he was writing powerfully expressive music in the '50s,
though it was only in the late '70s and the '80s, with the general
revaluation of the expressive, that he began to gain an audience
outside Budapest, where he then lived.
</P>
<P>
   Indebted to the great tradition, from Bach to Bartok, he is in
some ways the most deep-dyed of the new Romantic conservatives,
except that in his case the Romantic gesture _ the melody or chord
change that speaks louder than words _ is freed from the upholstery
of 19th-century textures and forms to be placed in a new context,
generally in a fragment that seems at once lapidary and vital.
</P>
<P>
   The radiant sense of ruin in Kurtag's music probably has
something to do with his double acquaintance with totalitarian
power, under Stalin as well as Hitler, and there are many other
composers from Communist Europe who felt compelled to give voice:
among them, Galina Ustvolskaya, in whose music religious simplicity
is shocking, not comforting, and Sofia Gubaidulina. The music of
composers like Ms. Gubaidulina, Kurtag and Holliger demonstrates
that modernism is by no means incompatible with expression, as was
earlier hoped by some and feared by many.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one may reasonably feel that only a contemporary musical
language can express the temper of the times, for the changes that
take place in musical style are not arbitrary; they are of a piece
with other changes in life and culture, and they need to be
recognized by composers who are concerned to speak of the present
and of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the present is thin if it does not contain an
awareness of the past. Boulez and some of his colleagues in the
early '50s wanted to create a music without memory, a New Music as
it was significantly called in Germany. Any hint of history _ a
tonal chord, a singable melody _ was to be avoided; some even
thought that the New Music would have to be exclusively electronic.
</P>
<P>
   It did not last. History could not be expunged any more than
expression could; indeed, the two impossibilities are linked,
because history gives the models in music by which we recognize
expression (the yearning interval, the sensuous harmony), and our
wish to make contact with expression urges us to remember the music
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   All this the New Music soon had to recognize. Still, there
remained the ideal of creating music that would not stalely repeat
what had already been done, and it is an ideal that many composers
have refused to abandon. Where Kurtag makes a homage to Schumann,
for example, he does so not just by quoting but also by stretching
the range of his own language. It is a question not of putting on
fancy dress but of reaching out a hand to touch another person,
even a person known only through music.
</P>
<P>
   The best alternative is a multilayered music in which Schumann
might coexist with Central African drumming, Hispanic-Caribbean
dance music and the complex rhythmic canons of Conlon Nancarrow, as
in some of Ligeti's recent work. Kurtag and Ligeti _ both born in
Transylvania and trained in Budapest, both now exiles _ are
outstanding representatives of two notably successful currents
among the bewildering waterways of classical music today.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtag speaks with a single voice and suggests in his music the
authorial presence with which we are familiar in 19th-century
music; Ligeti refracts that presence through levels of allusion and
self-observation.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtag's music maintains the old equation of communication: he
speaks, and we listen. Our experience of Ligeti's music _ or of
Carter's or Luciano Berio's or Harrison Birtwistle's or John Adams'
_ is likely to be more complicated. Though different in so many
other ways, all these composers commonly write in simultaneous
conflicting speeds and meters, so that there is no controlling
rhythmic line, and thus, it seems, no single subjective voice.
</P>
<P>
   There are other similarities. The music of these polyvocal
composers will often be exuberant and playful, sometimes even when
the underlying expressive charge is gloomy, as in the several
pieces Ligeti has recently produced on falling lament motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kurtag and Holliger convey a pessimism that nobody could
avoid, looking back on the last century, Ligeti and Carter offer an
optimism we would all want, looking forward to the next.
</P>
<P>
   As far as music is concerned, optimism is appropriate. There are
many more composers at work today than ever before, in many more
styles, most of them endeavoring to do what composers have done
throughout the history of Western music: make a new sound. They
lack the rapid technical advances that upheld them and their
colleagues 40 or 50 years ago, but they still face the biggest
challenge, which is to find something that speaks from, for and of
them, and that by being personal is unprecedented and commands
attention.
</P>
<P>
   We are reaching, perhaps, the end of an epoch of relative stasis
_ an epoch also of extraordinary achievement. The language of music
will soon be developing again, in younger heads.

STUDY BACKS A DRUG FOR HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa., Colo.)  (rk) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted,
researchers have found that the drug Ritalin, the object of sharp
debate for three decades, was more effective than
behavior-modification therapy in treating children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who worked at six sites around the country in
teams assembled by the National Institutes of Health, said that
adding the behavioral therapy to Ritalin treatment was no more
effective than the drug alone. But they said they found that about
70 percent of the children they studied also turned out to have
problems like depression and anxiety. In those cases, they said,
behavior therapy provided significant benefits, especially when
used in combination with the Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   The results, reported in the current issue of the Archives of
General Psychiatry, were discussed at a news conference Tuesday at
the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter S. Jenson, a child psychiatrist at Columbia and a
senior adviser to the NIH who directed the project, said the
results were ``the first real information on comparative treatments
over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James T. McCracken, the director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the Neuropyschiatric Institute of the University of
California at Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research,
called the study a landmark and said it proved the benefits of
treating hyperactive children with a stimulant. ``As a child
psychiatrist, it is still surprising that Ritalin remains as
controversial as it is,'' he said. ``One hopes that this study will
put some of the controversy to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wiliam Carey, a child psychiatrist at the Children's
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said that while he had
no criticism of the study, Ritalin is overused, adding, ``Do you
give it to a child who talks incessantly in line?'' The drug should
be reserved for real brain disorders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent battles over the drug took place last
month when the Colorado Board of Education moved to discourage
teachers from recommending behavioral drugs like Ritalin and urged
school personnel to use discipline and instruction instead to
overcome problem behavior in the classroom. The action was said to
have stemmed from fears that such drugs were related to violence
among children, although medical scientists say there is no
evidence of that. Its side effects, which include headaches or loss
of appetite, are reported as minor and reversible.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH researchers studied 579 children over 14 months. The
children, who were 7 to 9 years of age, were given long and
detailed examinations, Jensen said. About 80 percent were boys.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments of the children were divided into four groups: those
that received Ritalin alone, received intensive behavior management
therapy alone, a combination of the two and whatever kind of
treatment was standard for their community.
</P>
<P>
   The researches found that among the children who had attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder but not the other psychiatric
disorders, Ritalin brought improvement in their conditions when it
was used alone, regardless of whether it was accompanied by other
therapy. They also found that Ritalin and the intensive behavior
therapy used in combination were the most effective when used for
the children with psychiatric problems that went beyond attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The study found a number of differences between the institutes
of health program of intensive behavior management _ based on the
B.F. Skinner theory on the value of using positive reinforcement to
encourage acceptable behavior _ and the various community therapies
used for the children in the fourth group.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen P. Hinshaw, a child psychiatrist and professor at
the University of California at Berkeley, said they included
monthly meetings under the NIH approach and more emphasis on
behavior management by parents in the home and teachers in the
classroom.

 Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the choreographer David Rousseve.  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Parsons would love to hole up for a few days
and shake the flu that has vexed him since Thanksgiving weekend.
Instead, with the biggest show of his life just days away, he drags
himself out of bed most mornings and gets to work.
</P>
<P>
   As the choreographer for ``Times Square 2000,'' Manhattan's
round-the-clock salute to the millennium, Parsons is putting the
finishing touches on nearly a dozen new dances by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   The show will go on with or without him, of course. But the way
Parsons has handled his looming deadline and lingering infection
seems to justify the decision to hire him in the first place.
Colleagues say he has kept his part of the program on track _
despite a trip to the hospital to be treated for dehydration _ with
shrewd planning, a lively imagination and undisguised pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor celebration will start around sunrise on Dec. 31 and
continue for 24 hours. As midnight approaches in each time zone, a
cast and crew of nearly 1,000 will set the mood with dance, music,
video, confetti and a cavalcade of giant puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dancing will take place on an elevated stage to be
erected in the middle of Times Square; the rest, like the puppetry,
will happen in the streets, in emergency lanes kept clear by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   With 1.5 million revelers expected to turn out, and perhaps a
billion more watching on television and the Internet, the stakes
are staggeringly high.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people will see you in this show,'' Parsons told some
dancers at a recent rehearsal, ``than every dance concert I'll ever
give in 50 lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, who turned 40 in October, is known as a can-do
choreographer with a knack for winning over the crowd. He began
working on ``Times Square 2000'' just over a year ago and helped
develop a set of hourly themes with Geoff Puckett, the show's
creative director, and Michael Curry, the puppet designer. But his
contribution ultimately hinges on the single month of rehearsal
time that he and his troupe, the Parsons Dance Company, have carved
out of their heavy touring schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And so the real work began less than three weeks ago, in a humid
studio at City Center. Parsons was there, with a bowl of soup and a
battery of medications at his side, and so was most of his troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Joining them were dozens of aspiring dancers he had picked for
the show in a September audition.
</P>
<P>
   The first rehearsal focused on the big opening number,
``Awakening,'' which uses slow, ritualistic encounters to evoke the
dawn of civilization and time itself. While most of the material
was new, Parsons had no qualms about recycling bits of repertory.
At one point, he gave new meaning to a rhythmic series of gestures
lifted from ``Step Into My Dream,'' his 1994 collaboraion with
Billy Taylor's jazz trio.
</P>
<P>
   In rapid succession, he and the dancers have also adapted an
aboriginal stick dance from Australia, an umbrella processional
from Japan and a Chinese dragon dance that features a 90-foot-long
puppet. Often Parsons would describe a dance in broad outline, then
demonstrate some likely steps. When his energy flagged, he asked a
few of his leading dancers _ most notably Robert Battle, who has
contributed six dances to the company's repertory since 1997 _ to
fill in blanks and smooth out transitions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parsons remains the final authority. ``This is too
complicated,'' he said one day as they worked on ``Ports of Call,''
a Celtic jig that relaxes to a Caribbean beat. ``Remember, you're
going to be wearing rubber boots and big yellow raincoats. It's not
like you can do pirouettes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting the dancers into a simple swaying motion, he quickly
conjured up a ship at sea. You could almost smell the salt air.
Then, reaching for a mop, he played around with easy swabbing
motions. As others followed suit, the studio came to resemble a
snappy outtake from ``Anchors Aweigh.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Frank Sinatra's and Gene Kelly's characters in that
1945 Hollywood caper, Parsons' dancers will not get any shore
leave. Because of anticipated congestion in Midtown, they are
supposed to stay close to Times Square for the duration of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Cots will be set up in the Bertelsmann building, and there will
be a heated waiting room underneath the stage, which will sit on a
traffic island between Broadway and Seventh Avenue just north of
45th Street. ( Curry, who has enlisted hundreds of volunteers to
parade his fanciful puppets through the crowd, will work out of a
separate space near 42nd Street.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the pageantry will start 15 minutes before each hour
and finish 10 minutes after. For several of the hours, Parsons has
booked guest artists to perform traditional dances from Bali,
Turkey, Brazil, Hawaii and the Sioux tribes of South Dakota. His
biggest challenge, though, has been creating or adapting dances for
about 12 of the hours.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographing on the fly has become second nature to Parsons,
who routinely creates dances in a span of 10 or 12 days. Because of
that compressed creative process, he often makes extensive
revisions to his work after it reaches the stage. But with ``Times
Square 2000,'' there are no second chances.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 years of taking his repertory on the road, he said he
welcomed the transience of a one-shot performance _ and the
opportunity for his dancers to unpack their suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason I'm doing this is to get us off the road,'' said
Parsons, whose company often tours more than 40 weeks a year.
``It's that simple. You have to find ways to keep people at home
and still pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   He works his dancers hard, but also offers regular salaries and
reliable health care. ``I've compromised _ I know I have _ to give
my dancers those things,'' he said, explaining that the troupe's
busy schedule cuts into his creative time. ``But I've had one get
hit by a truck and one who has HIV. This may be theater, but I'm a
very practical person. I've always struggled to make sure the
people I work with are taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more troubling aspects of ``Times Square 2000,'' he
said, is the sense that he is asking too much of the 50 walk-ons
who will augment his troupe. For a full month of rehearsals _
including three overnight drills at Times Square _ and a marathon
performance in the dead of winter, they will receive an honorarium
of $100.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the thrill of being seen on television by a billion
viewers is enough for some of the recruits. But many hope to
impress an audience of one: Parsons. He can hardly blame them. As a
teenager, he hung around Paul Taylor's studio for several months
before the choreographer took him on as an understudy. He got his
break when a dancer was injured just before a tour to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 years at the helm of his own company, Parsons has grown
accustomed to a level of artistic independence that ``Times Square
2000'' cannot match. As a former gymnast, he envisioned using
trampolines to propel performers high above the crowd. But safety
considerations (the trampolines might obstruct fire lanes) and
budget constraints (the gymnasts wanted too much money) squelched
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Parsons said he found it exhilarating to work on such a
large theatrical scale. ``The object is to change the process,'' he
said. ``Maybe it's uncomfortable. Maybe you fail. But you're still
pushing it.''

UNION LEADERS SAY THEY WILL NOT CALL TRANSIT STRIKE FOR WEDNESDAY
MORNING
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As contract talks continued feverishly on Tuesday,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said leaders of the transit workers' union
had provided assurances that the union would not shut down New York
City's transit system on Wednesday morning, although city officials
predicted rush-hour chaos because of wildcat work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   After a state judge issued two orders threatening the union with
draconian fines if it went on strike, Willie James, president of
the union representing 33,000 subway and bus workers, told the
Giuliani administration that he would not call for a walkout on
Wednesday morning, City Hall officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, James and other leaders in Local 100 of the Transport
Workers Union have threatened a strike if they did not reach an
agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority by 12:01
on Wednesday morning, when the union's contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   James sent a letter to all members on Tuesday warning that the
huge fines that could be imposed from defying the judge's orders
``will quickly bankrupt the Union making it unable to function on
your behalf.'' But the letter stopped short of saying outright that
he would not call for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference, Giuliani said the letter made
clear that the union's leaders opposed a walkout, which would be
illegal under New York state's Taylor Law, which bars strikes by
transit workers and other public-sector employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani added that there was still a small chance that a
large dissident faction in the union could muster the votes to
authorize a strike _ a move that could paralyze the city and create
havoc for 3.5 million people who use the mass transit system each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said some parts of a contingency plan to speed
transportation into Manhattan would go into effect on Wednesday
morning, and that the full plan _ which would restrict motor
vehicle access _ would be ready if needed.
</P>
<P>
   An official close to the negotiations said on Tuesday night that
the two sides had considerably narrowed their differences, with the
union reducing its wage demands to 5 percent a year over three
years, down from its previous demand for 9 percent a year. The MTA,
this official said, had raised its offer to 13 percent over four
years, up from its previous offer of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of attacking the union, Giuliani escalated his
efforts on Tuesday to pressure it not to strike. He had the city's
lawyers go to a judge's house shortly before 7 a.m. to obtain a
restraining order that calls for fining the union $1 million for
the first day of a strike, $2 million for the second day and
doubling again each successive day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under the judge's order, individual union members,
whose salaries average $39,000 a year, could face fines of $25,000
on the first day of a strike, with the fine doubling on each
successive day.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said, ``We sought an amount of money that would
immediately make it financially impossible for anyone to engage in
this activity.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, over a foot of new snow fell in many of the higher
elevations of Washington state as a chilly flow of air directed
abundant moisture inland from the northern Pacific. The damp
conditions will continue across the Northwest Wednesday, though
snow levels will rise to higher altitudes as a warm front sweeps
east across the region. This will cause snow to eventually change
to rain around pass levels.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered snow showers will surround low pressure tracking
slowly through the western Great Lakes Wednesday where several
inches of snow could accumulate in Wisconsin and northern Michigan.
Farther west, a few light rain showers will develop from eastern
Michigan into the southern Appalachians ahead of an advancing cold
front. Later Wednesday night and Thursday, progressively colder air
will circulate over the relatively tepid Great Lakes, setting the
stage for heavier snow showers downwind of the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Residual moisture in the lower portions of the atmosphere will
bring clouds and spotty showers to portions of New England. Farther
south, clouds will break, yielding intervals of clouds and sun near
the Middle Atlantic Coast. Meanwhile, Florida will stay seasonably
warm amid sunshine and patchy cumulus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding currents of air associated with high pressure over the
Southwest will promote ample sunshine from southern California to
Texas. Gusty breezes from the east will impact southern California
and Arizona Wednesday. The offshore winds will bring very mild
conditions to much of the southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Absence of Chill
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since there has been a wintry day in
Milwaukee. Every day since March 11, the temperature has risen
above freezing at the lakeside city. The string of 279 days is just
four days shy of the longest period on record during which
temperatures have risen above 32 degrees. The absence of chill in
Milwaukee is part of a persistent pattern that has swept air masses
across the nation that had their origins over the mild waters of
the Pacific. It is unlikely that the record will be broken,
however, since a surge of chill from Canada will reach the upper
Middle West Thursday.

MCCAIN UNVEILS HEALTH PLANCALLING FOR MODEST CHANGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Calling the nation's health care system ``too
costly, too inaccessible and too bureaucratic,'' Sen. John McCain
on Tuesday set out a plan of ``tailored reforms'' ranging from a
federal program to help the low-income elderly pay for prescription
drugs to a limited right to sue health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech to the Charleston Rotary Club was part of an
effort by the Arizona Republican to capitalize on his surge in New
Hampshire by fleshing out his positions on issues. Health care _
and most particularly the soaring costs of prescription drugs _ has
emerged as one of the hottest topics on the campaign trail this
year, and until now it has been a policy arena largely dominated by
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our health care system today often fails to reflect our
values,'' McCain said, as he began two days of campaigning in one
of the key early primary states where he is hoping to upset the
Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ``Too many
Americans go to sleep at night desperately fearing illness or
injury to themselves or a family member because they are without
health insurance to pay their bills.''
</P>
<P>
   But even while he identified access to affordable, quality
health care as one of the most pressing problems facing American
families, McCain stopped well short of the kinds of more
far-reaching legislation that Vice President Al Gore, former Sen.
Bill Bradley and congressional Democrats are running on. His entire
health care plan would cost $15.7 billion over five years, and
nearly half of that would go to increased health benefits to
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he hewed to a more Republican philosophy. His plan for
regulating health maintenance organizations would extend a limited
right to sue to consumers in managed health care plans regulated by
the federal government. But that would not include allowing suits
for punitive damages. His prescription drug plan would offer
federal funds to states that choose to participate and match the
amounts instead of making it a new benefit for all Medicare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed nothing resembling Bradley's call for a vast system
of subsidies and tax credits to insure all children and provide
access to affordable coverage to all adults, allowing anyone to buy
private insurance through the program that insures federal workers,
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting there does not require some grand experiment in social
engineering,'' McCain said, ``or a death-by-a-thousand-cuts,
gradual government takeover of the health care system. We need only
to consult our values and enact tailored reforms that build on the
strengths of the current system.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attempt to find an ideological middle ground was most
clear in his proposal for alleviating the spiraling costs of
prescription drugs to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called for a broad expansion of the
federal Medicare program to add prescription drug coverage for up
to 39 million elderly and disabled Americans. Under his plan,
Medicare beneficiaries would pay a total of $110 billion in
premiums for drug coverage over the next decade, and the government
would put up $118 billion. Both Gore and Bradley have advocated a
Medicare benefit for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, called Tuesday for a far more modest block
grant that would cost the federal government $5.1 billion across
five years, with matching funds put up by those states that choose
to participate in the program. Currently 14 states provide some
kind of drug cost assistance to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   While Medicaid currently covers most prescription drug costs for
the elderly poor, McCain's aides said his plan would help an
estimated 10 million of the near-poor elderly with incomes of up to
two times the poverty level of $8,240 for an individual and $11,060
per couple.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said that he would create regional pilot projects
costing $1 billion over three years to test regional programs to
provide assistance to the elderly regardless of income when they
face catastrophic drug costs ``that can cruelly snatch away a
life's savings.
</P>
<P>
   The speech gave McCain a new opportunity to tie his signature
issue _ the overhaul of the campaign finance laws _ to broader
social concerns. ``Taking the $100,000 special interest checks out
of politics is the gateway through which all other reforms
including the reform of our health care system must pass,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed both parties' fidelity to special interests for
congressional gridlock on regulating managed care. ``Republicans
want to protect the insurance companies from lawsuits,'' he said.
``The Democrats want to let the trial lawyers sue anyone for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain found a middle ground, on regulating managed care,
calling for more protections than Republican legislation that
passed the Senate, but stopping short of the right to sue contained
in a bipartisan bill that the House passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you or a loved one is sick or injured and wrongfully turned
away for care, you must be assured the ability to resolve that
problem rapidly through a fair and independent review process,'' he
said. ``But if you're not satisfied, no American should be denied
the ability to seek redress through the courts.''

   At a news conference later, McCain said he would like to see
independent state panels set up to review cases where consumers are
denied care by a health maintenance organization. His aides said
that under his proposal the 48 million Americans in the managed
care plans that fall under federal regulation would be given a
somewhat broader right to sue than they currently have, if they
were unsatisfied with the review. Currently those in such federally
regulated managed care plans are allowed to sue but only for the
cost of denied medical care.
</P>
<P>
   They would be bared from receiving punitive damages. But they
would be allowed to seek unlimited damages for economic suffering
like lost wages. Dan Schnur, the senator's communications director
said McCain would also propose legislation to put a $250,000 cap on
noneconomic damages, such as awards for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate debated managed care regulation earlier this
year, McCain voted for the Republican bill, which did not include
an expanded right to sue. His aides said he had supported the
legislation because he did not want to see the issue die in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   To extend health insurance coverage to more of the nation's 44
million uninsured, McCain like many Republicans called for an
expansion of medical savings accounts, tax-free accounts that can
be used to cover medical costs, and for a more general tax
reduction to give people more money to buy insurance. He also
called for a more aggressive effort to encourage small businesses
to band together in insurance purchasing pools, as well as a
greater effort to enroll children in a federal program that was
established two years ago for children in families not poor enough
for Medicaid but not affluent enough to buy private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech made him the first Republican to set out a
detailed health care plan. Bush so far has spoken only generally of
extending coverage to more of the uninsured and pointed to the
program in Texas for regulating HMO's.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been more hotly debated in the Democratic
presidential contest because of Bradley's call for a vast system of
subsidies and tax credits that would cost $65 billion a year. Gore
has aggressively picked apart the plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On another front, McCain on Tuesday defended the military's
``don't ask don't tell policy'' toward gay members of the service,
saying ``this policy has worked.'' He criticized Gore for calling
on Monday for the outright elimination of the program, saying the
vice president should not take a position on the issue without
first consulting with high-ranking Pentagon officials.

 &HT;    Cuban inmates still hold hostages, demand attention for their

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ At least six Cuban prisoners, five of whom are
federal immigration detainees, continued to hold a warden and two
sheriff's deputies hostage Tuesday in a south Louisiana jail
surrounded by heavily armed police and federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-takers, reportedly joined by at least two other
inmates Tuesday, released a fourth hostage_another deputy_but were
threatening Tuesday morning to kill the remaining hostages unless
their demands were met within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Being held at knifepoint were Warden Todd Louvierre and deputies
Jolie Sonnier and Brandon Boudreaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is working very hard in this situation to bring
about a peaceful resolution,'' said Mike Gilhooly, a spokesman for
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is responsible
for at least 60 Cubans being held at the jail.
</P>
<P>
   The incident at St. Martin's Parish jail in downtown St.
Martinville focused attention on the long-standing issue of Cuban
refugees held in jails around the United States. And it comes at a
tense time in Cuban-American diplomatic relations because of the
custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, a refugee rescued
from the sea two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   His mother and stepfather died in the waters off Florida as they
tried to flee Cuba with Elian. Elian's father wants the boy back in
Cuba. His stateside relatives want him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the Cubans who took over the St. Martin's Parish jail
were being held there by the INS. The sixth is being held on state
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are still 2,400 Cubans imprisoned by INS in a
legal and diplomatic standoff that grew out of the Marielito
boatlifts of the 1980s. Most are refugees who committed crimes
either here or in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, which U.S. officials accused of emptying its jails during
the boatlifts, resists taking back the detainees, and immigration
laws often bar their release here. ``If we don't believe they're
going to stay out of crime, we don't release them,'' Gilhooy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans in St. Martinville took four hostages as they were
leaving a rooftop recreation area Monday afternoon. They said they
want to be set free and sent to Cuba or another country.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the five has been in jail as long as 13 years,
according to a prisoner who spoke with a Spanish-speaking
television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The INS would not give details of their cases. Officials
identified the Cubans as Gerado Santana of Miami, Elisalte Orta of
Sacramento, Calif., and Jonne Ponte, Juan Miranda and Roberto Grana
Villar, whose hometowns were not given.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Foley said the
U.S. continues to seek a solution to the long-standing problem of
detainees but little progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised the issue of the return of criminal
excludables, as they're called, with the Cubans during each round
of the migration talks since 1984,'' he said. ``The Cuban
government has not agreed to accept the return of such
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have argued for years that the INS system
for reviewing the prisoners is inefficient and flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are immigrants they are being treated
differently,'' said Ruby Feria of Mothers for Freedom, a Miami
support group for Cuban detainees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration among detainees has spawned at least three prison
riots over the years, including one at the Atlanta Federal
Penitentiary in November 1987. That same year, rioting detainees
burned to the ground a holding facility in Oakdale, La., about 50
miles from St. Martinville.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Cuban inmates took 89 hostages and held the facility
for 12 days. After negotiations, some of the Cubans were released
and some were sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But many remained in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Cuban inmates in Talladega County, Ala., held hostages
in a facility for nine days. That siege ended when the FBI stormed
the prison.

STUDY BACKS A DRUG FOR HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa., Colo.) (Eds: SUBS 6th graf to correct spelling of William.) 
 (rk) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted,
researchers have found that the drug Ritalin, the object of sharp
debate for three decades, was more effective than
behavior-modification therapy in treating children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who worked at six sites around the country in
teams assembled by the National Institutes of Health, said that
adding the behavioral therapy to Ritalin treatment was no more
effective than the drug alone. But they said they found that about
70 percent of the children they studied also turned out to have
problems like depression and anxiety. In those cases, they said,
behavior therapy provided significant benefits, especially when
used in combination with the Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   The results, reported in the current issue of the Archives of
General Psychiatry, were discussed at a news conference Tuesday at
the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter S. Jenson, a child psychiatrist at Columbia and a
senior adviser to the NIH who directed the project, said the
results were ``the first real information on comparative treatments
over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James T. McCracken, the director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the Neuropyschiatric Institute of the University of
California at Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research,
called the study a landmark and said it proved the benefits of
treating hyperactive children with a stimulant. ``As a child
psychiatrist, it is still surprising that Ritalin remains as
controversial as it is,'' he said. ``One hopes that this study will
put some of the controversy to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Carey, a child psychiatrist at the Children's
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said that while he had
no criticism of the study, Ritalin is overused, adding, ``Do you
give it to a child who talks incessantly in line?'' The drug should
be reserved for real brain disorders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent battles over the drug took place last
month when the Colorado Board of Education moved to discourage
teachers from recommending behavioral drugs like Ritalin and urged
school personnel to use discipline and instruction instead to
overcome problem behavior in the classroom. The action was said to
have stemmed from fears that such drugs were related to violence
among children, although medical scientists say there is no
evidence of that. Its side effects, which include headaches or loss
of appetite, are reported as minor and reversible.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH researchers studied 579 children over 14 months. The
children, who were 7 to 9 years of age, were given long and
detailed examinations, Jensen said. About 80 percent were boys.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments of the children were divided into four groups: those
that received Ritalin alone, received intensive behavior management
therapy alone, a combination of the two and whatever kind of
treatment was standard for their community.
</P>
<P>
   The researches found that among the children who had attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder but not the other psychiatric
disorders, Ritalin brought improvement in their conditions when it
was used alone, regardless of whether it was accompanied by other
therapy. They also found that Ritalin and the intensive behavior
therapy used in combination were the most effective when used for
the children with psychiatric problems that went beyond attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The study found a number of differences between the institutes
of health program of intensive behavior management _ based on the
B.F. Skinner theory on the value of using positive reinforcement to
encourage acceptable behavior _ and the various community therapies
used for the children in the fourth group.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen P. Hinshaw, a child psychiatrist and professor at
the University of California at Berkeley, said they included
monthly meetings under the NIH approach and more emphasis on
behavior management by parents in the home and teachers in the
classroom.

 &HT;    PERCEIVED U.S. SNUB ASIDE, PANAMA COMMEMORATES TRANSFER OF CANAL
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Water cannons fired into the air, tugboats
blasted their whistles and a choir sang the ``Hallelujah Chorus''
Tuesday as Panama moved closer to taking full ownership of the
famous canal that bears its name.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter represented the United States at a
ceremony overlooking the 50-mile-long waterway, signing documents
with Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso as Spain's King Juan
Carlos and the presidents of a half-dozen Latin American countries
looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indeed a historic occasion, perhaps the most
significant that has occurred in this hemisphere,'' Carter said.
the canal ``Was a source of great pride in my country from the time
I was a child until I became president.''
</P>
<P>
   The final, legal hand-over mandated by treaties negotiated by
Carter in 1977 won't come until noon on Dec. 31. Panamanian
officials pushed up the ceremony to avoid conflicts with millennium
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last we have reached victory, the canal is ours,'' said
Moscoso, noting the event was a profound moment in her young
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour ceremony marked an important milestone in the
96-year relationship between the United States and Panama _ and
reflected some of the tensions that have beset that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
declined to attend, leaving many Panamanians miffed at what they
see as a snub of their debut on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Clinton announced he wasn't coming, it was like, 'OK, he
has a domestic political problem,''' said Roberto Eisenmann,
founder of La Prensa, one of Panama's largest newspapers. ``But
when Albright announced she wasn't coming, it was a real slap in
the face. It showed a lack of interest in the whole region.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton said the U.S. remains committed to the
canal's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ceremony underscores our confidence in the government
of Panama and the Panamanian people's ability to manage this vital
artery of commerce,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. retains the right to intervene if there is a threat to
the canal's safety. But a dozen U.S. military bases within the
10-mile-wide canal zone have been closed and turned over to Panama,
leaving the country of 2.8 million responsible for day-to-day
security.
</P>
<P>
   American critics of the canal transfer fear that the Panamanians
will let the 86-year-old waterway fall victim to poor maintenance,
corrupt politics, terrorism or influence by foreign governments.
They are particularly upset by a contract giving management of two
ports at either end of the canal to a company they believe has ties
to the Chinese military _ a charge downplayed by current U.S.
military officials, and denied by the Hong Kong-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is action by the leadership of Panama and the
U.S. to restore a U.S. military presence here, there's a great
danger this magnificent canal could be threatened within a short
time,'' said Howard Phillips, head of the Conservative Caucus, who
lobbied against the hand-over in the 1970s. ``It will do us damn
little good to send in the Marines after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnover is a bookend to what many historians have called
``the American Century.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. construction of the canal between 1904 and 1914 marked
America's emergence as a world power, signaling the country's
engineering prowess and financial might while providing a crucial
economic and military link.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a powerful symbol of U.S. domination of the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Slicing through a 500-foot-tall mountain range, the canal also
sliced across a nation that was never comfortable with the
overwhelming presence of its more powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Panama was a part of Colombia until 1903, when a group of
residents declared independence _ under the watchful eye of U.S.
Marines who steamed into a Panamanian port as the revolt unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The new Panamanian government quickly signed a treaty allowing
the U.S. to finish building the canal _ and also to run it and the
canal zone, which effectively became a strip of U.S. soil within
the midst of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, thousands of Americans lived and worked in the
360,240-acre zone, enjoying subsidized housing and high pay in
exchange for hard work far from home. Panamanian workers were paid
less and subjected to U.S. laws within the zone.
</P>
<P>
   But they also enjoyed higher paying jobs than they would have
found in Panama's native industries.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting emotions many Panamanians feel about the canal,
the turn-over and the United States are still readily evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the Americans in all forms,'' said Fulgencio Bonilla,
53, a Panama City resident. ``We need their experience in running
the canal, and we need their military to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, worrisome clashes have flared along the border
between Panama and Colombia. Just last weekend, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, attacked a Colombian outpost on
the border, while other unidentified armed bandits _ possibly drug
traffickers _ have crossed into Panama and attacked rural villages.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's army was disbanded in 1989 after the United States
invaded to depose strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. He was
whisked to Miami, tried and imprisoned for aiding Colombian drug
traffickers. The country now relies on an 18,000-person police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show 60 to 70 percent of Panamanians wish the
United States would retain a military presence here.
</P>
<P>
   The canal is considered one of the engineering marvels of the
modern age. It carries roughly four percent of the world's
shipping, and earns nearly $600 million in tolls per year. About 12
percent of U.S. shipping passes through the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter acknowledged that the hand-over was
unpopular in the United States, but has said repeatedly that it was
``the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who headed a 29-member U.S. delegation that also
included Army Secretary Louis Caldera and Ambassador Simon Ferro,
criticized the doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country and in this one there were demagogues who
exaggerated problems and spoke about catastrophic events,'' he
said. ``There are still some in my country spreading false stories
about security of the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Carter told the crowd, ``We're celebrating a new
relationship between your country and mine. Today we come together
in a spirit of mutual respect acknowledging without question the
complete sovereignty of Panama. It's a very important moment for
all of Latin America.''

 Matthew Gurewitsch's last article on theater for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the Noel Coward revue ``If Love Were All.''  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What may be the very last new ``Hamlet'' of
Shakespeare's millennium opens at the Joseph Papp Public Theater
Sunday night _ boards that many melancholy Danes have trod before.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Liev Schreiber wears the customary suits of solemn
black, under the direction of the Romanian-born Andrei Serban, an
unapologetic eclectic. In his early years, Serban assisted Peter
Brook and went on to make his name with experimental productions of
Greek tragedy, Chekhov, Goldoni and Shakespeare for companies
including La Mama, the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge,
Mass., and the Public.
</P>
<P>
   His awareness of the history of ``Hamlet'' and of theater
history in general converge at the moment shown in the accompanying
photograph, when the prince is dispensing his famous advice to the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``O, there be players that I have seen play ...,'' Hamlet begins
airily, proceeding to diss them all. As he does so, cast members
carry on posters of Hamlets past. Ralph Fiennes, lately of
Broadway, is there, along with the Public's own Sam Waterston,
Kevin Kline and Diane Venora (borne by Ms. Venora herself, this
production's Gertrude), plus the celluloid princelings Laurence
Olivier, Mel Gibson and Kenneth Branagh, not to mention John
Barrymore and Sarah Bernhardt, still legends after generations.
</P>
<P>
   Last and largest in the parade is a blow-up of Schreiber, so big
that it takes two actors to carry it. They enter just in time to
illustrate the final words of Hamlet's critique: ``They imitated
humanity so abominably.'' Subtext: If the shoe fits ... Preview
audiences have been giving the line a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't get it, Serban offered this brief aside:
``When the posters arrive, the audience may say: `Where are we? Are
we in Elsinore?' I say, `Listen, we are not in Elsinore, guys, we
are in the theater.'''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few quantities in this ``Hamlet'' bear noting. A single
intermission. Two Fortinbrases. Three extra ghosts of Hamlet's
father. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   About the intermission, Serban said: ``After directing Wagner's
`Ring' in San Francisco this summer, I could see a value created by
sheer duration. You're entering a new universe. When you're on a
journey, you don't feel time so much. Second, the play has two
broad movements. First, Hamlet is given his mission of revenge by
the ghost, an aim he pursues more and more unsuccessfully until he
kills Polonius. Hamlet's departure for England closes the first
cycle. When he comes back to Denmark, he has found out about
courage, determination, will, following one's aim _ everything he
has been missing.''
</P>
<P>
   And why the double Fortinbras? Shakespeare's prince of Norway is
a man of steel who arrives at Elsinore just in time to take charge
without a fight. In Serban's show, a Joan of Arc arrives, arm in
arm with an androgynous twin brother, with whom she recites in
high-pitched, echo-distorted tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet's death is a kind of sacrifice,'' the director said.
``He wants to give an example that will give other people a chance
to get things right. Then Fortinbras appears, like the Archangel
Gabriel, in the outfit of a warrior. But they are warriors in a
spiritual army, bringing peace, a caressing kind of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a coda for a mystery play, worlds away from where the show
began, hours before, when a stagehand hauled out a smoke machine, a
la Brecht, and released a few puffs. In between, Hamlet has taunted
Ophelia in scenes straight from Artaud's Theater of Cruelty, there
have been touches of Meyerhold, a ghost out of an Elizabethan
trapdoor, a closet scene that is pure Stanislavsky and a
gravedigger on loan from the New Vaudeville. Nor has Serban
excluded Kabuki, Noh and other traditions of the East.
</P>
<P>
   Why all these styles? ``They are trying to mirror life,'' Serban
said. ``In life, there is so much comedy and tragedy one moment
after another. But it's hard to say that life has a style.''

 &HT;    ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS TO OPEN WITH MIDDLE EAST PEACE AT STAKE
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Still hoping to broker lasting peace in the Middle
East before leaving office, President Clinton aims to jump-start
long-stalled Israeli-Syrian negotiations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will host Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa for morning talks at the White
House, followed by planned face-to-face talks after lunch between
the Israeli and the Syrian officials at the historic Blair House.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand will be Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
has worked for months trying to nurse the tenuous Mideast peace
process back to something resembling good health.
</P>
<P>
   That process _ key to U.S. political and strategic interests in
the oil-rich Middle East _ has been a central goal of U.S.
diplomacy for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching an Israel-Syria accord _ centered on Israeli withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights in return for security guarantees
from Syria _ is seen as one key to an overall peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vital, because Syria has a large army, Syria controls
Lebanon and it has to do with Israel's entire northern border.,''
said Jon Alterman, Mideast analyst with the U.S. Institute for
Peace, a quasi-governmental think tank. ``It's a question of
whether Israel is surrounded with neighbors with which it is at
peace, or has enemies on its northern border.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high stakes, or perhaps because of them, the
Israel-Syria track has been stalled since talks collapsed nearly
four years ago. At issue are complicated territorial and security
concerns that have divided the two neighbors since Israel's
inception in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   After months of intensive U.S. diplomacy, Barak and Syrian
President Hafez Assad agreed last week to resume negotiations under
White House auspices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process,
one that can shape the face of the region for generations to
come,'' Clinton said in announcing the talks last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace has long been within our sight,'' he said. ``Today, it
is within our grasp, and we must seize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who is 69 and in failing health, is sending al-Sharaa to
represent Syria. Both he and Barak were scheduled to arrive in
Washington overnight.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement is expected this week. Instead, Sharaa and Barak
are slated to focus on process matters and a road map for another
round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly no expectation that they can reach a broad,
wide-ranging agreement on issues that are quite difficult and
long-standing,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
``But I think what they will hope to do over the next two days is
work hard to find a process that allows them, over a period of
time, to reach a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the two officials will return to their
respective capitals after two days of talks here and schedule a
next-step summit in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict how long this will take,'' a senior
administration official told reporters at a White House news
conference. He spoke to more than 60 reporters on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we feel there's momentum and we are going to want
to be building on the momentum,'' the official said. ``But I think
the first two days will be much more geared towards organization
and the process than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the Israeli-Syrian dispute is the occupied Golan
Heights, a large and strategically valuable piece of high ground
where Israel's northern border abuts against southwestern Syria.
</P>
<P>
   After Syria joined Jordan and Egypt in attacking Israel in 1967,
Israel countered with a fierce return blow, seizing the Golan
territory _ a strategic prize for armies dating to antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the Golan has given Israeli troops a commanding
foothold in Syria. It has also provided a valuable listening post
for eavesdropping into Syrian military conversations and for
monitoring the activities of groups such as Hezbollah, regarded as
a terrorist outfit by Israel and its ally, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan also contains the Sea of Galilee _ the single largest
source of fresh water in the desert region.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Israel's continuing occupation of the Golan, though, has come at
a price.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for one thing, remains in a state of undeclared war
against Syria and its army of 400,000 forces.
</P>
<P>
   A deal on the Golan would come with security guarantees for
Israel _ including dramatic reductions in the number of Syrian
forces arrayed near the Israeli borders _ as well as valuable
trade, investment and diplomatic ties with a land bridge linking
Israel to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, Israelis will be able to drive to Europe,
they will be able to trade with Syrians and Syrians will be able to
trade with Israelis,'' if an accord is reached and relations are
normalized, said Alterman. ``Syria will open up to Israel and
Israel will open up to Syria. Exactly how that works is something
to be negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Syria have been at loggerheads over the issue since
1967. Following that year's Six-Day War, the United Nations called
for the so-called ``land for peace'' formula at the heart of this
week's talks. That appeal, enshrined in U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242, still lies near the epicenter of the complex quest
for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   A second component is Israeli-Lebanon relations. Israel
continues to occupy Lebanese territory it seized in 1982 as part of
an offensive against Palestine Liberation Organization operations
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which has based troops in Lebanon since 1976, is
effectively in the driver's seat on the Lebanon-Israeli
land-for-peace front. A deal between those two countries would
likely fall into place, Mideast experts agree, once Israel and
Syria reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   The third and most troublesome part of the equation is the
remaining gap between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have set a
mid-February deadline for reaching a framework for so-called final
status talks, aimed at addressing the most contentious outstanding
issues between them, including the future of Jerusalem and the
question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the two men have committed to winding up final
status talks by next October _ conveniently in time for Clinton to
claim a foreign policy victory on the eve of November's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for Americans, however, stretch far beyond politics
and presidential legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Israel remains the staunchest U.S. ally in the fractious Middle
East, supplier of a substantial amount of the crude oil that fuels
the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, nestled between Israel and another U.S. ally, NATO member
Turkey, has the potential to be a bridge or a chasm between
southeastern Europe and the volatile Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And Israeli security concerns still darkly complicate U.S.
relations with the Arab world, something American diplomacy has
sought for decades to move beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S.-brokered accord that would end half a century of enmity
and bloodshed in the fractious Middle East would bode well not just
for the region.
</P>
<P>
   If there are benefits to the United States, there will most
assuredly be costs as well. Israeli press reports have suggested in
recent days that Barak will ask Clinton for a commitment for what
could amount to more than $10 billion over time to help finance
</P>
<P>
   operations associated with Israel's withdrawal _ if one is
agreed upon _ from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart neither accepted nor rejected those figures on Tuesday,
but he made clear that the White House was prepared to entertain
some sort of assistance request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always stood ready to help our friend, Israel,'' said
Lockhart. ``As we move forward, those questions, I'm certain, will
be discussed.''

BRADLEY ATTACKS GORE AS CARING MORE ABOUT `PRESERVING POWER' THAN
REFORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a prelude to his cross-party appearance Thursday
with Sen. John McCain to promote campaign finance reform, Bill
Bradley spoke out Tuesday against the influence of money in
politics and attacked Vice President Al Gore for appearing to care
more about ``preserving power'' than reducing the flow of campaign
donations to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seven years in power, Al Gore has not come close to
enacting campaign finance reform,'' Bradley said at Fordham
University on Manhattan's West Side. ``I have profound differences
with Al Gore. He is wedded to the ways of Washington. Not once has
he called out for changes in the campaign finance system. It shows
he doesn't care about reform as much as preserving power.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, Bradley said, Gore, his opponent for the Democratic
presidential nomination, paid ``lip service'' to campaign finance
reform. ``When I called for the elimination of soft money,''
Bradley said, ``Al Gore's campaign attacked me rather than call for
reform. This is an issue they are afraid to touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bradley is to appear with McCain, who is seeking the
Republican presidential nomination, at a New Hampshire forum where
they plan to present a bipartisan appeal for campaign finance
reform. Both have called for a ban on soft money, or unrestricted
large donations to political parties from wealthy individuals,
corporations and unions, and both have made the issue of money in
politics a central theme in their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters after his speech, Bradley said he agreed
to appear with McCain because ``it shows that this is a different
kind of a campaign and because it is an important symbol that it
will take both parties to make campaign finance reform happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Bradley running nearly even with Gore among
New York Democrats three months before the primary, Bradley is
striking a theme that has shadowed Gore since 1996. In a 1997
congressional investigation of fund-raising activities in the last
election, Gore came under fire for attending a Democratic
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple, for making fund-raising telephone
calls from his White House office and for aggressively pursuing
large soft-money campaign contributions for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore called Bradley a latecomer to the campaign finance
issue, saying that he had taken it up only as he was about to leave
the Senate in 1996, while Gore had sponsored legislation in
Congress as early as 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Bradley sat in the Senate over 17 years without
authoring his own campaign finance reform legislation,'' said Chris
Lehane, Gore's press secretary, ``Al Gore has a real record of
action on campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For his speech, Bradley was flanked by several New York
Democratic politicians, including Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, whose district includes the West Side, and
City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge. The Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare,
president of Fordham and chairman of the New York Campaign Finance
Board, a quasi-independent body that overseas New York's public
campaign finance system, also appeared.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to proposing a soft-money ban, Bradley has proposed
providing federal candidates with free television time and greater
public funding. Such changes, he said, are necessary because
Congress is unable to ``deliver on the hopes and the dreams'' of
ordinary Americans and because money ``drowns out the voice of
ordinary citizens'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money sets the agenda in politics; money makes a mockery of
our representative system,'' Bradley said. ``If you reduce money in
politics, the people's agenda has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The last Congress, Bradley said, failed to enact a patients'
bill of rights because of opposition from insurance companies and
health maintenance organizations, failed to enact measures to curb
gun violence because of opposition from the National Rifle
Association and failed to increase the minimum wage because of
corporate opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Students listening to the speech said they found Bradley's
message appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't decided who I will support, but I like that he
didn't shy away from the big issues, like gun control and attacking
big money,'' said Sara Dawida, a Fordham sophomore. Justin Brennan,
a junior, said that ``definitely campaign finance reform is the
issue people came to hear,'' while Olivia Vaughn, a senior, said
she liked Bradley's ``stand on global issues, and I especially
agree with his emphasis on campaign finance reform.''

MONSANTO SUED OVER USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY IN DEVELOPING SEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the nation's most prominent antitrust lawyers filed a
class-action lawsuit against Monsanto Co. on Tuesday, accusing it
of rushing genetically engineered seeds to the marketplace without
properly testing them for safety, and of forming an international
cartel that conspired to control the world's market in corn and
soybean seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in
Washington on behalf of six farmers, is the latest skirmish in the
debate over the use of bio-engineered seeds, which are popular
among American farmers but troubling to consumers in Europe and to
environmental groups that contend that they are potentially
dangerous to humans and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which contends that Monsanto is at the hub of an
international conspiracy to control a large part of the world's
seed supply, was brought on behalf of a coalition of small farmers
and farm groups that accuse Monsanto of giving farmers false and
fraudulent guarantees on the safety and marketability of a new
breed of bio-engineered seeds. But some of the nation's largest
farm groups criticized the suit, saying that American farmers have
largely benefited from new technologies in the seed market, which
have reduced the use of herbicides and pesticides and increased
crop yields.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto denounced the suit, arguing that its biotechnology
products were safe and that they had been approved by U.S.
regulators. The company, which is based in St. Louis, also denied
that it engaged in any anti-competitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely disappointed that the plaintiffs have filed a
lawsuit without merit,'' said David Snively, an assistant general
counsel at Monsanto, which is one of the world's largest
agricultural seed and chemical companies. ``We have complied with
every part of the law and now we're dealing with lawyers who don't
care about science and are trying to make a political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The real force behind the suit is a coalition of environmental
groups, including Greenpeace, that are serving as advisers in the
case. The initiator of the lawsuit is Jeremy Rifkin, the
environmental activist who has repeatedly decried biotech crops as
potentially dangerous and likely to lead to ``genetic pollution''
and the creation of ``superweeds'' that could drastically alter the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin, a longtime critic of Monsanto, said Tuesday that about a
year ago he hired what he calls a ``Dream Team of the Green
movement'' _ a group of antitrust lawyers from 10 firms who are now
using words reminiscent of the Justice Department's case against
Microsoft, such as contentions that Monsanto has gained monopoly
status through the use of bully tactics, intimidation, deceptive
business practices and restrictive technology deals with small
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the case is Michael Hausfeld, the Washington attorney
who is best known for defending Alaskan natives in the Exxon Valdez
oil spill, and more recently for helping to win a $1.1 billion
price-fixing settlement against the world's largest vitamin makers.
Hausfeld is also representing victims forced by Nazis to work
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Also considering a lead role in the suit is David Boies, the New
York attorney who led the Justice Department's prosecution of
Microsoft. Boies was a lead attorney in the class-action suit
against the vitamin makers and is said to be interested in the case
because of concerns about farmers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a new chapter in the debate over
genetically modified foods,'' Rifkin said at a press conference
Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In filing the suit in federal court, Hausfeld said that he was
seeking class-action status for the case. Nine other companies,
like DuPont and Novartis, were named as co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that since 1996 Monsanto has been using its
clout in the agriculture market to gain control over the corn and
soybean markets and to prepare for the widespread introduction of
genetically modified seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that as a leader in the field of agricultural
biotechnology, Monsanto initiated an effort to neutralize
competition through licensing agreements with its competitors and
the misuse of intellectual- property rights.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which spent more than $8 billion to acquire large
seed companies in the last few years, also conspired with other
large seed companies, the suit claims, to inflate prices and force
small farmers to pay excessive ``technology fees'' and agree to
restrictive planting contracts that sometimes forced them to buy
package deals of Monsanto products.
</P>
<P>
   In the news conference in Washington, Hausfeld also said that
there was a significant amount of uncertainty about whether
genetically modified seeds were safe, and that farm exports were
being harmed by growing scientific and political concerns that have
arisen despite Monsanto's claims that the products are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Several farm groups, however, defended Monsanto and its use of
biotechnology. ``Soybean farmers strongly support the technology,''
said Bob Callanan, a spokesman for the American Soybean Association
in St. Louis. ``They see it as a trend. They're using safer
chemicals and less chemicals. We also believe in the regulatory
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Callanan said that biotech seeds are now used on about 40
million acres in the United States, up from about 8 million acres
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monsanto is being singled out because they're the only one
with the Roundup Ready soybean product in the market,'' he said,
referring to the company's genetically engineered seeds. ``It's not
their fault there aren't competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who have been consistently behind the
company's move into biotechnology, also defended Monsanto. ``This
is a very different situation from Microsoft making every computer
company pay for Windows,'' said Nicholas Redfield, an analyst at
Bank One Investments. ``On some of its products, Monsanto has a
monopoly but it's a legal monopoly. They have the patent.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, the chief executive at Monsanto, said in an
interview Tuesday that one of the reasons the case may have been
centered on Monsanto alone, rather than on the entire agricultural
biotechnology industry, which was initially planned, was simple:
``Public relations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, which has been under fire here and in Europe over its
development of biotechnology products, has been attacked for trying
to ``play God'' with the world's food supply. Advocates of
biotechnology say that a ``hysterical'' campaign has been waged
against the company in recent months, putting pressure on its stock
price, which fell 25 cents Tuesday, to $41.875.
</P>
<P>
   But Hausfeld said that Monsanto aims to control not just the
seed market, but the world's food chain, even the water rights in
some countries. He said related lawsuits are planned outside the
United States.

GRIFFEY BLOCKED TRADE TO METS BECAUSE OF ANNOYANCE WITH MARINERS'
TACTICS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Late Monday night, Ken Griffey Jr., the
Seattle Mariners star who is generally considered the best player
in baseball, used his veto rights to quash a possible trade to the
Mets. But the talented center fielder might have been trying on a
New York Mets uniform for size Tuesday if they had begun their
aggressive pursuit of him earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility arose Tuesday with the confirmation by
Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg, that the Mets were one of the
teams on Griffey's original list of four teams to which he would
accept a trade. But even before the teams negotiated their
contingency deal, Griffey, annoyed at the Mariners' negotiating
tactics, had reduced the list to one team, and it wasn't the Mets.
It was the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 30-year-old Griffey invoked his status as a
10-year veteran (the last five with the same team) and blocked a
trade, providing a striking example of how players increasingly use
their rights to determine where they play, and for whom. And the
Mets were left contemplating what might have been if they had added
a 10-time all-star who has averaged 52 home runs the last four
years and is a sensational fielder as well.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey drew up the list late in October after meeting with
Mariners officials and telling them he did not plan to remain with
the team after the 2000 season. Since Griffey can be a free agent
after next season and the Mariners faced the prospect of losing him
and receiving nothing in return, they proceeded to initiate talks
in an effort to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Then came word from Chuck Armstrong, the Mariners' president,
about a conversation he said he had with Fred Wilpon, the Mets'
co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks into the process,'' Goldberg said by telephone from
his home in Cincinnati, ``Chuck Armstrong told me the Mets were
very lukewarm toward Kenny but that Wilpon had called him and
specifically asked him about Alex Rodriguez's availability.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is the Mariners' shortstop who also can be a free
agent after next season. He has told the club he doesn't want to be
traded but wants to finish out his contract in Seattle. The
Mariners have not tried to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone efforts to reach Wilpon for comment on his
conversation with Armstrong were unsuccessful, but Goldberg's
characterization of it fits what had been the Mets' internal
thinking earlier in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent weeks, though, their stance on Griffey changed,
heating up to the extent that general manager Steve Phillips seemed
all consumed at baseball's winter meetings in his attempt to
acquire the player whose 398 home runs place him more than halfway
to Hank Aaron's all-time total. Phillips was intent on pulling off
the coup of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wired all day,'' an acquaintance said of the general
manager's demeanor Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he confirmed that Griffey had rejected the trade,
Phillips could not hide his feelings about almost having pulled it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean if we got Ken Griffey Jr. your papers wouldn't stop
the presses?'' Phillips, his voice rising an octave or two, asked a
group of New York reporters just before 2 a.m. New York time
Tuesday, an hour when newspaper presses were running down.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips was too late. Griffey had changed his mind about
the Mets a couple of weeks earlier. It was his change of mind, in
fact, that prompted Goldberg to relate the Armstrong-Wilpon
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might look like two weeks ago that Kenny changed his
mind,'' the agent said. ``It's also a situation that a team can
change its mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and his aides met with the Mariners at the general
managers meetings in Dana Point, 30 miles south of here, the second
week of November. But, a participant in the meetings said, the
Mariners did not say whom they wanted for Griffey and the Mets
neither asked for names nor made an offer. But the Mets' strategy
was far more aggressive the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips pursued Griffey relentlessly despite word from the
superstar's agent that he would accept a deal only to Cincinnati,
the city where he grew up and where his father is employed as a
Reds coach and presumptive manager-in-waiting. Shrugging off the
report, Phillips plowed forward and at least came close to an
agreement Monday with Pat Gillick, the hamstrung Mariners general
manager, on a contingency trade.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether or not an actual trade had been agreed
to. Phillips and Gillick both have declined to say. One person who
had participated in meetings between the teams said that four basic
names were on the table. When Armstrong called Goldberg to seek
Griffey's approval, the club president said the Mariners would get
three of them. The four were Armando Benitez, Roger Cedeno, Octavio
Dotel and Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call about 11 Eastern last night from Chuck Armstrong,
who's in Hawaii,'' Goldberg said, ``and he asked if Junior would
consider a trade to the Mets. He said they needed to know
immediately. There was no time to think on it. I talked to Junior
and he politely declined.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is, in baseball parlance, a 10-and-5 man. That means he
has played in the major leagues for at least 10 years and the last
five with the same team. That status, in turn, means he cannot be
traded without his permission. It does not give him the right to
ask to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who can be a free agent after next season, when his
contract ends, nevertheless gave the Mariners a list of four clubs
to which they could trade him _ the Mets, the Reds, Atlanta and
Houston. But the Mariners strayed far beyond those teams, and their
disregard for the list led to the change of mind that turned out to
be devastating for the Mets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Despite the list, Goldberg said, the Mariners asked him if
Griffey would approve trades to the New York Yankees, Cleveland,
St. Louis, Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh. The Mariners did not
necessarily have deals completed with those teams, but Gillick was
trying hard to expand his options. Griffey wound up contracting
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed his mind 2 1-2 weeks ago,'' the lawyer said. ``The
reason was that he was being asked to go to teams that were not on
the list. He didn't like all the misleading with teams not on his
list. He was very uncomfortable with that. It was never that he had
a deal. It was `we got something we like, something we'd probably
accept.' After a month of that, he just thought it was better to
shut it down. He told the Mariners and I told the Mariners he would
accept a trade to Cincinnati. Other than that he was coming back
for the last year in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's decision not to play for the Mets was not directed at
them, Goldberg stressed. ``It has nothing to do with the team or
the town or anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Gillick kept talking to teams not on the list, he explained
that Griffey could change his mind. Just last Sunday, as the
temperature of his talks with the Mets was rising, he said,
``Kenny's a great guy, but basically his mind changes from day to
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Griffey told a baseball executive this week that
Griffey was very upset with the Mariners for comments like that and
for their continuing efforts to trade him places he wouldn't go.
His attitude, the executive quoted the friends as saying, was that
he would play out his contract in Seattle, leave as a free agent
next November and let the Mariners be stuck with two draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   After the Reds terminated talks with the Mariners last Saturday,
the Mets became the team most likely to conclude a deal. They did,
but it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, following his usual practice, refused to acknowledge
that a trade had been completed contingent on Griffey's approval.
``I'm not going to confirm a deal was in place,'' he said before
talking about stopping the presses, ``but I will confirm that he
has said he would not want to come to the Mets in a trade. Seattle
let us know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Phillips feel he had wasted his time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like it was a waste of time,'' he said. ``I think
it was a worthy effort to pursue, an exciting one to pursue. I'm
always willing to leave that door ajar to be revisited. The way it
stands today it's unlikely something will happen, but things
change. We still have some areas we can have some discussion with
Seattle to make it convenient if something were to change.''

SOX DID VERY LITTLE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who
often is among the last to arrive and first to leave at baseball
gatherings, remained behind here Tuesday when the winter meetings
came to a close and most club executives scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was taking an extra day not because he had the
expectation of closing a deal for a starting pitcher, a lefthanded
reliever, or a power-hitting outfielder. He had other matters to
tend to, though he expressed confidence that by the end of the
week, the Sox will have pitching help and perhaps a productive
hitter (Carl Everett).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple of things we're working on that may come
together by the end of the week,'' said Duquette, who in the five
days of meetings here made one minor trade, swapping outfielder
Damon Buford to the Cubs for utility infielder Manny Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said talks with the Astros about Everett are
continuing, even as Houston GM Gerry Hunsicker and his staff left
Tuesday. It appears that if the Sox make the deal they've discussed
with Houston _ trading shortstop prospect Adam Everett and Single A
lefthander Greg Miller _ Duquette will have to do so without first
striking a deal for a contract extension with Everett, who is
eligible to become a free agent after next season.
</P>
<P>
   As things stood, the Astros were not likely to give Duquette
permission to negotiate with Everett, but as the Sox GM noted,
similar circumstances did not prevent him from trading for Pedro
Martinez two years ago, when Martinez could have walked as a free
agent after one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to balance the talent you have to give up in such a
trade against the risk that the player you're trading for will play
for you just one year,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette indicated that Everett wasn't the only option he was
pursuing to strengthen the outfield, noting that he has also been
talking with the Anaheim Angels. But he conceded that the Angels
are not inclined to trade right fielder Tim Salmon, and while the
Sox also have some interest in Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson, the
Angels were on the verge of dealing Edmonds to the Oakland A's for
a package of prospects. He also has talked with the Padres about an
outfielder, presumably Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, according to sources, still would like to deal
Everett to the Sox, alleviating the surplus of outfielders they
have while eliminating one in a host of salary concerns. But if the
Sox do not act soon, the Astros say they have at least one other
club that has expressed serious interest in the switch-hitting
center fielder, who last year hit .325 with 25 home runs and 108
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette all but conceded that when he acquires a starting
pitcher, it will not be of the high-end variety, like lefthander
Chuck Finley. Duquette did not make an offer for Finley here, and
essentially acknowledged that the other teams in the running _ the
Indians, Orioles, and Mariners _ would be willing to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he has interest in free agent righthander Steve
Trachsel, an 18-game loser for the Cubs last season who nonetheless
is seeking a big payday, and lefthander Jeff Fassero, whom he once
had in Montreal. He also acknowledged that the club has interest in
Graeme Lloyd, the Aussie lefthanded reliever, but there were other
pitchers the Sox are looking at while waiting for the market to
fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get a starting pitcher before we do anything
else,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was unable to match up with the Padres for lefthander
Sterling Hitchcock but continues to talk with the Cardinals about
righthander Juan Acevedo.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette scoffed at the rumors that greeted him upon his arrival
here that the Sox might have interest in Mo Vaughn. The Angels
weren't shopping the former Boston slugger, whom they're expecting
to bounce back from last season's disastrous experience, which led
to the firing of GM Bill Bavasi and manager Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were not happy that Vaughn frequently had a couple of
his friends in the clubhouse, though the club admits it was at
fault for not barring the practice until late in the season.
Vaughn's decision to miss a game in Boston so he could attend the
funeral of a close friend's mother also provoked some resentment
among teammates. Typically, the understanding is that a player
misses a game only for the funeral of an immediate family member.

LEBANON WAITS UNEASILY WHILE SYRIA TALKS FOR BOTH OF THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ When Israel and Syria sit down for talks in
Washington on Wednesday, the most notable absentee will be Lebanon,
the last active battleground in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement in Lebanon, where Israeli forces battle regularly
with Lebanese guerrillas, is seen as vital to any permanent peace.
But Syria, not Lebanon, has the final say on Lebanon's policies.
That factor has not only kept Lebanese officials out of the talks
for now, but also could play a big role in determining how the
negotiations unfold, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very real sense, the Syrians will have two seats at the
table, whether or not the Lebanese are there,'' said a
Damascus-based diplomat. ``And while Syrians and Lebanese see
eye-to-eye on most things, when they don't, you can guess who will
end up the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Lebanon have vowed to work together, and Lebanese
officials are expected to accept a U.S. invitation to join in
parallel talks with Israel as early as next week, when a second
round of discussions is expected to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa has said that his
country believes that progress on the Syrian and Lebanese fronts
should be ``simultaneous.'' Each of the two countries has promised
not to make peace without the other and not to compromise on their
basic demands.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad was reported to have telephoned his
Lebanese counterpart, Emile Lahoud, to coordinate their positions.
That kind of consultation surprised no one in Lebanon, where Lahoud
and his fellow leaders are recognized as owing their jobs to Syria,
and where its interests are overseen by Bashar Assad, the
president's son and presumed heir.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lebanon's exclusion from the first round of talks has
caused some grumbling in Beirut. While Lebanese officials are
careful not to criticize Syria, which maintains 30,000 troops in
Lebanon, some have worried in private that Lebanon could be handed
a deal that does not fully reflect their country's interests.
</P>
<P>
   At least in some quarters, what is of particular concern is the
prospect of a peace accord that might rid Lebanon of one foreign
army _ the 2,000 Israelis involved in its south _ while further
entrenching another.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian forces came to Lebanon in 1976, at the invitation of the
government. Syria also imposed the 1991 peace, which ended
Lebanon's 16-year-long civil war. But the Syrian troops have never
departed.
</P>
<P>
   As a price for a withdrawal from Lebanon, Israel is expected to
demand security guarantees for its northern border, previously the
target of attacks from Lebanon-based guerrillas. A Syrian
guarantee, backed by Syrian troops, could be seen as more credible
than one from Lebanon since the Lebanese have limited military
capacity and have never tried to rein in the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been critical of what some officials have portrayed
as Syria's occupation of Lebanon. But in the current talks, some
diplomats predict, Israel, Syria and the United States might all
line up on the same side of the matter _ choosing to acquiesce in a
continued Syrian presence, even though it frustrates many ordinary
Lebanese, particularly among the Christian minority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The relationship between Syria and Lebanon is one of many
strands, including gratitude, dependence and resentment. Syria has
used its military presence to cement its dominant policy role.
Diplomats say it has also provided protection for smuggling,
counterfeiting and drug-running operations that have provided
income for Syrian officials. Under Syrian control, Lebanon's Bekaa
region has had to support bases for Syrian-backed militants who
have attacked Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebanese officials argue with much validity that their
country owes a good deal to Syria, on the grounds that without the
security of Syria's military presence, Lebanon might never have
recovered from a civil war that tore the country and its
institutions apart.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in advance of this week's talks, the nature of the
Syrian-Lebanese partnership has worked to Lebanon's disadvantage.
Lebanon has borne the brunt of the pain inflicted by Israel's
occupation of southern Lebanon, where its troops have been present
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   For Syria, by contrast, that Israeli presence has provided an
opportunity to demonstrate to Israel, at low risk, that its
continued occupation of Arab land would carry heavy costs. That
message has been carried by the Lebanese guerrillas, particularly
the Hezbollah, which Syria has allowed to function freely in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, calm has prevailed along Syria's own border
with Israel, in the shadow of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   A promise earlier this year by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
to withdraw Israeli forces from southern Lebanon by June 2000, if a
peace deal had not been reached, has served to expose the rival
interests. In other circumstances, a unilateral withdraw might have
been welcomed by Lebanon as a surrender. But the prospect of losing
a pressure point has so alarmed Syria that it has made clear its
opposition to the plan, causing Lebanon to fall in line.

 &UR; THRESH &LR;  _ Dennis Fong didn't really fancy himself a hardcore video
gamer. Then he won an international Doom II competition. He doesn't
consider himself a car person. But he has a red, convertible
Ferrari. And despite landing $11 million in funding from venture
capital giant CMGI for his fledgling dot-com firm, Fong, also known
as `Thresh` on the game circuit, never really thought of himself as
a business man. Fong's short life - he's only 22 - has been a
series of pleasant, but unexpected twists, beginning when he
discovered an aptitude for the twitchy world of video games.
Several years later, he parlayed that talent and the money from
dozens of winnings into Gamers.com. He and about 40 employees at
the company's Berkeley headquarters hope the site will become the
Web portal for any and all things video game-related. By Kelly Zito

FIGHT EARNS APPROVAL, BUT RUIZ-GRANT REMAINS UP IN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Ruiz moved one step closer to Michael Grant Tuesday when an
unexpected fax arrived in the office of his attorney, Tony
Cardinale, from the World Boxing Council. But even with WBC
approval of a match between the No. 1-rated Ruiz and the No.
2-rated Grant, the Chelsea, Mass. heavyweight remains a million
dollar signs away from a March 18 fight on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   WBC president Jose Sulaiman's fax fell short of mandating the
fight but said the organization was in favor of it ``to get an
official challenger'' to face undisputed champion Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But a day earlier, Ruiz's promoter, Don King, met for more than
an hour with HBO officials to discuss a possible June rematch
between Felix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya and never mentioned
Ruiz or Grant, who is an HBO fighter.
</P>
<P>
   HBO is willing to put up around $2.5 million to be split between
the fighters, and Grant is willing to discount his share to get a
shot at the No. 1 ranking because that position would insulate him
from the sport's politics when it comes time to negotiate with
Lewis next year.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, HBO would rather make a Lewis-Grant fight
immediately in part because it believes the World Boxing
Association, whose No. 1 contender is entitled to the next title
shot, would let its fighter step aside with an understanding that
Henry Akinwande would get the winner. But if Grant and Ruiz fight
first, the WBA would force an Akinwande-Lewis rematch that no one
wants to see or strip Lewis of the title and hand it over to Mike
Tyson and Showtime, HBO's cable rival.
</P>
<P>
   So Ruiz's fortunes are buffeted on the one hand by the network's
interests and on the other by his promoter's perceived reluctance
to risk the mandatory position in a fight that will gross him only
$500,000. Secondarily, Grant does not want King to promote the
fight, which could be a major stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   While the two camps seem genuinely interested in making the
fight and believe it can be done, mistrust is in the air. Grant
doesn't trust King, and neither does Ruiz. HBO doesn't believe King
will accept a reasonable fee because it doesn't believe he wants to
make the fight; members of both fighters' camps feel the same away
about HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we've put enough money out to make that fight,'' said
HBO senior vice president for programming Lou DiBella. ``Far too
much, frankly. We won't put up 50 cents more. It's up to them how
they divide it, but it's insane money for that fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Insane or not, Ruiz wants the same $1.5 million that
International Boxing Federation No. 1 contender David Tua declined
for a Grant fight, and Grant's people want the No. 1 ranking to
strengthen their position in any negotiations with Lewis's manager,
who is insisting on future options on Grant to make the title
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WBC has told us they will recognize it as an
elimination,'' said Jim Thomas, who handles Grant. ``Don and I are
supposed to talk later this week. Then we'll see if the naysayers
are right. If Don does what he said he'll do, we're not going to
have a lot of trouble agreeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on our side is in accord that this is an important
step for Michael. If we need to stretch (on the purse), we would.
I'm a long-term thinker. If we win that fight, there's nothing
Lewis's people can do to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing, of course, John Ruiz doesn't do something to him
first.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Retailers Step Up Drive for Net Taxes  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Some brick-and-mortar merchants yesterday stepped up a multipronged
effort to make sure e-tailers charge their customers sales tax.
<P>
   At a news conference in San Francisco, merchants from Wal-Mart,
the world's largest retailer, to Cody's Books, a Berkeley
independent, called on policymakers to tax all online purchases,
just as they tax goods sold at physical stores.
</P>
<P>
   Those merchants have formed a lobbying group, the e-Fairness
coalition, to ``advocate a level playing field for the new
economy,'' said David Bullington, vice president for taxation at
Wal-Mart, which sells merchandise over the Web as well as in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Several retailers, including Wal-Mart, will testify tomorrow in
the second day of hearings sponsored by the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce, a panel that is charged with recommending an
e-commerce taxation policy to Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a coalition of California booksellers has
asked the California State Board of Equalization to investigate Web
merchants like Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com for alleged sales
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   At issue for both the e-Fairness Coalition and booksellers is a
1992 Supreme Court decision, Quill vs. North Dakota, that requires
merchants to collect sales tax only in states where they have a
physical presence, or ``nexus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quill decision applies to sales via catalogs and television
shopping channels as well as Web sites. An act of Congress would be
required to force businesses to collect taxes in states where they
do not have a nexus, said Sarah Whitaker, director of government
relations for the National Retail Federation in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern California Independent Booksellers Association
asserts that the Web operations of national booksellers should be
required to collect sales tax on merchandise sold in states where
they operate stores.
</P>
<P>
   The group has requested an investigation into the matter by the
California State Board of Equalization. Members of the state
Assembly are also studying the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble told The Chronicle
yesterday that their stores do not constitute a nexus for the Web
division because their Internet operations are separate from their
physical-store operations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither bookseller collects sales tax on Web purchases made in
California, even though they both operate stores here.
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com is a publicly traded company that is 40
percent owned by Barnes &AMP; Noble. Both firms are based in New York.
Borders.com is wholly owned by Borders Group Inc. of Ann Arbor,
Mich., which also owns the Walden and Borders book chains.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ross, president of Cody's Books, has sent extensive
evidence to the BOE that he believes shows Borders' and Barnes &AMP;
Noble's physical stores are acting as ``agents'' for their Web
sites. Agents can be considered a nexus that would trigger sales
tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just today, I sent (the BOE) photos of Barnes &AMP; Noble stores
and Borders stores with signs urging their customers to shop
online,'' said Ross in an interview yesterday. ``Both continue to
say physical stores are unrelated to their Net operations and this
is clearly not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross operates a Web site, which constitutes about 1 percent of
its sales, as well as two stores in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Horton, a business taxation specialist with the BOE, said
the board continually monitors merchants to make sure they are
collecting sales taxes if they have a nexus in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Horton declined to discuss specific companies but said, ``We're
seeing if we can establish a nexus for these Net companies to get
them to pay tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Using in-store signage and coupons to promote a Web site would
not ``in and of itself be strong enough to establish nexus, but
that in combination with other things could be useful in
establishing if they have nexus in a state,'' Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every retailer likes the idea of more Net taxation, however.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Julian, a vice president with Federated Department Stores,
the parent company of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, maintains that
sales tax collection is ``very burdensome and expensive,'' he told
The Chronicle yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tax policies among the 46 states that impose a sales tax vary
widely, said Julian. For example, nine states exempt clothing from
sales tax; five consider handkerchiefs clothing and four do not.
Eight of those states consider shoelaces clothing, but Texas does
not, said Julian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology does not exist today to enable a remote seller
to easily comply with those laws,'' said Julian, who will testify
at the hearing tomorrow at the Westin St. Francis Hotel. The
hearing is one of four the ACEC is conducting across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Wal-Mart's Bullington said his company's Web site collects
sales tax in every state. Wal-Mart employs four people full time to
calculate state and local taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said states should simplify their tax structures to make it
easier for e-tailers to collect sales tax. Small Web businesses
such as his should also be exempt from paying sales tax in states
where they don't have a nexus, he said.

 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After months of bitter negotiations, German industry
and government officials agreed on Tuesday to establish a fund of
roughly $5.1 billion to compensate slave laborers during the Nazi
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Though important details were still being ironed out,
negotiators on both sides said on Tuesday night that they had
reached an agreement on the central question, the amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the effort could ultimately affect more than one
million surviving victims of Nazi Germany's systematic use of
forced labor, though nobody is yet sure how many people may
ultimately file claims.
</P>
<P>
   American government officials estimate that there are about
240,000 surviving slave laborers, about half of them Jewish, who
were held in concentration camps and forced to work under
nightmarish conditions. The fund would also compensate a much
larger number of ``forced'' laborers, most of whom were not Jewish
and were brought in from the Soviet Union, Poland and other East
European countries to work in German factories. Officials estimate
that this group numbers anywhere from 700,000 to 1.5 million
people. In both cases, compensation would be paid to victims who
were alive as of last February.
</P>
<P>
   Although fewer than 100,000 of the former forced workers are
Americans, the negotiations were driven almost entirely by American
class-action attorneys and Jewish groups, as well as the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   German industry executives have been worried about the suits,
but even more by the prospect of a conflict with American customers
and business partners.
</P>
<P>
   American and German officials said they now hope to finish
negotiating the main elements of the plan on Friday in Berlin.
German corporations will contribute at least half of the money for
the new humanitarian fund, and the German government will
contribute the rest. American companies with German subsidiaries,
including General Motors and Ford Motor Co., are also expected to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the fund could provide as much as $7,500 for each
surviving slave laborer and most likely smaller amounts for forced
laborers. But attorneys involved in the talks predicted some
bruising disputes about the rules governing how former workers will
qualify for those payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement, there is absolutely no doubt about
that,'' said Michael Witti, an attorney in Munich representing
former workers. ``But anybody who thinks this will all go through
smoothly is living in a dream world.''
</P>
<P>
   Though about three-quarters of the fund's money will be used to
compensate forced workers, the settlement is also intended to
resolve other unresolved claims arising from the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also will be used to compensate victims of so-called
``Aryanization'' programs _ Jews and other non-Germans who were
forced by the Nazis to sell their property at firesale prices. And
it will be used to handle lingering claims against insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reached after marathon bargaining over the
telephone between Jewish groups, American class-action lawyers,
German industry and the German government. It was mediated by
Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy secretary of the Treasury, and
Otto Lambsdorff, a former economics minister of West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are scheduled to arrive in Berlin on Friday to work out
final details and formally announce an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for contributing to the fund, German industrial
companies, ranging from DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen to Siemens,
will be given immunity from future lawsuits over the use of forced
labor. German banks will be freed from claims arising from the the
``Aryanization programs.''
</P>
<P>
   All companies will contribute to a common humanitarian fund set
up by an independent German foundation, which will then transfer
money to designated organizations representing surviving workers in
the United States as well as in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that an agreement has been reached,'' said
Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for the German industry foundation.
``I hope that the money will come relatively quickly to the
surviving victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the total compensation will probably come from American
companies with German subsidiaries that used forced labor in the
war. The most notable of those are likely to be Adam Opel, a
company that General Motors bought more than 70 years ago, and the
Ford subsidiary in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have long acknowledged that their German
factories used forced laborers in the war, but had argued that they
had no liability because the Nazi government took over the
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement on establishing a fund of roughly 10 billion
German marks entailed big compromises on both sides. Attorneys
representing former workers had demanded 20 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
   German negotiators, as well as Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, had
insisted as recently as last week that there would be no money
beyond the eight billion marks proposed last month.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, advocates for former workers said they were
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a measure of justice for slave laborers who have
waited a very long time,'' said Gideon Taylor, executive vice
president of the Jewish Conference on Material Claims Against
Germany, which has been collecting and distributing funds from
Germany on behalf of forced workers for the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Eizenstat was optimistic that there
would be a definitive acceptance of the 10 billion mark figure, but
he cautioned that the German government had yet to accept the plan
officially.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a wonderful way for Germany to make a moral
statement at the end of the century that would have lasting effects
into the next century,'' he said of the emerging terms.
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn Weiss, one of the Americanclass-action attorneys
representing former slave laborers, said he was unhappy about
accepting 10 billion marks, but felt he had had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good about it, but it is a pragmatic decision,''
said Weiss. ``At this point, we don't have a choice because of the
needs of aging victims and the pressure from governments to get
this resolved.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may be only a matter of days before a new round of bickering
breaks out over how to distribute money to victims. Class-action
attorneys are already incensed over the draft of a German law that
would establish the rules for running the new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Witti sharply attacked a provision of the draft law that would
prohibit a person who had received compensation from other programs
for victims of the Holocaust from receiving any money from the new
humanitarian fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the agreement will fall apart because of these
issues, but that rule is totally unacceptable and there will be
significant disputes over it,'' he said.

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON  
 GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON  &HT;     Choices Galore for Credit Cards 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: What is the best credit card deal for small-business use, such
as rental cars, hotels, lunches?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The good news is you have more choices than ever. There are
about 100 credit cards specifically designed for businesses,
compared with only a dozen or so three or four years ago. You
should check out WebCard, which tracks the credit card industry
from Frederick, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some great deals,'' says WebCard CEO Robert
McKinley. To find out who offers what and for what price, go to
www.webcard.com, click ``CardSurveys'' in the left column and then
click ``Business.''
</P>
<P>
   You will find a list of more than 30 issuers, their annual fees,
interest rates and toll-free phone numbers. McKinley tops the list
with four cards that have no annual fee and charge a fixed 9.99
annual interest rate. They are: First USA Business Visa, American
Express Corp. Platinum Optima, American Express Gold Corp. Optima
and Bank One Business Card.
</P>
<P>
   You need to look at what you want from a business credit card.
McKinley, for example, likes rewards programs and has been very
happy with his American Express business card. He racked up more
than 100,000 points and used it to send 18 New England lobster
dinners for two as Christmas presents to employees. Each dinner for
two, which was sent by Federal Express from Martha's Vineyard,
would have cost $150 if purchased for cash.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of rewards programs is that the company
can consolidate and benefit from the buying power of several
employees. Most of the card issuers also have partners in the
airline, hotel and office supply businesses who provide upgrades,
discounts and other benefits to the business cardholders. Some also
provide sophisticated monthly or quarterly billing statements which
break expenses into useful accounting categories like travel, food
and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   You may find some low introductory rates like the 3.9 percent
``teaser'' rates that banks frequently offer new individual
customers for six months. But McKinley suggests that if your credit
history allows you to get a 9.99 percent fixed rate, it may be
better, especially if you are interested in long term relationships
and reward programs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to watch out for with business cards is that
cardholders of a business could be liable for their colleagues'
charges if their business is unable to pay the bills. Some issuers
offer protection against such a calamity by limiting employee
exposure to $15,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
More Biz Sites
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some other good business Web sites besides the Small
Business Administration's (www.business.gov) site you mentioned
last week?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: There are lots of them. The California Society of Certified
Public Accountants in Redwood City recommends the following:
</P>
<P>
   BusinessAthome (www.gohome.com) _ Features financial, marketing
and operating tips for improving your home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   Small Business Supersite (www.smartbiz.com) _ Has articles,
reports and checklists.
</P>
<P>
   Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov) _ Includes
information on starting a business, creating a business plan,
arranging financing, business development and expansion, marketing
and more.
</P>
<P>
   Securities &AMP; Exchange Q&AMP;A (www.sec.gov/smbus/qasbsec.htm) _ Q&AMP;A
on how a business goes public, including regulations and reporting
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Resource Center (www.bizwiz.com) _ New site
under development to provide entrepreneurs with information about
financing marketing, registering your business, dealing with the
government and more.
</P>
<P>
   You might also check the California CPA society's own Web site
(www.calcpa.org). It has some new features useful to small
businesses like ``Ask a CPA'' and articles under ``CPAs Can Help.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CalCPA offers guides to starting a business,
testing your EQ (entrepreneurial quotient), writing a business
plan, choosing the appropriate legal structure, finance options and
other subjects. It also has an online directory to find a CPA by
geography, expertise or language spoken.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRADE LINKS &QL; 
Last week, we mentioned that SBA's upgraded Web site allows users
to tailor a Web page to support their own international trade.
Reader David Rearwin e-mailed to say it didn't work and he was
right. But the SBA has fixed the link. Go to www.business.gov,
click on International Trade and then link to Tradenet Export
Advisor before clicking ``Personalize this site with: My Export.''

GM WANTS DAEWOO MOTOR BUT NOT ITS BILLIONS IN DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ General Motors Corp. on Tuesday made
official its desire to buy Daewoo Motor Co., but said it was
unwilling to assume any of the Korean automaker's $16 billion in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   GM executive vice president Louis Hughes, who is now in Seoul,
delivered a letter of intent containing the company's investment
plans to a South Korean committee that represents the domestic
creditors of the troubled Daewoo group.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM is interested in all of Daewoo Motor's domestic business
areas and a large portion of its overseas operations,'' with the
exception of the operations most pressed for cash, said Alan
Perriton, the GM executive in charge of expansion plans in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   But Perriton said that it was too early to disclose details of
his company's proposal and that it needed more time to study Daewoo
Motor's business.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition of Daewoo Motor would greatly expand the huge
American automaker's presence in Asia and would be the largest
asset sale so far for the Daewoo group, which was once South
Korea's second-largest conglomerate behind Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   The Daewoo group has been struggling for months with a debt
burden estimated at nearly $78 billion, and creditors are pushing
for sales of businesses to pay off much of that debt.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor Co. has been a supplier of parts to GM under a
relationship that began almost 20 years ago. GM's purchase of the
company would almost certainly ensure Daewoo Motor's future. But
GM's refusal to assume any of its debt means that the Korean
automaker's creditors would have to absorb at least some losses on
their loans if such a sale were to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   An auction of Daewoo Motor has not been ruled out. But Perriton
said GM opposed that idea, saying it ``would harm Daewoo Motor by
prolonging the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh Ho Gen, the head of the Corporate Restructuring Coordination
Committee, which represents Daewoo's domestic creditors, said
further negotiations would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes visited Seoul just a week after General Motors said it
was merely interested in making a substantial investment in the
Korean automaker.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been evaluating Daewoo's passenger car business as part
of an overall expansion plan in Asia, where it aims to double its
market share to 10 percent by 2005. Just last week, it acquired a
20 percent stake in Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan, parent company
of the Subaru automotive brand, for $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between the GM officials and South Korean creditors
of Daewoo Motor took place against a background of growing friction
between the domestic and foreign creditors of the Daewoo group.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign creditors, owed nearly $7 billion, say they have
been largely excluded from negotiations aimed at easing Daewoo's
debts.
</P>
<P>
   In a proposal submitted to the foreign creditors earlier this
month, South Korean creditors offered to establish a special
company that would buy unsecured foreign debts held by Daewoo
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The debts would be purchased in cash, but at discounts ranging
from 18 percent to 65 percent. Foreign creditors rejected the
proposal as inadequate.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Video Game Champ Creates Web Portal  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Dennis Fong wasn't a hard-core video gamer. Then he won an
international Doom II competition.
<P>
   He's not a car person. But he has a red, convertible Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   And despite landing $11 million from the investment arm of
Internet powerhouse CMGI for his fledgling dot-com firm, Fong, also
known as ``Thresh'' on the game circuit, never really thought of
himself as a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Fong's short life _ he's only 22 _ has been a series of
pleasant, but unexpected twists, beginning in the early 1990s when
he discovered an aptitude for the twitchy world of video games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he parlayed that talent and the money from scores of
tournament victories into Berkeley's GX Media, which now hopes to
turn its flagship Gamers.com site into the Web portal for any and
all things game related.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game industry right now is really fragmented,'' Fong said.
``We said we need to build something that brings it all together
... let's become an aggregator of all this information.''
</P>
<P>
   In a market as crowded as the game industry, Fong has his work
cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Just as game-related revenues soar _ the overall industry is now
worth a staggering $7 billion a year _ so do the number of Web
sites like Happy Puppy (happypuppy.com), ZDNet's GameSpot
(gamespot.com) and IGN.com (www.ign.com). Most offer game reviews,
sneak previews, trend stories, strategy hints and industry gossip.
</P>
<P>
   But Fong is maneuvering on a different level.
</P>
<P>
   While Gamers.com does offer areas for chatting and viewing
user-based ratings systems, it's mostly a network of links to other
sites' news, reviews, etc. Even the site's ``Play Games'' channel
connects to other sites that actually host the games. Instead of
creating the content, Fong wants to be the clearinghouse for it.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Funk, editorial director of Electronic Gaming Monthly and
Expert Gamer, calls Fong's goal of becoming the ``Yahoo'' of the
game world an ambitious one. But if Fong's business model depends
on users spending a lot of time at Gamers.com, Funk isn't sure it
will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the majority of gamers heading online will go
directly to Web zines offering original content or to sites where
they can immediately jump into a multiplayer match of Doom or
Quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to go to the (Electronic Arts) of the world
because they want to be there to play a game,'' Funk said. ``It's
nice to have a small chat before a game, but people usually have a
limited amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Pidgeon, an analyst at Internet research firm Jupiter
Communications, lauds Gamers.com for linking to other sites,
thereby saving overhead on hosting or content production. But he
warns that anyone getting into the game information business online
has to watch out for Sony, MSN.com's Zone and Electronic Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really the top three in this channel,'' Pidgeon said.
``They'll be more likely to offer more game-related information''
though each site will probably focus on their companies' respective
games.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the folks at CMGI of Andover, Mass., think
Gamers.com, which plans to make money through advertising,
e-commerce and community hosting fees, stands a good chance at
taking on some of the big guns.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI is a Boston-area conglomerate that has invested in,
acquired or launched dozens of portals, e-commerce companies,
Internet technology firms and online ad services. Among its stable
of companies are Engage Technologies, which develops software that
helps advertisers tailor offers to Web surfers, and the search
engine AltaVista.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, CMGI's venture capital arm, AtVentures, invested $11
million to help GX Media move into much  &LR; larger offices in Point
Richmond and increase its staff of 40 40-person head count &LR;   &LR; to
around 100.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jon Callaghan, AtVentures general partner, his
group had looked for an investment opportunity in the Internet game
market for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Two things stood out about Gamers.com, Callaghan said: The idea
that it was a site ``built by gamers for gamers,'' and Fong
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every online gamer needs a place to compare notes or
strategize, and Dennis is the best player in the world,'' Callaghan
said. ``He's very in touch with what gamers need and want in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong says gamers feed on community.
</P>
<P>
   To foster that among hard-core gamers, he's employed a network
of ``game experts'' from around the world who review game, fan and
related sites and post their findings at Gamers.com.
</P>
<P>
   But since Fong believes ``the biggest obstacle to games now is
that it's intimidating, whether because it's too technical or too
edgy,'' he's also tried to make the site friendly for the general
user.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the interface a cross between Yahoo.com and Excite.com.
And he's installed a search engine and shopping channel, both
designed to appeal to a clueless parent looking for the newest
title or console.
</P>
<P>
   All this is designed to capitalize on the exploding number of
people logging on or plugging in to play Sonic the Hedgehog, Tomb
Raider or Twisted Metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games, about a year and a half ago, were what e-mail was five
years ago,'' Fong said. ``Five years ago, only the techies and
geeks had e-mail. Now if you don't have e-mail you're strange. It's
the same with games. People perceived games as this nerdy thing,
but it's shedding that stereotypical image now. As it's accepted
more and more, it will explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Research supports Fong's theory.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter's Pidgeon, the game industry now outstrips
the film industry in annual revenues. And the online component _
revenues from advertising, subscriptions, etc. _ is expected to
reach well over $100 million this year, compared with about $80
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``As online gaming grows, reviews, ratings, news, previews (are)
going to become even more important,'' he said. ``Anyone who's
offering all those things has a tendency to offer more hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon also says Gamers.com provides something that no one else
does _ Fong's wildly successful gaming alter ego _ though he
criticizes the site for not hyping Fong's identity out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thresh'' came into existence when a 14-year-old Fong first
took up gaming after hearing a series of explosions from his
younger brother's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I peeked in and said, `What are you doing, Bryant?' He said
I'm playing this new game called Doom.' So I sat down and started
playing. I got my butt kicked. ... But I said, `Man, this is cool.'
From that day, I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong chose the name ``Thresh'' because in the macho world of
online gaming a word that means ``to strike repeatedly'' tends to
get noticed.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Fong, a Los Altos native, showed an almost
uncanny ability to anticipate the future within the virtual
universes of Doom and Quake. Based on the sounds his opponents
would generate picking up a gun or reloading, Fong could tell where
they were in the game and in which direction they were heading.
They didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot like the wild, wild West back then, where you
make a reputation beating certain opponents, and they spread the
word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fong never realized he was that good.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a news crew from fledgling Cnet accompanied him to an
International Doom II tournament in Redmond, Wash. Both the crew
and Fong were stunned when he won. Shortly after, he enrolled in
the University of California at Berkeley as a business major; but
he left less than a year later to start Gamers Extreme. With its
easy-to-remember URL, Gamers.com, the company created a site for
fans of hard-core, multiplayer games. But the niche didn't expand
the way the Fong brothers expected.
</P>
<P>
   With the company struggling to gain an audience and stay afloat,
Fong continued to play in dozens of game tournaments, including an
Atlanta Quake competition in 1997. This time, he won a red
convertible Ferrari 328 GTS along with sponsorships, book deals and
a column for PC Gamer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Fong plowed much of the money he made back into the company, but
it was stymied by some strategic missteps. Fong doesn't disclose
the financial details of the privately held company, but he does
say he and other executives (his official title is chief gamer)
sometimes didn't drive a hard-enough bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn, don't be too excited in the first
meeting,'' Fong said, recalling some of GX's initial business
encounters. ``Before, if someone had a pretty cool idea, we were
like, `Yeah, let's do it!' We were too trusting and too sincere, so
that hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, Fong changed the company's name to GX
Media and decided to try to broaden its appeal to include the
entire gamers' spectrum. In March, the company landed about $2.25
million from so-called ``angel'' investors who often provide
capital for very young start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But GX Media's big break came in Monte Carlo in October at the
European Technology Roundtable Expo. After presenting a speech on
the game industry, Fong met David Wetherell, the founder and
president of CMGI, who referred him to AtVentures.
</P>
<P>
   This time, GX Media found a partner, not an adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Fong has come to view business as one big game, like Doom and
Quake, albeit a bigger one with different rules. As both a
professional gamer and an entrepreneur, Fong has learned that speed
doesn't make up for lack of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think it's reflexes,'' he said. ``But the way I
look at games is like speed chess, where there's a lot of
analytical, strategic thinking. Yeah you have to think fast, but
you have to think a lot.''

COMMENTARY: PLAYING THE JESUS CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ My father had two prized possessions: a scrapbook
full of newspaper clippings about the Irish Catholic who didn't
make it to the White House in 1928, and a huge framed photo of the
Irish Catholic who did in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   JFK once joked that after Al Smith lost to Herbert Hoover, whose
slogan was ``A vote for Smith is a vote for the pope,'' the New
York governor had to cable the pope: ``Unpack.'' President Kennedy
added that after he refused to help the U.S. Catholic bishops get
federal aid for parochial schools, the pope cabled him: ``Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kennedy's shimmering wit could lighten any tense moment.
But as he went through his crusade in '60 to convince voters that a
Catholic president would not build a pipeline to the Vatican,
Catholics held their breaths in fear, murmuring  &UR; Please, please,
please, let him be president and he'll never, never, never mention
religion. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy vowed to keep a wall between church and state: ``I
believe in a president whose views on religion are his own private
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   How odd that only 40 years ago a presidential candidate could
not win unless he left religion out; now candidates think they
cannot win unless they bring religion in.
</P>
<P>
   As H.L. Mencken pointed out, religion ``is used as a club and a
cloak by both politicians and moralists, all of them lusting for
power and most of them palpable frauds.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush finally scored some debate points on Monday night
by supporting the holy trinity of ethanol, Jesus and soft money.
(Didn't Jesus throw those soft-money changers out of the temple?)
When the Republican candidates were asked to name their favorite
political philosophers, Bush replied: ``Christ, because he changed
my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to elaborate, the Texas governor again showed his
inability to go deep. To borrow a Dorothy Parker quip, he ran the
gamut from A to B. Just as in the last debate, when he was asked to
expound on a biography of Dean Acheson, he gave the impression that
he thought coughing up an impressive name was quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   His mouth curled down into that famous smirky look. ``Well, if
they don't know, it's going to be hard to explain,'' he said.
``When you turn your heart and your life over to Christ, when you
accept Christ as the Savior, it changes your heart. It changes your
life. And that's what happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: You're either in the Christ club or out of it, on
the J.C. team or off. This is the same exclusionary attitude, so
offensive to those with different beliefs, that he showed in 1993
when he said that you must believe in Jesus Christ to enter heaven.
(Bush has since conceded that only ``God decides who goes to
heaven, not George W. Bush.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, the man who told President Clinton that Monica
would not play well with the public, immediately proclaimed that
Jesus would play well with the public. The pollster enthused on Fox
News that W. had ``cut right into the evangelical vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the era of niche marketing, and Jesus is a niche. Why
not use the son of God to help the son of Bush appeal to voters? W.
is checking Jesus' numbers, and Jesus is polling well in Iowa.
Christ, the new wedge issue.
</P>
<P>
   When you take something deeply personal and parade it for
political gain, you are guilty either of cynicism or exhibitionism.
Exhibit A: Al Gore's skin-crawling speeches at the Democratic
conventions about his son's accident and his sister's death.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has sunk to the same level on religion. On ``60 Minutes''
last week, the vice president declared himself to be a born-again
Christian. And in an earlier interview with The Washington Post's
Sally Quinn, he said he often asked himself ``W.W.J.D. _ for a
saying that's popular now in my faith, `What would Jesus do?'''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kansas board of education removed evolution from the
science curriculum testing to make way for creationism, neither
Gore nor Bush could bring themselves to utter a word in defense of
scientific truth.
</P>
<P>
   It raises the question of whether the vice president and the
governor want Jesus as their personal Savior or political savior.
</P>
<P>
   Genuinely religious people are humbled by religion and are
guided by it on the inside. They don't need to wear Jesus on the
outside as a designer label.
</P>

   MAKHACHKALA, Russia _ The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's chairman on Tuesday urged Russia and
Islamic rebels to agree to a cease-fire in Chechnya. But his plea
was ignored, and Russia continued its heavy shelling of Grozny, the
Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made an appeal for a cease-fire, and if there is an
attack on Grozny, I have not been answered,'' the official, Kurt
Vollebaek, told reporters here in Makhachkala, the capital of
Dagestan, on Tuesday. ``On the contrary, they are doing the just
the opposite of what I asked for.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek's visit underscores the dearth of Western influence
over Russian policy in Chechnya. On the first full day of his
three-day visit, he not only had his plea rejected; the Russians
also bluntly informed him that they saw no role for his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Like Western political leaders, the group has been concerned
that civilians are being put in danger in Chechnya and wants to see
the turmoil in the breakaway republic resolved by negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin considers the organization naive about the
Caucasus and asserts that suspending military operations now would
simply allow the rebels to rebuild their strength and sow disorder
through the south.
</P>
<P>
   Even Vollebaek's visit did not come about easily. The OSCE's
role was hotly debated in November at the European summit meeting
in Istanbul. Eventually an agreement was reached allowing Vollebaek
to travel to the region.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow has sought to define the scope of his trip. Alexander
Avdeyev, a senior foreign ministry official, said in an interview
that Vollebaek's visit has been organized by Moscow to demonstrate
that much of the Caucasus is stable and that Russia is a good
custodian.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek, in fact, did not start his visit in Chechnya.
Instead, the Russians arranged for him to come to Dagestan, to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Dagestan was invaded by Islamic militants operating
from bases in Chechnya. And Vollebaek and several foreign reporters
were whisked by helicopter Tuesday to the Botlikh area so Moscow
could make its case that it was the militants who were responsible
for the fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The former war zone is a stunning landscape of snow-capped
mountains, sheer cliffs, alpine meadows _ and destruction. One of
Vollebaek's stops _ Tando, a tiny village with a commanding view of
the valley _ was leveled in last summer's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said that more than 200 militants had seized the town,
proclaiming they were going to drive the Russians out of the
Caucasus. After the villagers fled, Russian troops counterattacked
with artillery and air strikes, demolishing the village. Only a
handful of residents have returned. ``There is no electricity and
nothing to eat,'' said Fatimat Sakhratullayeva, 58.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek said here in Makhachkala that the damage made a strong
impression on him. But he added that his goal was to prevent
similar attacks on civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That brought a tart response from Nikolai Koshman, the Russian
official in charge in Chechnya, who noted that Russia halted its
earlier military campaign against the militants in 1996 when
Chechnya achieved its de facto independence. The result, Koshman
said, was an expansion of the militants' operations, hundreds of
kidnappings and the rebel attacks on Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   During Vollebaek's tour in Dagestan's mountains, the roar of
Russian artillery fire in Chechnya could be heard in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have opened two escape routes for civilians
trapped in Grozny, but the corridors are open only for specified
hours, enabling the military to keep up its bombardment, albeit
intermittently. A Russian official said Russian troops had secured
the military airfield in Khankala, on the outskirts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians appear determined to win the battle for Grozny,
regardless of what the West thinks. This quest has lent an air of
unreality to Vollebaek's peace mission.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday he plans to visit Chechnya and Ingushetia, to the
west. He expressed the hope that his meetings today with the
leaders of Dagestan and his scheduled session with the president of
Ingushetia might encourage a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the Russians had scant interest
in his proposal to involve the organization in the sort of
mediating role it played in the 1994-96 conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And he acknowledged that the Russians think his group should
confine itself to organizing relief assistance for Chechnya, and
not dispense political advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand they cannot find a solution without including
the Chechens somehow,'' he told reporters here. ``Where they
disagree with me is the international role. Their view is that this
is something that Russia can solve by itself, that Russia is a
great power, Russia is mighty, Russia can deal with its own
business, and it does not need the international community to
assist them.''

TEACHER IGNORES GIRL'S COMMENT THAT `MY MOM IS DEAD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI AND DAVID ABEL S  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. _ A 7-year-old girl spent a night sleeping in her
dead mother's arms after her teacher apparently did not believe her
when she said her mother had died.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Hanson, a first-grader at the Kiley School, ``told her
teacher, `My mom is dead,' but she had no emotion in her eyes or in
her voice,'' said Mark Standley, a friend of Lydia's mother,
Kimberley Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her teacher said, `You shouldn't say things like that,' ''
Lydia's grandmother, Sharon Tucker, told the Salem Evening News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lydia went to her desk and sat down and went on (with the) day
like nothing happened. And they put her on the bus when it was time
to go home . . . and her mommy was still there in a chair,'' Tucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia apparently attempted to comfort herself during the lonely
night she spent with her mother's cold body by maintaining the
normal routine she had shared with Hanson, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia later told her grandparents that after school she finished
her homework, then microwaved leftover spaghetti and meatballs for
dinner. She also made microwave popcorn and watched a movie,
because this was a ritual she and her mother followed every night,
Standley said.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia took a quilt from her bedroom, covered both herself and
her mother, and fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``She actually curled up in her mom's lap and went to sleep with
her overnight,'' Richard Tucker, Lydia's grandfather, told WHDH-TV
(Channel 7) in Boston. ``She watched TV for awhile, holding her
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Hanson, a single mother, had diabetes and probably died
of natural causes Thursday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia was unable to call the police for help because she did not
know how to use the household's new cordless telephone. She had
intended to mail her grandparents a letter with news of her
mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody Schools Superintendent Louis Perullo called the incident
``a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The school made a mistake,'' Perullo said in a written
statement. ``I wish we had done otherwise. This has never happened
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The young child's grandparents are angry that her teacher
dismissed such an alarming and unusual comment. ``I think it was
appalling. If a kid went to school and said, `My mommy hit me,'
they would have DSS down there like that,'' Richard Tucker said,
snapping his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Family friends, however, said they did not want to see
disciplinary action taken against the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad for the teacher,'' Standley said, speaking
outside Hanson's wake Tuesday night. ``She had so many kids to deal
with. But she could have done something, and she didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The school has called to apologize to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tucker found Hanson's body on Friday, with Lydia there,
holding her mother's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Hanson had complained of feeling ill. Her
mother, Sharon Tucker, made soup for her and Lydia, and made Hanson
promise to visit a doctor Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson did not have the chance. Instead, she sat in a recliner
chair in her living room, put her head back, and died Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia apparently did not go to school Friday morning. She made
herself a bowl of cereal for breakfast, Standley said. When her
grandfather arrived and asked her why she was home, ``she just
rubbed her mommy's hand and said, `Bampy, my mommy died.' '' Sharon
Tucker said. ``He walked over and touched her. She was ice cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson was a manager at a Boston publishing company, Sharon
Tucker said. She worked part time from home so she could be
available when Lydia left for school and returned home.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparents, who live in Hamilton, are trying to get
custody of Lydia, and arranging for her to see a counselor. They
say they will not send her back to the Kiley School.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his granddaughter had cried over her mother's
death, Richard Tucker answered: ``No, she has not, and that is very
bothersome to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The child is sacred,'' Tucker added. ``You just can't take
what a child says for granted.''

A DIVIDED VENEZUELA TO VOTE ON NEW CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Venezuela has the chance Wednesday to
accelerate what President Hugo Chavez terms a ``peaceful
revolution,'' or to reject what his opponents say would be a
constitutional dictatorship benefiting Chavez at the expense of the
millions of poor citizens he says he represents.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has a political fight divided this country, the world's
third largest oil exporter and major supplier to the United States,
with such passion and invective.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, elected a year ago on a promise to strip power from
Venezuela's traditional parties and wealthy elite, has branded
critics of the constitution that is to be voted upon Wednesday
``degenerates,'' members of ``a rancid oligarchy whose only
motherland is capital and profits'' and ``enemies of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, he has charged, ``a truckload of squealing pigs'' and
``a batch of bandits who have betrayed, pillaged and humiliated the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the anti-Chavez camp has sought to link the
president to Fidel Castro and Cuban communism, using Chavez's own
words against him. ``I feel happy to follow the path of Fidel,'' he
said during a state visit to Havana last month, adding that
Venezuela was swimming ``toward the same sea as the Cuban people,''
which he described as ``a sea of happiness, social justice and true
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   To the alarm of those already suspicious of Chavez, the new
charter, drafted in less than four months by an elected
Constitutional Assembly in which his supporters won 90 percent of
the seats, would significantly extend the powers of the executive
branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   It abolishes the Senate, one of the two existing houses of
Congress, and gives the president authority to dissolve the
legislature in certain specified circumstances. The presidential
term of office would expand to six years from five, and Chavez
would be allowed to seek immediate re-election, which is prohibited
under the current 1961 constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the powers of states and municipalities would be
significantly curbed, and the role of the military and its ability
to take part in government and politics would increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many basic respects, this constitution is a step backward
from the democratic change the country has been demanding,'' said
Allan Brewer Carias, a prominent lawyer here and an opposition
member of the Constitutional Assembly. ``It opens the door to
authoritarianism, and the authoritarian provisions it contains are
certainly going to be used, if not by Chavez, then by someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the constitution's main intellectual author has now begun
to express doubts about the document. Hermann Escarra, a prominent
professor of constitutional law and chairman of the committee that
drafted the charter, said he still planned to vote yes in the
referendum Wednesday, joining what opinion polls indicate will be
strong support for the document.
</P>
<P>
   But Escarra describes the final product as ``a populist model
under military tutelage'' and says he will immediately introduce
amendments to weaken those tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Escarra, who has been one of Chavez's closest legal advisers,
said last week in an interview with the Spanish newspaper La
Vanguardia that ``the constitution has grave incongruencies'' that
allow the president ``to assume all powers,'' ``give privileges to
the military'' and put them beyond civilian control. A result, he
added, will be a ``restricted democracy,'' and ``that would be very
disturbing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since declaring its independence from Spain in 1811, Venezuela,
which has the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East, has had
25 constitutions, more than any other country in South America.
Chavez, striking the kind of sweeping note that has prompted many
people here to invest in him their hopes of change, says the new
charter will define ``the future of Venezuelans for the next 200
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters point proudly to the broadened guarantees of
individual rights that it offers, including greater recognition of
the status of women and indigenous peoples. The charter also
reorganizes the country's notoriously corrupt judicial system and
includes a recall mechanism that in theory would allow voters to
replace elected officials who fail to perform their duties
properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most modern and advanced constitution in the
entire continent and perhaps in the world,'' Chavez said recently
on his weekly radio program. He described its passage as essential
to ``putting 40 years of unfettered corruption and incompetence
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has also warned of the prospect of an ``internal war'' if
voters do not approve it.
</P>
<P>
   If the constitution is rejected, ``I will do everything possible
so that the democratic and peaceful road continues,'' he said in
November. But he added, ``I do not know if that will be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll here found that less than 2 percent of voters in
this nation of 23 million people had actually read the draft of the
new constitution, a floridly written document that has 350
articles. As a result, the vote seems to have become more of a
plebiscite on Chavez, a cashiered army colonel who led an
unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992 but was elected to office with a
resounding majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to vote yes because I want to give the people's
president the tools he needs to govern,'' said Gumersindo Alvarez
Montilla, a Chavez supporter who was handing out copies of the
document at a subway stop here. ``I haven't read all of the
constitution, but I don't need to. For me, it is enough that this
is Chavez's project, that this is what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez's popularity and the apparent support for his charter
have not stopped an informal coalition of political, business,
religious and human rights groups from focusing on what they see as
dangerous flaws in a document they say was hastily and carelessly
drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups here and abroad, for instance, have
expressed concern about a provision that requires news
organizations to publish only ``truthful, opportune and impartial''
reports. They say the provision would open the door to official
censorship and intimidation, since it is unclear who would
determine what meets those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Venezuela's main business organizations have come out
against the charter. They worry about articles that promise workers
a ``living'' wage without specifying how that would be calculated,
prohibit ``unjustified'' dismissals, reduce the work week and
guarantee health care and social security benefits to all
Venezuelans, even those who have not contributed to the system,
without making clear who will pay that cost.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has taken out full-page newspaper ads to warn
that its independence and ability to fight inflation would be
sapped by a requirement that it subordinate its policies to those
of the government. The president of the state oil company, a Chavez
ally, has also complained about provisions that forbid
privatization of the company and reserve all ``strategic'' sectors
of the economy for the state.

MCCARTNEY GOES BACK TO HIS ROOTS

   LONDON _ After 36 years, Paul McCartney went back to, as the
sign above the entrance to the Cavern Club puts it, the place
``Where it all began.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Cavern Club, the small, sweaty, subterranean
Liverpool nightclub that launched the Beatles, last saw its most
famous progeny on Aug. 3, 1963. After that, it was auditoriums,
stadiums, and history for the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new album, and a new attitude after emerging from an
extended period of mourning the death of his wife Linda two years
ago, McCartney decided to go back to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, only 300 people could squeeze into the Cavern,
which is a replica of the old club that was torn down 26 years ago.
But another 12,000 crammed into a nearby park to watch the concert
on closed-circuit television, and it was beamed to 25 other
countries and a TV audience that its promoters said could total 500
million. The concert was also broadcast live on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Beatles ever got big, we started out playing rock
n' roll at the Cavern,'' McCartney said before the show. ``I'm
going back as a nod to the music that always and will ever thrill
me. I cannot think of a better way to rock out the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The promoters hoped to break the all-time record for a TV
audience, which the Beatles set in 1967 with a concert called ``All
You Need is Love'' despite the inability then to broadcast it
behind the Iron Curtain. Now, with the Cold War over and the Soviet
bloc collapsed, McCartney can't be back in the USSR, but the
concert was beamed to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Baker, McCartney's spokesman, said the Russian audience
was expected to make the gig the most watched TV show ever.
</P>
<P>
   Between March 1961 and August 1963, the Beatles played the
Cavern no fewer than 275 nights. The original Victorian warehouse
at 10 Mathew St. was demolished for an underground railway that
never got built. Seeking to capitalize on the tourists who came to
Liverpool looking for the birthplace of the Beatles, a replica of
the Cavern, including bricks from the original, was built at the
site and opened in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 who watched the show inside the Cavern got their tickets
by lottery. Among them was John Ono Lennon, an 18-year-old
Englishman who legally changed his name to reflect his devotion to
what he calls ``the greatest band ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles remain more popular here with the parents of
18-year-olds, but McCartney, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth
II, occupies a special place in British society compared to the
other two surviving Beatles, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr didn't even join the Beatles as the drummer until after
the band had graduated beyond the claustrophobic confines of the
Cavern. McCartney first played the Cavern in 1958 with John
Lennon's band, The Quarrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is more common for the Cavern to host a disco with
recorded music than a live show, but McCartney treated a select
audience, and an estimated half-billion electronic onlookers, to
the club's and the Beatles' roots.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the wrinkly-faced grandfathers in other band reunions,
McCartney said getting on stage was not as natural as some might
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always about to give up, because it seems so unseemly,''
McCartney said, ``but then it seems so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatles traditionalists may have been disappointed by the play
list, which was heavy on the new songs of McCartney's new band and
album of the same name, Run Devil Run, and light on the familiar
Lennon-McCartney tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But the band included some heavyweights, including Pink Floyd's
guitarist David Gilmore, and the place rocked when McCartney sang
``I Saw Her Standing There,'' which he introduced as a song that
could have been from the 1950s or the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Sir Paul shouted, ending the gig. ``See you next
time.''

A SIDE-BY-SIDE CONTRAST OF SOLEMN AND LIVELY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To paraphrase Jean-Luc Godard, who once suggested
that the most effective way to criticize a film is to make another,
I propose that the best way to criticize ``Marie Christine'' is to
see it back to back with another ambitious but very different
theater piece, ``In the Blood.'' Which is what I did recently, by
accident and with no malice aforethought.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't fair. Nobody ever intended that the two productions
should be seen in tandem and then compared. Yet when they are, each
has a way of illuminating the other, sometimes happily, other times
for merciless effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine'' is Michael John LaChiusa's new operalike
musical in the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. It is a
variation on the ``Medea'' of Euripides, updated by almost 2,500
years and transferred, bag and baggage, fromrinth of
prehistory to the New Orleans and Chicago of the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Blood,'' which was inspired in part by Nathaniel
Hawthorne's ``Scarlet Letter,''is Suzan-Lori Parks' nonmusical
play, a spare, utterly contemporary contemplation of an unwed
welfare mother of five and the urban society that successfully
ignores her. Unfortunately for many of you, ``In the Blood'' gives
its final performance Sunday in the Shiva Theater at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Each production is headed by a stunning young actress (Audra
McDonald in ``Marie Christine'' and Charlayne Woodard in ``In the
Blood'') and shares an unusual seriousness in its aspirations. Yet
``Marie Christine'' is so intimidating with its artistic
earnestness that you might want to cry uncle before the end of the
first act. ``In the Blood'' has the jazzy beat and cheeky humor of
life as it's captured in tabloid prose. Yet ``In the Blood''
prompts exultation, which is what opera is supposed to do, while
``Marie Christine'' leaves you simply exhausted and a little
confused.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``Marie Christine'' and ``In the Blood'' in such
juxtaposition confirms suspicions that if and when a new musical
form is ever identified, it may be too narrowly elitist for
Broadway, which seems to be prospering anyway with a succession of
revivals. At the same time, there is hope for an Off Broadway and a
regional theater that, like the plays of Ms. Parks, speaks to the
needs of the people without condescension.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa, who wrote the words and music for ``Marie Christine,''
continues his tireless pursuit of a new American musical idiom,
having already won attention for his satirical ``First Lady Suite''
and ``Hello Again,'' an adaptation of Schnitzler's ``Ronde.'' This
season LaChiusa is being represented not only by ``Marie
Christine,'' for which Lincoln Center Theater has provided a
sumptuous production, but also by ``The Wild Party,'' the musical
he is doing with George C. Wolfe, the producer of the Public
Theater. It is scheduled to open in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa is the fellow everyone wants to quote when doing a
``whither'' piece on the state of musical theater. There were high
hopes for ``Marie Christine,'' which opened at Lincoln Center not
long after ``Contact.'' This innovative, elegantly funny dance
play, conceived by the choreographer Susan Stroman and the writer
John Weidman, which is now at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater, moves to
the Beaumont in March.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Marie Christine'' is an interesting one. The
New Orleans of 100 years ago is a place where whites and blacks
recognize a singular, completely artificial racial hierarchy of a
complexity that is both primitive and highly sophisticated. There
are apartheidlike laws on the books, but also ways in which the
races mix freely, intimately, if not publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which ignores have-nots without regard for race or
color, perfectly serves the power structures of the white, the
black and the mixed-race communities.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa's Medea is Marie Christine, the daughter of a black
mother who has a penchant for voodoo, and a rich white plantation
owner. She, too, dabbles in magic, which she explains initially as
little more than mind games. Later, though, she demonstrates that
her magic is as powerful and terrifying as Medea's.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Christine has been brought up in a genteel, strictly
bourgeois mulatto world as far removed from the ruling white
society as it is from the black working class. Like Medea, she is
initially regarded as something exotic and richly desirable by the
man who destroys her. In this case, he is Dante Keyes, a handsome
buccaneer who seduces her and carries her away, first to New York
and then to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   When Dante eventually dumps her to further his career in Chicago
politics, she does what every Medea has been doing since time
began; that is, she wreaks a terrible revenge on Dante's new wife
and protects her sons in the fashion dictated by the ferocity of
her nature.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Marie Christine'' as an opera or as a musical
_ it is not easily classified as either _ is that LaChiusa's music
and words never successfully embrace the primal narrative. They
never reveal and embody the all-consuming passions that rule this
Medea. Instead, the music and words rather dutifully announce and
describe feelings and events that are beyond the artist's ability
to evoke directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Blood'' deals with a world no less exotic in its way
than that of ``Marie Christine,'' but never for a minute does it
seem to be unreal or removed. Ms. Parks' reimagined Hester Prynne
is a woman we choose not to see every day as we move around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   This Hester is a timeless figure. She is a bewildered Everywoman
living under a Manhattan bridge, coping with her five kids: Jabber,
Bully, Trouble, Beauty and Baby. She uses and is used by welfare
people, do-gooders, fellow drifters and the deadbeat fathers of her
children. She is rude, deceitful, filthy, in short: impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard's performance is blunt, beautiful and riveting, so
full of uncanny force that it can make you feel guilty for
watching, guiltier for laughing. I can't say that if I met her on
the street, I wouldn't walk by her feeling a bit of righteous
indignation that we were sharing _ even briefly _ the same
territory. Such are the mixed feelings Ms. Parks can bring out.
</P>
<P>
   This is her achievement as a writer. Hester is someone of our
time, a character who erupted within the mind of the playwright
because her time had come. That's how right she feels.
</P>
<P>
   My difficulty with ``Marie Christine,'' as it was with last
year's most ``serious'' musical, ``Parade,'' for which Jason Robert
Brown did the music and lyrics, is that there is no sense of
spontaneity about it. It has the manner of a musical more or less
worried into being by people who, having desperately searched for a
worthy subject, have accepted one before the subject had its own
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine'' is certainly better than ``Parade,'' which
was about the lynching of a Jewish businessman in Georgia in 1915,
but it, too, has the manner of a project of more theoretical than
actual interest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa's music has wit rather than passion. When he becomes
solemn, his lyrics, like the music, begin to sound banal,
inadequate, as in ``I will love you/Too much and more,'' which
isn't quite enough when it issues from a mother who is about to
murder her two small sons.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with the production of ``Marie
Christine,'' directed by Graciela Daniele. It is exceedingly
handsome, and Audra McDonald is in splendid voice in the title
role. This is a big leap for the new star who, until now, has given
glowing performances in supporting, largely reactive roles in
``Carousel,'' ``Master Class'' and ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Her performance as Marie Christine is a good deal smaller than
her great, lovely soprano. But there isn't a lot to act. Ms.
McDonald looks like a young, naive Medea, and because of that she
seems less like an awe-inspiring pagan witch than an angry baby
sitter. As she seems to stand apart from the character, so the
production and LaChiusa's text seem to stand apart from the
enormity of the tale being told.
</P>
<P>
   The only supporting players who have a chance to register are
Anthony Crivello, who sings well as Dante, the rather thinly
written Jason character, and Mary Testa, who plays a Chicago madam,
a character that exists only to serve the narrative by passing on
information as needed.
</P>
<P>
   As staged by David Esbjornson, ``In the Blood'' has a swiftness
of line and an immediacy of feeling that suggest a series of epic,
Daumieresque caricatures. Except for Ms. Woodard, each of the
actors in the cast has two roles, meaning that all of the children,
ranging in age from 2 to 13, are played by the same adults who also
turn up minutes later as, among others, the woman from welfare, a
nutty street doctor, a hustling preacher, and Hester's first love,
a gentle fellow with a serious hang-up with clocks and being able
to judge the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the unwed mother in ``In the Blood'' is named Hester, and
though there are other associations to ``The Scarlet Letter,'' Ms.
Parks' interest in the novel and in Hawthorne has more to do with
social and psychological responsibility than with anything as
commonplace as plot. The ``A'' that haunts this Hester has nothing
to do with adultery. It's the first and only letter of the alphabet
that she recognizes after all of the attempts of Jabber, her oldest
child, to teach her how to read.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Woodard, the members of the superb cast: Rob
Campbell, Reggie Montgomery, Gail Grate, Bruce MacVittie and
Deirdre O'Connell. Each and every one admirable, in all their
guises. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnelli on Minnelli'' is the self-explanatory title of the
show now at _ where else? _ the Palace: Liza Minnelli's
irresistible tribute to her father, Vincente, who, beginning with
``Cabin in the Sky'' in 1943, directed some of MGM's greatest
musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Not since my stereo went to sleep and my old LPs were stored too
long on a radiator have I so enjoyed two hours of looking backward.
Among the films whose scores are recalled: ``Ziegfeld Follies,''
``An American in Paris,'' ``The Band Wagon,'' ``Gigi'' and
``Kismet,'' which provides the star with one of her big hits of the
night: ``Baubles, Bangles and Beads.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minnelli may be somewhat rounder than when she won her Oscar
for the 1972 ``Cabaret,'' but the need to please is real and the
talent unstoppable. Bob Mackie's spangly jackets, worn over black
slacks, give her whatever show-biz chic she needs. Most important,
the voice can still make bold men weep.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the patter is awkward, but she is great about both her
mum and dad. Fred Ebb's direction keeps everything on track, and
the five dancer-singers who back her up are inexhaustible.
</P>
<P>
   The night's climax is telegraphed early on, and it works anyway:
Liza, live at the Palace in December 1999, singing a duet of ``The
Trolley Song'' with her mother's voice from the soundtrack of
``Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944, directed by her father). When you
have roots like that, you don't stay at home, hiding them under a
wig. You go to the Palace and sing your heart out. &QL;

<P>
   Bryan Goluboff, author of ``Shyster,'' can write vivid,
compelling characters. They are being played for all they are worth
by the five wizardly actors now in the Naked Angels production _
which closes Sunday _ at the tiny Blue Heron Theater. The
comedy-drama, about a Jewish family whose father has just died,
doesn't seem at all sure about where it is going or how. What are
intended to be plot revelations often play as if the author had
just changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Set on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, this is a
play fueled by the actors, who appear to be having a most
productive time of it. Note Phyllis Newman as the exhausted mother
of the family; Annabella Sciorra as her daughter, badly wounded
during service with the Israeli Army; Fisher Stevens as her drifter
son; Charles Malik Whitfield as the young black man who became the
son that Stevens never was to his recently deceased dad, and
Saundra McClain, who plays Whitfield's mother.
</P>
<P>
   More about the story you need not know. The joy in this
production, directed by Dante Albertie, is watching these nifty
actors give performances you don't often find on Broadway. All the
actors are equally good, but among the equals, Ms. Newman is just a
little bit more equal than anybody else. She is wonderful.

 &HT;    Abortion law may face legal challenge
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Secret court proceedings designed to protect
pregnant girls may create legal problems for a new Texas law that
will force doctors to notify the parent of a minor seeking an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 1, a doctor will have to notify a parent or
guardian 48 hours before performing the abortion, except in a
medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But a girl who doesn't want her parents to know about her
abortion can seek a court order certifying that she is mature
enough to make the decision herself, or that she has reason to fear
that telling her parents would put her in danger. The so-called
``judicial bypass,'' which the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled must be
included in parental notification laws, is designed mostly to
protect girls who have been sexually abused at home.
</P>
<P>
   To conceal the girl's identity, the new Texas law says
everything about the judicial bypass proceeding, including the
court's decision and even the judge's name, has to be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody agrees that the girl's name should be kept secret. But
critics say the Texas confidentiality clause goes too far, cloaking
judges who might rule based on their ideology rather than the
facts. Some also worry that it will make it difficult for judges
and lawyers to know what ``mature and sufficiently well-informed''
actually means.
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy provision may be ripe for a legal challenge: Some
lawyers and judges argue that the judicial bypass rules, which go
far beyond the secrecy rules in other cases involving juveniles,
violate the Texas Constitution's ban on closed court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be shocked if there wasn't a lawsuit,'' said Chip
Babcock, a Dallas media lawyer who headed the Texas Supreme Court
committee that hammered out the procedural rules for the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, who sponsored the parental
notification bill, said she wanted to keep judges' names secret to
shield them from electoral intimidation from either side of the
contentious abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that there is no public purpose for judging
the judges in this particular set of circumstances, because they
are not going to be doing their ruling based on their pro-choice or
anti-choice views. They are going to be doing it based on the
mental capacity of the children,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Watler, a Dallas lawyer who used to head the Freedom of
Information Foundation of Texas, said the law's sweeping
confidentiality ``erodes public confidence in the judiciary,
particularly in a controversial area like abortion. You inevitably
give rise to the idea that judges are deciding these cases based on
personal ideology, and not on the rule of law.'' Watler noted that
a Cincinnati newspaper successfully sued to overturn a similar
provision in Ohio's parental notification law.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the confidentiality issue point to
Harris County as an example of an overheated atmosphere on the
abortion issue. Anti-abortion rights forces have been particularly
active in local elections, including judicial races. One Houston
judge, state District Judge John Devine, was jailed as an
anti-abortion protester before he took the bench in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro says she wasn't pressured by either side of the abortion
debate on the confidentiality issue. Her claim is bolstered by the
ambivalence of some leading abortion rights supporters and
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Kae McLaughlin, who heads the Texas Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League, said national abortion rights activists want
judges' records to be public so they can be held accountable. But
she's afraid that Texas' elected judges who grant the judicial
bypass will be targeted for defeat by abortion-rights opponents.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin also worries that in rural areas of the state, girls
will resort to illegal and dangerous abortions rather than go
before a judge they know has a record of denying the bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Price of Texans United for Life said he's not all that
concerned about the rules for the bypass procedure. He believes
that many girls will tell their parents rather than go before any
judge. Overall, he is convinced that the law will result in fewer
teen-age pregnancies and fewer abortions. In any case, Price said,
evidence from other states suggests that judges award the bypass 90
to 95 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see the same results, and how they write these
rules isn't going to affect that one way or the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges and lawyers, meanwhile, say the confidentiality
clause may make it difficult for them to know how mature is mature
enough. ``It's going to be more difficult than in other areas of
the law to know what the law is and how to apply it,'' Supreme
Court Justice Nathan Hecht said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ann Crawford McClure of the Eighth District Court of
Appeals in El Paso said the secrecy provision will make it
difficult to establish a body of case law that judges and attorneys
can consult. ``It's really going to be like shooting at a moving
target for the time being,'' McClure said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all judges are concerned. District Judge Scott McCown of
Austin acknowledged that the maturity standard is subjective, but
he said it's one that judges already contend with in other juvenile
cases, such as deciding when a juvenile can be tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht said the court considered ruling on the constitutionality
of the secrecy provision but decided to wait until it has a case in
front of it. He wouldn't be surprised, he said, if they get that
chance sometime soon.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: MIXED FORECASTS FOR FUTURE OF GLOBAL AVIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several days before the start of an international aviation
conference in Chicago early this month, the U.S. Transportation
Department released an upbeat report about the future of aviation
and the success of the various Open Skies agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Those agreements between nations permit unrestricted air service
by airlines of each country to, from and beyond the other's
territory, with no limit on the number of flights, the type of
aircraft and the prices they can charge. The United States has
agreements with 38 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department found that from 1996 to 1998, on
routes connecting interior cities in both the United States and
foreign countries, fares fell an average of 17.5 percent where Open
Skies was in effect. In markets without Open Skies agreements, the
average decrease was 3.5 percent. The department also noted that
the global impact of air transport would approach $2 trillion in
2010, almost double that of 1994, and directly and indirectly would
account for more than 30 million jobs, 6 million more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Beyond Open Skies'' conference in Chicago heard a less
upbeat view of the future of aviation from James Goodwin, the chief
executive of United Airlines, the nation's biggest carrier.
Declaring global aviation at a crisis point, he said there was not
enough runway space, terminals or parking space to accommodate the
millions of arrivals and departures and the one billion passengers
projected to fly on U.S. airlines by 2012, up from 680 million
passengers this year. And he laid most of the responsibility at the
door of the nation's air traffic control system.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first such industry warning. Earlier this year,
Carol Hallet, president of the Air Transport Association, made
similar predictions, contending that the air traffic control system
was inadequate to handle the current 21,000 daily flights, much
less the billion passengers expected within the next dozen years.
In addition, the magazine Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology
primarily cited the United States government for the growing air
travel crisis, a crisis in which ``passenger safety could be
severely compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is rare to hear such forebodings by an airline executive
at a conference intended to celebrate the growth and economic
importance of the aviation industry. Nevertheless, Goodwin warned
that if something is not done soon, air traffic delays would triple
in 10 years, costing passengers both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   A Matter of Service
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the deadline for the airline industry to put into
effect its improved customer service provisions. These include
giving passengers notification of cancellations, delays and
diversions; replying within 60 days of receiving written
complaints, and advising of the lowest fare available for each
flight.
</P>
<P>
   But individual airlines have gone beyond that, pledging to
notify passengers by phone (instead of at the airport) of flight
cancellations when known at least two hours before departure (Delta
Air Lines), promising not to keep passengers aboard delayed planes
for more than an hour (Northwest Airlines) and establishing a
consumer advisory board to give advice about the airline's
performance (U S Airways).
</P>
<P>
   U S Airways yesterday vowed to allow passengers to cancel
purchased tickets within 24 hours without penalty and promised to
make prompt refunds. Two days ago, Continental Airlines said that a
so-called Service Planning Center would be installed at each of its
hub airports in Newark, Houston and Cleveland to rebook passengers
on alternate flights, make hotel reservations and generally assist
fliers.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from reaction on the Internet and in trade
publications in recent weeks, the flying public is taking a
decidedly wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Rights
</P>
<P>
   Passenger rights are spelled out on a Web site recently
introduced by the National Business Travel Association
(www.BizTraveler.org). There are also some 2,000 travel tips,
including how and where to file a travel complaint, warnings about
regions to avoid because of safety or weather threats, what to do
when bumped or delayed, how to travel with a laptop computer or
with children, and what safety precautions to take in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Those tips were collected from more than 1,400 of the
association's corporate travel managers, and although intended for
business travelers, they should prove equally helpful for all
travelers. The Web site's passenger complaint form will allow the
association to monitor the actual level of service being delivered
in the travel industry, seek a remedy if possible, and, in the case
of air travel, compile a report from the responses and forward it
to the appropriate regulatory body. &QL;

 &HT;    Former GOP presidential hopeful endorses Bush
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORALVILLE, Iowa _ Facing questions about whether he is ready
for the White House, George W. Bush on Tuesday trotted out just
what the spin doctor ordered _ an endorsement from former rival
Lamar Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, one of the first to declare Bush not ready for the
big time, campaigned with the GOP front-runner and declared him
``presidential,'' an image Bush is working to capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me last night and he showed me on the campaign trail
that he is steady, that he is strong and that he is presidential,''
Alexander said. ``In other words, when I get up in the morning and
turn on my television set and look into it, I want to see someone
who looks and acts presidential to me. And to me, George W. Bush
does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who quit the race in August, offered the endorsement
three weeks ago. The Bush campaign announce-- it Tuesday, the
morning after a debate that, by all measures, went better for Bush
than two previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said Bush's experience as -- big-state chief executive
is a major plus. Seven months ago, however, Alexander was not quite
as impressed by Bush's resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to be a governor,'' Alexander said in May.
``Going from being governor to being president is like going from
the playground to the NBA finals, and the people of New Hampshire
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   When he dropped out of the race in August after a poor showing
in the Iowa straw poll, Alexander declined to endorse anyone. He
bemoaned the system that allowed Bush to become a prohibitive
front-runner by piling up early money and endorsements. At the
time, Alexander said voters, not inside players, should pick the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Alexander offered a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is nearly over,'' he said, though nobody has voted
yet. ``I came to the conclusion that I'd waited long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's presidential credentials have come under fire as a result
of stumbles on the campaign trail and lackluster performances in
debates in New Hampshire and Arizona. Monday night, Bush was more
aggressive, especially toward top challenger Arizona Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was more relaxed and more confident and more
engaged and a little feistier,'' said Bush adviser Mark McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to score points with his campaign-reform message,
an ace in the hole he uses in relation to many issues. Karl Rove,
Bush's top adviser, said Tuesday that McCain is overrating the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``While campaign finance reform is a worthy goal . . . it ranks
somewhere lower on the scale than education and defense and taxes
and welfare,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Bush said he had no second thoughts about offering
Jesus Christ as the answer to a debate question asking the
candidates to identify the ``political philosopher or thinker . . .
you most identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Des Moines radio interview, Bush said ``some people might
have been offended by the fact that I was willing to express my
faith on public television. But that's OK. I just thought it was
the best thing to say at the time and, as you get to know me
better, you'll find I'm the kind of person that doesn't worry about
a poll or a focus group when asked questions.''

STUDY BACKS A DRUG FOR HYPERACTIVE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa., Colo.) (Eds: SUBS 4th graf to correct spelling of Jensen.) 
 (rk) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted,
researchers have found that the drug Ritalin, the object of sharp
debate for three decades, was more effective than
behavior-modification therapy in treating children with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who worked at six sites around the country in
teams assembled by the National Institutes of Health, said that
adding the behavioral therapy to Ritalin treatment was no more
effective than the drug alone. But they said they found that about
70 percent of the children they studied also turned out to have
problems like depression and anxiety. In those cases, they said,
behavior therapy provided significant benefits, especially when
used in combination with the Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   The results, reported in the current issue of the Archives of
General Psychiatry, were discussed at a news conference Tuesday at
the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter S. Jensen, a child psychiatrist at Columbia and a
senior adviser to the NIH who directed the project, said the
results were ``the first real information on comparative treatments
over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James T. McCracken, the director of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the Neuropyschiatric Institute of the University of
California at Los Angeles, who was not involved in the research,
called the study a landmark and said it proved the benefits of
treating hyperactive children with a stimulant. ``As a child
psychiatrist, it is still surprising that Ritalin remains as
controversial as it is,'' he said. ``One hopes that this study will
put some of the controversy to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Carey, a child psychiatrist at the Children's
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said that while he had
no criticism of the study, Ritalin is overused, adding, ``Do you
give it to a child who talks incessantly in line?'' The drug should
be reserved for real brain disorders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent battles over the drug took place last
month when the Colorado Board of Education moved to discourage
teachers from recommending behavioral drugs like Ritalin and urged
school personnel to use discipline and instruction instead to
overcome problem behavior in the classroom. The action was said to
have stemmed from fears that such drugs were related to violence
among children, although medical scientists say there is no
evidence of that. Its side effects, which include headaches or loss
of appetite, are reported as minor and reversible.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH researchers studied 579 children over 14 months. The
children, who were 7 to 9 years of age, were given long and
detailed examinations, Jensen said. About 80 percent were boys.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments of the children were divided into four groups: those
that received Ritalin alone, received intensive behavior management
therapy alone, a combination of the two and whatever kind of
treatment was standard for their community.
</P>
<P>
   The researches found that among the children who had attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder but not the other psychiatric
disorders, Ritalin brought improvement in their conditions when it
was used alone, regardless of whether it was accompanied by other
therapy. They also found that Ritalin and the intensive behavior
therapy used in combination were the most effective when used for
the children with psychiatric problems that went beyond attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The study found a number of differences between the institutes
of health program of intensive behavior management _ based on the
B.F. Skinner theory on the value of using positive reinforcement to
encourage acceptable behavior _ and the various community therapies
used for the children in the fourth group.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen P. Hinshaw, a child psychiatrist and professor at
the University of California at Berkeley, said they included
monthly meetings under the NIH approach and more emphasis on
behavior management by parents in the home and teachers in the
classroom.

 &HT;    Lotto odds great - for lottery officials
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ If you miss buying a ticket for tonight's
$77 million Lotto jackpot, don't fret. It will probably hit that
level at least once more within the year.
</P>
<P>
   And if $77 million isn't enough to make you part with a buck,
just wait 2.8 years, by which time it will likely have hit $134
million, according to lottery estimates obtained by The Palm Beach
Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``$100 million jackpots are achievable and statistically
probable within 24 months and statistically possible within 12
months,'' according to a March memo to then-interim Lottery
Secretary Sue Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the new math for the new Lotto, which was unveiled in
October to produce just these sorts of gigantic jackpots to induce
frenzied ticket buying in a public that's grown jaded with prizes
in the $20 million to $30 million range.
</P>
<P>
   How frenzied?
</P>
<P>
   In a week with a $3 million starting jackpot, the lottery
expects to sell about 11 million tickets. This past week, with
jackpots in the $60 million-$70 million range, the agency estimated
it will have sold 101 million of the $1 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   While lottery officials sold ``new'' Lotto as providing players
twice as many chances to win, in reality, according to its internal
documents, the new ``matrix'' was designed to make more players
lose more often _ thereby boosting stagnant Lotto sales from about
$700 million a year to at least $900 million, possibly $1.1 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Going from a game of picking of six numbers out of 49 to six out
of 53, lottery officials worsened the odds of winning the jackpot
by 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old game, a player betting $10 per week _ if he could
have lived so long _ would have won $7 million after 27,000 years.
He would have spent $14 million winning it.
</P>
<P>
   With the new odds, a player betting $10 per week will win $11.5
million after 44,000 years, having spent $23 million to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the point of view of the lottery, the change in numbers
drastically decreases the chances that anyone will win a starting
jackpot _ from 50 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, the chances of there being a single winner
of a ``triple rollover'' jackpot of about $30 million decreases
from 94 percent to about 77 percent, thereby allowing the lucrative
quadruple and near mythic ``quintuple'' rollover. In the Lottery's
11-year history, there have been only two quadruple rollovers, $106
million in September 1990 and $89 million in October 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Quadruple rollovers are expected to bring in $51 million in
sales per drawing, with an average of three such jackpots each
year.
</P>
<P>
   And the quintuple _ a sort of Holy Grail for lottery officials _
could see a jackpot of up to $134 million, with $100 million in
sales for each such drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery statisticians estimate that such a drawing would take
place every three years. A comparable jackpot under the old Lotto
was statistically possible every 6.6 years, although the game had
not seen a jackpot like that since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   With any major change with a popular Lottery game, though, come
risks. In this case: What if players don't go for the idea of
betting on a game with even worse odds than before?
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials considered that, but ultimately decided to
believe a survey of their ticket vendors: ``Core players would
dislike it at first but that most players do not know or care about
the odds,'' according to an Aug. 19 staff memo sent to Lottery
Secretary David Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   An outside consultant brought in by Griffin to critique the
proposed switch also acknowledged the concern, advising Griffin to
go ahead with the change but have ready ``a contingency action
plan, with an exit strategy for the 6-of-53 Florida Lotto, when and
if the situation arises, including a replacement game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' wrote Virginia gambling industry
consultant Carl Alexoff, ``there are only two ways to increase
sales: 1) have the current player base play more or 2) broaden the
player base. The trick is to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lottery officials might see their very first
``quintuple'' rollover tonight if no one wins the $77 million
jackpot. The chances of that happening: 5.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Mich. _ The AutoNation operation here looks more like a
gigantic Starbucks than a place to sell used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Acres of parking lots marked by color-coded signs surround a
large, high-ceilinged building of tan brick and glass. Inside,
instead of battered desks and lots of pushy sales representatives,
the office contains curving cubicles of polished wood, with
computers to describe the features of every car on the lot.
</P>
<P>
   But as heavy sleet turned to snow Tuesday morning in this
Detroit suburb, a team of liquidation experts poked through the
cavernous showroom, trying to determine what could be sold and how
quickly, from the cars to the computers. For while AutoNation has
succeeded in creating a cheerful, comfortable place to buy used
cars, it has failed to do so in a way that would earn money.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the century-long history of the auto industry,
selling cars _ particularly used cars _ has been a gritty business.
Profits usually flowed to the hardest-nosed bargainer, the dealer
who negotiated the highest possible price for each automobile while
spending as little as possible on amenities like furniture,
carpeting and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation and other big, publicly traded companies captured
Wall Street's fancy three years ago by trying to change all that.
Now they are struggling as the car-sales industry is buffeted by
the rise of the Internet, a fall in used-car prices and a push by
traditional dealers to improve customer services.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these new-wave car sales companies built used-car
superstores that looked like cafes, not junkyards, and employed
computer kiosks and child-care centers to lure customers to immense
lots that offered as many as 1,000 late-model cars. The same
companies, plus a few others, later created big chains of new-car
dealerships that would share ad budgets and back-office staff to
build national brand names at relatively modest cost.
</P>
<P>
   But now the used-car superstores are disappearing almost as fast
as they appeared, while the chains' new-car dealerships try to cut
costs after sometimes lavish expansions.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation's announcement late Monday that it would close most
of its used-car superstores and slash costs at its headquarters
signals the unraveling of that original vision. To some extent,
investors had already seen it coming: With the exception of Lithia
Motors, the most old-fashioned of the publicly traded auto
dealerships, stocks in those chains had already slumped. Since
early 1997, price-earnings multiples for the dealer chains have
tumbled from as high as 50 to just 8 or 9, as low as the multiples
for auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But the troubles are far from over. ``The initial Wall Street
projections were so off-base that you had this land rush into the
industry,'' said George Hoffer, an economist at Virginia
Commonwealth University.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? The publicly traded dealership chains appear to
have been buffeted by several forces that few anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the Internet has made car buyers more conscious of
what constitutes a fair price and better able to check prices
without shuttling among dealerships. These informed consumers give
dealers with low costs and little overhead the advantage, because
they can afford to sell cars at rockbottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, largely because prices for new cars have leveled off,
prices of late-model used cars have fallen recently, hurting the
value of the inventories at used-car superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Long-maligned traditional dealers also seem to have improved
customer service, partly to match the competition and partly in
response to pressure from automakers, including some that are
experimenting with operating dealerships themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, dealers have used their muscle in state capitals to
strengthen franchise laws. Even where the rules have not been
tightened, the laws already make it hard for publicly traded
dealership companies, automakers and Internet companies to expand
their retailing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Super-dealerships, thus, are undergoing a metamorphosis: Auto
executives are replacing the financiers who built the chains and
are moving quickly to reduce costs. In August, Roger Penske, the
car dealer and diesel-engine magnate, took control of United Auto
Group, the nation's second-largest dealership chain, from Marshall
Cogan, a financier. Michael Jackson, former head of Mercedes-Benz's
North American operations, became AutoNation's chief in October,
replacing Steven Berrard, a video-rental executive and friend of H.
Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   It was Huizenga who conferred Wall Street credibility to the
idea that publicly traded corporations could consolidate the auto
dealership industry; Huizenga had already consolidated the
garbage-hauling and video-rental businesses, building first Waste
Management and then Blockbuster Entertainment. In 1995, Huizenga
took control of Republic Industries, a small garbage hauler, and
set about turning it into what is now AutoNation, the world's
largest auto retailer.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to buy hundreds of dealerships with his high-flying
company stock as he reminded investors and analysts of previous
successes. ``We want to build a brand just like we did at
Blockbuster,'' the company's 1995 annual report said.
</P>
<P>
   But brand-building has proved difficult, partly because the
top-performing dealerships AutoNation bought had already built
their own reputations based on loyalty to the original owners. And
AutoNation was often prevented by state laws from getting extra
volume discounts from automakers that might give it a competitive
advantage over other dealers, so the company could do little to
make up for the higher costs associated with building an empire.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is now laying off virtually all 1,800 employees at the
23 used-car superstores being closed and dismissing 225 of 600
employees at AutoNation's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would also sell one of AutoNation's two jets and
even look for ways to trim costs at the corporate dining room. ``We
will create a cost-conscious culture in this company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But AutoNation, which has 409 dealerships in 19 states and
annual sales approaching $20 billion, still has a long way to go.
Compare it, for example, with Lithia Motors, essentially a family
dealership that has grown into the nation's sixth-biggest publicly
traded new-car dealership chain with 41 franchises under one
corporate umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Lithia is known for its cheapness. Its corporate headquarters
are housed above the parts department of the company's Toyota
dealership in Medford, Ore. When an electric motor opens the garage
door for the loading dock below, the whir is heard in the offices
of the company's top executives. The walls have the original
knotty-pine paneling from 1973, and hallways feature exposed pipes.
</P>
<P>
   An executive dining room? ``I go to Taco Bell or order in
pizza,'' said Jeff DeBoer, Lithia's vice president of finance. ``We
order in spaghetti sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   That austerity has been rewarded: Lithia's earnings and stock
price have risen even as the stocks of the other big public
dealership chains have faltered. Generally speaking, investors have
grown disenchanted with the idea of generating rising earnings
simply by buying bunches of profitable dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   The only surviving publicly traded chain of used-car
superstores, out of five two years ago, is CarMax Inc., which is
also known for controlling its costs and is 77 percent-owned by
Circuit City Stores Inc. While AutoNation said on Monday that its
corporate overhead costs had risen 71 percent in the last 12
months, CarMax's overhead has remained flat even as it has slowly
expanded, said Austin Ligon, its president.
</P>
<P>
   Austin attributed AutoNation's problems to excessive growth:
``There's a limit to how fast you can do this and still be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation's rivals have also tried to give considerable
autonomy to their dealerships' sales managers, reasoning that every
auto market is subtly different and constantly changing. United
Auto Group and AutoNation are now moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Rival dealers say that a lack of feel for local markets hurts
the big chains. James Willingham, a Buick, Pontiac and GMC dealer
in Long Beach, Calif., said he often drives by an AutoNation
used-car superstore and is surprised by what is on its lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the wrong product,'' he said. ``They're very close to
Long Beach University with 30,000 students and they've got big
sport utility vehicles, big Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles when they
should have Toyotas and Nissans.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation now sees its future relying to a great extent on the
Internet. Two years ago, when it was buying dealerships almost
every week, Berrard said that the company had only begun to work on
an Internet strategy. Jackson now considers the Internet a core
part of AutoNation's business, noting in a conference call with
analysts and reporters on Monday that customers who first contacted
the company through the Internet had bought $1 billion in cars this
year.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation now lists 90,000 cars and their prices on its Web
site, www.autonationdirect.com; it has 900 sales agents to handle
Internet inquiries. ``This is a payoff for economies of scale,
because of the single-site advantage to present a wide selection,''
said Thomas Eggleston, AutoNation's senior vice president for
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But while its selection may be broad, customers are unlikely to
buy cars at dealerships at the other end of the country and wait
for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   And for all its size and heft, AutoNation has found that it
cannot simply cut margins and try to sell as many cars as possible.
The company tried recently in Denver and learned that the
automakers' systems for allocating new cars _ another feature of
the franchise system _ did not allow dealers to replace cars as
fast as they were sold, Eggleston said. Manufacturers have been
leery of shipping so many cars to a single dealer, concerned that
the dealer will pursue sales across the franchise territories of
other dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The same state franchise laws also make it impossible for
AutoNation to start selling new cars at the used-car superstores
that it is shutting because that would have infringed on the
territories of existing dealers.
</P>
<P>
   A few experts have suggested that publicly traded dealership
chains join with automakers and Internet companies in a lobbying
campaign to overturn the state laws, possibly through federal
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional dealers are masters not only of low-cost selling
but also of using their connections to influence lawmakers. Despite
lobbying by automakers, dealers have already persuaded at least
five states this year to tighten state franchise laws even further.
Even as the public dealership companies stagger, traditional
dealers are still standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a real fight,'' said one auto-manufacturing
executive, ``it would have been called.''

 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is reducing its efforts to find
cheating by businesses and high-income individuals, and stepping up
investigations into two forms of cheating that are more likely to
involve the working poor than the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Congress to stress customer service more,
the IRS is also reassigning employees who audit companies and
high-income individuals to work counters at walk-in centers, answer
telephones around the clock and resolve the tax disputes of
estranged couples.
</P>
<P>
   But some IRS agents say that many of the changes will tie their
hands and in effect shift the focus of audits to those without
professional advisers or political connections.
</P>
<P>
   The principal sponsor of the IRS overhaul legislation, Sen.
William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., said in a statement that the changes
taking place were the kind of transitory issues that should be
expected when an agency is undergoing a major transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The number of audits in the fiscal year that began this autumn
will be cut by 30 percent to 40 percent from the record low number
of two years ago, the latest for which data are available, the IRS
commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, said. Fewer than one in 300 tax
returns will be audited this fiscal year, down from one in 217 two
years ago and one in 63 in 1981. For wealthy individuals with gross
income of $100,000 or more, fewer than an estimated one in 150
returns will be audited this year compared to one in 33 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS plans to continue giving its highest priority to
auditing the 1,600 largest corporations. But it will sharply reduce
audits of the other 16 million businesses in America, the vast
majority of them privately owned, and of the rapidly increasing
ranks of high-income Americans, who tend to file complex returns.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of corporate returns that are audited is expected
to fall to just above 1 percent for the current fiscal year from
just under 3 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to find tax cheating is being reduced even more than
these numbers suggest, according to more than four dozen IRS
employees. In interviews they described pressure from managers to
avoid upsetting taxpayers, to overlook complex issues and to close
audits quickly. Some agents have coined a term for these
once-over-lightly examinations of tax returns: audit lite.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these sharp cuts in personnel to enforce the tax laws,
the tax agency is planning a new assault on abuse of the Earned
Income Tax Credit, in which the working poor can collect up to $323
for individuals and up to $3,556 for a family of four. The credit
was created to offset the sharp rise in Social Security tax rates
that began two decades ago. Some people make false claims to
increase their payment from the government. The credit has been a
target of Republican congressional leaders for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also plans a major new hunt for people who failed to
file tax returns. Tax workers said the last such search, early in
this decade, focused on people of modest means, and they expect the
same this time. The IRS says it intends to focus this search on
people who owe substantial amounts.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fifth of IRS employees, the equivalent of nearly
21,000 people working full time, will be assigned to customer
service, up from 12,000 four years ago by one measure and nearly
18,000 by another. By either measure there are thousands fewer
workers available to conduct audits and collect overdue taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax agency also plans one new initiative aimed squarely at
the wealthy, an attack on the creation of improper trusts to avoid
estate taxes, but this program will not begin until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the crackdown on abusive trusts, these changes all
grow out of a series of new tax laws sponsored by the Republicans
who control Congress. The most significant of these laws, the IRS
Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, was passed after Senate
Finance Committee hearings in which the IRS was described as out of
control and routinely abusive of taxpayers. Much of the most
explosive testimony has since been discredited and a subsequent
General Accounting Office report found no evidence of systematic
mistreatment of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings, the new laws and Rossotti's policies together have
had a profound effect on the agency's employees, especially the
low-level managers whose daily decisions determine how the tax laws
are administered. Many of these managers have concluded that they
are supposed to wilt before the rich and powerful, especially those
who can get a politician on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't aggravate taxpayers _ that's what our managers are
telling us,'' said one longtime revenue agent in New York. As he
spoke six colleagues nodded in agreement and offered similar
comments from their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   A revenue agent in Florida said his manager told him: ``Don't
probe deeply. Just find three or four obvious items and close the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   An IRS worker in Nashville, Tenn., said anyone there could get a
tax case resolved favorably if they have enough influence to get a
senator or congressman to complain to the IRS. ``We just
collapse,'' the 14-year veteran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't call us tax collectors in the newspaper,'' one
veteran revenue officer in New York said. ``We don't collect taxes
anymore. We aren't allowed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief of IRS operations, John Dalrymple, said ``none of
these comments shock me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was given a synopsis of comments from interviews with IRS
workers in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Michigan, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, nearly all of
whom spoke on condition that they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also am hearing things that have the same general tone,''
Dalrymple said. He added that he would characterize their comments
this way: ``Hey, what is the service's policy going to be around
compliance and enforcement? And how are we going to balance the
need for good customer service on an individual basis with our
responsibility to make sure that people are paying their fair
share?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it is a discussion that we have been having at the
highest levels of the organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple said he and other leading agency executives had
traveled the country telling IRS workers that enforcement was
important and that all taxpayers were to be treated alike, without
regard to their economic or social standing.
</P>
<P>
   He said that this message was not getting through and that
efforts had failed to stamp out the mistaken belief that the new
policy favored the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles and I have been talking about this for quite
sometime,'' he said, adding that Rossotti agreed with him that the
only way to change such a widely held belief was for the
commissioner to personally to make repeated, clear and forceful
corrective statements, which he said Rossotti began doing in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers and employees are looking for some definitive
statements from Charles about what to do in certain circumstances
that are fairly egregious in terms of not complying with the law,''
Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said in a statement responding to questions about
the changes: ``Without question, it will take time for IRS agents
who have done things one way for the past 40 years to learn the new
approach, which is built on better serving taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on serving customers, as taxpayers are now called,
comes not only from Congress but also from Rossotti, a management
and computer systems expert who was brought in two years ago to
modernize the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti has said that for decades the IRS has relied too
heavily on audits and on pursuing tax cheats and that the key to
increasing tax revenues and maintaining popular support is to help
taxpayers meet their obligations through better service delivered
by a better-trained staff and improved technology.
</P>
<P>
   In his first and so far only mission statement for the agency,
which focused on helping people pay their taxes, Rossotti made no
mention of enforcing the law or collecting taxes, omissions that
have been viewed widely within the agency as reflecting a decreased
emphasis on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But now even Rossotti is worried that enforcement has slipped
too far. He told a Senate subcommittee in October that such a low
audit rate ``poses the risk of increased unfairness in
administration of the law, and ultimately, undermining our entire
system of voluntary tax compliance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rossotti has had to strip down audit units to obey Congressional
dictates to expand customer service and resolve a deluge of
so-called innocent spouse cases, most of which involve divorced
women who say their former husbands cheated on their taxes and left
them holding the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Whole audit teams in Brooklyn, Seattle and elsewhere have been
reassigned to innocent-spouse cases, and corporate audit teams
across the country that once had as many as 12 highly trained
examiners have shrunk to as few as four people, tax workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Highly trained IRS auditors who are paid up to $77,000 annually
to examine corporate tax returns have been detailed to answer
telephones and greet people at IRS offices, even though their years
of specialized work have left them ill equipped to handle mundane
questions from the public. One IRS customer service clerk said it
took these auditors so much time to research answers to questions
that, when she was away, it took five of them to do her job.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, revenue officers, whose job is to collect
taxes that are past due, said they were having difficulty getting
supervisors to approve enforcement actions, like foreclosing on
property, because of a perception by managers that they were not to
upset customers, even if they are major tax cheats.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ended Sept. 30 the IRS seized property 161 times,
down from 10,000 two years earlier. Levies on bank accounts and
paychecks fell to 504,000 from 3.1 million two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Two revenue officers outlined cases they had built against
individuals who each cheated the government out of millions of
dollars in taxes, only to be frustrated by the refusal of their
superiors to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   These officers described elaborate schemes to place assets in
the names of relatives to thwart tax collection and, presumably,
hide money from creditors. ``Every badge of fraud was there, but
Criminal Investigation Division told me the U.S. attorney was not
interested,'' one of these revenue officers said.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue officer said that because the case was rejected for
prosecution, requests for permission to force the taxpayer to pay,
which Congress now requires be approved by high level managers,
have been ignored. ``No one will do anything'' to collect the
taxes, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple said he had heard, fourth or fifth hand, similar tales
of inaction and was troubled by them. He said he would like to hear
directly from revenue officers who think their superiors are
failing in their duty to enforce collection.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the cuts in audits is amplified by other factors,
including a steady rise in the number of tax returns and a very
sharp increase in returns filed by high-income Americans, who are
the most likely to have income and deductions from businesses and
investments, which can involve complex audit issues.
</P>
<P>
   The number of returns reporting an income of $1 million or more
jumped to 142,500 in 1997 from 87,000 two years earlier. These
returns often include income from businesses the taxpayer controls,
capital gains and other sources not subject to the mandatory
reporting systems that apply to the forms of income reported by
most people, like wages, interest on savings and dividends.
</P>
<P>
   But under tight budgets set by Congress the full-time IRS staff
has shrunk to about 82,000 people, down 14 percent from 1995. When
the growing number of tax returns, the increased volume of money
and the 1,260 tax code changes that Congress enacted in 1997 and
1998 are taken into account, Rossotti calculates, the IRS has had
its resources cut nearly 29 percent.

SPORTS COLUMN: BLAME MILLER FOR THE STAR THAT GOT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marvin Miller stood off to the side Tuesday afternoon
in a large room at the All Star Cafe in Times Square. . Moments
earlier, The Sporting News had named its 100 sportsmen of the
century. Pete Rozelle was voted as the most powerful of all. On
hand to honor his memory were the commissioners of the four major
professional team sports: baseball's Bud Selig, football's Paul
Tagliabue, basketball's David Stern and hockey's Gary Bettman. One
by one, they stepped to the podium to reflect on Rozelle, and how
he had distinguished himself in his long run as commissioner of the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the news media circled the four men to talk some more
about Rozelle, and about the hot issues facing each sport. Miller,
the former head of the baseball players union, watched the
give-and-take, not feeling particularly attached to the moment. ``I
feel more like history than anything else,'' he said. ``I don't
have any active role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but his presence was a reminder that the Sporting
News voters got it all wrong. Rozelle was a master at making a game
into something larger than life: the AFL-NFL merger, ``Monday Night
Football,'' NFL Films, NFL Properties. But Rozelle was working for
the owners, using athletes' supple bodies to make the enterprise
larger while keeping the players' share as small as possible,
refusing to even give guaranteed contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miller gave players the atomic bomb of sports: he
gave them free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest proof of Miller's lasting power came late Monday
night with news that Ken Griffey Jr. had broken New York's heart
and rejected a trade that would have sent him from Seattle to the
Mets. The deal was so tantalizing that even Selig admitted being
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, I think it would be great for Ken Griffey
Jr. to be in New York,'' Selig said. ``From the commissioner of
baseball's perspective, yes, if the world were perfect and you
could order players. But you can't. I think it would be great for
baseball, but I want to be protective of his right to be able to
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Griffey would have been a Met. Period. But as
a player with 10 years of experience in the major leagues and the
last five with the same club, Griffey had the right to veto the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the St. Louis Cardinals traded Curt Flood to
the Philadelphia Phillies. Flood balked and, with Miller as his
counsel, went to court seeking the right to become a free agent.
Miller warned Flood that he would probably lose the case; he also
predicted that the suit would initiate a movement that would change
the financial landscape of professional teams. Flood lost, but the
tapestry was changed. A player's talent clearly meant something.
Andy Messersmith picked up the fight following the 1975 season, and
won, challenging baseball's reserve clause and becoming the sport's
first free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty five years later, Miller feels that many of the players
have no idea of where their free-agent rights come from. ``I do
feel a little irked and chagrined when I realize that the players
have no idea that it was the union that changed everything,'' said
Miller, who was the head of the union from 1966 through 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the brightest of the players, a John Olerud, can exalt in
the fact that he's able to pick a team, go back to his roots. But
there's nothing I've read that gives me the faintest idea that he
knows where this came from. What's taken for granted are the
salaries, the perks, free-agency rights, salary arbitration rights,
all of which were tremendous struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller added: ``I would like to see more of these players active
in their own union. I don't like to see them have a board meeting
when 12 teams are not represented. That shows a lack of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Selig spoke of a partnership between Major League
Baseball and its players. ``Everybody has to start to think
league,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller is ever wary. Owners are the relentless foe, the
enemy that never stops being an enemy. In his view, the lack of
restraint that prompts owners to spend $80 million on one player is
the same impulse that won't allow them to stop the assault on
player gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't know your history, you tend to relive it,''
Miller said. ``I don't want to see players have to fight this all
over again. During the period I was active, I would say the latter
half was filled with nothing but attempts by the owners to turn
back the clock. I don't believe they've ever given up.''
</P>
<P>
   And so whenever Junior gets a chance, he should call Miller and
thank him for giving him the option to say no to New York.  &QL;

STILL NO DEAL FOR EDMONDS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels general manager Bill Stoneman
checked out of his hotel room at the Anaheim Marriott on Tuesday
morning and returned to his office at Edison Field, having fallen
short of his goal of trading one of his outfielders for starting
pitching help.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stoneman was quick to point out that there was no
trading deadline at the just-concluded winter meetings. And he is
close to finalizing a deal that would send center fielder Jim
Edmonds to the Oakland A's for three minor-league prospects. The
holdup, according to a source, is the third prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have agreed to take pitcher Brett Laxton and
outfielder Mario Encarnacion. They also want third baseman Adam
Piatt, but the A's so far have been reluctant to part with him.
</P>
<P>
   Piatt, who was named Baseball America's Minor League Player of
the Year this past season, hit .345 with 39 homers and 135 RBI at
Double-A Midland before being promoted to Triple-A Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds passed the day as he has all offseason _ by working out.
His agent, Paul Cohen, continues to monitor the situation and keep
Edmonds posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a few conversations today and it's 90 to 99 percent
done,'' Cohen said. ``But as time goes by, there's more of a risk
(it won't happen). Because a lot of things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stoneman continued to work on other possible trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had conversations with other clubs, even including a
new discussion that wasn't discussed at the meetings,'' he said.
``And fires continue to burn on the old discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Angels' other needs is a second baseman, and they are
in talks with free agent Mickey Morandini, who hit .241 with the
Chicago Cubs last year.

ISRAELI ARMY REPORTS SLAYING OF 2 HAMAS MEMBERS PLANNING BOMB
ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs headline and first 2 grafs to remove references to
`terrorists') 
 (bl) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Two members of the militant Palestinian group Hamas
were killed by Israeli commandos Monday night near Hebron as they
prepared a bomb attack, Israeli army officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza City, Hamas leaders praised the two as martyrs and
accused Israeli forces of deliberately killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli defense officials said the two had been killed after
firing on an undercover surveillance unit that found them in a town
in the West Bank, Beit Awwa. The officials said that both men were
members of the clandestine Hamas military wing and that they ranked
high on Israel's most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   Two explosive devices were seized in the raid, according to Gen.
Yitzhak Eitan, commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank. ``They
were on their way to carry out an attack and were surprised by our
forces,'' said Eitan. ``So their attack was averted.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Beit Awwa said soldiers fired a volley of rockets
at the house after having exchanged fire with the two militants,
who were later found dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   The army unit ``had a good idea who they were'' and hoped to
capture them alive, said Deputy Defense Minister Efrain Sneh on
Tuesday night. ``If terrorists surrender,'' said Sneh, ``they don't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier comments by Sneh were interpreted by Hamas leaders
as confirmation that Israeli forces had intended to kill the two.
``There is an automatic contract on anyone from Hamas who commits
murderous attacks,'' Sneh had said, in response to a state radio
reporter who asked whether the army purposely killed the men.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hamas in Gaza, Ismail Abu Shanab, said, ``Israel
bears full responsibility for this killing, and we say we have the
total right to defend ourselves and to react to this criminal
act.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, Iyad Batat, was said by Israeli authorities to have
been a commander of Hamas guerrilla forces in the Hebron area, and
he was accused of the shooting death of a border police officer
this year. Reporting at the time to a parliamentary committee, Sneh
had predicted that those responsible for the officer's death would
be ``dead within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the radio interview Tuesday, Sneh said, ``I had said that
within a year those attackers would die, and see, it took less than
a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Tuesday night, Sneh hastened to clarify that he had
not meant his statement to imply ``that Israel acts like the mob,''
marking its enemies for execution. Rather, he said, he had meant to
stress that government policy was to pursue anyone responsible for
attacks against Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said then that I can promise you that in one year they will
be killed,'' Sneh said. ``This was not a judicial statement. It was
just a way of saying that we have a very active policy of combating
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officers called the raid a serious blow against Hamas,
already debilitated by the seizures of weapons and explosives in
Palestinian territory and the closing of military planning offices
in Jordan and Syria. Three other accused Hamas militants were
arrested in the sweep at Beit Awwa.

AMR PLANS TO SPIN OFF ITS STAKE IN TRAVEL RESERVATION COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that could touch off investor interest in airline
stocks, the AMR Corp. said Tuesday that it would spin off its 83
percent stake in the Sabre Holdings Corp., the world's largest
travel reservation company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the deal, noting that AMR, the parent of
American Airlines, could better control rising fees that are
associated with booking tickets. Computer reservation companies,
like Sabre, have continually raised their fees, leaving carriers
little room to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right move for AMR,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an
airline analyst with PaineWebber. ``We fully expect airlines to
become more aggressive and innovative in finding ways to reduce
reservation fees. Privately, airline executives have been fuming
over these fee increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the divestiture, valued at $6.2 billion, AMR will distribute
its 107 million Sabre shares to its shareholders. Each AMR
stockholder will receive about 0.7 share of Sabre for each of their
shares. Sabre will also pay $675 million in dividends to its
shareholders, including AMR.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were enthusiastic about the deal. Shares of AMR
increased $4.75, or 7.5 percent, to $68.50. Sabre Holdings rose
$2.875, or 5.5 percent, to $54.75.
</P>
<P>
   With American Airlines shedding Sabre, analysts expected the
carrier to have more leeway in lowering its cost of selling
tickets. Other companies that own stakes in computer reservation
companies _ notably UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and the
Northwest Airlines Corp. _ are also expected to sell their
holdings, which would create more competition in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have been increasingly successful in selling
tickets to customers over the Internet and forcing reductions in
fees from travel agents. But carriers that owned stakes in computer
reservation systems have felt compelled to use the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were hopeful that the spinoff of Sabre, which was
reported Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, would attract more
investors to the airline sector. Many of the stocks have increased
about 10 percent since rising fuel prices pushed them to 52-week
lows in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stocks' recent gains, analysts remain bullish that
the momentum has only just begun. The airline sector is projected
to trade at about seven times 2000 earnings, compared with 25 times
earnings for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole airline sector is undervalued,'' said Candace
Browning, an airline analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``There will be
more short-term negatives. There is going to be a slowdown in
traffic, due to Y2K. Everybody in America is going to stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that AMR's stock was a good value. They
expect the stock to trade at about six times earnings next year,
making it one of the cheapest in the airline sector.
</P>
<P>
   The company has become more focused on its operations. AMR said
on Tuesday that it would use its share of Sabre's $675 million
dividend to invest in its core airline business. Buttrick thinks
that AMR will hit $82 a share by spring, a 19.7 percent gain from
Tuesday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   But even with AMR's projected gain, two other large airline
stocks are expected to outperform it. Delta Air Lines has
diversified, buying a 5 percent stake in Priceline.com, which tries
to offer Internet users the lowest prices on goods and services.
Buttrick said that shares of Delta, which closed Tuesday at
$50.0625, should reach $74 in the spring. That move would give
investors a 47.5 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines is also expected to perform well. The
airline, projected to trade at about eight times 2000 earnings,
should reap more revenue from its North Atlantic routes, where
excess capacity hurt profits this year. Analysts also noted that
Continental had made inroads in the New York market, taking market
share on some routes from its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Buttrick's calculations, Continental Airlines'
stock should reach $52, a 25 percent increase from Tuesday's
closing price of $41.5625 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were divided about the financial prospects of Sabre.
Most agreed that, without its ties to AMR, the company would be
more likely to obtain contracts from other carriers.  &QL;

SAMARANCH'S MESSAGE FOR CONGRESS: `ETHICS COMMISSIONER EQUALS
ENFORCEMENT'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the
International Olympic Committee, felt jittery about testifying
before a House subcommittee on Wednesday, he refused to show it
Tuesday night. In his corner hotel suite in Georgetown, he sat
serenely on a sofa and sounded certain that the reforms enacted
last weekend by the IOC will settle all congressional doubts about
the direction of the embattled organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous,'' he said, flanked by Dick Pound, an IOC vice
president, and Bob Ctvrtlik, an Olympic volleyball player elected
to the IOC last week. ``What do I have to be nervous about? I'm
told there will be very tough questions, and will try to answer
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, a 79-year-old Spaniard, arrived at the hotel with a
small entourage after a meeting about the IOC's new World
Anti-Doping Agency with Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House
drug policy director, who excoriated the committee's anti-doping
efforts earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pleased,'' said Samaranch. ``It was a very good
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and Samaranch released a 17-point agreement, but
McCaffrey said it was nonbinding. There were no groundbreaking
proposals, and the agreement basically reiterated ideas that were
generated from the formation of the IOC's anti-doping agency last
month and a meeting between McCaffrey and Pound, the head of the
IOC agency.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has been elusive quarry for Congress since it began
holding hearings last winter into the scandal over illicit cash and
gifts provided to IOC members by organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake
City Winter Olympics. At two Senate hearings and one in the House,
his absence was noted and scorned, as other IOC members testified
in his place.
</P>
<P>
   His agreement to appear Wednesday came with an assurance that he
would not be subpoenaed as a witness in the ongoing Justice
Department inquiry into the Salt Lake City scandal and negotiations
that eventually led to his agreement to speak to the FBI next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch wanted to testify only after last weekend's IOC
session in Lausanne, where 50 procedural changes were approved.
``Maybe before the sessions, it could have been dangerous,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes include modified term limits for members, a ban on
members' once-cherished, but abused, visits to bid cities and the
election of 15 active athletes to the IOC
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they will not trust,'' he said of the members of the
House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which is headed
by Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. ``But we are
speaking not with words, but with facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch refused to accept the notion that a skeptical Congress
_ and American public _ has placed the IOC on probation until it is
clear that the reforms are tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to trust the members,'' he said. ``We have to trust
the bid cities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pound added: ``We're not on probation. We're embarking on an
exciting new direction. But there are some people who won't be
happy until we sink into the middle of the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch sidestepped the criticism of IOC members that Congress
was too intrusive, in threats to strip the organization of its
nonprofit status in the United States and halt the flow of domestic
television rights fees to its accounts. Lambis W. Nikolaou of
Greece, an IOC member, cautioned Samaranch not to testify. ``You
are only accountable to the Olympic family,'' Nikolaou said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, ever the diplomat, said Tuesday: ``I've said many
times before that the Olympic Games belong to the world. The
president of the IOC is accountable to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Wednesday's hearing, he will be accountable to Upton's
panel. He expects questions about the reforms and about a $12,000
trip that his wife took to Atlanta in 1990 at the expense of that
Olympic organizing committee before it was awarded the 1996 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was invited,'' he said. ``I told her she had to accept the
invitation. These people are friendly, they're nice.'' He said the
trip, including a side trip to the Olympic yachting site in
Savannah, Ga., posed no ethical problem because he ``has nothing to
do with choosing bid cities.''
</P>
<P>
   He rifled through his leather briefcase to find a letter his
wife received after her trip from Vice President Dan Quayle. ``I
hope you were able to sample the warm hospitality for which the
American South is famous,'' Quayle's letter read.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch also sought to clarify confusion about the mandate of
a new eight-member ethics commission. Last weekend, some members
said it would not initiate future investigations of wrongdoing
without a written complaint or that it would not revisit past
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cases that are judged are finished,'' he said. ``But if new
facts come from the past, they will be reopened. If no old facts,
it's done.'' He said credible evidence of wrongdoing _ delivered by
letter or verbally _ would be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Had the commission existed several years ago, would it have
rooted out corruption within the Salt Lake City organizing
committee? After all, the scandal was not disclosed to the IOC
through a letter, a personal visit by a whistleblower or a
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he said. ``I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a message was passed to Samaranch from a press
aide. It read: ``Ethics commissioner equals enforcement.'' It
reminded him that an ethics commissioner, reporting to the
commission, is to be hired to police future violations.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Samaranch folded the note into a paper airplane and
rested it on a coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch will deliver his opening statement in English. He will
try to persuade the House subcommittee that the IOC has delivered
on its promise to reform itself. Then he will answer questions in
Spanish through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can say the Olympics are not up to date,'' he said.
``The structures were not the best ones, and we used this crisis to
change many things, no?'' &QL;

HOUSE PANEL TO QUESTION DEMOCRATIC FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Calif)  (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of investigations, partisan vitriol and
accusations of stonewalling leveled at the Clinton White House,
Republicans in Congress will at last get what they have long
sought, a hearing on Wednesday to publicly question a Democratic
fund-raiser at the epicenter of the 1996 campaign fund-raising
controversy: John Huang.
</P>
<P>
   Protected by a grant of immunity, Huang is scheduled to begin
three days of testimony at the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee led by its Republican chairman, Rep. Dan Burton
of Indiana _ an event that Republicans hope will prove
uncomfortable for President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may be disappointed. In Huang's opening statement, a
copy of which was provided to The New York Times, the former
fund-raiser said he knew of no wrongdoing by either Clinton or
Gore. Huang said he might have escaped ``the terrible ordeal'' had
he implicated them, but, he said: ``I never had a basis upon which
to do so. In fact, I maintain very high regard for each of these
dedicated men.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Huang pleaded guilty to engaging in a conspiracy to
defraud the Federal Election Commission by arranging for employees
of the Lippo Group, an Indonesian-based conglomerate run by the
powerful Riady family, to be reimbursed for contributions in the
1992 and the 1994 elections. He was sentenced to probation and
agreed to cooperate with the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Huang played a significant role in the 1996 campaign. Of the
$2.8 million in improper contributions that the Democrats were
forced to return after the 1996 election, almost 80 percent were
raised by Huang and Yah Lin Trie, both of whom were longtime
friends of Clinton and raised large sums based on their personal
relationships with the president. In 1997, when the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee began its investigation, Huang
refused to testify, invoking his constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, White House officials repeated their frequently
expressed skepticism about the objectivity of Burton's panel and
questioned its impartiality in questioning Huang. Jim Kennedy, a
White House spokesman, said: ``Three things in life are certain.
Death, taxes and partisan hearings chaired by Dan Burton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Huang's testimony _ re-examining the frenzy of Democratic
fund-raising in 1996 _ comes at a time when campaign finance issues
seem to be catching fire in the presidential race and could help
sharpen demands for changes in the country's system of raising
money for federal candidates and parties.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands are already central issues for insurgent
presidential candidates such as Bill Bradley, the former Democratic
senator of New Jersey, and John McCain, the Republican senator from
Arizona. In an unusual step, Bradley and McCain have scheduled a
joint appearance on Thursday in New Hampshire to pledge that if
nominated, they would call on their parties to refuse unrestricted
contributions for party-building activities known as soft money.
Many of the large contributions raised by Huang in 1996 flowed into
the Democratic National Committee in soft-money checks.
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, Huang does not suggest that he will
add important new details to his activities, which have been the
subject of lengthy Senate, House and Justice Department
investigations. Last month, Burton's committee released lengthy
notes taken by FBI agents in their investigation of campaign
finance matters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in his prepared remarks, Huang, who once worked at the
Commerce Department and later at the Democratic National Committee,
portrayed himself as a victim of partisan politics, a rising tide
of anti-Asian sentiment and grossly unfair news accounts, including
reports of lawmakers who falsely accused him of economic espionage.
``People seeking publicity have lied about me repeatedly in the
press and even before this committee without consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted that he had made mistakes. ``Embarrassed and
saddened though I am by the unfortunate attention my conduct and
notoriety brought upon my community, the dated and isolated
offenses, which I have openly acknowledged, will not deter me from
my careerlong efforts to promote understanding between the citizens
of the United States and those of China, Taiwan and the rest of
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CAN HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Investigations have found that Huang first met Clinton in the
1980s, through a mutual friend, James Riady, the head of the Lippo
Group. By 1992, when Huang was employed by Lippo Bank in
California, he began to raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's election, Huang used his contacts to get a job
at the Commerce Department. In 1995, as the president's re-election
campaign began, Huang left Commerce to begin fund-raising for the
Democrats, although some party officials had reservations from the
start about whether Huang might be raising money from contributors
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1996, Huang organized fund-raising events, some
attended by foreign contributors and Clinton. Huang and another
fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, organized one such event on April 29,
1997, at the Hsi Lai temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., that was
attended by Gore, whose shifting statements about his knowledge of
the purpose of the event dogged the vice president for many months.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Despite booming retail sales and strong consumer demand, the
Consumer Price Index barely rose in November, the Labor Department
reported Tuesday. Even gasoline prices did not make their usual
contribution to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Prices rose in a few scattered areas _ like long-distance
telephone tolls, airline fares, prescription drugs and housing
costs _ but the index, reflecting a great variety of goods and
services, was up only 0.1 percent, the smallest increase since
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much competition and too much deregulation, and
as a result companies are finding it virtually impossible to raise
prices,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown, offering an explanation why rising inflation, widely
expected on Wall Street, fails month after month to show itself in
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The weak November inflation number should have sent stock prices
soaring, with its suggestion that the Federal Reserve's
policy-makers will refrain from raising interest rates when they
meet next week. Stable prices and interest rates encourage
investors to remain in stocks rather than shift to interest-bearing
securities.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of focusing on the bland inflation data, investors
responded to two other government reports that reflected the
economy's strength and for that reason seemed to portend higher
interest rates, if not next week then soon enough. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 32.42, to 11,160.17, and interest rates on
Treasury securities rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department, in one report, said retail sales jumped
by a robust 0.9 percent, a result of holiday spending and a surge
in auto purchases in a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the second report, the nation's current-account deficit, a
measure of what Americans owe to foreign lenders, rose in the third
quarter to $89.95 billion, up 11.2 percent from the second quarter.
Higher interest rates, in Wall Street's view, would cut into these
trends by raising the cost of credit. Spending would slow not only
for domestic goods but also for imports, the main reason for the
rising foreign debt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Yardeni attributed the mild inflation numbers to
competition and deregulation _ of the telecommunications industry
in the mid-1990s and banks and financial services companies this
fall _ others said the stock market might be playing a dual and
somewhat contradictory role.
</P>
<P>
   Rising stock prices encourage spending and demand, trends that
could in time produce inflationary shortages. But notoriously
unprofitable Internet companies are using money raised from
investors to subsidize discount pricing. Amazon.com, for instance,
floats shares in a rising market, and the money it raises covers
huge annual losses. Meanwhile, the company maintains its discount
pricing. And the discounts, in turn, keep prices down in
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar is happening in other industries, says Sung
Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ``Many
people check toy prices on the Internet and ask toy stores to match
them,'' he said. ``Or they see the merchandise at a store and go
home and buy it for less on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices would have fed into the inflation rate,
producing a higher price index, if the Bureau of Labor Statistics
had continued its price surveys for another week instead of ending
them Nov. 22. The bureau followed its usual practice of shortening
the surveys to three weeks from four in November and December, to
interfere as little as possible with holiday shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices dipped in late October, and ``there was not
enough of a rebound by the time we had finished our pricing,'' said
Patrick Jackman, a senior economist in the office that handles the
price index. The December report is likely to reflect the rebound,
perhaps adding as much as one-tenth of a point.
</P>
<P>
   With energy excluded from the November report, the price index
rose only 0.2 percent. That was also the case when both food and
energy prices were excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Economists focus on this restricted figure because they consider
energy and food prices volatile _ subject to sharp fluctuations
that can distort the overall ndex. With those exclusions, the index
increased 2.1 percent for the 12 months ending last month. By this
measure, the annual inflation rate has fallen from 2.4 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The overall index is another matter, rising 2.6 percent over the
last 12 months, a full percentage point more than the annual rate
as of last December. Rising petroleum prices accounted for all of
the increase, particularly as it shows up in gasoline, aircraft
fuel and heating oil. Elsewhere, petroleum has not affected the
prices of other products yet, although it is a major building block
for plastics used in toys and many other products.
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers and others who use plastics may simply be absorbing
the higher cost, at the expense of profits, or offsetting the cost
through greater productivity _ in effect getting more production
from employees for the same wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Productivity would have to rise at an accelerating rate to
maintain this balance, and that is questionable,'' said Richard D.
Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong sales last month, the prices of new vehicles were
unchanged, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and over the last 12
months they fell 0.3 percent. Apparel costs fell in November,
reflecting discounting that usually precedes Christmas. But rents
and the cost of owning a home rose _ each by a strong 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of demand for housing,'' Jackman said, ``and
that is affecting monthly costs.''

CITY, TRANSIT WORKERS REACH TENTATIVE DEAL, APPARENTLY AVERTING
STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for updated top and general rewrite) 
 (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's transit workers and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority agreed on the outlines of a tentative deal
Tuesday night, a union spokeswoman said, apparently averting a
strike that was threatened for Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m. Tuesday, Carlean Williams, a spokeswoman for Local 100
of the Transport Workers Union, said that Willie James, the union's
president, had just reached an agreement that would cover the
city's 33,000 subway and bus workers. But union officials said a
few final details were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams said she did not immediately have details of the
tentative agreement because James had not yet presented the
agreement to the union's board and staff.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two sides were moving closer to an agreement on
Tuesday, city officials warned of the possibility of disruptions
Wednesday from wildcat actions by disgruntled transit workers..
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials said Tuesday night that the MTA and
union sides were close to a deal, but it was not quite clinched.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, said the
governor was heading from Albany to his New York City office to do
what he could to help resolve any loose ends in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement came on a day when James was under
intense pressure from a large dissident faction to take a tough
stance and from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to avoid a strike. The two
sides reached the tentative deal on a day when a state judge issued
two orders threatening the union with draconian fines if it went on
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that leaders of the transit workers' union had
provided assurances that the union would not shut down New York
City's transit system Wednesday morning, although just hours before
the agreement was reached, city officials were preparing for
possible rush hour chaos because of wildcat work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the tentative deal was announced, an official
close to the negotiations said that the two sides had considerably
narrowed their differences. This official said that the union had
reduced its wage demands to 5 percent a year over three years, down
from its previous demand for 9 percent a year. The MTA, this
official said, had raised its offer to 13 percent over four years,
up from its previous offer of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, James and other leaders in Local 100 of the Transport
Workers Union had threatened a strike if they did not reach an
agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority by 12:01
Wednesday morning, when the contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   James sent a letter to all members Tuesday warning that the huge
fines that could be imposed from defying the judge's orders ``will
quickly bankrupt the union, making it unable to function on your
behalf.'' But the letter stopped short of saying that he would not
call for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference, Giuliani said the letter made
clear that the union's leaders opposed a walkout, which would be
illegal under New York state's Taylor Law, which bars strikes by
transit workers and other public-sector employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani added that there was still a small chance that a
large dissident faction in the union could muster the votes to
authorize a strike, a move that could paralyze the city and create
havoc for 3.5 million people who use the mass transit system each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tentative deal was announced, Giuliani said that some
parts of a contingency plan to speed transportation into Manhattan
would go into effect Wednesday morning, and that the full plan,
which would restrict motor vehicle access, would be ready if
needed. The city has spent $3 million preparing for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of attacking the union, Giuliani escalated his
efforts Tuesday to pressure it not to strike. He had the city's
lawyers go to a judge's house shortly before 7 a.m. to obtain a
restraining order that calls for fining the union $1 million for
the first day of a strike, and $2 million for the second day,
doubling each successive day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, union members, whose wages average $39,000 a year,
could face fines of $25,000 on the first day of a strike, with the
fine doubling on successive days.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said, ``We sought an amount of money that would
immediately make it financially impossible for anyone to engage in
this activity.''

JAMES PARKES, 64, PHYSICIAN WHO TREATED SPORTS STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. James C. Parkes II, the orthopedic surgeon who
mended Willis Reed's strained thigh well enough for the New York
Knicks to win the 1970 National Basketball Association
championship, died Dec. 13 in his Manhattan home. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   His two daughters said he had been suffering from a progressive
neurological illness.
</P>
<P>
   Parkes was the team physician for the New York Mets from 1974 to
1991 and the Knicks for the second half of the 1969-70 season. In
1970, Reed injured his thigh during the NBA playoff finals against
the Los Angeles Lakers and it was obvious the Knicks could not win
without their center and captain. As Parkes recalled in a New York
Times interview in 1980:
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that the only way to help this man was to establish
confidence. So I flew to L.A. and even sat on the bench. Every time
he came out, I'd ask how he felt and reminded him that no harm
could come to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the plane going back to New York for the deciding game,
Willis came to me and said: `Doc, you've got to get me out there.
This is the pinnacle of my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the series tied at three games each, the deciding game was
played in New York's Madison Square Garden. When the teams warmed
up, Reed was in the locker room, still getting treatment. The crowd
was hushed, not knowing if Reed could play. His teammates did not
know, either.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds before the game began, the crowd erupted as Reed limped
onto the court, Parkes at his side. Reed started and made the first
two shots of the game, and though he played little after that, his
presence lifted the Knicks and demoralized a Lakers team with the
future Hall of Fame players Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and
Jerry West. When the Knicks won, Reed threw his arms around Parkes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the guy who got me out there, a very good man,'' Reed
said Tuesday. ``But I almost missed the start of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As Reed, now an executive with the New Jersey Nets, recalled,
Parkes told Knicks coach Red Holzman that he would give Reed a
painkilling injection just before the game. ``Red asked him how
long the injection would take,'' Reed said. ``The doctor told him
and said I would be ready, but it took longer than that. When the
injection was done, we walked out and found that somehow the tipoff
had been delayed until I got there.''
</P>
<P>
   James Creighton Parkes II was born March 2, 1935, in Red Bank,
N.J. He graduated with honors from Dartmouth in 1957 and Harvard
Medical School in 1961. He later became an associate professor of
orthopedic surgery at Columbia, president of the Major League
Baseball Physicians Association and a consultant to the U.S. Tennis
Association, treating such players as John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg
during the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 36 years, the former Margaret
Barrera; his daughters, Susan Cirignano of Far Hills, N.J., and
Jacqueline Hendrix of Westfield, N.J., and five grandchildren. &QL;

DISNEY INTERNET STOCK OFF IN FIRST FOUR WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK _ Where in the world is Go.com going?
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co.'s new tracking stock for its Internet assets has
been a major flop so far, losing 37 percent of its value since its
creation four weeks ago. It began trading at $37.675 on Nov. 18 but
closed Tuesday at $23.625, declining 62.5 cents to its lowest close
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is 72 percent owned by Disney, has seen its
stock slide amid a red-hot market for many rival Internet issues.
But the company has not issued any negative announcements recently
and some media analysts believe the decline reflects a variety of
factors including continuing skepticism over Disney's management
and online plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is being driven down because Wall Street does not
have a clear understanding of what Disney's strategy is for
Go.com,'' said media analyst Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King
Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the sell-off reflects mostly year-end profit-taking
along with the tendency of investors to downgrade Internet assets
of large companies that are not solely focused on the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what Go.com is suffering from is the market perception
that views media conglomerates like Disney as being too slow-moving
to compete,'' said Katherine Styponias of Prudential Securities.
``I don't think that's the case; it's just the market perception.
There has not been any specific news item that would make it trade
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co. noted that many Internet
stocks have run-ups during the first couple of days they trade
before investors have completely analyzed the company. ``It's also
likely that some people that owned it have started taking
profits,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney created the stock following the merger of
its Buena Vista Internet Group _ including Family.com, Mr. Showbiz,
NFL.com and NBA.com and sites related to ABC, ESPN and theme parks
_ with Infoseek Corp., one of the Web's leading search engines. The
publicly held Go.com shares were distributed to Infoseek
stockholders as part of Disney's $2 billion buyout of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   Media analyst Christopher Dixon of PaineWebber, who issued a
``buy'' rating with a $48 price target last month, said it's
probable that many of the shares are being sold by money managers
and investors to adjust portfolios prior to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm disappointed about the price,'' said Dixon, but
he stressed that the fundamentals of Go.com are ``very strong'' as
the Internet evolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable for its prospects as the Internet moves
from low-speed delivery at 28.6 kilobauds per second to full
broadband,'' Dixon said. ``The validity of these long-term
strategies will be correct. One of the best ways to take advantage
of those changes is through major entertainment companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Styponias said it's difficult to evaluate the success of Go.com
at this point. ``Disney is using something like its TV broadcast
model, where they're looking to capture as many eyeballs as
possible and funnel them to as many sites as they can,'' she said.
``Will it win out? It's hard to say but it's important that they
play in the space.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Joseph Butt Jr. of Forrester Research believes the idea
of a ``portal'' no longer makes sense due to its costs and
increased sophistication of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``My issue has been that they have strongly branded properties,
so they should take Go and subsume it to those brands,'' Butt said.
``If they want to keep it, they could make it an internal
directory. But the best thing would be to let it go gently into the
good night.''

IT'S NOT THE PRODUCT THAT'S DIFFERENT, IT'S THE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   This column about management issues appears every other week. Fred
Andrews' e-mail address is frandre(AT)nytimes.com.

 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marshall McLuhan wrote 35 years ago that the  &UR; medium is the
message, &LR;  a puzzling perception that turned out to be profound.
Today, a great many business thinkers, in one way or another, seem
to be saying something similar: In the new economy,  &UR; the process is
the product. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Set aside the electronic gadgetry. Are the other things we buy _
the cars we drive, the shoes we wear, the trips we take _ all that
different from what they were when the other George Bush was
president?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. The shirts and skirts and jackets we wear today are
pretty much the same as the ones that hung in our closet a decade
ago. But the ways they are produced _ all the steps from textile
plant to doorstep delivery _ have been overhauled, in a forced
infusion of information technology. In the 1990s, the apparel
industry saved its skin by bringing off a process revolution all
but invisible to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Something similarly invisible is taking shape now with the
Internet. Who could possibly escape the squall of dot-com retailing
this season? But largely out of sight, the Internet is also
devising the institutions that will enable businesses to deal with
one another in radically different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America seems to have concluded that the train _ the
Internet Express _ is leaving the station. The foundations of a new
business order are being laid right now. And unless companies
respond in kind, they will wither like towns on the Great Plains
that failed to attract the early rail lines.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Roscitt, the new president of AT&AMP;T's huge Business
Services arm, made his reputation building complex Internet-based
networks for corporate giants. He thought he saw the makings of a
business revolution in the Internet several years ago, but he is
astounded at how quickly it came. ``You would have to have had a
crystal ball,'' he marveled in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The commanding heights of business have come alive to the power
of networking as a pervasive way of doing business, Roscitt said.
Established giants are shifting critical functions to the Internet,
at least to their roped-off corner of it. Merrill Lynch has
embraced online trading, Citibank sends trillions of dollars a day
across the Net. The Internet is pumping ``the lifeblood of the
organization,'' Roscitt said. ``The stakes are much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The chronic weakness among automakers has been a development
process that moves at a turtle's pace. Now AT&AMP;T is building an
Internet network for General Motors that will enable GM to bring
cars to market more quickly. The five-year, $350 million project
will link GM design centers, factory floors and dealerships the
world over and allow them to perform continuously as though they
were side by side.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blown to Bits'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1999),
Philip Evans and Thomas S. Wurster, partners at the Boston
Consulting Group, argue that communication via the Internet has
become so cheap and so powerful _ and still no end in sight _ that
it will shatter today's business order. They predict it will force
every business in America to pick apart the processes that lie
behind its products and consider putting the chain back together in
novel ways.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been costly to convey thorough, reliable, timely,
rich information. That reality protected those who could afford to
play. On the Internet, the cost will all but dry up. And once pure
information is cut loose from the expensive physical means of
delivering it, whether a printing plant and a fleet of trucks or a
dedicated network of mainframe computers, the value of all those
old arrangements comes into question.
</P>
<P>
   In the new economy, information will substitute for goods.
Branch Rickey once remarked that luck was the residue of design.
Evans and Wurster write that ``inventory is merely the physical
correlate of deficient information.'' Not nearly as epigrammatic,but it is a powerful thought: The more known about what customers
want, the less the need to tie up money in expensive (and
perishable) stock. The process replaces the product.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly that notion about inventory drove the remaking of the
American garment trade. Apparel makers, under searing pressure from
retailers like Wal-Mart, used computer links and the sharing of
sales and production data to create a discipline of speedy
response. They successfully met the simultaneous demands of ``lean
retailing'' for both lower inventories and a much greater variety
of goods, at lower prices and in smaller, more frequent deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how information technology enabled the American
garment industry to triumph over low-cost competition overseas is
told in ``A Stitch in Time'' (Oxford University Press, 1999) by
Frederick H. Abernathy, John T. Dunlop, Janice H. Hammond and David
Weil.
</P>
<P>
   Laser technology permitted the key innovation: the bar code,
which tracks demand at the cash register and the status of goods at
every earlier stage. That system in turn required computers and
software to monitor thousands of prices and millions of items.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry also had to abandon old thinking and invent a
new way for handling goods, the bustling hub known as the modern
distribution center. ``A distribution center,'' the authors of ``A
Stitch in Time'' remark dryly, ``is the antithesis of a
warehouse.'' Goods sit in a warehouse; they speed through a
distribution center on conveyor belts, racing from supply trucks at
inbound bays to delivery trucks at outbound.
</P>
<P>
   And yet nothing would flow until everything fit. The industry
had to hammer out common standards at every juncture, from the
bar-coding itself to labels on shipping cartons to uniform price
tags and garment hangers.
</P>
<P>
   That history came before the Internet, but the pattern is
instructive. The new order will require not only lasers and
computers but also, like lean retailing, fresh thinking about old
processes and new arrangements of bricks and mortar. The apparel
rebirth relied on expensive computer systems tying giant retailers
more tightly to selected suppliers. By contrast, the Internet will
be open and cheap, accessible to a host of new and smaller
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Uniform standards, essential in every era, now define the day.
The Internet itself consists of agreements to communicate in a
certain way. New protocols are being added industry by industry.
With every added layer, the Internet connects new realms and
thousands of new participants. Evans and Wurster of Boston
Consulting say that in many ways this standard setting is more
profound than the dazzling technology. Roscitt of AT&AMP;T says it is
the only way to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet protocol is what everyone's going to jump on,''
Roscitt said. ``No one in their right mind would build anything not
based on that.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   History beckons in Washington on Wednesday, as Israel and Syria
open peace talks that could bring an end to an era of conflict in
the Middle East. The Israelis and Syrians appear eager to resolve
their differences quickly, and they will have the assistance of
President Clinton in trying to do so. The major issues facing the
lead negotiators, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk Shara, involve control of the Golan
Heights, the restoration of peace in Lebanon and the safeguarding
of Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the narrow margin of approval Israel's Parliament gave
Barak's negotiating plans Monday, the moment is promising for a
settlement with Syria and the Israeli leader should be bold in
seizing it. Peace with Syria and Lebanon would mean that for the
first time since its creation in 1948, Israel would no longer face
armed hostility from any of its immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli governments have tried to negotiate with Syria before,
without success. This time chances seem good that a deal can be
worked out in which Israel would return most of the Golan Heights
in exchange for a Syrian commitment to peace, recognition and
normal trade.
</P>
<P>
   The talks will probably move quickly to the details of defining
Israeli withdrawal lines in the Golan and establishing safe
conditions for Israel's promised troop withdrawal from Lebanon.
Before Israel took control of the Golan's strategic high ground in
1967, Syria used it to launch attacks on Israeli civilians below
and to threaten vital water supplies. The Golan also provides a
vantage point overlooking military traffic from Damascus to the
border, giving Israel time to mobilize in the event of Syrian
attack. New ways will have to be found to provide Israel with the
information it now gets from monitoring stations atop the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   One plausible proposal would place international or U.S.
observers at the Golan monitoring stations now manned by Israelis,
with Israel retaining access to information directly affecting its
security. There might also be agreement to demilitarize a swatch of
territory on either side of the newly established border.
</P>
<P>
   The issues concerning Lebanon are in particularly urgent need of
resolution because of Barak's promise to withdraw Israeli forces
from that country by next July. Even if Syria agrees to rein in
Lebanese Hezbollah fighters from launching new attacks against
Israel, Damascus may not be able to guarantee that Hezbollah's
Iranian sponsors will show equal restraint. Yet it is hard to
imagine a Golan solution that does not include Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Israeli parliamentary vote is significant, since Barak
has promised that any deal he reaches with Syria will be submitted
to Israeli voters in a referendum. But if Syria is reasonable about
addressing Israeli security needs, a peace agreement can still win
broad public support. It is now up to Barak and Syrian President
Hafez Assad to produce such a deal.

JURY REJECTS DANISH MOTHER'S CLAIM OF FALSE ARREST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a case that set off a trans-Atlantic debate about
child-rearing practices, a federal jury in Manhattan rejected a
Danish woman's claim Tuesday that New York City police officers had
falsely arrested her outside an East Village restaurant after she
left her baby daughter in a stroller on the sidewalk to go inside
for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member panel, however, did award the woman, Anette
Sorensen, a total of $66,400 in compensatory and punitive damages
for events after her arrest, including what the jury called the
``widespread practice'' by the police of failing to advise
foreigners who are arrested in New York of their right to
assistance from their consulate.
</P>
<P>
   But the repudiation of the false arrest claim made by Ms.
Sorensen, who contended that in Denmark parents often leave their
babies in strollers on the sidewalk, was seen as clear vindication
by the city and the police officers who had arrested her that night
in May 1997 and who were named in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Gregory O. Ajose, one of those officers, said: ``It shows
that police officers can act in good faith and not fear that their
actions will be misunderstood and they'll be held to a standard
that's unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acted in good faith that evening,'' he went on, ``to try to
protect the life and interests of a 14-month-old child, and to be
dragged through this lawsuit was pretty sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. Sorensen's lawyer, Michael Q. Carey, denounced
the verdict as possibly the result of ``jury nullification'' _ when
a jury ignores the evidence before it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been a cultural question,'' he said, adding, ``A
little xenophobia was at play here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen, who weathered a blistering cross-examination in
the trial that raised questions about whether she had been drunk
and ignored her child's welfare that night, said afterward: ``I
have to lean up against the truth. That's what I've done all the
way along. The truth hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the six members of the jury would discuss the verdict.
The forewoman, who did not give her name, said only that the jurors
focused on the facts and saw the case as a serious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that makes it here is frivolous,'' she said as she
left U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reaching its verdict, the jury also rejected a false arrest
claim by the baby's father, Exavier Wardlaw, 52, who lived in
Brooklyn and was with Ms. Sorensen that night at the restaurant, a
Dallas BBQ at Second Avenue near St. Marks Place.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that although both Wardlaw and Ms. Sorensen, 32,
had been strip-searched by the police, they were each entitled only
to nominal damages of $1.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen was awarded $6,400 in compensatory damages for the
failure of the police to advise her of her right to have the Danish
Consulate notified. Her lawyer, Carey, had offered evidence that
the police failed in tens of thousands of cases a year to provide
such information.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant corporation counsel, Patricia Miller, said that the
city would seek to overturn the $60,000 in punitive damages awarded
in the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the law is very clear that punitive damages may not be
awarded against the city,'' she said, ``and I suspect that that
particular amount will be set aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Wardlaw, whose total award was $1, left the courtroom fuming.
``What's wrong with New York City?'' he asked. ``Where is humanity
of the people?
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Danish customs had resonated throughout the trial,
which was attended by many Danish television and newspaper
journalists. In court, Ms. Sorensen testified that she had always
been able to see Liv, who was bundled in blankets in the stroller,
through a window in the restaurant, but that she had gone inside
herself because it was chilly.

MRS. CLINTON MEETS WITH JEWISH GROUP TO DEFLECT CRITICISM ON ISRAEL
TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to ease strains with some Jewish groups,
Hillary Rodham Clinton met privately with Orthodox Jewish leaders
for more than an hour Tuesday, as she sought to deflect criticism
of her November visit to Israel while signaling her agreement on a
number of issues raised by the group, including opposition to
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to express my deep commitment for the security and
well-being of Israel,'' the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate
told reporters after the meeting at the downtown headquarters of
the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. ``I was able
to discuss the role that I believe the United States should rightly
play in supporting Israel as it takes risks for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Mrs. Clinton used the meeting to recount, if
in unusually great detail, what have become familiar views on
U.S.-Israeli relations and other issues of concern to the group.
</P>
<P>
   However, in one emotional moment, Mrs. Clinton assured Stephen
Flatow, whose daughter was killed in a terrorist attack in the Gaza
Strip in 1995, that she supported his efforts to collect a $247.5
million in damages he won in a suit against Iran. A U.S. District
Court made the award under the 1996 Antiterrorism Act after finding
that Iran had promoted the terrorist group that claimed
responsibility for the blast that killed his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts by Flatow, who was one of 100 people who attended
the lunch with Mrs. Clinton, to collect by seizing diplomatic
property owned by the Iranian government in the United States have
been strongly opposed by the State Department, which has argued
that diplomatic property is sacrosanct. Mrs. Clinton used the
meeting to signal her disagreement with the State Department's
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the State Department would negotiate with
you in good faith and there could be some way of resolving this
that would stay true to the principle that you pursued and the
meaning of the legislation that was signed,'' Mrs. Clinton said,
according to notes taken by someone who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also signaled that she supported the groups'
attempt to curb physician-assisted suicide, though she stopped
short of endorsing legislation in Congress, supported by the
Orthodox Union, that would outlaw it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's meeting with the group came at a time of growing
concern among her advisers about her standing among Jewish voters,
a critical group in her expected campaign against Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. Giuliani has always had strong relationships with Jewish
leaders in New York, particularly the more religious and
politically conservative leaders who made up the bulk of Mrs.
Clinton's audience Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was accompanied to the meeting by Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., an Orthodox Jew who is a member of the board of
directors of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting view of the two candidates became clear after
Orthodox Union president Mandell Ganchrow was asked, after a
question-and-answer session with the first lady, if he viewed Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani as friends of the Jewish community. ``Mayor
Giuliani has been a friend,'' Ganchrow said. ``Mrs. Clinton has
been a friend in her circles. We do not know her as well, because
she has not run for office. And that was the purpose of this
meeting, to really find out where she stands on some of these
issues. Some of these issues we agree with, some we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has been criticized by this group, and others in
New York, for sitting silently as the wife of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat used a public awards ceremony to suggest that Israel
had been poisoning Palestinian children with toxic gases.

PATRICK BEDFORD, ACTOR, DIES AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Patrick Bedford, who performed in many Broadway shows
and played opposite Sandy Dennis in the 1967 film ``Up the Down
Staircase,'' died on Nov. 20 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Patricia O'Haire, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford, who was born in Dublin, had lived and worked in New
York for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   He first came to the United States in 1966 and quickly won a
role in Brian Friel's play ``Philadelphia, Here I Come!,'' for
which he received a Tony nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He starred with Ms. Dennis in the 1967 movie version of Bel
Kaufman's novel ``Up the Down Staircase,'' in which he played an
English teacher in a troubled high school in a large city.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford's 30-year career spanned two continents and several
theater companies, including the Hilton Edwards/Micheal MacLiammoir
Dublin Gate Theater, where he performed in the works of Chekhov,
Shaw and Shakespeare early in his career; he also directed
occasionally. He was involved in more than 200 productions.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other notable roles were Nym in the film ``Chimes at
Midnight,'' Orson Welles' adaptation of several Shakespeare plays,
which was shown at the 1966 Cannes International Film Festival and
released theatrically in 1967 under the title ``Falstaff.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two brothers, John and Frederick, and two
sisters, Alice McGuinness and Cora Kelly, all of Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Venable Herndon, a playwright and screenwriter who
taught dramatic writing at New York University's Tisch School of
the Arts, died on Dec. 8 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He
was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was acute leukemia, said Louise Bernikow, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known screenplay was his 1969 collaboration with the
director Arthur Penn on ``Alice's Restaurant,'' a film inspired by
the hit recording by Arlo Guthrie and starring Guthrie. His plays
included ``Until the Monkey Comes,'' which was produced Off
Broadway in 1966 and revived earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Herndon was also the author of a book, ``James Dean: A Short
Life'' (1974), and was the founding editor of the literary journal
Chelsea Review in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia on Oct. 19, 1927, Herndon graduated from
Princeton in 1949 with a degree in French literature and received a
master's degree in comparative literature from Harvard in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   From 1951 to 1966, he worked in advertising with clients
including Gimbel's and Beefeater gin.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the faculty at New York University in 1975, becoming
an associate professor in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Sharon Anson, and a daughter,
Isabelle Molinaro of Manhattan.

MANHATTAN HOTELS EXPECT THIS NEW YEAR'S EVE TO SET RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some cities have scaled back their expectations for
New Year's now that they have no illusions that holiday visitors
will have to camp outside overflowing hotels. In Manhattan, rooms
are available at many hotels for New Year's, and events like the
star-studded $1,000-a-person Celebration 2000 party at Jacob Javits
Convention Center have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Manhattan's hotel industry remains on track for a
record New Year's holiday. About 85 percent of Manhattan hotels
will be completely sold out during the holiday, compared with 70
percent occupancy for a typical New Year's Eve, according to a Dec.
6 estimate by the PricewaterhouseCoopers hospitality and leisure
consulting practice. And revenues from room rates and the New
Year's Eve packages wrapped around them will average 21 percent
more than usual for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   New York room rates are already the highest in the nation,
averaging $178.60 a night this year, well above the runner-up, San
Francisco, where the average is $135.01 a night. Yet to judge from
the occupancy rates and waiting lists at many hotels, many visitors
who descend on New York to usher in 2000 are untroubled at having
to add a hefty premium for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Hefty but apparently not extortionate, since few New York hotels
are charging more for rooms than the posted price, or rack rate,
according to Sean Hennessey, director of the PricewaterhouseCoopers
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, hardly any hotels are charging less than the
posted rate, which, throughout the hotel industry, seldom bears
more relationship to reality than the sticker price on new cars.
And almost 90 percent of the city's hotels require a three- or
four-day stay over New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But a sizable number of Manhattan hotels that put together
expensive packages for the New Year have not sold out, Hennessey
said. While some of them have recently lowered the price of their
packages, ``the difficulty now,'' he said, ``is finding time to get
the word out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rather than end up with even a single empty room on New Year's
Eve, many of those hotels have recently discounted those rooms
heavily. Last week, for example, Central Park Inter-Continental New
York listed its available rooms with Priceline.com, dropping its
posted $389 daily rate to $250.
</P>
<P>
   For $550 a night based on a two-night minimum stay, some rooms
are still available in the Crowne Plaza in Times Square; for an
additional $550 per person, the hotel's Samplings restaurant on the
second floor offers a six-course meal with champagne, as well as a
ringside seat of the ball descending from atop the building at 1
Times Square. Hotel Reservations Network and other consolidators,
which buy blocks of rooms in many cities and sell them at discount,
still have some rooms available in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the Inter-Continental at 48th Street and Lexington Avenue,
which is charging $449 a night for a two-night minimum, is
virtually sold out. So is the 1,946-room Marriott Marquis Hotel,
despite charging $2,000 for a four-night stay.
</P>
<P>
   More foreign guests than usual for this time of year are booked
at the Marquis, in the heart of Times Square, which this year,
according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, will be
the site of the biggest party in the square's 95-year history.

EDITORIAL: JUSTLY HARSH PUNISHMENT FOR VOLPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Short of murder, it is hard to imagine a crime more vicious than
the torture Justin Volpe inflicted on Abner Louima. The corrosive
effect of Volpe's crimes on trust between New York City police and
many communities may take years to mend. The suffering he caused
Louima and his family cannot be fully measured. The 30-year
sentence imposed by Federal District Judge Eugene Nickerson will
not heal those wounds, but it sends a strong message to law
enforcement officers that police brutality will face severe
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Volpe admitted to violating Louima's civil rights by
sexually assaulting him with a stick in a Brooklyn precinct station
bathroom. Nickerson's decision to sentence him to 30 years, though
less than the life sentence recommended by the federal probation
department, seems a sound application of the complex federal
sentencing guidelines. It has been accepted by the federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The offense level of Volpe's crime, as calculated by probation
officers under federal sentencing rules, was high enough to warrant
a life sentence. That was based, in part, on the crime involved,
the brutality and sexual nature of the attack, the fact that Volpe
was a police officer and that Louima was under arrest and
handcuffed at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Nickerson removed from consideration an
obstruction-of-justice element, which was based on Volpe's threat
to kill Louima shortly after the attack. The judge ruled that
obstruction could be counted as an aggravating factor in sentencing
only if the obstruction took place during the investigation or
prosecution of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The judge further reduced the offense level, and therefore the
sentence imposed, because Volpe is likely to be held in harsh,
segregated prison conditions to protect him from abuse by other
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Three other officers, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder, will face a second trial next month for allegedly
conspiring to obstruct justice in attempting to cover up Schwarz's
role in the assault. Schwarz, who was convicted in June of
violating Louima's civil rights, plans to appeal because Volpe has
belatedly said that Schwarz was not in the bathroom during the
assault. These questions will be played out in further court
actions. The Volpe sentencing does not end the case, but does show
that a measure of justice has been achieved.

HULL, KYL, MC CAIN DECRY MONUMENTS `BY DECREE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Gov. Jane Hull and members of Arizona's
congressional delegation are blasting proposals to create two
national monuments in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But their objections may be too late.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hinted Tuesday, Dec. 14, that he likely will
sign an executive order soon that would protect 1 million acres
northwest of the Grand Canyon and 70,000 acres north of Phoenix
from uranium mining and urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving these lands national-monument status would ensure they
would be passed along to future generations, healthy and whole,''
Clinton told a gathering of environmental leaders in the Roosevelt
Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was significant. The room is named for President
Theodore Roosevelt, who pushed through Congress the 1906
Antiquities Act, which gives the president the power to declare
national monuments to protect any land that has historic,
scientific or archaeological significance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described the proposed Grand Canyon-Parashant National
Monument _ nearly the size of the adjacent 1.1-million-acre Grand
Canyon National Park _ a place of ``stunning canyons and lonely
buttes, shaped by the hand of God over millions of years.''
</P>
<P>
   And the president called the proposed Agua Fria National
Monument - in the rolling hills east of Interstate 17 between Black
Canyon City and Cordes Junction - ``a desert region in the shadow
of rapidly expanding Phoenix.'' &QL; 
In an exclusive interview Sunday, Dec. 12, with The Arizona
Republic, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said that Clinton likely
would act on his recommendation to create the two Arizona
monuments, and two others in California, within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dec. 13, Hull called a press conference to denounce
Babbitt's proposal, saying that the plan bypasses the involvement
of Arizonans and could harm the state's economy by reducing the
amount of productive land in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Dec. 13, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he is writing
a letter urging Clinton not to go forward with the proposal, saying
it amounts to ``government by decree.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was voicing support for Babbitt's recommendation,
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. and a leading GOP candidate for president
in 2000, suggested that Babbitt is breaking his pledge of
``cooperation and commitment'' to work with Congress and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``His recent statement indicates that he is deliberately taking
into his own hands a decision that should be made by the state and
the Congress, with support of the Arizona people,'' McCain said. &QL;

JOCK ELLIOTT JR., THE MAN WHO COLLECTED CHRISTMAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a man obsessed with Christmas. Jock Elliott
Jr., 79, retired chairman of the advertising firm of Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather, has been collecting Christmas books and mementos for more
than 40 years. He now has 3,000 objects, most of them the first of
something: the first printed picture of Santa descending a chimney,
from The New-York Mirror in 1841; the first Christmas card, from
1843; the book in which the words ``Merry'' and ``Christmas'' first
appeared together, in ``An Itinerary,'' a travel book by Fynes
Moryson Gent, in 1617.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Elliott keeps them all in his country house in Cross
River, N.Y., but now other fans of Christmas can see about 150 of
his objects, through Jan. 29, at the Grolier Club, a club for book
collectors, at 47 East 60th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But why the obsession? Maybe it is because Elliott, who has no
children, is on a Proustian journey to recapture the Christmases of
his own childhood.
</P>
<P>
   There was more snow in those days, Elliott said as he gave a
recent tour of the exhibit. His family's house, at 220 East 62nd
Street, was ``a fairyland,'' he said; the lights on the Christmas
tree reflected brilliantly off the mirrored walls in the second
floor hallway. When he and his baby brother Osborn, who grew up to
become editor of Newsweek, woke up, there were ``early morning
presents'' at the foot of their beds to keep them quiet, Elliott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's father was an investment counselor, and his mother
sold real estate. It was the Depression, but so plentiful were the
presents he and his brother received when they were boys, Elliott
said, that they were displayed for a week afterward. Elliott
remembered how he and his brother worried about the ``old family
retainer,'' his mother's maid, not having presents. So they used
their pocket money to buy rubber bands and paper clips to stuff
into her stocking.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a mystery at the heart of Jock Elliott's
Christmas: that his mother, who ``grew up in a broken family,''
never talked about her own childhood Christmases. There was no
mention of ``the secret presents, the carol singing, the bulging
stocking, the glittering tree,'' Elliott writes in the exhibit's
catalog. ``She must have been a lonely little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's Christmas collection is a social history of the
holiday in England and America. It reminds one that Christmas is an
invented occasion. Elliott points out that pagan cultures had
festivals at the time of the winter solstice. The Romans had the
Saturnalia, in honor of Saturn, the harvest god, during which there
was much drinking and rowdiness. Most scholars agree that Jesus was
not born on Dec. 25, 1,999 years ago; some think it was more like 4
or 5 B.C. The Christian holiday developed as an incentive for
converts who were reluctant to give up winter revelries.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest item in Elliott's collection is a leaf from a Book of
Hours from 1430, before the invention of movable type, showing the
Adoration of the Magi. There is also a leaf from a book printed by
William Caxton of the story of the Nativity, and a volume of
Milton's poems, from 1645, probably a first edition, including
``Hymn on the Morning of Christ's Nativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The English Puritans put a damper on Christmas. In 1644, Oliver
Cromwell banned the celebration. Elliott's collection includes
books and tracts attacking and defending the holiday. One, written
in 1647, by someone who dared use only his initials, ``T.H.,''
reads: ``This very good time of Christ's birth some men do not
greatly desire to have this day sanctified with thanksgiving, nor
yet their poor kindred and poor neighbors treated with Christmas
mirth and love, but I hope these men will change their judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Christmas as it is in America, a time of familial togetherness,
did not come into being until the middle of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Nissenbaum, a historian, has written that in New York
City, there was originally little distinction between Christmas and
New Year's celebrations. In his book ``The Battle for Christmas''
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1996), he writes that immigrants, workers and
members of the lower classes were noted for their rowdiness during
the Christmas week. The modern Christmas, Nissenbaum said, was an
invention of the upper classes, to curb those excesses.
</P>
<P>
   A milestone in its beginning, he said, was Clement Clarke
Moore's ``Visit From St. Nicholas'' (``The Night Before
Christmas''), published in 1823. Elliott has several books
containing the poem, including an 1844 collection by Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time of Moore's poem, the first Christmas card
appeared, in England. It was commissioned in 1843 by Henry Cole, a
founder of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and illustrated by John
Calcott Horsley. The card is a triptych. In the center is a scene
of a family celebration, with everyone, including the children,
drinking a toast. On either side are panels showing the poor being
given food and clothing. Elliott's card is the only one inscribed
and dated by Horsley still in private hands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the 19th century, Christmas had become a craze
on both sides of the Atlantic. But Christmas trees became popular
only after 1848, when The Illustrated London News published a
drawing of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their children
gathered around a tree hung with ornaments. That image was
transformed for New World consumption when it appeared in Godey's
Lady's Book in 1850, democratized with the removal of the Queen's
coronet, and Albert's mustache, sash and royal insignia.
</P>
<P>
   The political cartoonist Thomas Nast created the modern image of
Santa Claus, and Elliott's collection contains several examples of
illustrations of Santa as a roly-poly figure with a long white
beard.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott also has five first editions of ``A Christmas Carol in
Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas'' by Charles Dickens, from
1844, with illustrations by John Leech. One book, Elliott said, is
notable for its ``defective'' title page, which has no title,
author's name, place of publication or date. ``In the United
States, it was pirated,'' he said. ``He didn't get a penny for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of Dickens' book prompted Christmas books by William
Makepeace Thackeray, Hans Christian Andersen, Wilkie Collins and
Horatio Alger. Elliott rounds out his collection with a grab bag of
books, including ``The Cultivation of Christmas Trees'' by T.S.
Eliot and ``Christmas Holiday'' by Somerset Maugham, with an
inscription to his lover and adopted son, Alan Searle. There are
also copies of Edna St. Vincent Millay's ``Ballad of the
Harp-Weaver,'' and Elliott's favorite piece of prose, ``A Child's
Christmas in Wales'' by Dylan Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   For Elliott, standing in the midst of it all, life seems just a
continuation from one Christmas to the next. He and his brother
still exchange ``early morning presents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott says he still has a Christmas stocking and it is six
feet long. ``My wife fills it up with socks and underwear,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott also wears Christmas suspenders, Christmas socks and a
nightshirt. Every Christmas, he reads his wife, Eleanor, ``The
Ballad of the Harp-Weaver.'' Afterward, Elliott said, ``we go to
sleep with a warm heart and a moist eye.''

EDITORIAL: THE ALLURE OF PLACE IN A MOBILE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I prayed for,'' wrote the Roman poet Horace. ``A
piece of land _ not so very big, with a garden and, near the house,
a spring that never fails, and a bit of wood to round it off.''
Those words were set down more than 2000 years ago, around 30 B.C.
It is easy to understand the emotion prompting them. We still
recognize what Horace meant by a rural garden, a place to take
refuge, as he did, from the irritations of city life.
</P>
<P>
   If the love of retreat, as Horace describes it, has not changed
much in 2000 years, the sense of place _ the way it frames
experience and shapes identity _ certainly has. Hardly anything
human has changed more, in fact. At this end of the millennium, we
travel with stunning speed and communicate almost instantaneously
over enormous distances. Mobility is not the exception in modern
life; it is a lifelong norm, especially in the United States. Our
days are filled with more and more information, and each particle
of that information, no matter how dry, distracts us from a present
awareness of place. As a result, the places we inhabit anchor us
less. ``Here'' sometimes seems like just another temporary
construct, a private niche only slightly more convincing than the
pervasive fictions of advertising and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   These facts and impressions differ hugely from what we know
about human existence in the past, for the meaning of place has
been reconfigured almost entirely within the past few centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-19th century and the spread of railroads, the
narrow ambit of nearly every person's life was measured at a
foot-pace or, at best, a horse's stride. One's place of residence
exerted an almost unimaginable gravity. In early medieval Europe,
it was possible to find a different set of weights and measures in
nearly every village. Local custom had the force of law. Residents
of medieval towns and villages were bound to their neighbors, their
betters and their landscape by a dense and, to our sensibility,
perplexing set of customary obligations. The differences in customs
and fealties from place to place engendered what one historian has
called ``the waste of energy through friction.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ours is a frictionless world. Money moves as fast
as thought. The urge to rationalize currencies, timekeeping,
standards, markets and laws has been nearly universal in human
history, but only in this century has it come close to being
accomplished. The result is to diminish the influence of the local.
Watching ice-cutters on Walden Pond one day, Thoreau tried to
visualize the global traffic in ice. ``Thus it appears,'' he wrote,
``that the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans, of
Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well.'' Even Thoreau,
self-reliant as he was, lived in a less locally determined, more
globally interdependent world than his parents did. As for us,
self-reliance is only a metaphor. Our dependence on others for the
fundamentals of life is nearly absolute, and those others on whom
we depend are scattered around the world. Most of us make nothing
from where we live but wherewithal.
</P>
<P>
   The biologist E.O. Wilson argues that we still have within us a
profound biological orientation toward what he calls ``the right
place,'' a landscape that evokes the setting of early human
evolution. Wilson describes it as ``open, tree-studded land on
prominences overlooking water'' _ not that different from Horace's
small farm. It is easy to see the romanticism in longing for such a
place, even in 30 B.C., a romanticism we still feel. But in modern
times, America has become a nation of almost hectic motion. That
does not mean we choose the right places to live. We live instead
where work takes us and try to make place inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   In the years to come, a globalized Internet economy may allow
some of us to re-root ourselves by freeing us from centralized
workplaces. It has already begun to do so. But the electronic
e-topia of the Internet, no matter how sophisticated it becomes,
offers no real alternative to the values arising from a strong
sense of place. For the human mind requires what Wilson calls a
``beauty and mystery beyond itself.'' The beyond that he means is
the natural world itself, a place of irreducible localness whose
claims upon us cannot be annulled no matter how hard we try.

FRIENDS AND FOES AGREE: NEAR LOSS IN '90 WAS PIVOTAL EVENT FOR
BRADLEY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to make it `walk,' stead of `lark')  (jt) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It once seemed that the word failure was not a part
of Bill Bradley's lexicon. He had been a Rhodes Scholar, Olympic
gold medalist, two-time NBA champion and, on his first foray into
politics in 1978, the winner of a Senate seat from New Jersey. In
1984, during the Reagan landslide, he won re-election in a walk.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1990, when Bradley came within 3 percentage points of
losing his once safe bastion to an unknown, poorly financed
Republican named Christie Whitman, he was devastated. For weeks, he
wandered the state in a sullen funk, asking friends what had gone
wrong. Over coffee, Michael J. Breslin, a Hackensack, N.J., lawyer,
summed it up for him in one word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `the public thought you were arrogant,''' Breslin
recalled, referring to voters' anger with Bradley for not taking a
position on a $2.8 billion state tax increase that year. ``He
looked at me as if he was startled. Because he can't stand arrogant
people. I said, `Nobody's told you that?' And he said, `No, you're
the first guy to mention that word, arrogant.'''
</P>
<P>
   To many of his critics and supporters alike, the disastrous 1990
campaign _ both sides use the adjective _ represents the most
important event in Bradley's political life. Almost no one had
expected the race to be close, Bradley had widely been touted as
presidential contender and he outspent Whitman by 12-to-1. Yet he
nearly lost.
</P>
<P>
   The election he later called ``a terrible blow'' shook his
confidence in himself and his staff, triggering an intense bout of
introspection that helped change the course of his career, Bradley
and his friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, he revamped his Washington staff and cut his ties
with some of his oldest political advisers. He removed his name
from the list of 1992 presidential contenders. His interest in the
Senate waned, and he began work on a memoir, ``Time Present, Time
Past,'' that eventually consumed more of his time than legislating.
By 1995, he had decided to retire, announcing in a now famous
speech that ``politics is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after two lucrative years of consulting, teaching and
lecturing, Bradley returned to the political arena as a candidate
for the Democratic presidential nomination. Yet as much as ever,
the 1990 race continues to color his view of politics, and his
critics' views of him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Bradley says, he relied too much on expensive pollsters
and consultants who failed to notice the electorate's fury. ``The
lesson of 1990,'' he said recently, ``is you can have too much
money in a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the race also helped him understand the importance of
listening more directly to voters, of speaking from his heart and
not worrying about the advice of handlers, of being bold. All are
lessons he claims to have incorporated into his current race, where
he has campaigned against conventional politics and made campaign
finance reform a central issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never be where he is today if not for 1990,'' said
Michael Kaye, Bradley's media adviser in 1990. ``He had to fail. To
see that that could happen, and that he could be humiliated. And I
think 1990 totally liberated him. He said to himself, `From this
point on, I'm going to do it the way I want to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans say they took a somewhat different lesson from
1990. To them, Bradley's refusal to distance himself from Gov. Jim
Florio's tax plan _ the issue Whitman built her campaign around _
simply proved that he was too aloof to understand the anger of
average voters and too regimented to adjust when he finally did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting him to blow me out of the water any day, which
he could have done with just a couple of sentences distancing
himself from that tax hike,'' said Whitman, who is now in her
second term as New Jersey's governor. ``But the fact that he didn't
became a bigger issue. If you are going to represent the people of
New Jersey, you have to respond to their concerns, you have to
listen to them. He just never responded.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The impression I got was that once he locks onto a
game plan, he won't change it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though Whitman entered the Senate race in January 1990, the
campaign really began in March, when Florio, a first-term Democrat,
unveiled his plan to close a yawning state budget gap with a $2.8
billion tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, coming in the midst of a spreading economic
downturn, touched off a storm of protests. Angry homeowners rallied
outside the statehouse, ``Impeach Florio'' bumper stickers spread
like brush fire and radio talk shows devoted hours to railing
against the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Florio released his proposal, Whitman's campaign
strategists had mapped out a plan for attacking Bradley as an
out-of-touch Washington insider more concerned about global affairs
and presidential politics than his home state. The tax plan
provided more fodder than they ever had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Whitman began demanding that Bradley take a
position on the tax increase, which was in the news almost daily as
Florio pushed it through the legislature. To their delight, he
refused time and time again, saying that it was a state issue that
had no place in a U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this self-styled tax expert to say, `I have an opinion but
I'm not going to say it, I'm not going to tell you,' well, people
thought that was unbelievably arrogant,'' said Willliam Palatucci,
a New Jersey lawyer who was Whitman's principal political
consultant then.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the tax issue raised some very difficult political
and personal problems. His aides say he really believed that it was
improper for him to weigh in on a state issue, even though he told
them privately that he thought the tax increase was ``too much, too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, Bradley felt deep loyalty to Florio, who had
bucked Democratic Party leaders by supporting Bradley in 1978 over
the state organization's favored Senate candidate. ``Some people
said we had to answer these Florio questions,'' said Bob McHugh,
Bradley's campaign press secretary at the time. ``But Bradley just
wasn't going to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one of Bradley's closest political advisers, Douglas
Berman, his 1984 campaign manager, was Florio's state treasurer and
an architect of the tax increase. It would have been hard for
Bradley to criticize the plan without appearing to repudiate his
old friend, now the chief strategist for Bradley's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a number of relatively inexperienced consultants
were running Bradley's 1990 campaign instead of Berman was an
indication to many people that Bradley was not too worried about
Whitman. Nicholas Donatiello, Bradley's 30-year-old Senate press
secretary, was the manager, though he had never run a campaign
before. Kaye, the media consultant, spent much of the year in Santa
Fe, N.M., and Los Angeles. And Joseph Peritz, a pollster, was a
specialist in consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a campaign people were anxious to run, because
expectations were sky high,'' Donatiello said in a recent
interview. ``You couldn't beat 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bradley's friends also say he seemed to be more
interested in the 1992 presidential campaign than in his
re-election. Leading up to the 1990 campaign, he had spent $1
million on polling voters around the country and buying computer
equipment to analyze the data. He also raised much of his $12
million Senate war chest outside of New Jersey, particularly in
California, an indication that he was trying to create a national
base of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   All of those things fit neatly into Whitman's line of attack.
Yet by the fall, polls showed Bradley still leading her by 20
points or more. So his advisers maintained their cautious strategy
of refusing to engage Whitman and running positive advertisements
about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Optional material)
</P>
<P>
   But even those commercials seemed to fall flat. One spot
featured Bradley in his Senate office, kicking his sneaker-clad
feet up onto his desk; another showed him sinking a basketball shot
before cheering students. In both cases, the ads seemed oddly out
of sync with the bad mood of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked frivolous,'' Kaye said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also often seemed slow or ineffective at responding to
Whitman's repeated thrusts on issues, ranging from his campaign
contributions to his environmental record. When she challenged him
to take a position on flag burning, he spent two weeks studying the
matter before announcing that he considered it a constitutional
right.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional material)
</P>
<P>
   By the last two weeks of the campaign, Bradley, who had been in
Washington for Senate votes during much of the fall, finally
returned home for full-time campaigning. For the first time, he
heard voters' anger in person. Soon after, his campaign ran its
first negative ad against Whitman, accusing her of supporting taxes
as a Somerset County freeholder. He defended the ad with a line he
still uses today, ``Get an elbow, give an elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, Bradley did little to alter his strategy
down the stretch. Yet more and more voters were switching their
allegiances to Whitman every day, and Bradley had no knowledge of
it. His own campaign had stopped doing tracking polls in October,
confident that their big lead would hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing, but no one smelled the coffee,'' McHugh said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Following the election, Bradley became withdrawn, his friends
and former aides say. He blamed his advisers, himself and even
voters. ``For many months to come,'' he wrote in ``Time Present,
Time Past'' (Knopf, 1996), ``I looked at each person who approached
me as if he or she had voted against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, as his disappointment lifted, he came to look at the
1990 election as ``the best thing that ever happened in my
political career,'' he wrote in his memoirs. ``It forced me to face
up to what I needed to change, both organizationally and
personally. It forced me to go deeper into my emotions and to speak
from values and convictions in ways I had avoided before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's friends say they think Bradley has become more playful
and unbuttoned now as a result of 1990, doing little things like
grabbing the glasses off Larry King's face or asking Sam Donaldson
whether he ever smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But some also wonder whether he completely understands what
happened in 1990, and whether he has accepted his own role in his
poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt betrayed,'' said one friend. ``And he blamed everyone.
He saw how vulnerable he was to people giving him advice. I felt
bad for him because I saw how wounded he was. But in the end, he's
the boss. They gave him bad advice, but he's the one who took it.''

LONG BEACH STATE FOCUSED ON VOLLEYBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ They are young, attractive, athletic, bright and
brimming with energy.
</P>
<P>
   They are in one of the storied vacation spots in the world, an
idyllic paradise where there are all sorts of alluring diversions.
</P>
<P>
   They have been staying at a hotel in Waikiki for a week, and you
would figure that by now they would have sampled the hip night
spots and at least paid homage to that shrine on the beach, Duke's.
</P>
<P>
   But forget it.
</P>
<P>
   The women on the Long Beach State volleyball team haven't
partied, danced, or engaged in the kind of frenzied fun those in
their late teens or early twenties are known to routinely do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they haven't even gone out at nights except on those
two notable occasions last week when they took care of business in
the NCAA Regionals against Colorado State and Texas A &AMP; M.
</P>
<P>
   They have been eating their dinners early and by 8 o'clock have
been in their rooms studying for their final exams, which they've
taken here the past few days under the watchful eye of a Long Beach
State proctor named Armando Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   Their coach, Brian Gimmillaro, doesn't even impose a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have had to have one,'' says Gimmillaro proudly. ``I've
never once had a bed check. There's not a person on this team who
would go out and fool around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not in these athletes' makeup. And they make a lot
of the rules themselves. They are able to govern themselves. From
the time they get at Long Beach, I instill in my players the
importance of being responsible and trustworthy. One of the things
I've been most proud about our program has been the discipline of
the players. And I think this discipline is reflected in the way
they play on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a mild surprise that the defending NCAA champion 49ers
have reached the Final Four for the seventh time in 11 years,
especially since Gimmillaro lost his Player of the Year setter,
Misty May, and two other stalwarts, Jessica Alvarado and Benishe
Dillard, from his 1998 team.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers struggled early in the season with the heralded 6-1
newcomer from Colorado, Brittany Hochevar, as the setter, and
Gimmillaro, reluctantly, turned to the 5-7 sophomore academic
scholar, Keri Nishimoto.
</P>
<P>
   The insertion of Nishimoto into the starting lineup turned the
Long Beach season instantly around.
</P>
<P>
   Nishimoto started gathering assists in bushels as her deft
passes began resulting in a steady stream of kills by teammates
like Cheryl Weaver, Tayyiba Haneef, Brandy Barrett, Anja Grabovac
and Veronica Walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people didn't think we'd be here,'' says
Gimmillaro, whose team faces the unpleasant task of playing No.
2-ranked Stanford Thursday evening. ``But we've just been getting
better and better and better. I just wish we had more time. If we
could be together for one more month, I don't think anyone would be
able to beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Keri Nishimoto could run this team, but I didn't know
if she could be physical enough to take us where we now are.
Obviously, she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimmillaro says his team will face its greatest challenge of the
season against the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think Stanford should have been the No. 1 seed
because it beat more teams in the Top 10 than Penn State did,''
says Gimmillaro. ``Stanford is a very tall and talented team. It
beat UOP easily, and you know UOP beat us twice. So there's no
doubt we're going to have our hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can the 49ers beat Stanford?'' I asked Gimmillaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be at our best,'' he said. ``We're
going to have to play as we did against Texas A &AMP; M, which I
thought was our best match of the season. We're going to have to
make good passes and not make many errors. It's going to be
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these 49ers have had it tough the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had to had to live in the shadow of last year's
undefeated team that I think is the best to ever play college
volleyball,'' says Gimmillaro. ``It's been difficult for this team
to develop its own identity. The expectations at Long Beach have
become so great, but I think this team now, finally, has its own
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his team, Brian Gimmillaro has not remained in Honolulu
the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   He and wife Dania returned to Long Beach on Saturday to spend a
couple of days with their son and daughter, and then he flew back
here on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't worried that his players might stray during his
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so focused both on their studies and on volleyball
that they don't really have time for anything else,'' says
Gimmillaro. ``Oh, they did go to the mall for a couple of hours
over the weekend. They also were going to go snorkeling, but it
rained and the event was canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many differences between women and men athletics
aside from the physical contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   The women don't posture shamelessly and finger-point after
making positive plays.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they fail drug tests, or get involved in robberies or
petty theft or other such shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you would have no curfew and bed checks if your
team was comprised of men?'' I asked Gimmillaro.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gimmillaro laughed heartily, thought a moment and said
firmly, ``No way.''

MCCAIN UNVEILS HEALTH PLANCALLING FOR MODEST CHANGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th and 5th grafs to correct and clarify cost of McCain's
health plan)  By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Calling the nation's health care system ``too
costly, too inaccessible and too bureaucratic,'' Sen. John McCain
on Tuesday set out a plan of ``tailored reforms'' ranging from a
federal program to help the low-income elderly pay for prescription
drugs to a limited right to sue health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech to the Charleston Rotary Club was part of an
effort by the Arizona Republican to capitalize on his surge in New
Hampshire by fleshing out his positions on issues. Health care _
and most particularly the soaring costs of prescription drugs _ has
emerged as one of the hottest topics on the campaign trail this
year, and until now it has been a policy arena largely dominated by
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our health care system today often fails to reflect our
values,'' McCain said, as he began two days of campaigning in one
of the key early primary states where he is hoping to upset the
Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ``Too many
Americans go to sleep at night desperately fearing illness or
injury to themselves or a family member because they are without
health insurance to pay their bills.''
</P>
<P>
   But even while he identified access to affordable, quality
health care as one of the most pressing problems facing American
families, McCain stopped well short of the kinds of more
far-reaching legislation that Vice President Al Gore, former Sen.
Bill Bradley and congressional Democrats are running on. Aides were
still calculating the cost of his program hours after his program.
On Tuesday night, they said his entire health care plan would cost
$7.6 billion when fully in effect in its fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   His plan for regulating health maintenance organizations would
extend a limited right to sue to consumers in managed health care
plans regulated by the federal government. But that would not
include allowing suits for punitive damages. His prescription drug
plan would offer federal funds to states that choose to participate
and match the amounts instead of making it a new benefit for all
Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed nothing resembling Bradley's call for a vast system
of subsidies and tax credits to insure all children and provide
access to affordable coverage to all adults, allowing anyone to buy
private insurance through the program that insures federal workers,
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting there does not require some grand experiment in social
engineering,'' McCain said, ``or a death-by-a-thousand-cuts,
gradual government takeover of the health care system. We need only
to consult our values and enact tailored reforms that build on the
strengths of the current system.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attempt to find an ideological middle ground was most
clear in his proposal for alleviating the spiraling costs of
prescription drugs to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called for a broad expansion of the
federal Medicare program to add prescription drug coverage for up
to 39 million elderly and disabled Americans. Under his plan,
Medicare beneficiaries would pay a total of $110 billion in
premiums for drug coverage over the next decade, and the government
would put up $118 billion. Both Gore and Bradley have advocated a
Medicare benefit for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, called Tuesday for a far more modest block
grant that would cost the federal government $5.1 billion across
five years, with matching funds put up by those states that choose
to participate in the program. Currently 14 states provide some
kind of drug cost assistance to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   While Medicaid currently covers most prescription drug costs for
the elderly poor, McCain's aides said his plan would help an
estimated 10 million of the near-poor elderly with incomes of up to
two times the poverty level of $8,240 for an individual and $11,060
per couple.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said that he would create regional pilot projects
costing $1 billion over three years to test regional programs to
provide assistance to the elderly regardless of income when they
face catastrophic drug costs ``that can cruelly snatch away a
life's savings.
</P>
<P>
   The speech gave McCain a new opportunity to tie his signature
issue _ the overhaul of the campaign finance laws _ to broader
social concerns. ``Taking the $100,000 special interest checks out
of politics is the gateway through which all other reforms
including the reform of our health care system must pass,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed both parties' fidelity to special interests for
congressional gridlock on regulating managed care. ``Republicans
want to protect the insurance companies from lawsuits,'' he said.
``The Democrats want to let the trial lawyers sue anyone for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain found a middle ground, on regulating managed care,
calling for more protections than Republican legislation that
passed the Senate, but stopping short of the right to sue contained
in a bipartisan bill that the House passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you or a loved one is sick or injured and wrongfully turned
away for care, you must be assured the ability to resolve that
problem rapidly through a fair and independent review process,'' he
said. ``But if you're not satisfied, no American should be denied
the ability to seek redress through the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference later, McCain said he would like to see
independent state panels set up to review cases where consumers are
denied care by a health maintenance organization. His aides said
that under his proposal the 48 million Americans in the managed
care plans that fall under federal regulation would be given a
somewhat broader right to sue than they currently have, if they
were unsatisfied with the review. Currently those in such federally
regulated managed care plans are allowed to sue but only for the
cost of denied medical care.
</P>
<P>
   They would be bared from receiving punitive damages. But they
would be allowed to seek unlimited damages for economic suffering
like lost wages. Dan Schnur, the senator's communications director
said McCain would also propose legislation to put a $250,000 cap on
noneconomic damages, such as awards for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate debated managed care regulation earlier this
year, McCain voted for the Republican bill, which did not include
an expanded right to sue. His aides said he had supported the
legislation because he did not want to see the issue die in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   To extend health insurance coverage to more of the nation's 44
million uninsured, McCain like many Republicans called for an
expansion of medical savings accounts, tax-free accounts that can
be used to cover medical costs, and for a more general tax
reduction to give people more money to buy insurance. He also
called for a more aggressive effort to encourage small businesses
to band together in insurance purchasing pools, as well as a
greater effort to enroll children in a federal program that was
established two years ago for children in families not poor enough
for Medicaid but not affluent enough to buy private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech made him the first Republican to set out a
detailed health care plan. Bush so far has spoken only generally of
extending coverage to more of the uninsured and pointed to the
program in Texas for regulating HMO's.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been more hotly debated in the Democratic
presidential contest because of Bradley's call for a vast system of
subsidies and tax credits that would cost $65 billion a year. Gore
has aggressively picked apart the plan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On another front, McCain on Tuesday defended the military's
``don't ask don't tell policy'' toward gay members of the service,
saying ``this policy has worked.'' He criticized Gore for calling
on Monday for the outright elimination of the program, saying the
vice president should not take a position on the issue without
first consulting with high-ranking Pentagon officials.

DE LA HOYA AND COLEY STAR IN THE LATEST BOXING SOAP OPERA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oscar De La Hoya and Derrell Coley sat on stage at
the Theater in Madison Square Garden Tuesday surrounded by the set
from ``A Christmas Carol.'' The two fighters were there to promote
their bout at the Garden on Feb. 26, but they are also players in
another drama that has been unfolding since De La Hoya lost his WBC
welterweight title to Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   The latest soap opera in boxing can be called ``As the
Welterweights Turn.'' By the time the run of it is complete, De La
Hoya and Coley may not meet in the ring in February, and Coley may
actually be a pawn in a bigger game to get De La Hoya and Trinidad
back in the ring for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's news conference, Dan Goossen, Coley's promoter,
had his lawyer send threatening letters to the promoter Bob Arum,
the president of Top Rank Inc.; to De La Hoya's promoter; to HBO,
which will televise the De La Hoya-Coley bout, and to Madison
Square Garden. The letters said to stop the fight or expect to be
sued.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen contends that Arum is interfering with his exclusive
promotional contract with Coley by signing him to an agreement to
fight De La Hoya. Goossen said Arum went behind his back and dealt
directly with Coley to get him signed to fight De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Arum has done as it relates to Coley is tantamount to one
baseball owner tampering with another baseball owner's player,''
Goossen said. ``In our industry we don't have a commissioner to
uphold someone's rights. Arum knew we had an exclusive contract
with Coley. Coley knew it; his manager Barry Linde knew it and his
attorney Milt Chwasky knew it and HBO knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chwasky said that Goossen was not acting in the best interest of
Coley and had dragged his feet on negotiating a deal for Coley to
fight Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Coley is the mandatory contender for the WBC title that Trinidad
holds. Chwasky said that Goossen was also slow in trying to work
out an agreement for Coley to fight De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way he'll win his lawsuit,'' said Chwasky, who
became Coley's attorney two weeks ago when Coley's manager, Linde,
called him. ``How can he win when he's exploiting the fighter?''
</P>
<P>
   Chwasky said that Goossen was offered $250,000 to allow Coley to
fight De La Hoya. Goossen turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about money,'' Goossen said. ``This is about right
and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen had negotiated a contract with promoter Don King for
another one of his clients, David Reid, the WBA superwelterweight
champion, to fight Trinidad. But that fight was postponed when
Coley insisted that he would not step aside and relinquish his
right to challenge Trinidad for the welterweight title in order for
Reid to fight Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen had his lawyer, Jethro Eisenstein, file a lawsuit in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan Tuesday against HBO on behalf of
Reid, asking that a judge stop HBO from saying that it has the
right of first refusal on the Trinidad-Reid bout. Eisenstein said
that because Goossen is not the lead promoter for that bout, HBO's
contract with Reid is not in effect for Trinidad-Reid. King,
Trinidad's promoter, is the lead promoter for that bout.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen's actions came on the heels of a failed meeting between
Arum, HBO executives, King, Trinidad and his advisers to reignite
negotiations for a De La Hoya-Trinidad rematch. Arum said King and
Trinidad were insisting that the De La Hoya-Coley match come after
a rematch between De La Hoya and Trinidad. But Arum refused to go
along with that and the meeting ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goossen did this at the behest of King for whatever Byzantine
reason,'' Arum said regarding Goossen's threats to stop the De La
Hoya-Coley bout.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, all the participants involved in De La
Hoya-Coley were putting on a happy face at Tuesday's announcement.
It will be De La Hoya's first fight in New York since he knocked
out Jesse James Leija in a lightweight bout on Dec. 15, 1995. De La
Hoya drew 16,000 fans for that fight.
</P>
<P>
   Coley was beaming at the opportunity to fight De La Hoya, who
had ducked him for almost two years when De La Hoya had the title.
It didn't seem to matter to Coley that De La Hoya doesn't have a
title anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this opportunity for 19 months; is this
really Oscar?'' Coley asked looking over at De La Hoya. ``Somebody
should check his ID, because I haven't seen the guy in 19 months.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya flew from Miami where he is recording a record album.
Although he was still glum about having lost his title to Trinidad
on Sept. 18, De La Hoya promised to be more aggressive in his fight
against Coley. He said the Trinidad fight had forced him to change
his way of thinking and his way of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an action-packed event,'' De La Hoya said.
``I'm going to come out with such anger. No more boxing on my toes.
It's sad that no one appreciates that skill of boxing anymore. If
it pleases the fans, I will go back to my old style and just duke
it out.''

REPORT SAYS JAIL ISOLATION CAUSED SUSPECT'S DECLINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Harvard Medical School psychiatrist who specializes
in the effects of solitary confinement on prisoners has concluded
that a defendant accused of having links to suspected terrorist
Osama bin Laden has been so mentally devastated by his imprisonment
that he may not be able to assist meaningfully in his own defense,
newly disclosed records show.
</P>
<P>
   The examination of the defendant, Wadih el-Hage, which was
conducted at the request of his lawyers, comes as a federal judge
in Manhattan has shown increasing concern about the impact of the
highly restrictive jail conditions under which el-Hage and five
other terrorism suspects are being held.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which asserted that el-Hage and the others might
still be involved in planning acts of terrorism, had invoked a
rarely used rule to hold the suspects in isolation, barring them
from virtually all contact or communication with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Stuart Grassian, who examined el-Hage for four hours on
Sept. 3 in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan,
said that more than one year of virtually complete isolation has
taken a devastating mental toll on el-Hage, who last lived in
Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``His day is almost entirely empty of structure or variety,''
Grassian wrote, ``and when he thinks, he finds himself endlessly
ruminating on the injustice and indignities he must endure.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's 18-page report, made public on Monday, cited
repeated strip searches and constant surveillance of el-Hage by
guards, his inability to remain in touch with his family or to
practice Islam, and the ``continual ringing of the telephone near
his cell and the flashlights shining in his face at night.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, federal prosecutors, who have resisted
relaxing the terms of the suspects' confinement, made an unexpected
concession, telling Judge Leonard B. Sand of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan they were willing to allow el-Hage to move to a larger
cell and to have another defendant in the terrorism case as a
cellmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion of not requiring isolation of the defendants,''
Sand said, ``which I am hearing for the first time today, is
something that should be explored. It seems to be a constructive
notion.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatric report on el-Hage is part of a mammoth bail
application newly filed by el-Hage's lawyers. The application was
released after Sand unsealed several pages that contained grand
jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The filing, totaling more than 400 pages, offers a wealth of new
detail about el-Hage, whom prosecutors say was a former personal
secretary to bin Laden, who is blamed for the bombing of two
American embassies in Africa in August 1998. Prosecutors have
charged that el-Hage helped bin Laden set up front companies in
Africa, and participated in his broad terrorist conspiracy to
attack American citizens abroad.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage has been charged with perjury, in addition to the
conspiracy charges. He has not been accused of a direct role in the
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 200
people and wounded thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The new filing shows that el-Hage, who has pleaded not guilty,
admitted going to work for bin Laden _ ``It was bin Laden's idea,''
he testified before a grand jury on Sept. 24, 1997 _ but only in
what he contended were legitimate business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage's lawyers, Sam A. Schmidt and Joshua L. Dratel, argue in
their papers that the available evidence contradicts the
government's assertions that el-Hage was involved in violent acts
that prosecutors have previously cited as a basis for holding him
before trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the government comes out with something, whether sealed
or in public, to show otherwise,'' Schmidt said Tuesday, ``I think
there's no basis for the judge to find that he's presently a danger
to the national security, or to the community.''

HOUSE PANEL TO QUESTION DEMOCRATIC FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to correct name of congressional committee)  (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of investigations, partisan vitriol and
accusations of stonewalling leveled at the Clinton White House,
Republicans in Congress will at last get what they have long
sought, a hearing on Wednesday to publicly question a Democratic
fund-raiser at the epicenter of the 1996 campaign fund-raising
controversy: John Huang.
</P>
<P>
   Protected by a grant of immunity, Huang is scheduled to begin
three days of testimony at the House Government Reform Committee
led by its Republican chairman, Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana _ an
event that Republicans hope will prove uncomfortable for President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may be disappointed. In Huang's opening statement, a
copy of which was provided to The New York Times, the former
fund-raiser said he knew of no wrongdoing by either Clinton or
Gore. Huang said he might have escaped ``the terrible ordeal'' had
he implicated them, but, he said: ``I never had a basis upon which
to do so. In fact, I maintain very high regard for each of these
dedicated men.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Huang pleaded guilty to engaging in a conspiracy to
defraud the Federal Election Commission by arranging for employees
of the Lippo Group, an Indonesian-based conglomerate run by the
powerful Riady family, to be reimbursed for contributions in the
1992 and the 1994 elections. He was sentenced to probation and
agreed to cooperate with the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Huang played a significant role in the 1996 campaign. Of the
$2.8 million in improper contributions that the Democrats were
forced to return after the 1996 election, almost 80 percent were
raised by Huang and Yah Lin Trie, both of whom were longtime
friends of Clinton and raised large sums based on their personal
relationships with the president. In 1997, when the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee began its investigation, Huang
refused to testify, invoking his constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, White House officials repeated their frequently
expressed skepticism about the objectivity of Burton's panel and
questioned its impartiality in questioning Huang. Jim Kennedy, a
White House spokesman, said: ``Three things in life are certain.
Death, taxes and partisan hearings chaired by Dan Burton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Huang's testimony _ re-examining the frenzy of Democratic
fund-raising in 1996 _ comes at a time when campaign finance issues
seem to be catching fire in the presidential race and could help
sharpen demands for changes in the country's system of raising
money for federal candidates and parties.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands are already central issues for insurgent
presidential candidates such as Bill Bradley, the former Democratic
senator of New Jersey, and John McCain, the Republican senator from
Arizona. In an unusual step, Bradley and McCain have scheduled a
joint appearance on Thursday in New Hampshire to pledge that if
nominated, they would call on their parties to refuse unrestricted
contributions for party-building activities known as soft money.
Many of the large contributions raised by Huang in 1996 flowed into
the Democratic National Committee in soft-money checks.
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, Huang does not suggest that he will
add important new details to his activities, which have been the
subject of lengthy Senate, House and Justice Department
investigations. Last month, Burton's committee released lengthy
notes taken by FBI agents in their investigation of campaign
finance matters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in his prepared remarks, Huang, who once worked at the
Commerce Department and later at the Democratic National Committee,
portrayed himself as a victim of partisan politics, a rising tide
of anti-Asian sentiment and grossly unfair news accounts, including
reports of lawmakers who falsely accused him of economic espionage.
``People seeking publicity have lied about me repeatedly in the
press and even before this committee without consequence.''
</P>

   But he admitted that he had made mistakes. ``Embarrassed and
saddened though I am by the unfortunate attention my conduct and
notoriety brought upon my community, the dated and isolated
offenses, which I have openly acknowledged, will not deter me from
my careerlong efforts to promote understanding between the citizens
of the United States and those of China, Taiwan and the rest of
Asia.''

   Investigations have found that Huang first met Clinton in the
1980s, through a mutual friend, James Riady, the head of the Lippo
Group. By 1992, when Huang was employed by Lippo Bank in
California, he began to raise money for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's election, Huang used his contacts to get a job
at the Commerce Department. In 1995, as the president's re-election
campaign began, Huang left Commerce to begin fund-raising for the
Democrats, although some party officials had reservations from the
start about whether Huang might be raising money from contributors
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1996, Huang organized fund-raising events, some
attended by foreign contributors and Clinton. Huang and another
fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, organized one such event on April 29,
1997, at the Hsi Lai temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., that was
attended by Gore, whose shifting statements about his knowledge of
the purpose of the event dogged the vice president for many months.

SOARING OIL PRICES AREN'T SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most gratifying developments of 1999 has been the
failure of soaring oil prices to slow U.S. economic growth or
weaken the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although oil prices have generally more than doubled compared
with this time last year as a result of OPEC's decision last spring
to curb output, the world's economic system hasn't showed any
appreciable sign of distress. Unlike during the 1973 and 1979
shocks, there has been no sign of incipient hyperinflation or any
hint of decelerating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Americans have seen substantially higher petrol
prices at the pump, but not nearly high enough to force the sort of
consumption trade-offs that hurt a consumer-driven economy. In
fact, as one industry analyst recently noted, the
inflation-adjusted price of gasoline is still below its level of
the early '80s, after the second oil shock.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Consumer Price Index report illustrated the relatively
benign effect of higher oil prices. The index rose only 0.1 percent
in November, and the price of gasoline actually showed a decline.
So far this year, the index is rising at a rate of 2.7 percent.
While this is higher than last year's 1.6 percent consumer
inflation rate, it's still relatively mild by postwar U.S.
experience.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? For one thing, according to a recent analysis by
The Economist, crude oil costs for most countries now account for a
much smaller share of overall petrol prices. The biggest
inflationary force when it comes to gas prices in recent years has
been tax increases, which have diluted the effect at the pump of
even large crude price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, the analysis said, is the diminishing dependence
on oil in the world's richest countries. Energy conservation,
increased use of other fuels and a decline in the presence of
energy-intensive industries have led to reduced oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development shows that if the average cost of oil in 1999 is double
1998's average cost, it will only increase the oil import bills of
the richest economies by 0.5 percent, or less, of gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   Another dynamic is the financial condition of the oil-exporting
countries. During the previous two oil shocks, they banked much of
their windfall profits because they had more money than they could
spend. Nowadays they're not so flush, and recycle their increased
income into the world economy by spending most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, previous oil shocks occurred in tandem with
soaring worldwide commodity prices, which intensified the
inflationary potential. The Economist, however, says its commodity
price index is generally unchanged over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say the world is out of the woods when it comes to
energy costs. Rather, it's to put the situation into perspective.
While the generation that survived the gas lines and hyperinflation
of the '70s has been conditioned to dread oil price increases, the
world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Rising petroleum costs are still an inflationary factor, but not
nearly the destructive force they were a generation ago. Meantime,
we may have more to fear from government's revenue enhancers on
this score than we do from OPEC.

KNICKS ROLL OVER ROCKETS, 101-90 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ For a while, the interchangeable Knicks looked on in
half amazement tonight as Patrick Ewing stepped onto the floor as
if he were slipping into a time machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was not the struggling, huffing vision he had been for the
first two games of his return. He was the Ewing of his youth as he
prowled around the paint and produced points by the handfuls in the
first quarter against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ewing stepped aside, and allowed younger players like
Latrell Sprewell to take over. After Ewing scored 14 of his 20
points in the first quarter, Sprewell delivered 11 of his 22 in the
third period to form a New York combination that overwhelmed the
depleted Rockets, 101-90, at the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston added 20 points in a well-rounded Knick victory.
It was the Knicks' sixth victory in their last seven games, and
their third in a row since the return of Ewing. After shutting down
the easy 3-point attempts the Rockets (7-16) had early in the game
to remain annoyingly close, the Knicks (14-9) grabbed a 15-point
lead midway through the fourth quarter and rolled from there.
</P>
<P>
   By a twist of lockout season scheduling fate, the Knicks last
season did not have to face a Rockets' team that had three players
selected among the top 50 in league history _ Scottie Pippen,
Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   By injury and insult, the Knicks did not have to play that
talent-loaded team on Tuesday night either. After what amounted to
a verbal food fight with Barkley, a disgruntled Pippen was traded
to Portland before the season. Then, the Rockets lost Olajuwon and
Barkley to injury.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Knicks playing a Rockets team that looked like a
car on blocks and short on parts. But they still had a team Knicks
Coach Jeff Van Gundy considered dangerous because of one simple
reason: the Rockets can run and push the ball, with rookie Steve
Francis providing the nudge.
</P>
<P>
   They can also shoot the 3-pointer, which allowed the Rockets to
stay within 48-45 of the Knicks at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks had certain advantages. Ewing, for one. It was
as if he had taken a dip into a jar of wrinkle-free cream. He
looked 10 years younger and fresher as he posted up the chunky
Thomas Hamilton and arched shots over the reserve center, Kelvin
Cato. Ewing's 14-point first-quarter effort belied the struggles he
had in the two previous games of his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   After missing 14 shots in a row and only making 3 of his first
19 since returning to the team last Friday, Ewing began Tuesday
night's game by putting down 5 of his first 6 shots This wasn't the
same Ewing at all. His touch was soft, his movements were sharp and
his reflexes were quick enough to push the Knicks to a 28-23 lead
at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could not keep the momentum going, though. Their lazy
perimeter defense allowed the Rockets to close the gap on some
timely 3-point jumpers. Matt Bullard delivered back-to-back 3's _
one in front of Larry Johnson and another in front of Kurt Thomas _
to tie the game at 30-all with 4 minutes 29 seconds left in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A brief flurry by Houston ended the Rockets' run. Ewing, who
took a long breather after playing the entire first quarter, scored
just 2 more points before leaving the flo the Knicks ahead
at the half.

CITY, TRANSIT WORKERS DRAW CLOSER TO DEAL TO PREVENT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for updated top and some rewriting. Lede backs off from
certainty of tentative agreement.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's transit workers and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority drew close to a deal Tuesday night on the
key issue of wages, union officials said, but the two sides were
still struggling over the final details of an agreement to head off
a strike Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As a midnight deadline approached, several union officials said
a tentative pact had been reached that would cover the city's
33,000 subway and bus workers. But the president of Local 100 of
the Transport Workers Union, Willie James, said management was
still balking. ``We were very close to a deal, but management
backed off that deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two sides were moving closer to an agreement
Tuesday, city officials warned of the possibility of disruptions
Wednesday from wildcat actions by disgruntled transit workers.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials agreed Tuesday night that the MTA and
union sides were close to a deal, but it was not quite clinched.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, said the
governor was heading from Albany to his New York City office to do
what he could to help resolve any loose ends in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides drew close to a deal on a day when James was under
intense pressure from a large dissident faction to take a tough
stance and from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to avoid a strike. The two
sides neared agreement on a day when a state judge issued two
orders threatening the union with draconian fines if it went on
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said leaders of the transit workers' union had provided
assurances that the union would not shut down New York City's
transit system Wednesday morning, although city officials were
preparing for possible rush hour chaos because of wildcat work
stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, an official close to the negotiations said that
the two sides had considerably narrowed their differences over
wages. This official said that the union had reduced its wage
demands to 5 percent a year over three years, down from its
previous demand for 9 percent a year. The MTA, this official said,
had raised its offer to 13 percent over four years, up from its
previous offer of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Calhoun, the union's secretary-treasurer, said Tuesday
night that the two sides were very close on wages, an issue that
both sides said would be the biggest hurdle to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, James and other leaders in Local 100 of the Transport
Workers Union had threatened a strike if they did not reach an
agreement with the MTA by 12:01 Wednesday morning, when the
contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   James sent a letter to all members Tuesday warning that the huge
fines that could be imposed from defying the judge's orders ``will
quickly bankrupt the union, making it unable to function on your
behalf.'' But the letter stopped short of saying that he would not
call for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with more than 1,500 union transit workers Tuesday
morning, Gil Rodriguez, a union vice president, urged the union
members to respect the court orders.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference, Giuliani said the James letter
made clear that the union's leaders opposed a walkout, which would
be illegal under New York state's Taylor Law, which bars strikes by
transit workers and other public-sector employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani added that there was still a small chance that a
large dissident faction in the union could muster the votes to
authorize a strike, a move that could paralyze the city and create
havoc for 3.5 million people who use the mass transit system each
day.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a strike, Giuliani said that some parts of a
contingency plan to speed transportation into Manhattan would go
into effect Wednesday morning, and that the full plan, which would
restrict motor vehicle access, would be ready if needed. The city
has spent $3 million preparing for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of attacking the union, Giuliani escalated his
efforts Tuesday to pressure it not to strike. He had the city's
lawyers go to a judge's house shortly before 7 a.m. to obtain a
restraining order that calls for fining the union $1 million for
the first day of a strike, and $2 million for the second day,
doubling each successive day.
