<HEADLINE> Container Terminal Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 800 dignitaries and
members of the international shipping/maritime community Thursday
witnessed the opening of one of the world's most advanced
container terminals -- Pasir Panjang Terminal in Singapore, as the
country's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong officiated at the event.
</P>
<P>
Located on the southwest coast of Singapore's main island,
Pasir Panjang Terminal occupies an area of 84 hectares filled up
from the sea and has six berths with 15-meter draught.
</P>
<P>
Its wharf stretches for 2,145 meter with 24 quay cranes and 44
remote-controlled bridge cranes installed. The terminal project
started in 1993 and its first two phases has been completed at a
cost of 70 billion Singapore dollars (42 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The terminal enjoys a high level of automation and is capable
of handling up to one million TEUs per berth per annum.
</P>
<P>
Yeo Ning Hong, chairman of the Port of Singapore Authority
Corporation, told the opening ceremony that the terminal is a new
generation of port with three decades of container terminal
expertise and experience applied in its design and construction
for superior customer service quality, high productivity,
reliability, flexibility, cost efficiency and responsiveness to
customers' needs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Goh said the terminal is designed not
only to meet its customers' current needs but also their future
demands.
</P>
<P>
He said that technologically, the Pasir Panjang Terminal boasts
many advanced handling features and its remote-controlled bridge
cranes are the first of its kind in the world with an operator
able to control up to four bridge cranes at one time.
</P>
<P>
Billing ports as the lifeline of Singapore's economy, Goh said:
"We should develop Singapore into a leading international maritime
center by leveraging on our existing strengths in financial
services, IT, telecommunications and transportation."
</P>
<P>
Pasir Panjang Terminal, the fourth container handling terminal
in Singapore, is the newest and most advanced compared to the
other three and with its opening Singapore has a total of 37
berths, 120 quay cranes, 3,700 reefer points and 65,000 ground
slots.

<HEADLINE> Third Summons Issued to Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General's
Office Thursday served a third summons on former president
Soeharto to be questioned next Monday in connection with his
alleged involvement in corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
"The third summons has been delivered to Soeharto by a courier.
We have asked him to come for questioning on Monday," Director of
Corruption at the Attorney General's Office Chairul Imam said.
</P>
<P>
He said if the 78-year-old Soeharto failed to meet the third
summons on acceptable grounds, the Attorney General's Office would
assign a team of prosecutors to do the questioning at his
residence in accordance with article 113 of the Criminal Code.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto failed to meet the second summons on Thursday citing
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Imam said the Attorney General's Office based its actions on
the medical statement issued by a team of doctors from the Cipto
Mangunkusumo hospital that Soeharto is fit enough to undergo
questioning.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was named as a suspect for alleged corruption during
his 32-year-rule after Attorney General Marzuki Darusman decided
to reopen the case in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. business magazine Forbes last year estimated Soeharto'
s family fortune at some 4 billion U.S. dollars. The Time magazine
of the U.S. has put the figure at about 15 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Benefit From Oil Production Increase: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The decision made by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to elevate
oil production will benefit the OPEC member countries and other
oil-producing countries including Angola, said Angolan Oil
Minister Botelho de Vasconcelos here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It will give Angola's oil industry a good perspective and help
the country improve its revenue from this sector, he said soon
after his arrival at the Luanda airport from Vienna, Austria,
where he participated the 109th OPEC meeting held between March 27
and 29.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during the OPEC meeting, nine of the 11
member countries decided to augment the level of the oil
production. Angola is not an OPEC member.
</P>
<P>
This decision will help stabilize the oil price in the
international market which is expected to range between 20 to 25
U.S. dollars per barrel, Vasconcelos said.
</P>
<P>
Among the member countries of OPEC are Iraq, Iran, Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Libya, Nigeria and Indonesia.

ADDIS ABABA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The wild fire in Borena
region in southern Ethiopia has been completely snuffed out with
the help of rainfall, the Ethiopian News Agency reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The wild fire, which had been raging over 35,000 hectares of
natural forest, was fully extinguished by the rains that continued
for two days, said Jemal Abas, chairman of the Zonal Council, in
Negelle town about 500 kilometers south of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Before the rainfall, Abas said, bush fire in some parts of the
region had already been snuffed out by public efforts.
</P>
<P>
About 97,000 people had joined in the fire fighting operation,
he said, adding that the operation had also got the support of
South African and German fire fighters.
</P>
<P>
More than 34 vehicles and two helicopters were deployed by
various governmental organizations, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Warns White Farmers Over Sabotaging Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday strongly warned some white commercial farmers against
sabotaging the land redistribution program by aligning with
outside forces to topple the government of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
The president made the warning when he spoke to 5,000 people at
 Dromoland Farm during the launch of the second phase of the
Matebeleland North resettlement program in west Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The country continues to face a negative attitude from the
commercial farming community which has been resisting government
efforts to acquire land for redistribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These farmers are being used by the British government to
fight against our land resettlement program," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the commercial farmers have even aligned
themselves with the labour-backed Movement for Democratic Change
in a desperate move to recolonize the country.
</P>
<P>
"To add insult to injury, they would not offer the government
alternative properties for resettlement. Instead, some of them
have gone further and inflicted violence on our war veterans who
demonstrated for land they fought for," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, a total of 91 farms had been made available
for resettlement of 1,685 families countrywide. This brings the
total number of farms available for resettlement during the second
phase to 110.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has set
the coming Sunday, April 2, as a national inter-denominational
prayer service day in memory of hundreds of people killed in the
Kanungu church fire on March 17.
</P>
<P>
 A press statement issued by the Minister for Presidency
Ruhakana Rugunda said that the prayers, to be attended by national
leaders, diplomats and the general public, would be conducted by
Vice President Specioza Kazibwe.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence so far unearthed has demonstrated that large numbers
of people, including children, were murdered at Kanungu and other
doomsday cult locations," the statement said, adding that the body
count has grown to nearly one thousand people.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Kazibwe would deliver a message of condolence
from the government to console the surviving relatives and assure
that the country is taking actions in pursuit of the criminal
perpetrators of the tragic killings, so that those responsible are
brought to book.
</P>
<P>
On March 17, more than 530 members of the cult Movement for the
 Restoration of Ten Commandments of God were burnt to death.
Hundreds of bodies of murdered cultists have also been exhumed and
reburied by police at several locations in the region following
the Kanungu incident. So far, more than 920 people are confirmed
to be murdered by cult leaders.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Arrests 16 Liberian Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone Friday said it had
arrested a group of 16 Liberian dissidents suspected of plotting
to cross into neighboring Liberia and destabilize it.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Freetown quoted a presidential
statement, as broadcast by state radio, as saying that the arrests
had been made by West African Peacekeeping forces (ECOMOG) and
government security agents in a forest near the two countries'
border on March 22.
</P>
<P>
It said the arrests were in line with a non-aggression pact
signed by Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea under which each
country undertook to prevent their territory being used as a
springboard for attacks by dissidents against the other. Sierra
Leone's National Security Advisor, Sheka Mansaray, told Reuters:
"I can safely say that the 16 men had the intention of causing
instability in our sister republic of Liberia."
</P>
<P>
Liberia ended a seven-year civil war with multi-party elections
in 1997. Its president, Charles Taylor, a former warlord, has
traditionally close links with Sierra Leone's rebels. Sierra Leone
is emerging from an eight-
year civil war following a 1999 peace deal.

Pretoria. The Malian president was on a one-day working visit to

</P>
<P>
The 14-nation SADC and 15-nation ECOWAS provided a strong basis

Konare said that only through African integration could
Mbeki's vision of an African Renaissance be realized.

"We are absolutely convinced that it is now the time to
accelerate these initiatives. This corresponds with the
expectations of our own people and the problems of the African
continent," Konare said.
</P>
<P>
Konare urged South Africa to increase its investments in
Mali and the rest of the ECOWAS region. Several South African
companies are already operating in Mali, notably mining giant
Anglogold.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said at an official banquet later Friday that South
Africa and Mali must "use our respective capabilities to
contribute to each other's all-round development and selflessly to
serve the cause of the peoples of our continent."
</P>
<P>
"We will have to ensure that Africa takes her rightful place
among the nations of our common universe (and is) no longer an
object of pity or contempt (but) capable of giving practical
expression to the high ideals of African solidarity, a shared
destiny and African unity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Bombs Residential Areas in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel bombed residential areas in
south Lebanon Friday morning, Lebanese News Agency reported. But
there was no report of casualties so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel fired about 40 rounds from the occupied buffer zone to
the village of Mujdala Zun in the west sector of south Lebanon, in
which several houses were damaged, Lebanese security source said.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone
in 1985 in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is
spearheading a guerrilla war in the zone to oust Israeli troops and
their ally South Lebanon Army from south Lebanon, the last active
Arab-Israeli battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government decided in March to back a pledge by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to pull out Israeli troops from south Lebanon
by July, with or without a peace agreement with Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli attacks on suspected guerrilla targets in the
region have turned into almost daily occurences.

WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
for manufactured goods decreased 0.8 percent in February as orders
for transportation equipment dropped sharply, the Commerce

New orders for durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last

Transportation equipment, led by aircraft and parts, had the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Doubles Iraq's Funds for Oil Spare parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday decided to double the funds that Iraq
can use to import oil spare parts in a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution which was unanimously adopted, Iraq can
draw 600 million U.S. dollars from its oil revenues in a period of
six months to import oil spare parts and equipment for its
dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The move came after U.N.Secretary-General Kofi Annan made the
recommendation in a report last week.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan said he was very concerned with the
deteriorating condition of the oil industry of Iraq as reconfirmed
by a recent survey conducted by a group of experts that he set up.
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that the decline in the condition of all
sectors of the industry continues, and is accelerating in some
cases," Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
U.N.Security Council adopted a resolution in 1998 which
allowed Iraq to use 300 million dollars to import the oil spare
parts and equipment in a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program began to be implemented
in late 1996 which was aimed to ease the suffering of Iraqi people
under the U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Hope for Stronger Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- French and German finance ministers
said on Friday that they hope the European single currency euro
will become stronger as the economies of the two countries are
showing signs of stable growth.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry Laurent Fabius
and his German counterpart Hans Eichel expressed the hope during
their first meeting on Friday in Grenoble near the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
Fabius took over the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry
this week from Christian Sautter in a government reshuffle by
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
``Our interest is that the euro will be strengthened. A strong
economy should be accompanied by a strong money,'' said Fabius,
while Eichel claimed: ``The evolution of the European growth
justifies a stronger value of the euro.''
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the weakness of the euro in comparison with
the U.S. dollar is caused by a more powerful economic growth in
the United States, which stood at 4.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
France registered a 2.7 percent growth in gross domestic
product in 1999, while Germany's growth rate was 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
French officials estimate that France will see a growth from 3.
4 percent to 3.8 percent this year, while Germany expects a 2.5
percent growth.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Conversion of Defense Nuclear Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin stressed Friday that the country should effectively
restructure and convert the defense sector's nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
"Today we need a well thought-out and wise conversion, taking
into account all the economic and social consequences," Putin told
a meeting at the Federal Nuclear Center in Snezhinsk.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to drag out conversion, then further infusions
of budget funds will be ineffective," the Interfax news agency
quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite an increase of 16 percent in the electricity output of
Russia's nuclear power plants, lack of funding and many consumers'
failure to pay the bill are taking their toll on the industry,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to pay electricity bills is a signal for the start to
bankruptcy proceedings at a company, no matter how important it
may be," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Putin also pointed to the problem of lower power prices. "Low
rates are a serious problem. Exporters should not have to provide
low rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our foreign partners are not averse to taking advantage of
that situation. Often they who deliver raw materials to Russia and
process them here operate parasitically," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"The atomic industry is a very important component of Russia's
fuel and energy sector. The problems of the nuclear plants should
not be treated as separate from the entire sector, from the entire
economy,"he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev was also present at the
meeting. He said the pressing task this year in advancing the
country's nuclear arms complex was to keep the central nuclear
test site in Novaya Zemlya in operating condition, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Novaya Zemlya is an archipelago of north central Russia in the
Arctic Ocean between the Barents and Kara seas.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a closed administrative territorial unit in
the archipelago could facilitate this, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need for better social security for
those working in the nuclear arms complex. "Nuclear safety depends
directly on that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Grants 180 Million U.S. Dollars to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Germany
have taken positive steps to promote bilateral ties over the past
six years, with the contribution of the latter to the development
of the former amounting to about 1.2 billion rand (about 180
million U.S. dollars). This was revealed in Pretoria on
Friday after the second session of the Bi-national Commission
chaired by South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma and visiting
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Fischer and Zuma told reporters that the contribution had been
evenly split for financial and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to form a committee on culture besides
committees on defence, development, economics, environment and
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a pact on cooperation in the areas of
 education and training, science, arts and youth exchanges.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Germany held the first session of Bi-national
Commission in 1997. There has been a regular transfer and exchange
of scientists and technological know-how since then.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, ministers from both countries agreed to
work together on clean production technologies, waste management,
recultivation of mining areas, environmentally friendly energy
supply, sound tourism and sustainable use of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Zuma expressed satisfaction with the talks, saying: "The
outcome will contribute to the improvement of the quality of life
of all South Africans. The deliberations have contributed
significantly towards... South Africa's relationship with Germany
and will provide impetus for even closer cooperation in the
future."

NAIROBI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Local leaders, women and youth
representatives from six prefectures have expressed their support
to the proposal of Paul Kagame as Rwandan president for the
remaining transitional period, Rwanda News Agency reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In consideration of circumstances prevailing in the country,
Kagame is the appropriate and capable candidate for the presidency
in the remaining transitional period," they said at an extra

</P>
<P>
"Paul Kagame should be entrusted with security matters and

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Strengthens Border Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister Steven
Kavuma said here Friday that Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF)
have improved security in all the border areas suffering from
incursion of rebels.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Ministry of Information Friday
afternoon, the minister said that both the rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) in the north and the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) in the west have been frustrated and dislodged.
</P>
<P>
"The UPDF have reduced the number of rebels active in Uganda
dramatically. We have recovered a lot of ammunition and logistic
support from the rebels," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The army has recovered 31 rifles, 18 grenades, six bombs and
120 TNT blocks from the LRA rebels since they entered northern
Uganda on December 23 last year," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that over 40 rebels fighting the government have so far
reported and surrendered to the government troops.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we are monitoring Mai Mai rebels and
Interahamwe in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to ensure
security of our borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kavuma, his troops would continue to block
remnants of the rebel groups from entering Uganda from neighboring
countries and would ask the rebels to take advantage of the
recently passed Amnesty Law so that they could be re-integrated
into the society.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has at least three rebel groups fighting the government
from the north, the northwest and the west respectively. The
government troops have much been involved in detecting and
killing the rebels who are targeting soft targets in their
terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Vows Not to Go Against Lusaka Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma said here Friday that his country would
never go against the Lusaka agreement penned by all the parties
involved in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly convinced that the agreement is the most viable
way of solving the DRC issue. Uganda is observing both the letter
and the spirit of the Lusaka agreement," he said at a press
conference Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He downplayed the report of potential clash between Ugandan
troops and Rwanda-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy based in
Goma, saying that the incident is by no means as serious as
reported by the media.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, since our last clash in Kisangani last August, we
have set up a committee which is still actively working. We are
doing all we can to stop the situation from deteriorating in the
DRC," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kavuma, the Joint Military Commission would
convene a meeting in Kampala next week to review the progress so
far made in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.N. peacekeepers would be
deployed in time so that all the parties to the 19-month-long
conflict can benefit from the deployment.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops into the DRC to allegedly protect its
borders soon after the civil war broke out there. These troops
have remained in the eastern part of the third largest African
country ever since.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council unanimously okayed a resolution on
February 24 to deploy U.N. peacekeepers in the DRC to monitor the
implementation of the Lusaka peace accord.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) trade ministers announced here on Friday that
they have decided to establish a regional common market on
September 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Trade Minister Iddi Simba, who chaired the meeting of
 the SADC trade ministers, said "we hope that after this meeting
we shall see a definite plan of action which will lead to the
establishment of a genuine common market in the SADC area."
</P>
<P>
The decision, however, will be subject to approval by the SADC
summit scheduled for Windhoek, Namibia in August, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Simba, senior officials from 14 SADC member states
will meet in the Namibian capital next month to elaborate on an
efficient dispute mechanism for the SADC.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's meeting, the trade ministers approved an agreement
on trade in the textiles and clothing sector, including the
creation of a textiles and clothing committee entrusted to
continue negotiating outstanding issues.

continue negotiating a sugar cooperation agreement for the SADC,
and charged the SADC trade negotiation forum to finalize
negotiations on member states' offers for preferential market
access without delay.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Threatens to Declare Economic War Against Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday said that his country may be forced to declare an economic
war against Britain which he accused of using flimsy pretexts to
stifle the land redistribution process in his country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was speaking at the launch of the second phase of the
land resettlement program at Dromoland Farm in Matebeleland North
province in west Zimbabwe where 231 families from Bubi, Umguza and
Nyathi districts would be resettled soon, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The president accused Britain of being in the forefront in
denouncing Zimbabwe internationally to the extent of blocking
financial assistance to the country from international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"The country is now under sanctions just because we are simply
insisting on equitable distribution of land," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is prepared to declare an economic war against the
British government which has a big interest especially in the
country's mining industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, the British government generates a total
of 10 million U.S. dollars every year from the country through
their ownership of various companies such as Rio Tinto and Lonrho.
</P>
<P>
"And as such we can sanction them better than they can as we
are servicing their economy heavily," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would not continue to live as an extension of
Britain but would learn to stand on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
"We can only do that if we unite and work together to achieve
equitable land redistribution as the first step to revamping our
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dromoland Farm was bought by the government for resettlement in
1995 and comprises of 23,749 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company to Invest in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
LUANDA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Haier Group, a Chinese company
specializing in production of household electric-appliances, is to
establish a factory in Angola with an investment estimated at some
11 million U.S. dollars, said an official of the group here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Angolan Sol Dourado Group, a Haier
delegation paid a two-day visit to the southwest African country
starting from Thursday, during which the two companies signed an
agreement on the start of the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, the first phase of the project is
estimated at some six million U.S. dollars while the second phase
will cost some five million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Antonio de Sousa, administrator of the Sol Dourado Group, said
that the project will benefit the Angolans since the factory will
produce refrigerators, washing machines, television sets,
equipment and parts of air conditioners in the country.
</P>
<P>
The factory, which is to be located in the Angolan capital
Luanda, will create some 700 jobs for the Angolans, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice President of Haier Group Chai Yongsen, Angola
is an ideal place for Chinese investment because of its internal
market and geographic position which will permit Haier to expand
its coverage to the south and west parts of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Haier Group, a large-scale Chinese firm specialized in the
production of household electric appliances, exports its products
to over 35 countries in Southeast Asia, Middle East, South
America, the United States, Russia and East Europe.

</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is seeking another meeting
on the ongoing fighting in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the State House, the president
urged all political parties involved in the DRC conflict to give
opportunity to former Botswana President, Ketumile Masire, who is
appointed by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as
facilitator on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between Zambia and Angola, Chiluba said
Zambia is a peace-loving country. "We don't want to get involved
in any war fighting against any other neighboring countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia's silence over the recent cross border attacks
by suspected Angolan rebels, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), should not be misconstrued as
cowardice.
</P>
<P>
Zambia would not allow itself to be drawn into armed conflict
with any country in the region as that would be going against its
policy of good neighborliness, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Zambia and Angola, both as member states of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the
Southern African Development community (SADC), should keep in
peace.
</P>
<P>
"We still have peace relations with all the neighboring
countries," he said, adding that the purpose for Zambia to send
some military forces to the border area with Angola is to maintain
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Zambia's forthcoming election, the president
re-confirmed that he will not stand for presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to follow the examples of other African
leaders in terms of choosing successors, like South African former
president Nelson Mandela and Tanzanian former president Julius
Nyerere.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Lankan Rebel Offensive Casts Doubt Over Peace Talks  By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops and
Tamil Tiger rebels clashed for a fifth straight day on Friday with
sporadic fighting reported from the northernmost Jaffna peninsula,
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said government troops were consolidating along the A-9
highway, the main supply route which Tamil Tiger rebels have tried
to cut off to isolate military camps located in the peninsula's
south, as a part of the offensive to recapture the Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the latest offensive since Monday by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Jaffna peninsula has
cast a shadow of doubt over the proposed talks between the
government and the rebels to reach a negotiated political
settlement of the bloody conflict which has plagued the island
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the LTTE rebels claimed they had overrun a key
military base on the southeastern area of the peninsula, which was
tacitly conceded by the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said in a statement they took the Thalaiyadi-
Maruthankerni-Chempianpattu army complex after an intense 12-hour
battle that ended around noon Wednesday. More than 100 government
soldiers were said to be killed in the fighting while the rebels
put their own losses at 25 dead.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting prompted an emergency meeting on Wednesday
of the National Security Council convened by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga who summoned the commanders of the three services and
other officials of the council to review the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the gains made by the LTTE rebels came on a day
when the fourth round of talks opened between Kumaratunga and
opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe on evolving a consensus on
constitutional reform proposals to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks, which concluded on Thursday, centered around
the composition and responsibility of ministers at the provincial
level. The next round of talks will take place next week.
</P>
<P>
The political fallout of the military offensive is significant
in the context of Jaffna's geopolitical importance in the long-
running civil war between government troops and LTTE rebels, who
have been fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Government troops captured the Jaffna peninsula from the rebels
in 1996, but since then the LTTE rebels have been trying to retake
their former stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Jaffna said the LTTE has pressed into service over
1,500 heavily-armed cadres, mostly gunmen from its suicide units,
to capture the beach heads on the eastern side of the peninsula.
They appear to have taken control of a long stretch of land
sandwiched between a lagoon and the sea coast.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the rebels would continue to focus
their military might on the peninsula although continuous fighting
has inflicted heavy casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said Thursday that at least 80 soldiers
and five officers had been killed in the fighting since Monday
while another 613 soldiers were wounded, most with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not say how many LTTE rebels were killed
during the period, but said earlier that the guerrillas suffered "
over 150 casualties."
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting between government troops and the
guerrillas comes as part of a LTTE offensive since March 27, with
the LTTE moving closer to the vital Elephant Pass military camp -
the largest and most-fortified Sri Lanka army base in the battle
zone at the entrance of the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"If Jaffna is gone militarily, the political efforts could well
be considered over," a political leader said, adding that the
southern pressure against the present peace efforts had prompted
hard-liners to call for an escalation of the military efforts.
</P>
<P>
Though the government is tightlipped over the fate of the
direct talks with LTTE rebels, which were agreed upon by both
sides last month after prolonged efforts by the Norwegian
government, analysts here believed there is little possibility of
holding peace talks in the near future due to the current fighting,
which may be escalating into a full-scale war.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Get 2 Bln U.S. Dollars in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah A.
M.S. Kibria Friday said donors would provide Bangladesh with
nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars as development assistance to the
country for the fiscal year 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen on aid commitment of donors prior to the
meeting of Bangladesh Development Forum to be held in Paris on
April 13-14, Kibria said the indicative level of donors'
assistance could range between 1.8 and 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a letter of the World Bank's Country Director
Frederick Temple to the finance minister about the aid flow
indication, Kibria said the aid flow would be significantly higher
if the pace of reforms is accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The development partners emphasized that the realization of aid
will depend on accelerated progress in policy and institutional
reform and faster utilization of the existing aid pipeline, Kibria
said, noting that the aid in pipeline from July 1999 to March 2000
was 1.028 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the aid package would help the
country's budgetary planning and the aid flow would increase as
the government is trying to accelerate the pace of reform programs
and ensure accountability.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on the causes of delay in project
implementation, Kibria said there is a time gap between aid
commitment and disbursement.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the aid package program is not a straight payment
program, but a complicated reform-oriented one, which depends on
the pace of reform, he said, adding that the rate of project
implementation is increasing day by day following the procedural
simplification.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Regrets India's Rejection of Dialogue Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday regretted India
's rejection of its offer for resumption of bilateral dialogue to
resolve outstanding disputes between them.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects that India wants to continue with its
belligerent attitude," Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said
here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new Foreign Secretary Inam-ul-Haq Wednesday met with
Indian High Commissioner to Islamabad P. Parthasarathy and
formally proposed resumption of the stalled talks between the two
arch rivals, said Altaf.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should take notice of India
's "negative attitude."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resolve
its disputes with India, especially the thorny Kashmir issue for
which the two countries had fought two of their three wars.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf said last
week, while meeting with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton,
that his country is ready for a dialogue with India "anywhere, at
any time and at any level."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income, Spending Rise in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Americans' income increased in
February but their spending rose more than twice as fast, pulling
the nation's savings rate down to an all-time monthly low, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by 0.4 percent last month, the slowest pace
since December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumer spending rose 1 percent, bringing the
personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of after-tax income,
down to 0.8 percent in February, a record monthly low. In January,
the rate was 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In January, income grew by 0.7 percent, while spending
increased by 0.6 percent, slightly higher than the government
previously reported. It was the first time since October that
income rose faster than spending.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve last week boosted interest rates for a
fifth time since June 30 to slow the speeding economy, which grew
at a breakneck 7.3 percent rate in the final three months of last
year, and to keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
Even though the higher rates made borrowing more expensive for
consumers and businesses, they haven't yet significantly slowed
the economy or its main engine, consumer spending, which accounts
for two-thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the central bank will bump up rates
again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
In February, Americans' spending on nondurable goods, such as
food and fuel, rose a sizable 1.4 percent in February, following
an 0.8 percent decline the month before.
</P>
<P>
For durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last at least
three years, such as cars and washing machines, spending grew by a
brisk 1.5 percent last month, down from 2.4 percent in January.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Divided on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) - UK businesses are firmly split over
whether to join the single European currency, euro, according to
the biggest ever survey on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous polls, which tend to show a majority in favor
of ditching the pound, the latest from the British Chambers of
Commerce (BCC) shows that the business community is now evenly
divided.
</P>
<P>
While 38 percent favor a commitment to join the euro, 36
percent want the government to rule out membership for the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
The BCC has abandoned its policy in favor in principle of
joining the euro when the economic conditions are right and is now
neutral about membership.
</P>
<P>
The results contrast sharply with a BCC consultation in 1997,
which suggested that two-thirds of members backed entry.
</P>
<P>
The director general of the BCC, Chris Humphries, said :"
Compare with other recent business surveys on the single currency,
this shows an increasing polarization of business opinion between
pro and anti-euro camps."
</P>
<P>
"If government wishes to retain the option of joining the
single currency after the next election, it must give serious
consideration to how it will promote the benefits to the business
community, which clearly remains unconvinced," he added.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Sweden to Extend Military Cooperation: Defense Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- German and Swedish defense
ministers, in a meeting held here Friday, expressed the agreement
that their two countries should extend military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At an invitation of German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping,
Swedish Minister of National Defense Bjoern von Sydow arrived in
Berlin earlier in the day on a visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Scharping said that cooperation between
Germany and Sweden was good, but it should still be improved
within the frame of the European security and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that the European armed forces should
strengthen further cooperation for a clear international policy,
which applies not only to NATO members, but also to Non-NATO
members, according to German news media.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Sweden want at first a closer cooperation in the
region of Baltic Sea within the Baltic nations and Russia, the two
defense chiefs agreed.
</P>
<P>
Sydow stressed the interests of both countries in good
cooperation with Russia. The two ministers agreed that after
Vladimir Putin's election as the Russian President, the
prerequisites have been created for improvement, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Although not a NATO member, Sweden plays an important role in
the northern wing of Europe.

MOSCOW -- About 2,036 Russian servicemen have been killed and 6,
076 wounded in the anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus,
a ranking Russian military officer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent losses incurred in fighting in both
Dagestan and Chechnya, the Interfax news agency quoted First
Deputy Chief of the General Staff Colonel General Valery Manilov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the last week alone, 45 Russian servicemen were killed and
151 wounded, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military campaign started last September following
Chechen armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a series of
explosions that killed more than 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities. The blasts were also blamed on Chechen
militants. (Russia-Chechnya)

MOGADISHU -- Three United Nations officials have escaped death
after Somali gunmen in the southern port town of Kismaio fired
upon an airplane carrying them on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from Kismaio, 500 kilometers south of
Mogadishu, the gunmen Thursday opened fire on the plane as it took
off from an airport, 10 kilometers west of the town.
</P>
<P>
Three senior officials from the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) including the regional deputy director Edward Beidbager
were on board the plane heading for the town of Baidoa when their
plane came under the attack.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Handover of Land Fund of Macao SAR Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- With a total sum of 10.185 billion
patacas (about 1.27 billion U.S. dollars), the land fund of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) was handed over to the
Macao SAR government Friday night.
</P>
<P>
On December 20 last year, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, on
behalf of the central government, had handed the certificate of
the land fund to Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the Macao
SAR. However, relevant accounts were not settled well until Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
During the period, large quantities of documents concerning the
land fund were gradually handed over to the SAR government, said
Yang Runzhen, former chief representative of the Chinese
delegation of the Sino-Portuguese Land Group.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration signed in
1987, all income obtained by the Portuguese Macao government from
granting new land leases and renewing leases shall, after the
deduction of the cost of land production, be shared equally
between the Portuguese Macao government and the future Macao SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
The part of land fund belonging to the Macao SAR government had
been kept and managed well by the Chinese delegation of the Sino-
Portuguese Land Group before the establishment of the Macao SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
The land fund of the Macao SAR includes two parts: the land
income itself and the earnings from banking deposits and
investment. Over the past years, the Chinese delegation managed to
bring about the greatest profits at a lower cost.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years and more, the part of income of the SAR
from land deals added up to 6.9 billion patacas (862.5 million
dollars), and banking interest and investment returns were about 3.
27 billion patacas (408.75 million dollars), Yang Runzhen said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao SAR government has entrusted its subordinate Macao
Monetary Authority to manage the fund, said Francis Tam Pak Un,
secretary for economy and finance of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an order from the chief executive, the fund
will be set aside as a special kind of fund and a consultation
committee will be set up to ensure good management and use, Tam
Pak Un said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Take Part in International Genome Research Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
working on an international genome research project are likely to
complete their work ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang Meng, a spokesman for the Chinese researchers from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), told Xinhua in an exclusive
interview that scientists have almost finished their quota of
sequencing 30 million base-pairs of the human chromosomes. They
expect to finish by early April.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the international program was initiated in
1990, aiming at deciphering human genomes, each containing 60,000-
100,000 genes and some three billion base-pairs, which determine
the health and longevity of human beings.
</P>
<P>
In September of 1999, Chinese scientists were admitted into the
project, at an international conference held in London, to work
with their counterparts from the United States, Japan, Germany,
France and Britain. China was the only developing nation to
participate in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientists have been asked to decipher one percent
of the three billion base-pairs of the human genomes.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese expert said it is not very difficult to
sequence the human genomes with the help of modern technology.
China's participation in the international project is aimed at
carrying out large-scale genome-squencing projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, 90 percent of human genomes will be sequenced to
enable all the scientists participating in the international
project to produce a "draft". By 2003, a final "draft" is expected
to be finished with 100 percent of the human genomes sequenced,
with 99.9 percent accuracy rate.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Boqin, a scholar from the CAS, said last year, chromosome
22 was completely deciphered by the international research group.
</P>
<P>
To sequence all the genomes lays a foundation to decipher the
genetic code of humans, he said, noting that sequencing will help
scientists better recognize the complex network of the human body.
Sequencing may also help develop genetics-based therapies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bitter Options in Store for Turkish PM by Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Speculations are rampant here on
Friday about what option Turkish Prime Minister Bulent will make
after a constitutional amendment bill allowing for the president's
re-election failed to be approved in the first round of voting in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit had lobbied hard for the passage of the constitutional
amendment in the parliament to allow President Suleyman Demirel,
whose single seven-year term is to expire on May 16 this year, to
serve a second term.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit repeatedly argued that the 76-year-old president
constitutes a "guarantee of stability" in Turkey and his staying in
office is crucial for the success of the country's economic
programs required by the European Union and international financial
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The political and economic stability of Turkey is based on very
sensitive balances," Ecevit told reporters Thursday before flying
to India for a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
"I have been trying to prevent this balance from being upset.
Now, I am concerned about that."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, 531 deputies from the 550-member parliament
cast their secret ballots in the first round of voting for Ecevit's
proposal which would reduce the president's term from seven to five
years, but allow for a second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Only 303 voted in favor, 202 against, 11 abstained, 6 invalid
and 9 papers void. The 303 "yes" votes were far short of the
required minimum of 330 votes for an amendment to be legislated.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit had been promised the backing of 324 deputies out of the
351 deputies belonging to his Democratic Left Party (DSP), the
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the Motherland Party (ANAP),
which form the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He had also managed to gain a promise of 82 "yes" votes from the
opposition True Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
The result showed that most ANAP deputies are against President
Demirel's extension in office and, to make things worse, quite a
few DYP deputies joined the forces against Demirel who just came
from this party.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who said he had the backing of
his coalition partners, the MHP and ANAP, is clearly embarrassed.
He saw that he does not have the backing promised him. He feels
betrayed," observed Ilnur Cevic, a noted columnist, in Turkish
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Despite the grave setback at the first round, it was reported,
the government still has a 50 percent chance of pushing the package
through the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Questioned whether he was considering resigning over the
crushing defeat, Ecevit said he would consider all options,
including resignation.
</P>
<P>
However, there are wide speculations that Ecevit has two options
before the second round of voting which is set on April 5.
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, the government has to pay a much higher
price to the pro-Islamic, major opposition Virtue Party (FP) in an
attempt to woo it to agree on keeping Demirel in office.
</P>
<P>
The FP, founded at the ashes of the banned fundamentalist
Welfare Party in 1998, is now embroiled in a closure case. It is
not satisfied with the proposed change on Article 69, part of the
three-item amendment package, which would make party closures more
difficult than in the past. It wants the kind of changes which
would render party closures completely impossible.
</P>
<P>
If, over the coming days, Ecevit offers sufficient concessions
to the FP and thus saves the party from closure as well as eases
the political bans against Islamic leaders, he will get FP's
backing for Demirel.
</P>
<P>
But in so doing it may also prove, to some extent, to be
counterproductive. Some deputies who already voted in favor
Wednesday may find these concessions excessive and vote against the
package in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Second, Ecevit may try hard to keep the parliament in order by
persuading partner leaders to bring their deputies under stricter
control in order to vote for Demirel. But that mission looks
difficult, if not impossible, as votes are cast in a secret way.
</P>
<P>
Looking tired and worried, Ecevit declared at the airport before
departure for New Dehli that his government will not retract the
amendment proposal before next week's second round of voting.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Shares India's Concern Over Terrorism: Turkish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here on Friday that his country shared India's concern
over cross-border terrorism and was determined to deal with the
menace without deviating from democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has suffered a great deal on account of terrorism
sponsored from outside the country," said Ecevit, who is here on a
three-day official visit. "Just like India we are determined to
deal with terrorism without deviating from democracy and human
rights."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leader met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, Home Minister L K Advani and several other Indian
cabinet members on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to an Indian foreign office spokesman, India and
Turkey are scheduled to sign three accords, respectively on
agricultural cooperation, establishment of a mechanism for
political consultations between the foreign ministries of the two
countries and extension of the Indo-Turkish cultural exchange
program, during Ecevit's visit.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement would also be issued at the end of the visit
focusing on future orientation of the Indo-Turkish relations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has said it views the visit as a "very important" one
as it could pave the way for further consolidation of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
A business delegation came with the Turkish prime minister for
the fourth meeting of the Indo-Turkish Joint Business Council,
during which the two sides would discuss steps for further
enhancing their economic and trade ties.

<HEADLINE> India To Set Up Special Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to boost exports,
India Friday announced a package of export and import policies
including the establishment of two free trade zones, the
conversion of four existing export zones into free trade zones and
the removal of import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Commerce and Industry Minister Murasoli Maran told the media
here that the free trade zones, or Special Economic Zones to be
set up on the Chinese model, would be established in the western
state of Gujarat and the southern Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the new export and import policy aimed at achieving
the target of over 20 percent export growth for the coming fiscal
year beginning April 1, Maran said the government had decided to
remove quantitative import restrictions on a wide range of 714
items.
</P>
<P>
The minister said India was obliged to remove the restrictions
as the Dispute Settlement Panel of the World Trade Organization (
WTO) had ruled against New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
India had earlier signed an agreement with the United States to
remove the restrictions on the remaining 1,429 tariff lines by
April 1, 2001, of which 714 items were to be removed by April 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
The items included milk, pepper, common salt, cigarettes,
electronics, coffee, paper, woven fabrics, garments, spices, soft
drinks, fruits squash and frozen fish.
</P>
<P>
The phased removal of import restrictions followed a bilateral
agreement with the United States after India lost an appeal before
the dispute settlement body of the WTO on a dispute raised by the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
Maran described fears in the industrial sector of dumping from
abroad as exaggerated and unfounded, saying the industry could
approach the anti-dumping or the safeguard directorates for relief.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his confidence that the new policy would not hurt
India's industry, the minister added that the government had the
tariff barrier to provide adequate protection to domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
The proposed free trade zones will have full flexibility in
operations, duty-free import of capital goods and raw materials
with freedom to access them from the domestic tariff area without
payment of terminal export duty.
</P>
<P>
Maran disclosed his intention to set up the free trade zones
after his visit to China last February.
</P>
<P>
In a major effort to rationalize the existing export promoting
schemes and to improve availability of inputs or raw materials for
exports, Maran decided to introduce a post-export duty-free
replenishment scheme for over 5,000 export products.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the government was likely to allow
foreign direct investment of up to 100 percent in the special
economic zones.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a series of initiatives to boost exports of
gems and jewelers, drugs and pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals and
bio-technology, leather, handicrafts, garments, silk, granite and
minerals.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Plane Under Attack in South Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Three United Nations officials
have escaped death after Somali gunmen in the southern port town
of Kismaio fired upon an airplane that they were on board
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from Kismaio, 500 kilometers south of
Mogadishu, the gunmen Thursday opened fire on the plane as it took
off from an airport, 10 kilometers west of the town.
</P>
<P>
Three senior officials from the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) including the regional deputy director Edward Beidbager
were on board the plane heading for the town of Baidoa when their
plane came under the attack.
</P>
<P>
The high UNICEF delegation, which arrived in Kismaio on Monday,
was aimed at assessing the situation in the town for a possible
resumption of the U.N. relief activities in the region for the
first time since last June.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, two rounds of bullets penetrated
the plane with one of them hitting the chair of one of the
delegates. Despite the deafening fire on the plane, the pilot
courageously continued his flight and made it land safely in
Baidoa town.
</P>
<P>
Even though none of the UNICEF staff members were wounded, the
three U.N. officials, in state of terror and anger, were
immediately evacuated to Kenya's capital Nairobi on another plane
while the damaged plane belonging to the United Nations Common Air
Service was taken for repairs to Mandera town of Kenya along the
border with Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack against the U.N. plane is not known.
However reports from Kismaio indicated that clannish fighting has
been continuing between the Marehan and Awramaleh clans living in
and outside the town in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
It is now believed that the armed confrontation between the two
sides has spread to the airport area which lies exactly in the
middle of the Awramaleh clan-dominated Abdalleh Biroleh village
and the Kismaio town where the Marehan clan is among the strongest
communities.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the U.N. plane seemed to have been carried out by
the Awramaleh fighters angered by the merciless attack of the
Marehan fighters against their village two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, this incident will have a serious negative impact
against the poor humanitarian situation in the region.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Ugandan police pulled another 81 bodies, most of them women
and children, from yet another mass grave Thursday on a property
associated with the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God doomsday cult, bringing the total number of
dead to 725 since March 17, when 330 charred bodies were found in
a makeshift church that had been burned down.
</P>
<P>
-- With tensions fast rising in Florida over the fate of 6-year-
old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez, the case vaulted into the U.S.
presidential campaign Thursday as Vice President Al Gore endorsed
special legislation that would grant permanent resident status to
the boy, his father and other family members now living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- After two days of debate, the U.S. House on Thursday
approved an emergency spending bill of 12.7 billion U.S. dollars
whose centerpiece commits the Untied States to train and equip
Colombia's security forces to combat drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
-- When Turkey's Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit boarded a plane
Thursday to begin a state visit to India, he left behind a country
that suddenly seemed on the edge of political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy grew at its strongest pace in more than 16
years in the fourth quarter, but several Federal Reserve officials
said the rate wasn't enough to justify more aggressive moves to
fend off possible inflation.
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan denied that the U.S.
central bank is attempting to talk down the country's highflying
stock markets, saying the Fed is simply worried that the country's
rapid economic growth may stoke inflation.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Summer Fishing Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to enforce a
fishing ban in the South China Sea, East Sea and Yellow Sea this
summer, Vice-Minister of Agriculture Wan Baorui said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular issued today by the ministry's Fishery
Bureau, the fishing ban in the South China Sea and in the East
China Sea will begin mid-day on June 1 to mid-day on August 1 (
Beijing Time).
</P>
<P>
Fishing ban in the area, which is located 35 degrees and 26.3
degrees north latitude, will be from 12 hours of June 16 to 12
hours of September 16, and the ban in the Yellow Sea will start
from mid-day on July 1 and end mid-day on September 16.
</P>
<P>
China began to implement fishing ban during the summer in the
East China Sea and Yellow Sea in 1995 and expand the area to South
China Sea last year. This has proven to be effective in protecting
fishing resources and marine life.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the fishing increases 10 to 20 percent in
two months immediately after each fishing ban. Fishing on some
fishing boats doubles or even triples. However, output drops
remarkably due to over-fishing by increasing number of fishing
ships.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau decided to launch its first nationwide survey on
marine fishing ships starting from April 15 to contain illegal
fishing activities.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Lake Pollution Control Research Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology and southwest China's Yunnan Province launched a
research program on controlling of water pollution of the Dianchi
lake, China's sixth largest fresh water lake in Kunming, capital
of the Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
Deng Nan, Vice Minister of Science and Technology, said the
research program will cost total of 50 million yuan (about 6
million U.S. dollars) and be completed in four years.
</P>
<P>
Dianchi Lake, a famous science spot on a high plateau covering
over 300 square kilometers, supplies water for industrial and
agricultural uses for Kunming, and plays a key role in balancing
the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, Dianchi Lake has been seriously polluted with
large amounts of blue-green algae. The growth of algae is
encouraged by chemicals and warm water from sewage and factories.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xunru, vice governor of Yunnan said the central
government and provincial government have been aware of the
importance on controlling pollution on Dianchi Lake and its
environs. Since the 1990s, a total of 3 billion yuan (about 360
million dollars) has been provided for controlling pollution on
the Lake.
</P>
<P>
Four sewage processing factories have been built around the
lake and dozens of factories with serious pollution problems have
been closed or have are now manufacturing other products.
</P>
<P>
In Kunming, residents are urged to use detergents without
phosphorus in an effort to reduce pollution in the Dianchi Lake.

<HEADLINE> PLA Launches Tree-Planting Program Along Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lanzhou, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 soldiers and officers
of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) planted trees today in
Lanzhou, a northwestern city on the bank of the Yellow River, to
initiate a PLA tree-planting program.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at protecting the environment along the
river, according to a decision recently made by the General
Political Department of the PLA and the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Youth League.
</P>
<P>
The program demonstrates the army's support in the government's
efforts to protect and improve the environment along the Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
The PLA plans to invest 1.5 million yuan to plant 1,000 ha. of
trees in Dashagou, located north of Lanzhou and is listed as a
protected area by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Dashagou project is the first part of the army's tree-
plating program, scheduled to be completed this year. The second
part of the project will be carried out next year somewhere in the
upper reaches of the River.
</P>
<P>
Once the project is completed, vegetation in the area is
expected to reach 85.9 percent and cover an area of more than 3,
000 sq.km., according to leading officers of the PLA's Lanzhou
Area Command.

<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Istanbul Gold Exchange (IAB) is expected to become
the world's fifth largest gold exchange after New York, Hong Kong,
London and Tokyo, reported Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Gold and Silver Exchange President Raymond Chan made
the prediction while visiting the IAB Thursday. He said that his
visit was aimed at establishing a bridge between the two exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He said that IAB's trade volume rose by an impressive 11.88
percent to a record high of 491 tons in 1999. Last year gold
dealers imported 107 tons of gold.
</P>
<P>
IAB President Serdar Citak said that the IAB's performance has
made it a focus of attention for international markets and will
create fresh opportunities for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Grain Board has decided to buy a total of
155,000 tons of U.S.-grown corn with the Free-on-Board (FOB) prices
per ton ranging from 97.45 U.S. dollars to 98.08 dollars, reported
Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Merchants said that orders were made with Alfred Toepfer for
105,000 tons and with Conagra for 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The board originally planned to buy 200,000 tons from the United
States, 55,000 tons from Hungary and 45,000 tons from Romania.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's foreign debts decreased to 28.192 billion U.S.
dollars in January from 28.761 billion dollars in December 1999,
the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A monthly report issued by the ministry said the debts account
for 30 percent of Egypt's gross domestic product (GDP), something
within the safe bounds. The world criteria put the safety bounds at
60 percent of GDP, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It also said that most of the debts are in the long and medium
terms while only 1.759 billion dollars are in the short term.
</P>
<P>
DAMACUS -- Syria and Italy have signed a cooperation agreement
under which Italy will offer Syria 3 billion liras (some 810,000 U.
S. dollars) in financial assistance to help Syrian nomads deal with
the current drought.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will be channeled through the Animal Feeding
Fund, especially to those who depend mainly on raising herds of
sheep.

<HEADLINE> India's Economic Growth Slows Down in Oct-Dec 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indian economic growth rate
declined to 5.8 percent during the third quarter (October-December
1999) of the 1999-2000 fiscal year as against 7.8 percent in the
corresponding period of 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
According to quarterly estimates of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) released by the Central Statistical Organization (CSO), the
decline in the GDP growth rate was due mainly to poor performance
of the agricultural sector which registered a meager growth rate
of only 0.5 percent during the period as against 9.9 percent
recorded a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector registered a higher growth rate of 7.2
percent compared with 2.9 percent, but failed to compensate for
the poor performance in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey for 1999-2000 has projected a growth rate
of 5.9 percent for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Solid Behind Estrada: General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) is solidly behind President Joseph Estrada amid
fresh reports of a coup in the making, a senior military official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
AFP Deputy Chief of Staff Lt. General Jose Calimlim told
reporters that there is no such report in the intelligence of that
nature, adding: "They are just trying to destabilize the situation.
"
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Estrada will complete his six-year term
in office despite the negative 32 percent rating of the president.
</P>
<P>
"The military is solid behind the President. The military is
solid behind the Constitution and the constitutionally-elected
authorities," Calimlim stressed.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim, also chief of the AFP Intelligence Service, laughed
off claims by Linggoy Alcuaz, former commissioner of the National
Telecommunication Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to Alcuaz, he has close links with the Reform of the
Armed Forces Movement (RAFM) which had launched six failed coup
attempts against the Aquino government from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, the RAFM has disowned Alcuaz.
</P>
<P>
Alcuaz is presently spearheading a campaign calling for the
resignation of President Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know, Mr. Alcuaz is trying to make a lot of...I don'
t know how to call it, imagined things," Calimlim said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the reports "are fabricated and something that
will really destroy not only the individual but the government."
</P>
<P>
Besides, there is no clear leader who will lead the coup, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He described Alcuaz's allegation as "politically motivated" as
the next election is fast approaching. The local election will be
in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim also said the military is not concerned about the drop
of President Estrada's rating.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the military is so concerned about the rating.
We are after the security. We are after the threats of this
country and we don't mind so much about the political squabble and
ratings of personalities in government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said that in case of a coup, "the military is ready
for any eventuality but I'm telling you there is no such thing as
a coup at this time."

<HEADLINE> South Korea Declares Paju Semi-Disaster Zone for Livestock Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Friday declared Paju
city, Kyonggi Province, as a quasi-disaster area after an outbreak
of a suspected foot-and-mouth disease among local livestock.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Forestry Ministry said it will secure 100
billion won (some 100 million U.S. dollars) to buy and slaughter
350,000 head of cattle in order to declare Paju a "clean city"
within half a year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, whose cattle have been killed and whose fodder and hay
have been burnt to rid the area of infection, will receive full
compensation at market prices. They will also receive benefits
such as a delay in the payment of debts they borrowed from
national agricultural and livestock cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government announced Thursday that it had
successfully contained the spread of the epidemic with no further
cases reported within a 20-kilometer radius of Paju, where the
first case was reported last Monday.
</P>
<P>
All livestock in the city and nearby areas were quarantined
after over 105 head of cattle and pigs died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Farmers around Paju are facing a crisis after the outbreak of
the disease because Japan and Taiwan suspended imports of South
Korean livestock and meat, and the United States and Australia
stopped the import of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
The government will announce the results of blood tests of
animals in the infected area next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Visiting NATO Chief George
Robertson discussed the situation in Kosovo with Swedish leaders
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear last week that we are on a razor's edge
between success and failure (in Kosovo)," said Robertson, who
visited Kosovo one week ago.
</P>
<P>
There is a lack of civil administration in Kosovo, said the
NATO secretary-general, adding that the international society
should put in more resources and send more judicial personnel to
help build an efficient civil administrative mechanism in the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that he also talked about the situation in
Russia during the meetings with Swedish leaders.
</P>
<P>
NATO is working to improve its relationship with Russia, he
said.

<HEADLINE> General: Russia Loses 2,036 Men in North Caucasus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- About 2,036 Russian servicemen
have been killed and 6,076 wounded in the anti-terrorist operation
in the North Caucasus, a ranking Russian military officer said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent losses incurred in fighting in both
Dagestan and Chechnya, the Interfax news agency quoted First
Deputy Chief of the General Staff Colonel General Valery Manilov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the last week alone, 45 Russian servicemen were killed and
151 wounded, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military campaign started last September following
Chechen armed incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a series of
explosions that killed more than 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities. The blasts were also blamed on Chechen
militants.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said although the federal forces have taken control of
Chechnya, there are still 4,000 rebels remaining in the breakaway
republic, with 2,000 in the southern mountains, 1,000 in Vedeno
district and another 1,000 in the Nozhai-Yurt district.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Eastern Army Group has been ordered to destroy the
nearly 1,000 rebels surrounded in Vedeno district, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Small groups of rebels are scattered throughout the valley of
Chechnya, Manilov said, while those in the west of Urus-Martan are
attempting to fight their way into neighboring Ingushetia, another
tiny Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in the southern mountains may try to flee to the former
Soviet republic of Georgia when the snow melts, but Russian units
will not allow their flight, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said federal troops are prepared to eliminate the
400 or so rebels in Grozny, the Chechen capital.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Extends Subsistence Guarantee Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province will
pump 15 million yuan into its subsistence guarantee program this
year so that poor urban and rural residents of the island province
can enjoy a more secure life.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 40,000 poor islanders will benefit
from the program, according to information from the provincial
civil affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
The province now has installed the living standard guarantee
system in 19 counties and cities, and has had good results with
the system in rural areas of five cities and counties, said local
sources.
</P>
<P>
The increased funding will be borne by various localities, as
the province is also approved to sell social welfare lotteries
this year, and part of the earnings from these sales will be used
to offset the money needed for the program.
</P>
<P>
Different localities will have to work out their respective
standards when they carry out the subsistence guarantee program,
the local sources said.

<HEADLINE> Longtan Hydropower Station to be Built Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Construction on the key part of
Longtan Hydropower Station on Hongshui River in south China will
begin ahead of schedule as preparations for the project are being
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower project was previously announced to be started
in 2001, said information from Longtan Hydropower Development Co.
Ltd, the builder.
</P>
<P>
Building of the hydropower station ahead of the schedule is
obviously related to China's strategy to accelerate the
development of the western region.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a recent press conference, Zeng Peiyan,
Minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission,
announced a group of big projects, including the Longtan
Hydropower Station, which will begin construction in the western
region this year.
</P>
<P>
Longtan Hydropower Plant, situated inside Guangxi's Tian'e
County near Guizhou Province, is the most important project out of
a number of the planned hydropower plants in exploring abundant
hydro-electric resources on the Hongshui River.
</P>
<P>
The plant will have an installed generating capacity of 4.2
million kw for development in the near future and 5.4 million kw
for long-term development.
</P>
<P>
The project will be second only after the gigantic Three Gorges
Water Control Project on the Yangtze River in terms of installed
generating capacity. The Three Gorges Dam, which is under
construction, will have an installed generating capacity of 17.68
million kw.
</P>
<P>
Planning and prospecting of Longtan Hydropower Station began in
1958. A proposal of building the hydropower project, as well as
eight other reports regarding subjects including use of overseas
investment in the construction were approved by panels of Chinese
experts.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Longtan Hydropower Development Co. Ltd said that
they have been working fast to prepare two other reports -- a
feasibility study report on the project and another report on the
details of key part of the hydropower station, and getting the two
reports approved, so that the hydropower station will start
construction as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, building of a 14-km-long highway connecting
the county seat of Tian'e to the site of the hydropower station
is being accelerated and the highway will be ready for traffic in
August. Installation of high-voltage power transmission lines for
the construction is also carried out very fast.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Remain Engaged with Macao SAR: Consul General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States will remain
engaged with China's Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR),
its government and people, the consul general of the United States
in Hong Kong said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to build on our excellent relations with the new
government of Macao, to expand bilateral cooperation, and to
promote opportunities for U.S. trade and investment," Consul
General Michael Klosson said at a forum entitled "the U.S. and
Macao: Looking Toward the Future."
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the United States Consulate General is
located in Hong Kong, he and his colleagues take their jobs as U.S.
representatives to the Macao SAR very seriously -- whether in the
consular, diplomatic, commercial or law enforcement spheres.
</P>
<P>
"We want to maintain -- and even increase -- our cooperation
and our involvement in the Macao SAR," the consul general said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very appreciative of the excellent cooperation,
and in many cases real friendship, that have developed. We hope
that senior Macao government officials will visit the United
States," he said. "We also encourage senior American officials to
visit Macao and see for themselves the 'One Country, Two Systems'
arrangement in practice."
</P>
<P>
Klosson said the United States also supports strengthened
professional and cultural exchanges between the people of Macao
and the United States. Over the past couple of years, the U.S.
Consulate has sponsored American experts to visit Macao and make
speeches, and Macao officials, journalists, and even a legislator
have visited the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition to official exchanges, more than 300 Macao students
go to study in the U.S. each year. "We hope that number will grow,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the cooperation in law enforcement, Klosson said
the two sides have begun working together to combat illegal money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
"We want to increase information-sharing and training
opportunities until eventually our law enforcement officials can
conduct joint operations to fight transitional crime, including
trafficking in women and children, narcotics smuggling, piracy of
intellectual property (right), and financial crimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of trading, the United States, as Macao's largest
trading partner, purchased almost half of Macao's exports (about
one billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, but exported only 40 million U.
S. dollars worth of goods to Macao. "We are eager to expand sales
here," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Enforce Amended Air Pollution Control Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Air Pollution Control (
Motor Vehicle Fuel) (Amendment) Regulation 2000 of Hong Kong,
which cuts the level of benzene allowed in petrol to not more than
one percent by volume, will come into effect on April 1.
</P>
<P>
"Reducing such toxic hydrocarbons in fuels is important for
protecting public health," a government spokesman said on Friday,
noting that benzene was a human carcinogen and petrol was a major
source of benzene.
</P>
<P>
The present limit for benzene in petrol of not more than five
percent has been in force since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the move to tighten the benzene limit in
petrol is part of an ongoing program to improve the standards of
motor fuels.
</P>
<P>
Following the successful introduction of unleaded petrol in
1991, the use of leaded petrol was subsequently banned in April
last year. In addition, the Hong Kong government has also reduced
the sulphur content in motor diesel fuel since 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue its policy of adopting the most
stringent requirements for the quality of motor fuels as soon as
compliant fuels can be made available in Hong Kong," the spokesman
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon put forward legislative amendments to further
reduce the sulphur content of motor diesel fuel to 0.035 percent
and upgrade the quality of unleaded petrol to pave the way for the
introduction of the more stringent Euro III vehicle emission
standards.
</P>
<P>
"These tightened motor fuels and vehicle emission standards are
expected to come into effect in January 2001," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the government was also seeking to
introduce additional measures to tackle air pollution problems on
all fronts in addition to efforts to raise the motor fuel and
emission standards.

HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's index of industrial
production for the manufacturing sector in 1999 as a whole
decreased by 6.3 percent compared with 1998, according to the
preliminary results of a survey released Friday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Figures also show that Hong Kong's producer price index for the
manufacturing sector dropped by 1.6 percent compared with that of

</P>
<P>
The provisional figures on the index of industrial production
and the producer price index for the manufacturing sector as a
whole decreased by 2.7 percent and 0.7 percent respectively in the
fourth quarter of 1999 compared with a year earlier, the figures
show.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production indices reflect changes in the volume
of local manufacturing output after discounting the effect of
price changes, while the price changes are measured by the
producer price indices for manufacturing industries compiled from
data on producer prices of industrial goods and services collected
from the same survey.

<HEADLINE> Revised Law Stresses Marine Ecological Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's revised law of marine
environmental protection, which will go into effect tomorrow,
stresses the protection of marine ecological system.
</P>
<P>
Previously, China has no law regulating protection of marine
ecology. However, protection of marine ecology and environment can
not be separated.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a new chapter on marine ecological protection has
been added to the revised marine environmental protection law,
demanding local governments in China's coastal regions to be
responsible for protecting the marine ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
According to article 20 of the new law, the State Council and
local governments of coastal regions must take effective measures
to protect mangroves, coral reefs, coastal wetland, sea islands,
gulfs, major fishery water areas and other marine life.
</P>
<P>
Rare and endangered marine life and natural oceanic
surroundings will also be protected under the revised law.
</P>
<P>
China has 18,000 km of coastline with more than three million
sq km of sea areas under its jurisdiction. Serious pollution in
recent years has led to serious marine pollution.

to a preventing and controlling marine environmental pollution
caused by marine engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
Article 47 of the new law stipulates that marine engineering
project must strictly meet China's marine environmental protection

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Must Tackle Six Major Problems (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's economic development
during the next Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) period must tackle six
major problems, says the latest issue of Outlook, the country's
most authoritative news weekly.
</P>
<P>
The April 3 issue says in a signed article that great changes,
such as the disappearance of shortage of commodities and the
forming of a buyer's market, have taken place in China during the
current Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
"The changes mark a completely new stage of development for the
Chinese economy," the article says, adding that these changes
demand that greater effort must be made to solve six major
problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, the first problem facing the economy
will be how to maintain the economic growth rate while improving
the quality of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the past years when domestic demand was huge, it was not
difficult to raise the economic growth rate by channeling more
investment into the national economy.
</P>
<P>
However, it becomes more difficult to support high economic
growth in a period of technological innovation bringing with it
new and more expensive products and equipment, it said.
</P>
<P>
The second major problem will be how to quicken reform while
emphasizing national stability.
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese economy enters a period of enhanced efficiency,
more effort will be needed to perfect the new mechanisms of risk
limitation and resources allocation.

<TEXT>
<P>
The reform of labor, income distribution, social security,
government functioning, macro-management, and the market system is
also expected to be deepened.
</P>
<P>
All this and more will inevitably touch upon the established
interests of many people, which in turn will have an impact on
overall social stability.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that the third major problem will be how to
achieve sustainable development while efforts are taken to speed
up the country's industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
As the world's most populous country, it is necessary that
China should push forward its industrialization. However, the fact
that the country's per capita natural resources and space is quite
limited means that it must pay enough attention to sustainable
development in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth problem will be how to cope with constraint on
economic structure upgrading posed by the expanded migration of
rural workers," the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
China's industrialization calls for the shifting of rural labor
to urban areas. However, this trend contradicts the necessity of
pooling capital and resources into capital- and technology-
intensive industries, which needs fewer workers.
</P>
<P>
It will become a major challenge for China to complete
structural optimization and industrial upgrading while gearing the
economy more to both the domestic and international markets, the
magazine notes.

<P>
In the early 21st century, the Chinese economy will become more
integrated into the international economy. "This will pose a
severe test for China's capital- and technology-intensive
industries," it says.
</P>
<P>
While China's labor-intensive industries still enjoy some cost
advantages, the capital- and technology-intensive industries are
at a great disadvantage in competition with their foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
The article predicts that the last problem China will have to
face will be how to best deal with the relationship among reform,
stability, and development.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, the change in China's economic growth
mode and the deepening of its economic restructuring will
inevitably lead to sharp conflicts of interests.
</P>
<P>
In particular, China's huge work force, expected to reach 860
million people by the end of this year and 910 million by the year
2005, will pose a great challenge to the country when slipping
economic growth offers fewer jobs, the magazine points out.
</P>
<P>
"The 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) will become the
transitional period for both our economic development and our
economic structure," it says.
</P>
<P>
The nation must keep a clear mind while seeking the proper
development path in a fiercely competitive global environment, the
article concludes.

<HEADLINE> China's 1st Oil Spill Emergency Program To Take Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's first emergency program
to prevent oil spill accidents in China's oceans is scheduled to
go into effect tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, the Ministry of Communications and
the State Environmental Protection Administration of China said
there are nationwide and regional emergency programs in the North
China Sea, the East China Sea, the South China Sea and the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Oil spills must be reported to related government bodies as
well as clean-up operations, oil-spill compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
Song Jiahui, director of the Maritime Safety Administration of
China (MSAC) under the Ministry of Communications, said the
programs were designed to protect China's marine environment and
resources, reduce the losses and damage caused by oil-spills.
</P>
<P>
Under the programs, MSAC is in charge of coordinating national
efforts to handle large oil-spill accidents and provincial
branches of MSAC are responsible for smaller oil-spill accidents.
</P>
<P>
Hong Shanxiang, vice-minister of Communications, said that
China faces growing risks of serious oil-spills with an
increasingly number of oil ships and tankers.
</P>
<P>
During the past 26 years, China reported 53 major oil-spills.
Each of these oil spills lost at least 50 tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, over 3,000 tons of oil was spilled into Qingdao Port
in East China's Shandong Province, polluting 230 km of coastal
lines and causing serious damage to seaside resorts and 1,000 ha
of aquatic farming areas.

including Harbin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Chengdu, Dalian, Shenzhen,
Beihai, Xiamen, and Guilin enjoyed fairly good air.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Chongqing, all 46 major Chinese cities
selected by the central government as key cities for environmental
protection listed suspended particles as the major pollutant.
Sulfur dioxide was the major pollutant in Chongqing.

<HEADLINE> Air Surveillance Launched in Nigeria to Protect Oil Pipelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has ordered
the police to begin a 24-hour air surveillance along oil pipelines
in the country's eastern states.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Thursday against the backdrop of
recent incessant vandalization of oil pipelines, which had caused
petroleum shortage from time to time in Africa's most populous
country, the Post Express, a leading Nigerian newspaper, reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance is to be carried out by an arm of the force in
charge of air patrol known as air police, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
More land patrol teams would also be put into operation to
supplement their colleagues in the air along the pipelines route,
said a police spokesman in the country's eastern Abia State.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the police would take further actions to
enlighten traditional rulers, village heads and the people along
the pipeline of the dangers in vandalizing oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month a big fire caused by oil pipeline
vandalization in Abia State killed some 50 people, causing the
nationwide petroleum shortage.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record High in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan's jobless rate in February
increased by 0.2 percent from January to hit a record high of 4.9
percent, the Management and Coordination Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The previous record of 4.8 percent was set in March, April,
June and July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for men rose by 0.3 percent to 5.1 percent,
also a record high, while the rate for women was unchanged from
the previous month's 4.5 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless totaled 3.27 million in February, an
increase of 140,000 from the same month in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The agency said a major factor pushing up the rate was the fact
that there were a total of 1.15 million people who lost their jobs
for involuntary reasons such as corporate restructuring and
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Labor Ministry said in a separate report that the ratio
of job offers to job seekers in February stood at a seasonally
adjusted 0.52 percent, unchanged from January. The figure means
there were 52 job offers to every 100 job seekers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise in the unemployment rate, the Japanese
government officials are still optimistic about the country's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"The rate may rise further in the next month or two, but it is
unlikely to affect the overall economic outlook," Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa's optimism was echoed by Taichi Sakaiya, head of the
Economic Planning Agency, who said the recovery of the Japanese
economy will not falter as a result of the worsening employment
situation.

<P>
Intel Technology (China) Ltd. in Pudong's Waigaoqiao Bonded
Zone is Intel's first production base in China and its second in
the world. Since it went into operation in 1998, it has been
producing three million chips a week, 90 percent of which have
been sold outside China.
</P>
<P>
Jim M. Lee, general manager of Intel Technology (China) Ltd.,
attributed his company's success partly to an improving business
environment that is basically based on international practice.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Lee said, the local Customs House has extended
its office hours to seven days a week to promptly meet the needs
of Intel Technology and other companies.
</P>
<P>
"This helps sharpen the competitiveness of our products," Lee
added.
</P>
<P>
Pudong set the goal of operating in accordance with
international practice, said Ruan Yanhua, vice-director of the
Pudong New Area Administration, and its overall planning was done
jointly by several well-known urban planning bodies selected
through international bidding.
</P>
<P>
While implementing a series of preferential policies to
investors, Ruan said, Pudong has built 10 major infrastructure
projects, and has another 10 under way, including an international
airport, a subway, and a pedestrian passage across the Huangpu
River separating the area from downtown Shanghai. At least 200
billion yuan has already been used for infrastructure construction
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Impressed by the great changes taking place in Pudong, Daniel
Lam, manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp. (HSBC), who came to work in Pudong nine years ago,
revealed that HSBC is considering moving its China headquarters to
this area.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt of China's determination to turn this area
into an international center of finance and trade," Lam said.

Vice-governor Chen Zhenggao said recently that Liaoning would
reduce the proportion of debt-ridden businesses so that such
enterprises will account for some 30 percent of the total
businesses of the province by the end of this year as against 35
percent in 1999. Coal mines and non-ferrous metal firms will
strive to turn losses into profits this year. The industrial added
value of the province is set to grow by 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning also has decided to give particular support to 60
selected key SOEs which have a vital bearing on the national
economy, and issue warnings to those which are poor in management
and economic performance. And about 60 percent of the key SOEs
should, by and large, introduce the modern enterprise system by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official sources from the province say that the situation in
the SOEs has begun to turn for the better in terms of economic
performance. The case is the same in the neighboring province of
Jilin.
</P>
<P>
Bai Chengqiang, general manager of Jilin Petrochemical Industry
Corporation, reported that "It is the first time in many years
that my corporation has begun making profits."
</P>
<P>
Jilin was the first of the 12 provinces across the country,
whose SOEs made a combined net profit of 1.68 billion yuan last
year.

all its SOEs by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Shen Jilan, China's Most Senior NPC Deputy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Back to this provincial capital
of Shanxi after attending the annual session of China's top
legislature in Beijing, Shen Jilan was again busy tending her
village's business, this time inspecting the financial records of
a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Shen, the most senior "congresswoman" in China, has been a
deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), or China's
parliament, ever since 1954. She is the only person in China who
has been elected as an NPC deputy for all the nine terms.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has changed for me," Shen said with an unchanged
dialect, "I'm still an ordinary farmer." Recalling her
extraordinary experiences, she did find some changes. "My name is
now inscribed at the gate of a company run by my village."
</P>
<P>
Now in her seventies, Shen is still energetic. She has vivid
memory of a panel discussion early this month in Beijing, when she
aired her views on economic development in the presence of
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Impressed by her frankness, President Jiang, who was attending
a meeting of NPC deputies from Shanxi, invited Shen to take the
floor.
</P>
<P>
As ambitious entrepreneurs were talking about going west, Shen
said that other parts of the country, especially the central part,
should not be neglected while implementing the central government'
s strategy for developing the western region.
</P>
<P>
Shen was speaking for her constituency -- though less developed,
Shanxi is not listed among the 10 provincial divisions that
constitute the west.
</P>
<P>
When She attended the first NPC session in 1954, Shen Jilan
believed her duty was to cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
Born in Pingshun County, north China's Shanxi Province in 1929,
Shen Jilan moved to Xigou Village of the same county after her
marriage. It was in this village that she met Li Shunda, a
national role model for Chinese peasants who had been recognized
by such Chinese leaders as Chairman Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and
Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
Li encouraged villagers to form mutual aid groups and co-ops,
making the previously unknown Xigou village the only one being
marked on the national map at that time.
</P>
<P>
Li was seeking a woman leader who could motivate the women of
the village to actively participate in farming. Shen Jilan became
his choice.
</P>
<P>
Shen led her woman villagers to learn farming techniques, and
her story of realizing "equal pay for equal work" spread
nationwide very quickly -- China was then working to raise the
social status of women, who used to be regarded as inferior to men.
She began receiving tens, even hundreds of letters a day that
praised her courage.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Shen Jilan, China's Most Senior NPC Deputy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an outstanding representative of women's liberation in New
China, Shen left Xigou Village on the back of a donkey, then on a
truck, then by train, and finally by plane to attend the World
Women's Conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Shen met Chairman Mao in Beijing the same year, fulfilling the
biggest dream of Chinese people at that time. From then on, She
frequently shook hands with state leaders with her coarse hands.
</P>
<P>
In September 1954, then 25-year-old Shen was elected a deputy
to the first National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"There were about 1,200 deputies to the first NPC session," she
recalled, "and women accounted for only 147. I just could not help
being excited as the session went on." It was the most impressive
session for Shen because it was the first time she stepped onto
the political stage on behalf of Chinese farmers. She believed
that the most important thing about the first session was that Mao
was elected chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We drew a circle under the name of a nominee at that time,"
she said. Shen practiced circle drawing every night with only one
thing in her mind -- to describe a perfect round circle under the
name of Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Shen Jilan went through various political movements over the
past four decades. She became the only person in China to be
consecutively elected as a deputy to the NPC nine times. From 1952
to 1996, she was always selected as a national model worker.
</P>
<P>
"I'm only a farmer. To be selected or not depends entirely on
others. What I think about most is how to accomplish my work,"
said Shen commenting on her legend.

<P>
The surging tide of China's reform and opening up drive since
the late 1970s soon spread to remote Xigou Village, where a more
experienced Shen Jilan, though getting older, is busy making plans.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I cared about in the past was farming. I was
not fond of being in the limelight," she said, "but I must refresh
my mind as the times have changed."
</P>
<P>
Shen turned to opening a dozen of factories with her villagers,
and their products including stone mills sold well on the domestic
and southeast Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Shen and her fellows have made life better, and the Xigou
villagers became comparatively well-off far ahead of other
villagers in Pingshun County. The average annual net income in
Xigou is now nearly 2,000 yuan (about 241 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shen's name was gradually coming to mean "money," too. Several
companies invited her to be an honorary consultant, and others
promised her a position of board chairman.
</P>
<P>
Shen declined all these offers until one day her name was
wanted as a trade mark for walnuts processed by a township
enterprise run by her village. Shen agreed without asking for a
penny. The small township enterprise has now grown into a company
group with the use of Shen's name.
</P>
<P>
"I just want all my villagers to become rich," she said, "They
need such a brand, so just take it." Yet she believed that quality
and the market are more important than the name alone.
</P>
<P>
"That is how the market economy goes," she said.

<HEADLINE> West China Areas Join Hands for Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The provinces and autonomous
regions of western China are planning to join hands in efforts
toward larger-scale development.
</P>
<P>
At a recent high-level conference in Chongqing Municipality,
leading officials from western China called on the 10 provinces
and regions of the west to enhance coordination and cooperation in
order to avoid unhealthy competition and achieve sustained
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
A Chongqing official said the city has proposed some projects
involving ecological protection, the development of mineral and
tourist resources, farm produce, and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of these projects could involve cooperation
among provinces and regions in the west.
</P>
<P>
He Guoqiang, secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of
the Communist Party of China, said that as an industrial base,
Chongqing will take advantage of its favorable conditions to serve
its neighboring western provinces and regions to jointly form a
large economic ring for further development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Chongqing will support all projects which benefit the
development of the west, even if they bring little benefit to
Chongqing."
</P>
<P>
China has recently invested heavily in a number of
infrastructure projects in the west, including the Guizhou-
Chongqing-Hunan Railway and the Sichuan-Chongqing Express Railway.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a railway from southwest China to Tibet will
start soon, and a Lanzhou-Chongqing railway running through
several ethnic minority areas in Sichuan Province is now being
designed.
</P>
<P>
Inter-provincial projects calling for joint efforts will
benefit the exploitation of resources and promote exchange of
commodities and personnel in the west.

<P>
In the area of expressway construction, Shaanxi is planning to
create tunnels through the Qinling Mountains for highways
connecting Shaanxi and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
A thoroughfare to the South China Sea from Shaanxi to Guangxi
is planned, and is expected to open to traffic in five years.
</P>
<P>
The 10 western areas targeted for development are Shaanxi,
Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang
Uygur autonomous regions in the northwest, Sichuan, Guizhou and
Yunnan provinces, and Chongqing Municipality and the Tibet
Autonomous Region in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
They are now mapping out their respective blueprints, and all
have placed economic development and environmental protection at
the top of their agendas.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say if the western areas join hands in development,
this can ensure environmental protection, and educational,
scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and Qinghai will cooperate
in an environmental protection program on the upper reach of the
Yangtze River next year.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the pressure on oil supplies in central and
eastern China, a 1,200-km-long oil pipe line will be installed
with an annual oil transfer capacity of 5 million tons.
Electricity and gas in the west are also expected to be
transmitted to east China.
</P>
<P>
Now there are a few economic belts which have emerged in
Chengdu-Chongqing area, Guanzhong Basin in Shaanxi and Hexi
Corridor in Gansu. With economic centers such as Xi'an, Chengdu,
Chongqing and Lanzhou, the large-scale development in the west is
promising.
</P>
<P>
Economists noted that the joint efforts in the development of
west represent a new concept of economic growth that will
undoubtedly be helpful for implementation of the state's strategy
of great development for western China.

<HEADLINE> Multinationals Keen on Shanghai's Pudong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Gunther Strobel, President of
Shanghai Bell Company Limited, has always wondered at traditional
Chinese culture, and that's why he adorns his office with delicate
model terra-cotta warriors and porcelain.
</P>
<P>
But Strobel is even more surprised by his company's performance
in the Pudong New Area, an emerging financial and trade zone set
up in the early 1990s in China's leading industrial center of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Belgian joint venture which moved into Pudong in 1995,
Shanghai Bell achieved about 900 million U.S. dollars in sales
last year, compared with 540 million U.S. dollars in 1995. While
holding a 30 percent share of China's program-controlled phone
business, it has sold more than 100 million U.S. dollars worth of
products in other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Pudong is a new starting point for us," Strobel said. "It's
enabling us to secure an increasingly larger share of the market
in the world as well as in this country."
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics indicate that 98 of the world's top 500
corporations, including General Motors, Volkswagen, BASF, and
Intel, have already opened some 180 subsidiaries in Pudong, with a
total contractual overseas investment of more than eight billion U.
S. dollars. Some multinationals have even moved their Asia and
China headquarters to this area.
</P>
<P>
Many executives of these companies share Strobel's view, saying
that Pudong, with an immense hinterland along the Yangtze River
and aiming to become an international banking, trade, tourism, and
conference and exhibition center, boasts great potential business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is an entrance both to the entire Chinese market and to
the broader global market, said Toru Mitarai, general manager of
the Sanwa Bank Limited Shanghai Branch.
</P>
<P>
Toru Mitarai's bank, one of the 42 overseas-funded banks in
Pudong, has more than 600 clients, and its outstanding loans have
reached 900 million U.S. dollars, with total savings deposits
climbing to 230 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is sure to become as active as London, New York, and
Singapore in economic development so long as it keeps on moving
forward, the banker said, adding that this will provide many
chances to expand the banking sector.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Prompts Surge of China's Newspaper Groups? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In line with the media practices worldwide, the establishment
of newspaper groups is an effective way to increase circulation.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Daily Newspaper Group, the first in China, has a
total circulation of 1.2 million newspapers, with a combined
output value of roughly two billion yuan, after annexing ten other
newspapers, three magazines, and a publishing house.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Daily Newspaper Group, which was just approved by
the SPPA, boasts a combined circulation of nearly two million
newspapers, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The hike in the price of newsprint has also contributed to the
formation of newspaper groups, experts say.
</P>
<P>
If there are too many small newspapers, the burdens of higher
prices must be borne by the readers, decreasing the
competitiveness of these newspapers. Newspaper groups, however,
can make up losses due to price hikes by engaging in a variety of
business, they add.
</P>
<P>
China's newspaper industry will also face challenges from on-
line information, which is becoming more popular all the time,
said Liang.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, newspaper annexations are still new in China,
and must be undertaken with caution.
</P>
<P>
At present, only the major newspapers run by the Communist
Party of China are allowed to annex other papers, the SPPA
official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese newspapers
recently joined hands to meet increasingly strong market
challenges by establishing eight new newspaper groups.
</P>
<P>
A State Press and Publication Administration (SPPA) plan calls
for the rapid development of newspaper groups, noting that ten
percent of the country's newspapers should be on a scale of more
than 100 million yuan by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China's first newspaper was founded a century ago, while the
first newspaper group was set up just three years ago, and now
there are 15 of them.
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper industry can better function as part of China's
socialist market economy by setting up newspaper groups," said
Liang Heng, deputy director of the SPPA.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that the state's preferential policies for the
newspaper industry cannot be sustained forever, and newspapers
will have to compete with other mediums sooner or later. "So, the
trend is to establish newspaper groups and sharpen the competitive
edge of the industry."

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry Both Chance, Challenge: Textile Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will bring about both opportunities and
challenges to the country's textile industry, Deputy Director of
the State Administration of Textile Industry (SATI) Wang Tiankai
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference sponsored by the Information Office
of the State Council that as the largest producer and exporter of
textiles and garments in the world, China boasts international
competitiveness in terms of labor costs, resources, and
manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that China's textile industry also has some
disadvantages in international competition, including crucial
weaknesses in product mix, management, and enterprise operational
systems.
</P>
<P>
He said the textile industry will focus on developing the
market in western China this year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, China's textile industry has slashed
redundant production capacity by abolishing 9.06 million cotton
weaving spindles and diverting and employing 1.16 million laid-off
workers. The industry achieved a net profit of 800 million yuan in
1999, ending a five-year streak of operating in the red.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs' Palestinian Identity Strengthening: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Arabs are beginning to
see themselves more as Palestinians living in Israel than as full-
fledge Israeli citizens, according to a recent poll conducted by
Givat Haviva's Institute for Peace Research.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published Friday, said the results appeared to
indicate a growing sense of bitterness and frustration on the part
of Israeli Arabs, which totals just over one million among the six
million Israeli population.
</P>
<P>
On the question of how members of the Arab community identify
themselves, some 46 percent of the 500 interviewees described
themselves as Palestinians or Arab-Palestinians in Israel, while 21
percent described themselves as Palestinian Arabs, 9 percent as
Arabs and just over 3 percent as Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated that when the same question was put to
interviewees in a similar poll five years ago, more than 38 percent
described themselves as Israeli Arabs and nearly 8 percent as
Israelis, while 27 percent at that time chose the title of
Palestinians or Arab-Palestinians in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The findings showed quite clearly a trend of Arabs in Israel
adopting a more Palestinian identity than an Israeli one, the poll
said.
</P>
<P>
The results also reflected deep disappointment on the part of
Israeli Arabs generally over the attitude of the government of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak toward them, which stands in contrast
with that of the government of the late prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Rabin treated the Arabs with respect and met with their leaders,
whereas Barak refuses to appear with them in the media or shake
hands with them and this has caused a great deal of frustration,
said Asad Ghanem, a leading member of the institute who has been
carefully monitoring the changing attitude of the Arab community
over the years.
</P>
<P>
Local Arab communities blamed the government for not paying
enough attention to their social and economic development and local
Arab council leaders organized several demonstrations since
February to force the government to allocate more fund in the 2000
state budget to tackle their social and economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Businesses Urged to Pay Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's business
community has been urged to pay taxes to enable the government put
in place a conducive environment for business development, the
Guardian newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a national workshop on economic policy-making
environment in Tanzania Thursday in Dar es Salaam, the
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma said the Tanzanian business community
must develop a culture of tax-compliance.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Vice-President reiterated the government's
commitment to attracting and encouraging foreign investment and
assured genuine and honest investors of full government support
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenue was necessary to socio-economic infrastructure that
would create an enabling business atmosphere in the country, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar, the government was working on observations
raised on the tax policy and tax administration in order to
eliminate undue constraints in speeding up economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank of Tanzania's latest monthly report, during
January 2000, revenue collection by the government dropped sharply
to 63.3 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 79 million U.S.
dollars) from 84.8 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 106 million
U.S. dollars) recorded in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts have warned the government to take prompt
measures to cover the revenue collection deficit before a wider
impact is felt on the economy.

celebrate the team's 79-64 victory over PAF Bologna of Italy and
its advance to the men's basketball EuroLeague final four.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before midnight as the basketball match ended, Tel Aviv
Mayor Ron Huldai made a victory speech and the crowd burst into
song and fireworks flashed through the sky above the square.
</P>
<P>
Even Prime Minister Ehud Barak got into the act, saying in a
statement that "I watched the game with excitement, like everyone
in Israel."
</P>
<P>
"The determination, fighting spirit and professionalism of
those that brought this important achievement deserve the highest
praise," Barak added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, Maccabi Tel Aviv used all-around team
effort and a dominating second half to crush Bologna 79-64 in
front of thousands of adoring fans at Tel Aviv's Yad Eliahu sport
center. With the win, Maccabi has advanced to the Euroleague
final four for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Maccabi's top four players were each in prime form as Nate
Huffman (18 points), Doron Sheffer (16), Arriel Mcdonald (14) and
Nadav Henefeld (12) shared the scoring duties. Mark Brisker and
Derrick Sharp contributed with aggressive defense.
</P>
<P>
Bologna came out strong early, leading by as much as seven
points in the first half before a pair of Nate Huffman shots put
Maccabi ahead for the first time ten minutes into the game. The
game stayed close throughout the rest of the first half, which
ended 43-42 with Maccabi leading one point.
</P>
<P>
Maccabi's domination began at the start of the second half. It
used four Bologna turnovers in the first two and half minutes of
the half in a 10-0 run to lead 53-42 with 17:39 left in the game.
Maccabi then never looked back, leading by at least nine points
for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
The semifinals will be played in Salonika, Greece, on April 18
and 20.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinal matchup, Maccabi faces Barcelona of Spain,
while Efes Pilsen of Turkey clashes with Panathinaiko of Greece.

<HEADLINE> "Real Name" System Adopted for Individual Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council today
promulgated a regulation on adopting a real name system for
individual bank accounts in an effort to protect the legal rights
and interests of savers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the People's Bank of China, the country's
central bank, said that the individual accounts referred in the
regulation are yuan and foreign exchange deposit accounts of
various kinds opened by citizens in banks and financial
institutions that handle individual deposits according to law.
</P>
<P>
"Real name" refers to names used in various legal
identification cards.
</P>
<P>
Individuals opening new accounts in financial institutions will
be asked to show their own identification cards and use their real
names as of the date of the promulgation of the regulation.
</P>
<P>
With respect to old accounts, the depositor is required to show
an identification card and change pseudonyms into real names only
when making new deposits.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also has detailed provisions on the
responsibility of financial institutions and their staff for the
security of individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that the implementation of this regulation is
a significant step in reforming China's individual deposit
management system, and will play an active role in protecting
savers' legal rights and interests, and prevent financial fraud,
while standardizing the operations of financial institutions and
further reinforcing financial supervision.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Members Arrested in Jenin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security forces on
Thursday night arrested a group of members of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the West Bank town of Jenin and
confiscated some arms and explosives.
</P>
<P>
The arrested, including Hamas spokesman Khalid Hajj, were sent
to jail after being interrogated by Palestinian Preventive Security
Police, Palestinian security sources said in West Bank on Friday
morning, without giving the exact number of those detained.
</P>
<P>
The arms recovered include some machine guns and bullets, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The move came as part of the efforts by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to crack down on terrorism to help the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks move forward.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams are due to start a new
session of talks in Washington on April 6 to continue their
discussions on the most thorny issues dividing them, including the
status of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees,
demarcation of borders and water issues.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have set a May deadline to draft a
framework agreement on solving the final-status issues before
concluding a final peace treaty by September.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which is opposed to the peace process between Israel and
the Palestinians, carried out several suicide bombing attacks on
Israeli targets in the last few years. The PNA has been under
pressure from the United States and Israel to rein in the group's
activities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Fuel Oil Price Hike Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- In order to prevent public
protests, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid Friday decided to
postpone the 10 percent increase in fuel oil price a day before it
takes effect on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The president did not specify when the oil price hike will take
effect but said the government will make a weekly review on when
to impose it.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives' commission on mines and energy
has earlier urged the government to delay the oil price hike until
it has prepared a mechanism that would prevent the prices of other
commodities from increasing and prevent leakage in the
distribution of fuel subsidies to the poor.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, affirmed that the government will
implement the increase in the structural allowance of high-ranking
government officials effective Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no change," he told reporters here, noting that
due to lack of funds, the government will raise the salaries of
low-ranking civil servants and military personnel in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The government recently decided to raise the structural
allowances for the four top ranks of officials by a range of 500
to 2,000 percent. These increases are way over the 25 percent
across-the-board rise for the basic salaries of all civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Students and non-governmental organizations have threatened to
mobilize thousands of people to hold street protests on Saturday
against the government's decision to raise fuel prices by 10
percent as well as increase the allowances of civil servants based
on their position and function.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta police Headquarters Friday ordered its personnel to
stay on high alert in anticipation of a wave of protests.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Jakarta Police Maj. Gen. Nurfaizi said the police
want to show the people that they are ready to secure the capital.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Addressing Human Trafficking Ends in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Asian Regional
Initiative Against Trafficking in Women and Children (ARIAT)
meeting concluded here Friday after adopting an action plan to
address the problem of trafficking in human beings.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting agreed that the causes of
trafficking are complex, but the primary root cause is poverty,
most particularly among women and children who may have little or
no access to education.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that trafficking in persons is a transitional
crime and combating this global problem will require an integrated
approach at national, sub-regional and international levels.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also developed an action plan for the region,
offering suggestions for possible future steps and practices to
fight trafficking in persons in all its forms.
</P>
<P>
The ARIAT plan proposed the establishment of a data bank on
trafficking including incidence rates, trafficking patterns in
countries of origin, transit, and destination, and investigative
information as well as number of cases prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The plan encouraged cooperation and partnership among
governments, non-governmental organizations, the private sector
and civil society in the prevention, protection, prosecution,
repatriation and reintegration aspects of trafficking in persons.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 representatives from more than 20 Asia-Pacific
countries and regions, plus the United States, Canada and the
European Union attended the meeting co-hosted by the Philippines
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The organizers estimated that as any as 250, 000 human beings
are bought and sold each year in the Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Concerned at Country's Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has expressed his serious concern over the country's
level of poverty, saying that "poverty has made Nigerians behave
like mad people".
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers on Friday quoted the President, who is
currently on a visit to the northwestern Kebbi State, as saying
that poverty alleviation was only one aspect of the government's
programs to attain the socio- economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said his government had made provision of 10 billion
naira (about 100 million U.S. dollars) to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
He teased the dignitaries accompanying him during the visit by
saying that "those of you who know what you will eat will not be
able to appreciate the level of poverty in some areas of our
communities".
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who took office last May, has launched a nation-wide
campaign to reduce poverty in the Africa's most populous country.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Zamfara State Vows to Implement Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's northern state of Zamfara
has vowed to implement Islamic law of Sharia to the full force
despite the widespread condemnation of the hand amputation of a
cow thief last week.
</P>
<P>
Zamfara State Governor, Ahmed Sani, said on Thursday in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation that his
government would extend the hand amputation penalty to civil
servants who steal public funds in the state.
</P>
<P>
Sani declared that any civil servant who stole more than 4,000
naira (about 40 U.S. dollars) public fund would have his right
hand amputated.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed, in unmistakable terms, the commitment of his
government to the full implementation of Sharia law in the state,
adding whoever violated the Sharia law in Zamfara would be
punished accordingly.
</P>
<P>
He ordered all senior public servants in the state to declare
their assets to the Anti-Corruption Committee, which was set up to
monitor the implementation of Sharia in the state, and failure of
doing that would cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Zamfara is the first state in Nigeria to implement the Sharia
law to the full force.
</P>
<P>
The recent violent clashes between Christians and Moslems over
the introduction of Sharia in the northern state of Kaduna and
some other states has claimed hundreds of lives.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Usu Volcano Erupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- After 23 years of sleep, Mt. Usu in
southwestern Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost prefecture, erupted
Friday as scientists had predicted, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of any casualties of property damage from
the eruption, which occurred at 1:10 p.m. local time (0410 GMT),
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
A huge column of gray smoke billowed out of the 732-meter
mountain, television showed.
</P>
<P>
A local meteorological observatory said the smoke reached a
height of 2,700 meters as of 1:30 p.m. local time (0430 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Japan's National Land Agency earlier said a small pyroclastic
flow is moving toward the Pacific Ocean but Hiromu Okada,
professor at Hokkaido University, was quoted by the Kyodo News as
saying that there is no fear of any pyroclastic flow.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has set up a task force headed by Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to deal with the incident.
</P>
<P>
The eruption was expected as seismic tremors had continued at
the volcano and a number of cracks have been found in and around
it, indicating an eruption was imminent.
</P>
<P>
Fairly strong quakes had been repeatedly recorded in areas at
the foot of the mountain since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,000 residents of the nearby city and towns had
evacuated their houses following directives from the municipal
governments issued Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Scientists and emergency officials began warning of a
possible large-scale eruption Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The volcano, which is located about 70 kilometers southwest of
Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital, last erupted in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Poll Reflects How Frenchmen Judge Leaders' Character </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A poll published on Friday said
that Frenchmen prefer to discuss a film or a book with Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin while considering President Jacques Chirac
as a better partner to go to a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the SOFRES polling institute among 1,000
people, said that 48 percent of Frenchmen and Frenchwomen consider
Jospin as a good company to talk about films and books, and 43
percent of them will choose Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 54 percent of Frenchmen and Frenchwomen will choose
Chirac to go to eat or go on vacation together, while only 35
percent prefer to have Jospin's company there, said the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that more Frenchmen and Frenchwomen would
choose Jospin rather than Chirac to organize a political party or
a tennis party. But the two leaders won equal scores in their
talent for organizing an enterprise.
</P>
<P>
From 9 to 18 percent of people inquired in the poll did not
express their specific preferences.

<HEADLINE> UK's Internet Service Provider Settles First Individual Libel Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A university lecturer has become
the first individual in Britain to receive libel damages from an
Internet service provider after reaching an 11th-hour settlement
with the company.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Demon Internet to pay more than 200,000 pounds
(about 320,000 U.S. dollars) in damages and costs to settle a
libel action could mean significantly more online censorship,
according to the Financial Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the first of two actions brought by physicist
Laurence Godfrey against Demon Internet Ltd. was due to start in
the High Court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Godfrey was quoted as saying, "I am delighted with the result.
It is sad that it has taken more than three years of sustained
effort to redress a wrong that could so easily have been avoided
by Demon."
</P>
<P>
Godfrey will receive 15,000 pounds (about 240,000 dollars) at
the end of his three-year battle against Demon after it refused to
remove a news group posting which contained material intended to
destroy his reputation.
</P>
<P>
Demon must also pay legal costs, which have yet to be decided.
The total sum could reach some 200,000 pounds (320,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the settlement reached by the company over material
posted on one of its news groups "will have a chilling effect in
the UK on free speech on the internet," said Adam Taylor of
Withers, a law firm.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A team from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will take part in the competitions of
the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league next season, an
official from the country's basketball authority said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Xin Lancheng, chief director of the Chinese Basketball
Management Center, told a CBA meeting that Hong Kong will become
the 13th team of the league, but it will be a difficult job for
the Center to plan an expansion for the premature league, which is
in its fifth year.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong team asked to be excluded from the relegation
system," Xin said. "We have to discuss the issue with them to find
a better way out for fair play competitions in the league."
</P>
<P>
Xin added the CBA may have to recruit one more team if the Hong
Kong SAR joins because otherwise there will be one team in each
round who has no game to play.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which has not produced enough local basketball
talents, may have to introduce players from the overseas and China
's inland provinces to stay in the first-division league.
</P>
<P>
Xin said the CBA league welcomed the Hong Kong team, but had to
make necessary adjustments to its league system.
</P>
<P>
The league, however, is not ready to give up the relegation
system though about half of the twelve teams want to have the
system scrapped, Xin said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Build Third Major Thoroughfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has decided to
build a third major east-west thoroughfare south of and parallel
to Chang'an Avenue, the city's main artery.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will invest four billion yuan (482 million U.S. dollars)
to build the eight-kilometer and six-lane road.
</P>
<P>
The new thoroughfare will be built by broadening the present
Guang'an Street, which, constructed in the 1950s, is now the sight
of frequent traffic jam, because it is less than 10 meters wide in
most sections.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 households and hundreds of units will have to be
relocated to make way for the new Guang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
The new corridor will run from the Guangqumen fly-over bridge
to the Guang'anmen fly-over bridge. The construction will start in
May and is expected to be finished by September 2001. It will
connect with the Beijing-Shijiangzhuang Expressway in the west and
the Fourth Ring Road in the east.
</P>
<P>
Ping'an Avenue, Beijing's second avenue parallel to and north of
Chang'an Avenue, was opened to traffic last autumn.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), told Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando De
Trazegnies here today that the further enhancement of China-Peru
friendly cooperation in all fields has great potential and broad
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the growth of bilateral friendly ties since
the two countries forged diplomatic relations, particularly after
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori came to power.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and Peru have glorious cultural traditions and both
are developing countries," he said, adding that the two share
similar or identical views on a number of major international
issues.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, Li stressed that the universal
principles of human rights which are widely recognized by the
international community should be respected. However, "Such
universal principles of human rights must take into account the
differing situations within the various countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights reflect historic evolution. All countries,
without exception, are in the process of evolving, so it is
inevitable that a nation's human rights situation is defined by
its own socio-economic development level, so that all nations face
the same task of improving their own human rights," he said,
noting that this is China's basic view of human rights.

"We are willing to actively participate in international
dialogue on human rights to enhance mutual communication and
understanding," he said. Nevertheless, "We oppose a show of
hegemonism and power politics, or interference in other countries'
internal affairs by using human rights as the pretext," he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
De Trazegnies said that though Peru and China are far apart
geographically, "the hearts of our two peoples beat as one,"
adding that the long-standing Peru-China friendship can be traced
back more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Peru and China conducted frequent high-
level exchanges and expanded fruitful economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Peru firmly observes the One China policy,
supports Chinese people's cause of reunification, and believes
that China will realize its complete national reunification.
</P>
<P>
He told Li that Peru opposes the politicization of the human
rights issues and moves taken by Western countries to interfere in
internal affairs of developing countries by making use of the
human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
De Trazegnies also highly commended China's great achievements
in economic construction.

</P>
<P>
The day, which as usual was marked by processions, rallies and
tree-planting ceremonies in the Galilee, the northern "Triangle"
area and the Negev desert, passed peacefully overall, apart from a
serious disturbance in the town of Sakhnin in Lower Galilee area
where more than 20 residents and policemen were lightly injured.

superiors of meetings with Ma'ariv publisher Ofer Nimrodi while he
was under a covert police investigation.

The two, who had taken leave from their posts, were reinstated
after the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Rejuvenation of Industrial Base Paves Way for SOE Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, the state-sector industries were faced with
unprecedented and formidable difficulties as a result of mounting
debt, increasing over-staffing, and heavy social responsibilities,
according to Wang Huabin, a former provincial official in charge
of SOE reform in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Two years later, however, the old industrial base stands a much
better chance of restoring its former glory as it successfully
dealt with the upsurge in unemployment which resulted from painful
restructuring efforts, and managed to turn most of its SOEs into
viable firms with modern enterprise mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
"The state industries in Liaoning have bottomed out,"
provincial governor Zhang Guoguang said. "But we need to work
harder for at least another ten years to completely rejuvenate the
SOEs as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Liaoning aims to further eliminate deficit-ridden SOEs this
year, bringing the loss-making SOEs to below 30 percent of the
total. Meanwhile, most of large- and medium-sized SOEs expect to
establish modern enterprise mechanisms which will enable them to
better adapt to market competition.
</P>
<P>
Economists have pointed out that although greater efforts must
be made to turn around the remaining deficit-ridden enterprises,
the social environment today is more favorable for the deepening
of SOE reform because there is less government intervention in the
business operations of state firms, and the booming non-state
sector, which already accounts for one-half of the provincial
economy, is helping to ease pressures on the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Successful industrial restructuring, along with state policy
incentives such as special loans and debt-to-equity swaps, are
also expected to further facilitate SOE reform in the region.
</P>
<P>
Most important of all, the SOEs there have finally come to
recognize the importance of gaining a greater market share to
survive competition. "A bigger market share should come before the
goal of greater profitability," said Han Shuqi, president of a
petrochemical company in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The improving picture in Liaoning's state sector actually
epitomizes a promising national picture: last year, China's state
sector made profits of 96.7 billion yuan, up 77.7 percent over
1998.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Launches Clean Energy Resource Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality has launched a clean energy resources project to re-
address the problem of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the municipal government has
collected 800 million yuan (96 milllion U.S. dollars) from society
for the project.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of this project, 2,563 coal-burning
boilers in the city's catering and governmental organization
sectors will be replaced by natural gas boilers.
</P>
<P>
Li Shilin, a senior engineer with the Chongqing Environmental
Protection Bureau, said boilers in the catering sector alone
consume one million tons of coal a year, producing the largest
share of the city's air pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Years of anti-pollution efforts have reduced the city's coal
consumption by a quarter, but Chongqing's air is still far from
satisfactory, Li added.

<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Grand National Theater is
expected to be completed in three years, as construction gets
underway tomorrow after two years of preparation.
</P>
<P>
The National Theater will be built just west of the Great Hall
of the People by Tian'anmen Square in the center of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Covering a total area of 180,000 square meters, the National
Theater will include four major buildings -- an opera house,
concert hall, drama theater, and performance center, with a
combined seating capacity of 6,200.
</P>
<P>
Architects from 10 countries have participated in two rounds of
design competition during the past 15 months, and the winner was
French architect Paul Andreu. The French design is being combined
with ideas from Beijing's Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
This was the first national key project which invited bids
according to the Law for Inviting and Submitting Tender passed
last August.
</P>
<P>
This largest cross-century cultural infrastructure project was
approved by the State Council in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
China formulated the plan to build the national Grand Theater
some 39 years ago, with the project tabled for many years due to a
shortage of funds.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Following are the cultural news
highlights released by Xinhua from March 24 to 30:
</P>
<P>
China to Regulate On-line Audio-Visual Business
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Culture issued a notice on March 24 to
regulate the audio-visual business on the Internet so as to
protect intellectual property and develop a healthy market.
</P>
<P>
Every Internet operator must have a legal permit, and the audio-
visual products they deal in must not include pirated, smuggled or
otherwise illegal ones.
</P>
<P>
No imported end products nor MP3 downloads are allowed to be
traded on line. Wholesale trading is forbidden as well.
</P>
<P>
More Ancient Tombs Found in Beijing
</P>
<P>
In addition to a Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - 220 A.D.) tomb which
is under excavation in west Beijing's Shijingshan District,
archaeologists have been found another two tombs dating back to
the Warring States Period (475 B.C.-221 B.C.) in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the two tombs are located some ten
kilometers from the center of Beijing and seem less important than
the larger one of the Western Han Dynasty, which was found some
weeks ago and called by some archaeologists "one of the most
significant archaeological discoveries in Beijing in the past half
century."
</P>
<P>
China's Cultural Market to Open Wider: Official
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Culture Li Yuanchao said that China is looking
to speed up the development of the arts and entertainment sector.
</P>
<P>
More investments in the form of private capital or equity
funding will supplement government funding for movies, magazines,
art trading and education, Li said.
</P>
<P>
 Copyright Protection Goals Achieved
</P>
<P>
The National Copyright Administration recently issued yearly
statistics on copyright protection which showed that anti-
infringement measures have been successful.
</P>
<P>
The statistics indicate that eight provinces and municipalities,
including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guangdong,
Guizhou, Anhui, and Jilin, have set up alliances to combat piracy.

<HEADLINE> New Law to Curb China's Marine Pollution: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's newly-revised Marine
Environmental Protection Law, which will go into effect as on
April 1, will help curb marine pollution and conserve marine
resources, a senior environmental protection official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the law were passed by China's top legislature
in December last year and are designed to protect the marine
environment better still and promote sustainable exploration of
the marine resources involving about three-million square
kilometers of sea area under China's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jirong, deputy director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA), said at a discussion on the new
law, that it will be more effective in protecting the marine
environment since it provides a new legal basis for implementing
relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
China's marine environment has been facing grave challenges
along polluted coastal areas, and the marine eco-system has been
seriously affected, she said.
</P>
<P>
The new law stipulates that government departments take
essential measures to protect marine life, the deputy director
noted, and a new chapter on the protection for endangered marine
species as well as marine ecology has been added.
</P>
<P>
China has 18,000 km of coastline with more than three million
sq km of sea under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Serious pollution in recent years has led to many problems in
the marine environment. There were some 193 instances of red tide
along China's coastal areas from 1990-1998, costing millions of U.
S. dollars in economic losses annually.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's discussion were officials from the
State Oceanic Administration, the Maritime Safety Administration
of China, and the Fishery Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture
which oversees the country's fishing industry.

<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China today approved an amendment
to the Patent Law, ensuring the role of the patent system in the
development of innovative technology and the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment was examined and approved at today's 27th
executive meeting of the State Council, presided over by Premier
Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
China's Patent Law, which was passed on April 1, 1985, has
contributed to encouraging inventions as well as the import of
overseas advanced technology. The first amendment to the law,
approved on September 4, 1992, expanded patent protection and
extended its length.

<HEADLINE> Rejuvenation of Industrial Base Paves Way for SOE Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the same time, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and holding
companies of SOEs in the province registered 1.31 billion yuan in
profit by the end of last year, putting an end to their loss-
making record since 1995.
</P>
<P>
These widespread better performances and favorable growth
momentum in the state industries in Liaoning, a traditional
industrial base in China, during the past two years shows that SOE
reform here has succeeded, and in turn promises an easier path to
the central government goal of getting most large- and medium-
sized SOEs out of financial difficulty by next year.
</P>
<P>
"Liaoning is bound to realize the goal of basically turning
around the state sector by the end of this year," pledged
provincial Governor Zhang Guoguang. By the end of 1999, the
province had reduced the number of large- and medium-sized SOEs in
the red to 35.5 percent of the total, down from the 51 percent at
the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
China pledged in 1997 to extricate most of its loss-making SOEs
from difficulty and get them on the road toward profitability by
this century's end. SOE reform in Liaoning, home to about one-
tenth of China's large- and medium-sized SOEs, is seen as pivotal
to the reform drive.
</P>
<P>
If the SOEs in Liaoning can be transformed into efficient and
profitable firms, the national goal of turning around the state
sector will surely be met, according to Premier Zhu Rongji.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will make a speech at the
inaugural session of the Euro-African summit which opens Monday at
the Cairo International Conference Center. The meeting will be
attended by leaders and heads of state and government of African
and European countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting is the first of its kind between leaders of
the two continents under the auspices of the Organization of
African Unity and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- A French-Egyptian excavation team discovered on Thursday two
chambers and a corridor inside the ancient pyramid of Honie, the
last king in the Pharaonic III Dynasty. The team used the latest
technology in the excavation of the new trove which is located in
Beni Sweif, 90 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt on Thursday welcomed an agreement by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase
oil production to drive down surging oil prices, but said it would
not raise its own crude or condensate production.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Petroleum Amin Sameh Fahmi said Egypt supports any
effort by OPEC and non-OPEC producers to strike a balance between
supply and demand in the interests of both producers and consumers
to realize world oil market stability.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Thursday headed home after a
week-long visit to the United States, during which he held a summit
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in addition to talks with
senior Clinton Administration officials.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-U.S. economic links, Egypt's efforts to transfer U.S.
high technology and the Middle East peace process topped the agenda
of Mubarak's talks during his trip.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Schools Urged to Give Sport "Real Priority" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of Sport,
Fitness and Leisure Trevor Mallard Friday called on all secondary
schools in the country to "give sport real priority."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch in Wellington of the new sportfit
strategy for secondary school sport to 2005, the minister noted
that schools are the place where most young people develop their
active lifestyles, and they have always been the factory for top
achievers in sport.
</P>
<P>
"School sport throughout New Zealand is generally well
organized and well structured, but the system is under pressure as
we move into the new century. There has been a lot of recent
attention on coaching shortages and the time pressures teachers
face. This is a serious issue for the whole of sport," said
Mallard, who is also the minister of education.
</P>
<P>
According to the new sportfit strategy, all secondary schools
in New Zealand are asked to increase the sport and physical
activity levels of students. The strategy aims to train 100,000
young people as sport leaders, able to coach and manage sport.
</P>
<P>
These goals, Mallard stressed, can only be achieved if "schools
give sport real priority."

<HEADLINE> Burundian Delegates Coldshoulder Peace Accord Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The hope to persuade
Burundi's warring parties to agree unanimously on peace accord in
a short time seems slim when delegates attending peace talks in
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha are complaining about the
outmoded expressions in the draft delivered by mediators.
</P>
<P>
Several delegates complained Thursday that the draft accord
contained nothing new and some said their work was a long way from
completion, the African newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't regard this as a draft agreement but as a compilation
of the different positions stated by the different delegations
negotiating here," president of the pro-Tutsi Social Democrat
Party Godefroid Hakizimana was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman for the Hutu National Council for the
Defense of Democracy, Jean-Marie Sindayagaya, said the draft is
nothing new compared with the documents that were distributed at
the end of February.
</P>
<P>
There are still some issues that have not really been properly
discussed, and there is not sufficient consensus on important
issues for the necessary drafts to be drawn up, Sindayagaya said.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, new Burundi peace facilitator, former South
African president Nelson Mandela submitted a draft peace accord to
negotiators, saying they had three weeks to respond and that
responsibility for the final proposal would lie with the
Facilitation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela appealed to the negotiating parties to put away their
differences and approve an agreement quickly.
</P>
<P>
While negotiating delegations have agreed on points of
principle in many areas, they still disagree on key issues such as
army reforms, the future electoral system and arrangements for a
transitional government.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, fighting between Burundian Hutu rebels and the
Tutsi- dominated army has killed more than 200,000 people and
uprooted more than 1.2 million others.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks, which began in June 1998, had made little headway
until Mandela took over as mediator of the talks last December and
urged all Burundian warring parties to negotiate a peaceful
solution.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Offer Emergency Aid to Angolans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Humanitarian Aid Agency
(SHA) will provide this year some 800,000 U.S. dollars as
emergency aid for the war- displaced Angolans living in the
central Huambo Province.
</P>
<P>
According to a note issued by the agency, the above-mentioned
amount will be used to purchase and assemble tents and put up
temporary dwellings and health centers to benefit the displaced
persons in dire need for basic subsistence.
</P>
<P>
Installing wood cookers at nutritional centers, rehabilitating
schools and food stores, and supplying drinking water to the
refugee camps in Huambo City are also parts of the SHA project.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency reiterated in the note that the projects
for the construction and repairs of bridges will remain suspended
until the political and military situation in the region is
improved.
</P>
<P>
It also said that during 1999 SHA spent 1.3 million U.S.
dollars on emergency projects essentially meant to relieve the
suffering of the displaced people in the cities of Huambo and
Caala.
</P>
<P>
Being the main battle field in the Angolan civil war between
the government troops and the rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Huambo Province has
suffered the conflicts for 25 years during which most arable
fields had been deserted while the rural residents fled into major
cities in search for shelters.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have gained the control over the region since
January, 2000 after they had defeated the rebels in late 1999 and
repelled them out of most cities and towns in the central
highland.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Improve Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has pledged
to solve the chronic problem of power supply which posed a serious
threat to its efforts of economic revitalization.
</P>
<P>
The Punch, a leading Nigerian newspaper, on Friday quoted
Vice-President Atiku Abubakar as saying that the government has
mapped out a three-way approach to improve power supply in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the government would invite private
power producers to set up emergency power stations, use
independent power supply and refurbish the equipment of the
National Electric Power Authority (NEPA).
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said Thursday in Lagos that it would be miraculous to
change the unstable power supply situation within a short period
as requested by Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible for the government to put back in shape within
six months what took 30 years to destroy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Import Sugar in Next Eight Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will continue to
import sugar in the next eight years to meet consumers' demand,
The African newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's sugar production was projected to be 430,000 tons by
the year 2009 and would meet the demand, the Executive Secretary
of the Tanzania Sugar Producers Association told the daily.
</P>
<P>
However, Reuben Naburi said Tanzania would have to continue to
import sugar before 2009 because the local industry can not meet
the demand despite a recent rise in sugar output.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's annual sugar production capacity is
120,000 tons while the demand stands at 300,000, he added.
</P>
<P>
Naburi said that privatization has boosted production in two
main sugar factories of Kilombero Sugar Company (KSC) and Mbibwa
Sugar Estates (MSE) .
</P>
<P>
The KSC was projected to produce 100,000 tons of sugar during
the year 2004/2005, while the MSE is projected to produce 46,000
tons, Naburi added.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Region Drives Sheep off Ecologically Sensitive Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 sheep and goats
have been driven off from a nature reserve in the Helan Mountains
of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
This step was taken to protect local ecological balance from
over-grazing. The mountainous area, which is renowned as a land of
ideal sheep farms for a long time, has suffered serious erosion.
</P>
<P>
The 148,000-hectare nature reserve in the Helan Mountains has
more than 860 species of wildlife, including black stork and four
other rare species under the first-class and red deer, blue sheep
and 20 other wildlife species under the second-class national
protection.
</P>
<P>
This year, the local government is planning to seal off an
additional 67,000 hectares of mountainous area in the region for
afforestation over the next eight years, and plans to restore and
further improve the ecological system of the Helan Mountains in
five years.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Enforce Use of Unleaded Gas on April 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it will start enforcing the use of unleaded fuel in
Metro Manila on April 1, a move that is expected to accelerate the
phaseout of leaded gas nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui said that
while the law calls for the total phaseout of leaded gas by
January 2001, the government has committed to strictly enforcing
this measure before the deadline, at least in major urban centers
like Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
"For the Metro Manila area, we're removing leaded gasoline
starting April 1. This is in response to the Clean Air Act,"
Tiaoqui said.
</P>
<P>
"What we've done is we've advanced phasing out in the Metro
Manila area. We'll phase out leaded nationwide earlier than 2001,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, Philippine President Joseph Estrada signed
the Clean Air Act into law and promised the nation a cleaner
environment with the phaseout of leaded fuels.
</P>
<P>
In signing the law, the president reiterated his administration
's commitment to fulfilling the people's constitutional right to a
healthful ecology.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2000 and beyond, all fuel types shall be lead-free
and gradually reduced in terms of additives, with corresponding
penalties and fines to be imposed on offenses and violations,"
Estrada was reported as saying in signing the law on June 23 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Estrada added that the Clean Air Act is a comprehensive act of
legislation that addressed issues on air quality, pollution,
control and sustainable development.

SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Thailand Friday expressed the hope
of forming a free trade area with South Korea in the near future
to drastically expand bilateral trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand is hopeful in the near future that we can move to
some discussions on the establishment of a free trade area between
Thailand and (South) Korea," Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi told a press conference on the sidelines of a two-day
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which
started here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who will take over the World Trade Organization in
2002, said Seoul and Bangkok have already agreed on a feasibility
study for the free trade area.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Supachai also expressed his support for
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's proposal for an
international monitoring system to check the speculative nature of
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
The framework will not limit the activities of hedge funds but
rather provide more information for governments, particularly
those in countries susceptible to the movements of hedge funds, to
make the right decision, said the Thai deputy prime minister.

<P>
A nationwide survey, conducted by the China Economic Situation

<HEADLINE> Restructuring to Be Main Theme of Next Five-Year Plan (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirdly, the domestic market for China's leading traditional
consumer products has already become relatively saturated.
</P>
<P>
Previous development of the country's consumer markets have
suggested that leading consumer products changed from time to time,
Ma said.
</P>
<P>
At one time in China, it was bicycles, watches, and sewing
machines that topped the shopping lists of Chinese consumers. Then,
it was television sets and refrigerators. Now, computers, cars,
and apartments dominate.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese consumers are now very reluctant to open their
purses, which prevents the new consumer goods from becoming the
driving forces behind domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
As the new consumer goods are more expensive, the capital
accumulation process has been prolonged, Ma said. The decrease of
family income for a considerable segment of the population,
especially urban labors and farmers, also poses an impediment.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next five to ten years, China will remain in a period
of readjustment, with particular efforts to ease the excessive
production capacity and to rid itself of backward equipment and
management," Ma predicted.
</P>
<P>
To cope with this not-so-promising future, Ma proposed that the
country step up restructuring and speed up the development of new
products. In the meantime, efforts should be made to quicken the
shifting of key consumer products.
</P>
<P>
Before these two requirements are completed, it would be quite
natural and logical for China's economy to grow at about seven
percent a year, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring to Be Main Theme of Next Five-Year Plan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official noted that the main propeller for China's previous
rapid economic growth was the shortage of goods, as these
shortages aroused huge investment impulses which resulted later in
enhanced production capacity and higher economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Yet, when it came to the early 1990s, the once-hungry domestic
market began to see an over-supply of goods for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, advances in the information economy and technology
have led to decreased demand for the products of traditional
industries, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the country's energy consumption for every 10,000
yuan (about 1,200 US dollars) of the GDP averaged 2.3 tons in 1995,
but this figure dropped to 2.0 tons in 1996, 1.9 tons in 1997, and
about 1.5 tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This means that technological advances and the information
economy can't in themselves guarantee the rapid and sustained
growth of the economy," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"While new economic growth spots are fostered in the process,
some traditional growth areas began to be eliminated," he said.
</P>
<P>
He particularly stressed the importance of restructuring the
Chinese economy in the new century. "If the country can't adjust
to the challenge swiftly, the macroeconomy will naturally come to
a decline."

<HEADLINE> Restructuring to Be Main Theme of Next Five-Year Plan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Restructuring will become the
major theme when China maps out its next Five-Year Plan of
economic and social development, according to the upcoming issue
of Outlook, China's most authoritative news weekly.
</P>
<P>
The April 3 issue of the magazine notes that the 10th Five-Year
Plan (2001-2005), which is being deliberated by related government
departments, will largely be devoted to economic restructuring
rather than development.
</P>
<P>
This view is also held by Ma Jiantang, director of the National
Economy Department under the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
After 15 years of rapid expansion, China's economic growth
witnessed a year-on-year decline beginning in 1993, and was
especially noticeable in the current Five-Year Plan period (1996-
2000), the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a rate of
14.2 percent. The GDP growth rate slipped to 10.5 percent in 1995
and was down to 7.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decline of economic growth has not been a short-term one,
Ma said, adding that it also should not be attributed to either
external factors or government economic policies, though these
have played some role in the process.
</P>
<P>
The official maintained that three major intrinsic economic
factors are responsible for China's declining economic growth.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the country's production capacity for ordinary
industrial products has been excessive. This situation began to
emerge as early as the first years of the eighth Five-Year Plan
period and became especially evident in the ninth Five-Year Plan
period, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Overloaded Buses: Kenyan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President has ordered the
country's police to set up road blocks for an immediate crackdown
on overloaded buses and matatus (mini-bus) to minimize road
carnage, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Thursday following the country's
worst ever road crash in which 75 people were killed after two
packed buses had the head-on collision in central Kenya
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moi ordered police to set up road blocks and ensure errant
drivers were prosecuted to deter them from floating traffic laws
with impunity.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who was addressing the public at a flower farm in Naivasha
in central Kenya, said his government could not sit back and
watch Kenyans lose their lives because of reckless driving and
lack of action.
</P>
<P>
He also directed the Ministry of Road and Public Works to
repair accident black spots to help save more lives.
</P>
<P>
Sections of the highway should be cleared and expanded to give
drivers a clear view of the road ahead, Moi stressed.

<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Air Zimbabwe, the national
airline, is finalizing details to facilitate its privatization
through examination of the whole management system.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the airline said Thursday that the process is
being carried out by experts at the instruction of new management
and is exposing weaknesses in the old management systems, which
cause huge loss and must be corrected.
</P>
<P>
It said the airline's board of directors last year put a new
management team in place, which was tasked with improving these
systems.
</P>
<P>
The process of coming up with systems that ultimately improve
the airline's operations has involved the use of external
specialized expertise.
</P>
<P>
This included the use of consultants in the areas of introducing
a performance management system, job evaluation, compensation
management practices, customer care delivery and financial
management and accounting.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Keeps Sinking As Water Table Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Extraction of ground water for
use in industry is causing continued land subsidence in Bangkok
and environs, the Bangkok Post reported Friday, quoting a water
table expert.
</P>
<P>
Samrit Chusanathat was quoted as saying that while stricter
controls had led to a significant reduction in subsidence in
crisis areas of the city, where sinking has slowed from about 10
centimeters a year in the early 1980s to 3.5 centimeters a year
now, the situation in surrounding provinces has become critical.
</P>
<P>
Samrit said no new permits have been issued for ground water
use in the city's crisis areas. "Some permits have been revoked
for users who have access to tap water," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the gap between water fees, 3.50 baht (9.3 U.S. cents)
for one cubic meter for ground water and over seven baht (18.6
cents) for tap water, made many factories reluctant to make the
change.
</P>
<P>
Samrit said heavy demand from industry meant permits were being
renewed, but only on a yearly basis instead of for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Industrial use accounts for 1.35 million cubic meters a day. He
said it is agreed ground water charges need to go up to at least
five baht (13.3 cents) to force industrial users to abandon ground
water. The proposal has been forwarded for cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
Samrit said while subsidence problems seemed to be improving
for the inner city, the situation is getting worse in the
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Seven provinces were put on red alert in 1996. However, about 2.
5 million cubic meters of ground water are still pumped up daily
in the crisis areas, double the safe amount.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is vital that the government gave greater
importance to artificially recharging the water table, although
this would be costly.
</P>
<P>
Artificial storage and recovery is a proven technology which
has been put into use in some foreign cities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bank Reduces Branches to Save Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Another Thai commercial bank,
Bank of Ayudhya, jumped on the bandwagon of cutting cost by
streamlining its branch network, the Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Ayudhya, a medium-sized Thai commercial bank, is
expected to review the performance of each of its 420 branches
nationwide and classify them into different categories, the
newspaper quoted Jamlong Atikul, the bank's senior executive vice
president, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 420 branches will be closed, but the bank has not
yet decided how many, according to Jamlong.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank reduced the number of staff to 9,900
following the early retirement of 1,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of streamlining the branch network is to
reduce operating cost and increase efficiency and quality of
services, the banker said.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of high proportion of non-performing loans,
which accounted for about 40 percent of total outstanding loans of
the banking system, Thai banks have to make operational adjustment
including closing branches and cutting jobs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bangkok Bank, the country's largest commercial bank,
reduced its employees by 6,000.

<HEADLINE> Samsung Seeking More Share of China's Chip Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Samsung Techwin Co.
will continue its expansion in China's chip mounter market this
year, aiming to reach a 22 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Techwin Friday said it has received 17 million U.S.
dollars worth of orders for chip mounters at "Nepcon Shanghai 2000,
" an international electronics manufacturing show ending Thursday
in Shanghai, China.
</P>
<P>
Chip mounters help chipmakers automatically mount semiconductor
chips on printed circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
Samsung's CP-45FV, a high-precision chip mounter, Screen
Printers and other new products were favorably received at the
Chinese trade show.
</P>
<P>
"The new orders, which account for 68 percent of Samsung
Techwin's chip mounter sales target for this year in China, have
brightened our chances of remaining No. 1 exporter to the Chinese
market," said a Samsung spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Techwin, South Korea's largest semiconductor equipment
maker, has held the biggest share of China's mid-speed chip
mounter market since 1998 and set the year's sales target at 25
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from CP-45FV, we are confident we will grab a 22 percent
market share by increasing mid-speed chip mounter sales possibly
by up to 30 million dollars," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Invites DPRK to Join APEC With Guest Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
on Friday invited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
to join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum with
guest status.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech of a two-day APEC forum meeting held here,
Kim hoped the DPRK would be able to participate in APEC activities
with guest status upon consultation with other APEC member
economies if it wishes so.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out that APEC members should fully consider the
role of the DPRK in business activities such as establishing joint
ventures with South Korean companies to guard against risks.
</P>
<P>
He said South Korea would like to see the establishment of a
formal channel for active support by APEC member economies in the
event of a request for assistance by the DPRK, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the day when North Korea is a member of APEC,
" said Kim.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, the president also proposed the prompt
establishment of a hedge fund "monitoring channel" as to prevent
another financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president also hoped that the information infrastructure
such as computers and high-speed information networks, will be
established in all corners of the Asia-Pacific region to enable
poor and vulnerable members of the region to easily access quality
education.
</P>
<P>
He also called for an APEC social safety net participated by
both the government and the private sector to share burden in
times of unforeseen difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The APEC region has recently experienced a number of traumatic
natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and fires, and a
social safety net in APEC could have alleviated such difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The APEC forum began a two-day meeting Friday morning in Seoul
to discuss economic and social issues facing its 21 members in the
new century.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 delegates attended the meeting under the theme of "
Shared Prosperity and Harmony" in an era of the knowledge-based
and digital economy.
</P>
<P>
The forum was proposed by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
at the APEC summit in Auckland, New Zealand, last September.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Quarterly Economic Growth Likely to Hit 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economic growth rate
may hit 12 percent in the first quarter of this year, said the
Ministry of Finance and Economy Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Hun-jai said signs of
economic overheating have yet to emerge despite the higher-than-
expected growth rate.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said the first-quarter figure is evidence
that growth has not slowed sufficiently despite the government's
claims to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
They said the minister, who recently estimated the first-
quarter growth rate at 10 percent, is trying to ease the markets'
inflation worries but the figure makes such worries persist.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that despite the high growth in the
first three months of this year, the annual GDP growth rate will
be around six percent as the economy is expected to slow down in
the coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 10.7 percent
in 1999, triggering concerns that the economy may be overheating
after the GDP got negative 6.7 percent in 1998 following the
financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans in
late 1997.

<HEADLINE> No Coalition Partner Proposes Cabinet Reshuffle: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said a cabinet reshuffle may not be forthcoming but two positions
left vacant by a deputy prime minister will be filled soon, the
Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan was quoted as saying on Thursday that coalition parties
had not discussed whether there should be a reshuffle following
Sanan Kachornprasart's resignation as deputy premier and interior
minister Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan denied reports that vacancies would be filled by Banyat
Bantadthan, a deputy leader of the ruling Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
But a source close to Sanan was quoted as saying that Banyat
would get the interior portfolio while Sanan would remain
secretary-general of the Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
The source said Sanan would not accept any political office
even if the Constitutional Court ruled in his favor.
</P>
<P>
The court will decide soon whether to hear the National Counter
Corruption Commission's charge that Sanan had intentionally made a
false assets and debts declaration.
</P>
<P>
A guilty verdict will mean that Sanan can not hold any
political office for five years.
</P>
<P>
The source said the Democrats wanted Banyat in the cabinet as
soon as possible to help the party prepare for the general
election this year.
</P>
<P>
Chamni Sakdiset, a deputy interior minister, was made acting
minister while the prime minister will handle agencies overseen by
Sanan in his role as deputy premier.
</P>
<P>
Chamni said it was still too early to make replacements and
declined to say if the Democrats will wait for the Constitutional
Court ruling on Sanan's case first.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said Thursday that none
of the coalition partners had proposed a cabinet reshuffle or a
House dissolution so far.

<HEADLINE> APEC Opens Forum on Economic Challenges in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Forum opened a two-day meeting Friday morning
in Seoul to discuss economic and social issues facing its 21
members in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 dignitaries, including finance ministers and officials
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and experts
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of "Shared Prosperity and Harmony," the meeting
is expected to provide momentum for APEC to go beyond mere
regional dialogue and into a regional cooperative organization.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to focus on overcoming of the Asian economic
crisis via liberalization and reform, the creation of a new
financial structure to prevent another crisis and promotion of
regional cooperation to mitigate social and economic disparities.
</P>
<P>
Among the three top agenda items, the most important and
controversial issues concern hedge funds and short-term capital,
which were considered to be the primary causes of the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The results of the forum will be reported to a meeting of APEC
finance ministers in September and the APEC summit in November.
</P>
<P>
The forum was proposed by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
at the APEC summit in Auckland, New Zealand last September, during
which he called for policy dialogue among member states to prevent
another economic crisis, and alleviate income and wealth
disparities between and within member economies.
</P>
<P>
At the Auckland meeting, APEC leaders agreed to develop the
forum into an institution for future-oriented and practical
regional cooperation in an era of the knowledge-based and digital
economy.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Police on Alert in Anticipation of Mass Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- As the Indonesian government is
determined to go on with the hike of fuel prices from April 1,
Jakarta Police Headquarters (Polda Metro Jaya) on Friday ordered
its personnel to stay on high alert in anticipation of a wave of
protests.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Polda Metro Jaya Let. Col. Zaenuri Lubis said
in an interview with Xinhua Friday morning, "Our personnel have
been ordered to stay on high alert starting from today, in a bid
to anticipate anything that may happen following the government's
decision to increase fuel price as of April 1."
</P>
<P>
"We want to safeguard the capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the situation in the capital is absolutely under control,
and there is nothing to worry about," Lubis stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to make sure that nothing will disturb the
Jakartans activities," Lubis said, adding such an order is just a
regular step for the police.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the Polda Metro Jaya has heard there will be a
big demonstration of students to protest the government's decision
to raise fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that seven student and labor organizations have
vowed to stage protest involving 10,000 people on Saturday to
protest the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
"We'll mobilize at least 10,000 students and workers on
Saturday, with the target of occupying the House of
Representatives building,"the Jakarta Post daily quoted Dita Indah
Sari, Coordinator of the National Front for Indonesian Labor
Struggle, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the plan, Lubis told Xinhua that the police will
allow them to make protest," as long as they are not anarchic and
do not damage the government and social facilities. But, if they
conduct anarchic actions, we will take firm measures against them.
We will have no doubt."
</P>
<P>
Separately, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said that until now, the government have no
plan to postpone the decision to raise fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
"Up to the day (Thursday) we have not considered delaying it,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The government and the House agreed to raise fuel prices by 10
percent on Saturday in order to cut fuel subsidies for the April-
December 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But the government said it would protect the poor families and
public transportation owners from the fuel price raising by
providing them with cash subsidies to buy fuel at lower prices.

<HEADLINE> Czech PM Says His Country Backs EU Sanctions on Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Czech Prime Minister
Milos Zeman said here Thursday that his country firmly stands by
the sanctions imposed by the European Union on Austria for its
inclusion of the far-right Freedom Party into the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Zeman's remarks came when Vienna has appealed for an end to
political sanctions its 14 EU partners imposed after the Freedom
Party entered the government on February 4.
</P>
<P>
He was telling reporters after talks with his Finnish
counterpart Paavo Lipponen on the last day of his two-day visit to
Finland.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of far-right members of Freedom Party, until
recently headed by Jorg Haider, in the Austrian government has
fanned the fire of the extremist forces in the entire European
continent, thus creating a threat not only to Austria but Europe
as a whole, Zeman noted.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Zeman's tone, Lipponen said as long as the far-right
party stays in the Austrian government, the EU's diplomatic
isolation of Austria will remain.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Austria's situation, the prime ministers also
exchanged views on issues such as the EU's expansion and bilateral
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
As for the Czech Republic's EU membership, Zeman said that his
country is geared up paving ways for it and expected to enter the
15-nation bloc in 2003.
</P>
<P>
He expressed strong support for the neighboring Slovak Republic
's bid to join the EU and NATO.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here the Czech prime minister met with Finnish
President Tarja Halonen and Parliament Speaker Riita Uosukainen.
</P>
<P>
Seeking privatization of the telecommunications sector in his
country to obtain investment in infrastructure, Zeman also met
executives from Finland's telecommunications tycoon, Nokia.
</P>
<P>
He will travel to Norway and Lithuania after Finland.

<HEADLINE> Regulation Introduced to Combine Airline Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A new airline regulation asking
aviation companies serving 100 popular domestic routes to combine
their services is scheduled to take effect on April 1, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Flights will be limited to suit market demands in those routes,
and hopefully, the move will increase per airplane passenger rate
and improve the efficiency of those flights, the paper quoted
sources from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Airlines operating on the 100 routes will be ordered to hand
over 80 percent of their revenue to a special committee under CAAC,
which will then distribute the money back to the airlines
according to their economic and personnel input.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation is aimed at improving airline transportation
and curbing recurrent competition over ticket discounts.
</P>
<P>
Bosses from all 24 domestic airlines agreed to the new
regulation last Saturday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the regulation is a compromise to some
domestic airlines that sell discounted air tickets to attract
passengers, as it allows a 20 percent ticket price margin,
tantamount to allowing airlines to provide a 20 percent discount
to passengers.
</P>
<P>
While new regulation is expected to curb air ticket discounting,
it has in fact dodged CAAC's repeated ban on air ticket discount,
insiders said.
</P>
<P>
"Before new measures are released, CAAC will keep its ban on
air ticket discount," said an official who declined to give his
name.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Warned of Agency Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The China Consumers' Association
(CCA) has offered tips to tourists on choosing travel agencies,
especially for overseas tours, to help prevent agency scams, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Price should not be the single most important factor in
choosing a travel agency, Zhang Yuanchao, CCA vice-secretary, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He singled out cut-rate tour packages offered illegally by some
small travel agencies that only charge consumers for travel
expenses and entrance to scenic spots. These seemingly attractive
offers turn out to be scams when the agencies take tourists to
over-priced gift stores and make a commission from sales, the
official warned.
</P>
<P>
Such tour packages have been banned by the National Tourism
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are advised to choose large State travel agencies
with good reputations and official approval. Only 67 agencies have
been approved to date to offer services for overseas tour groups.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are also advised to carefully study their contracts
with the agencies and to buy travel insurance.
</P>
<P>
Currently, representative offices of overseas travel agencies
in China are not allowed to organize or receive travel groups.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's association handled some 5,330 complaints about travel
agencies last year, up 41 percent from the previous year. The
majority of complaints involved tours to Hong Kong, Singapore,
Malaysia and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Two Chinese Oil Firms Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The merger, approved by the State Council, China's highest
governing body, is part of a three-year strategy to reformulate
the country's oil industry, said Jiang Qiangui, vice-minister
State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
As a wholly owned subsidiary of the larger Sinopec, the Beijing-
based China National Star Corp was renamed Sinopec Star Petroleum
Co Ltd, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the central government has been trying to make the
oil business stronger by making management more efficient, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec President Li Yizhong said the merger will reinforce
Sinopec's capability for oil and natural gas exploitation while
promoting Sinopec Star Petroleum Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Now being able to do business easily with Sinopec's other
subsidiaries, Sinopec Star Petroleum Co Ltd will have a more
stable market and not need to build its own refineries or chemical
plants.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, there were three major oil and petrochemical
companies in China: Sinopec, the China National Petroleum Corp and
China Offshore Oil Corp. The latter two focused on onshore and
offshore crude oil, while Sinopec concerned itself with oil
refining and the petrochemical businesses.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, China National Petroleum Corp and Sinopec were
asked to transfer some of their subsidiaries to integrate oil
drilling, refining and chemical products.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization has also brought provincial sales companies
into the fold of the giants and allowed the big firms to
distribute management around China.
</P>
<P>
Now China National Petrochemical Corp mainly taps petroleum and
natural gas in northern and western China. It may also develop
some petrochemical products. Sinopec is more active in eastern and
coastal areas. It also manages north China's Shengli and Zhongyuan
oil fields.
</P>
<P>
But China National Star Petroleum Corp did not get reshuffled
then. Established in January 1997, this company was the successor
of the Bureau of Petroleum and Marine Geology under the Ministry
of Geology and Mineral Resources, which had prospected for oil and
gas since 1955 and made finds in 35 basins.
</P>
<P>
China National Star Petroleum Corp discovered oil in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Tarim Basin and in the East
China Sea. It has found 162 million tons of oil and 142.6 billion
cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The company has six onshore bureaux, two offshore bureaux, four
subordinate enterprises and six research units.

fiscal policy and issue more treasury bonds this year, but poor
liquidity of the treasury bond market is limiting the size of debt
issuance, Dai writes in a report commissioned by China National
Debt Association.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 and 1999, the government's proactive fiscal policy was
very successful in timely reversing the downturn of the Chinese
economy. The policy contributed 1.5 and 2.5 percentage points
respectively to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.8 and
7.1 percent in the two years.
</P>
<P>
Since the expansionary fiscal policy calls for issuing more
treasury bonds, a developed treasury bond market with high
liquidity is necessary, as has been proved in many other countries
with matured treasury bond markets, where people have full
confidence in the bonds and the government enjoys ample room for
debt issuance.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that such a market is also urgently needed in
China.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the Chinese government issued a series of
treasury bonds, which carried little risk yet comparatively high
returns. However, due to the low efficiency of the bond market, it
was very difficult for bond holders to cash in their treasury
bonds.
</P>
<P>
At that time, some bond holders had to sell their bonds at very
low prices when they urgently needed cash. As a result, the
government had to resort to administrative means to distribute its
treasury bonds. It was after the practice was changed and a
secondary treasury bond market was established that the government
had expanded its debt issuing capability.

<HEADLINE> China's Treasury Bond Market Should Have Greater Liquidity: Expert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economist notes that as the central bank has repeatedly cut
bank interest rates, low bond yields have made it difficult than
before for the government to expand the size of national debt.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that the existing treasury bonds are mostly
three-year and five-year ones, some experts suggest the government
issue treasury bills with three-, six- and nine-month maturities,
which have the highest liquidity among treasuries, to attract
short-term investments.
</P>
<P>
To invigorate the treasury bond market, experts suggest that
inter-bank bond trading should be expanded to account for the
largest business volume in the bond market. China started inter-
bank bond business in 1997, but it is still limited to a small
number of commercial banks, securities companies and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
The central bank should also play a greater role in the
treasury bond market and expand its open-market operations. In
1999 the central bank's open-market operations in treasury bond
trading amounted to more than 500 billion yuan, still far from
enough to regulate the monetary base, the economist writes. To
facilitate the central bank's open-market operations, bond
repurchase business has to be developed.
</P>
<P>
The economist suggests that China's top legislature approve a
ceiling of at least 500 billion yuan for treasury bill issuance,
and that local governments be allowed to sell their own debts to
finance their own development projects rather than relying on the
national debt.

<P>
BOGOTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- About 50 entrepreneurs from
Colombia and Venezuela met Thursday in Bogota to discuss
possibilities of reactivating trade and investment in both
countries, which have suffered a severe fall due to last year's
recession.
</P>
<P>
Both countries need an economic start-up, said an official of
the seminar organizer, adding that Venezuela has managed to
stabilize its economy, but the government "has not yet had a
coherent program to guarantee the growth."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're entering a stage of growth despite the
high price of petroleum," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Venezuela will increase its petroleum
exports to over 19 billion U.S. dollars this year, 3 billion
higher than that of 1999, according to a weekly report on the
state of Venezuela's economy.

<HEADLINE> Peru's GDP Rises in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Peru's gross domestic product (GDP)
registered a 7 percent growth in February as compared with the
same month last year, said Pablo Secada, an economist with
Santander Investment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This GDP growth rate is in accordance with the production
increase goal that we set for the first quarter of this year,
which is 5.5 percent to 6 percent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this growth to public activities in Peru's
presidential election campaign, which promoted an increase in
input, taxation and income from custom duties.
</P>
<P>
Secada expressed his dissatisfaction with the development of
the primary sectors, which, he said, were not as dynamic as
expected. At the same time, however, he showed his confidence for
the future of these sectors.
</P>
<P>
Peru's economy has been gaining strength since last October and
the growth hit a higher level in February, Secada added.

BUENOS AIRES, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando

United States in June, said an official here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While staying in the United States, De la Rua will hold talks
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the official added. The visit
has been postponed due to the work load of the Argentine leader.
</P>

During the meeting, De la Rua will seek a more independent
relationship with the United States, which is different from what
former president Carlos Menem practiced in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De la Rua will also look for Washington's political
support following its backing of his economic plan, which resulted
in the International Monetary Fund agreeing to give Argentina a
credit line of 7.4 billion U.S. dollars, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Hosts Symposium On "Comfort Women" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 170 scholars from China and
other countries and regions are here discussing Japanese
militarists' World War II atrocities.
</P>
<P>
A three-day international symposium on the issue of Chinese "
comfort women" during the World War II (1939-1945) period opened
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Those attending indignantly pointed out that the "comfort women
" system the Japanese militarists adopted during World War II is a
supreme disgrace in the history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that such a seminar has been held in
China.
</P>
<P>
Materials provided by participants show that China is the
country that suffered greatest harm from this shameful event, as
statistics show that some 200,000 of the acknowledged 400,000 "
comfort women" were Chinese.
</P>
<P>
During the war, the Japanese invaders established "comfort
centers" in every place they trampled over in China.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese invasion troops established 83 such "comfort
centers" in Shanghai alone.
</P>
<P>
The symposium attracted 170 scholars from China's mainland,
Hong Kong and Taiwan, and Japan, the Republic of Korea, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Philippines, the United
States, New Zealand, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, participants will discuss issues
including the "comfort women" system, Unit 731, the Nanjing
Massacre, and post-war compensation from the Japanese government.

the third gold medal in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
Yagudin, winner at the European championships in Vienna last
month, gave a brand new programme on the Nice ice rink. Skating
to the music of Tosica by Puccini, he doublefooted in the quad toe
loop and triple toe loop combination before a successful quad toe
loop, which decides the final rankings of the men's skaters.
</P>
<P>
He was awarded six 5.8s for technical merit from nine judges
and seven 5.9s for presentation.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do my best, but I think it was enough tonight.
Frankly, it was tough to defend the title this time," he said. "So
many skaters tried to do quad this time, and many did it."
</P>
<P>
Many attempted to skate quad jump but only Yagudin had solid
landing.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Elvis Stojko, who is making his tenth appearance at
the world championships, finished second in the category.
</P>
<P>
Third went to American Michael Weiss.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian Evgeni Plusenko, who was second in the short
programme, dropped to the fourth after free skating.
</P>
<P>
Chinese skater Li Chengjiang, who is making debut at the world
championships, was fifth.

<HEADLINE> Drexler Resognes as U-of-Houston Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Former NBA star Clyde Drexler
has resigned as men's coach at the University of Houston,
according to reports on thursday.
</P>
<P>
Drexler, named as one of the NBA's 50 Great Players, informed
Houston director of athletics Chet Gladchuk on Wednesday night
that he wanted to step down after coaching for the last two
seasons, citing he needed to spend more time with his family after
20 year basketball career.
</P>
<P>
"The time away from home has been difficult," Drexler was
quoted as saying. "Despite my enthusiasm for the job, the
university and the student-athletes, I need to re-prioritize my
lifestyle so that I can spend more time with my family."
</P>
<P>
Drexler compiled a 19-39 record in his two seasons as coach,
but laid the foundation for a basketball rebirth at Houston with
his recruiting efforts.
</P>
<P>
Drexler was one of three players in league history to
accumulate 20,000 points, 6,000 rebounds and 6,000 assists. He
helped the Houston Rockets win their second straight NBA title in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Before his NBA career, Drexler led the University of Houston
to two Final Four appearances and ended his career as the only
Cougar to amass 1,000 points, 900 rebounds, 300 assists and 250
steals.
</P>
<P>
Drexler retired as a player after the 1997-98 season despite
leading the Rockets in scoring (18.5 ppg) to become the men's
coach at his alma mater.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Androstenedione has been added
among the list of drugs banned by National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
Androstenedione, a performance-enhancing drug taken by U.S.
major league baseball's Mark McGwire when he hit a record 70 home
runs in 1998, is banned by most sports and the Olympics, but not
by baseball.
</P>
<P>
NBA on Wednesday said the NBA-NBA Players Association
Prohibited Substances Committee added Androstendione and eight
other substances to the list of steroids banned by the NBA-NBPA
Anti-Drug Agreement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Stresses Need to Implement Signed Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat stressed the necessity to implement the
accords signed by the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with visiting Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, he said "we asked President Clerides to help push
forward the Middle East peace process," according to the
Palestinian News Agency (WAFA).
</P>
<P>
Arafat and wife Soha Arafat received Clerides and his wife
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"We put President Clerides in the picture of the peace process
and the dangers facing it due to the Israeli settlement expansion
especially near Jerusalem and Bethlehem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not ask for the impossible, We just want a sincere
implementation of the signed accords," Arafat told reporters,
adding that the recent talks in Washington failed to make any
significant progress.
</P>
<P>
On Clerides' visit he said "we will never forget the continuous
support offered by the Cypriot leadership and people at hard times
over the recent years. I hold in high esteem my personal friendship
with President Clerides which strengthened the bilateral ties
between the Palestinian and Cypriot peoples."
</P>
<P>
Clerides said Arafat briefed him on the difficulties facing the
peace talks, pointing out "the necessity of reaching a fair
solution that guarantees peace and the withdrawal of occupiers from
our territories."
</P>
<P>
Clerides was apparently referring to both Turkey, that controls
the northern third of Cyprus, and Israel, that still holds many
Arab territories, as "occupiers."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his desire to make more efforts to establish peace
and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After a red-carpet welcome Clerides was granted the Bethlehem
2000 decoration at the Palestinian presidential office in the West
Bank city of Ramallah by Arafat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clerides arrived in Ramallah earlier Friday from Israel on a
visit to the Palestinian self-rule areas, which came four days
after the opening of an air route between Gaza and Larnaca, Cyprus.
Palestinian flights will shuttle the two places on a bi-weekly
basis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus offers continuous assistances to the Palestinians in
terms of scholarships, training courses and two medical centers in
the West Bank that cost 2 million U.S. dollars, according to
Palestinian sources.

<HEADLINE> Clerides Reaffirms Bizonal, Bicommunal Federation Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
underlined Friday that his government remains firm in its effort to
reach a solution in Cyprus through the establishment of a bizonal,
bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remark at the airport in southern coast city
of Larnaca upon returning from a four-day state visit to Israel,
the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed the belief that a federation solution could
guarantee human rights for all citizens on the island and safeguard
the return of refugees after decades of division on the island as
well as other freedoms such as the freedom of movement and
expression.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Turkish Cypriots' demand for a two-state
confederation solution, he said "If we do what the Turkish side
does and say that we do not accept a bizonal, bicommunal
federation, then we have no basis for a settlement."
</P>
<P>
In such a case, international interest for a solution would also
diminish, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third in the wake
of a coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the United Nations has been trying for years to
bring the two sides back together through a bizonal, bicommunal
federation formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash hopes for the recognition
of his breakaway regime in the north, now recognized only by
Turkey, and a confederation of two states on the island.
</P>
<P>
The two communities on Cyprus have held two rounds of U.N.-
sponsored indirect talks in New York and Geneva, so far with no
progress. They will hold another round in New York, starting May
23.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- The ministerial meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has already put to work a "new
mechanism" to settle oil price, said Algerian Energy and Mines
Minister Chakib Khelil on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers in their latest meeting in Vienna, Austria, early
this week, agreed on a 20-day moratorium to get the per-barrel oil
price stabilized to the 22-28-U.S. dollar level, Khelil said.
</P>
<P>
"In case the oil price per-barrel exceeded the 28 dollar bar,
the OPEC daily output would automatically go up 500,000 barrels per
day (bpd)", he said, adding that "once the price sinks to less than
22 dollars, OPEC will cut the output by 500,000 bpd to restore
balance to the market."
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A senior official of the National Bank of Kuwait
expected that Kuwait would achieve a budget surplus this fiscal
year thanks to the increase in oil output quota within the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Under the new quota, about a 3-billion-dollar surplus is
attainable if average oil price remained over 23 dollars per
barrel, Randa Azar Khori said.
</P>
<P>
By mid-March, average Kuwaiti crude oil price hit 22.06 dollars
per barrel (dpb) against 11.7 dpb in the corresponding period in
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Qatar's 2000-2001 fiscal year is to kick off on Saturday
with a budget based on an average oil price of 15 dollar per
against an outgoing budget based on 10 dollar per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Deficit in the new budget would be 2.783 billion riyals (764.8
million dollars), down from 3.602 billion riyals (989.8 million
dollars) in the outgoing fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait Petroleum International Aviation Company
(Q8) has signed an agreement to supply jet fuel to the airways of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states at London's Heathrow
Airport during the next fiscal year starting on April 1, it was
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Q8 will supply the GCC airlines 357,000 barrels
of jet fuel over a year, said a statement issued by Q8's parent
company Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), quoted by the Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Q8 takes care of KPC's refineries in West Europe. It signed an
agreement last December to supply 750,000 barrels of jet fuel to
British Airways and Swiss Air at Heathrow airport.
</P>
<P>
The new deal has brought Q8's total annual sales at Heathrow
airport to 2.143 million barrels, accounting for 5 percent of jet
fuel sales at Heathrow.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Sector Reforms in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Friday the approval of 1 billion U.S. dollars in loans to Brazil
to support the government's recent Social Security, Fiscal and
Administrative Reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
These loans are part of the 1998 package of international
support aimed at assisting Brazil to address key social and
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's program of reforms is designed to address the
structural causes of the country's fiscal deficit, restrain the
growth of public debt, strengthen market confidence, and create
the right environment for growth and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The 1 billion dollars consist of the Second Social Security
Sector Adjustment Loan and the Administrative and Fiscal Reform
Special Sector Adjustment Loan. Each loan amounts to 500 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Second Social Security Sector Adjustment Loan supports the
second phase of the Brazilian government's pension reform program.
This is centered on the implementation of a second phase of Social
Security reforms to achieve financial and actuarial balance of the
pension system for private sector workers.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimated that with the new benefit formula, the
country's pension system for private sector workers will achieve
fiscal balance in about 2003, and the surplus rises to almost 1
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2010, in stead of a
deficit of 2 percent of GDP without the reform.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative and Fiscal Reform Special Sector Adjustment
Loan will support the government's program to improve Brazil's
fiscal performance in general, and the fiscal performance of
states in particular, with an emphasis on administrative reform to
reduce costs and increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The government's program consists of policy actions to improve
fiscal performance, mainly by reducing the burden of the wage bill
in the Federal, State and Municipal governments, as well as in the
Federal District.
</P>
<P>
"These two loans support reforms that are critical building
blocks in Brazil's drive to establish fiscal credibility," said
Gobind Nankani, World Bank country director for Brazil. "The
continuing process of streamlining the social security and public
employment systems are fundamental steps towards a faster-growing
and poverty-freer Brazil."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Confirms Sex Charge Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference with Ukraine's visiting Defense
Minister Olexander Kuzmuk, Cohen confirmed that Lt. Gen. Claudia
Kennedy, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, has
alleged that she was sexually harassed by a fellow general.
</P>
<P>
He said he had only become aware of the case Thursday following
news reports and could not comment in detail on the investigation
by the Army and the Defense Department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in a position to comment other than to say we maintain
a zero-tolerance policy that no harassment at any level is going
to be acceptable or tolerated and that the process should go
forward and will go forward," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 52, the first female three-star general in the history
of the Army, is due to retire this summer. She did not comment on
the reports and the name and rank of the male general have not
been revealed in what could become the most embarrassing in a
series of harassment cases involving the U.S. military in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The incident could be a setback for the Army's efforts to put
to rest sexual misconduct issues since a series of sensational
cases emerged in 1996 involving military trainers at the Army's
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland State.
</P>
<P>
Several generals and admirals have been punished, including
demotions and forced retirement, for harassing junior military
personnel or having extramarital affairs -- one of them with the
wives of several officers under his command.

The IBGE said that the north, southeast, and center-west
regions, which traditionally contribute 90 percent of the
Brazilian grains harvest, will have this year a 0.03 percent
growth and will amount to 74.84 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The production of the north and northeast zones will be 9.49
million tons, a 22.41 percent rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The IBGE said that the losses caused by the negative effects of
the climate in parts of the south, Sao Paulo, and Mato Grosso do
Sul, will be compensated by the good results of the soybean, rice,
corn, and beans harvest in the northeast region.
</P>
<P>
Some of the products that had the most noticeable growth were
cotton, with 14.15 percent, and beans (first harvest) with 18.9
percent.

<HEADLINE> French Skaters Win Figure Skating Ice Dancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, France, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Figure Skating
Championships skated into a climax here Friday evening with French
Marina Anissina/Gwendal Peizerat winning the ice dancing thrilling
finale.
</P>
<P>
It is the first gold of the category for France after brother
and sister ice dancers Isabelle/Paul Duchesnay won the event at
the 1991 world championships in Munich, West Germany.
</P>
<P>
With injury withdrawal of reigning champions Anjelika Krylova/
Oleg Ovsiannikov of Russia, the French pair have been the
strongest contenders for the title.
</P>
<P>
Skating first in the last group of six, the European champions
this year displayed the same Carmina Burana program as in Vienna,
which was packed with innovative choreography, lightening fast
twiddles and dance spins, a reverse lift (where Anissina lifted
Peizerat) performed with their characteristic dramatic intensity.
</P>
<P>
The full-house crowd gave them a standing ovation and the
winners received four of the highest possible marks of 6.0s for
presentation.
</P>
<P>
Italian dancers Barbara Fusar-Poli/Maurizio Margaglio, leaders
after compulsory and original dances, also had a brilliant
performance on the ice, but it was only enough to earn them the
silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Their portrayal of two warriors in their Duel routine won a
rapturous reception from the crowd. It was a powerful performance
showing speed across the ice, fast turns, deep edges and
innovative lifts. It awarded them four 5.9s for presentation.
</P>
<P>
Margarita Drobiazko/Povilas Vanagas, third place finishers in
Vienna ,had the bronze medal, the first one for Lithuania at the
world championships.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians romantic program, set to Spente Le Stelle by
Emma Shapplin, began with a flowing spin combination and contained
many unusual lifts and steps.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1968 that Russian skaters don't win
a medal of any hue in ice dancing at the world championships.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Case Defaces U.S. Image: Cuban Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alarcon said that the U.S. government lost prestige before the
world by tolerating the retention in Miami of the minor, whose
mother drowned in the sea, and is being reclaimed by his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon told the Cuban television that he considered something
unprecedented that the kidnapping and abuse against Elian is being
committed publicly and before the ABC television network cameras.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said he was surprised by the unending patience shown by
the U.S. authorities with the kidnappers, with whom they are
negotiating the acceptance of a decision of the courts of justice,
something he called unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent week after week watching the meetings of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS) and the so-called
kidnappers' lawyers, and the deadlines being extended once and
again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The INS extended until Tuesday an eventual annuling of the
temporary permit granted Elian to remain in the United States and
called a new meeting Monday with the boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
Cuba on Thursday named a 31-member delegation for a proposed
mission to take charge of motherless Elian in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Seeks Mercosur Consolidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian businessmen said
Friday that the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) consolidation is
one of the main challenges the country faces in the international
arena.
</P>
<P>
The National Industry Confederation (CNI) said in its report
titled "Foreign Trade Outlook" that the government has shown the
importance it gives to this year's trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Not only the adoption of common positions by the Mercosur
countries in the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) is growing more difficult every day, but also the
consolidation of Mercosur as a reference and a model for the
integration of the several participating countries," said the CNI.
</P>
<P>
The slow evolution of negotiations in the Mercosur, the
difficulties to implement the so-called consolidation and
profoundization of the regional bloc agenda are Brazil's main
challenges this year in the international scenario, added the CNI
report.
</P>
<P>
The main Brazilian reaction, as stated by the CNI, is the
explicit statement of its decision to seek the profoundization of
Mercosur integration.
</P>
<P>
A Brazilian Foreign Ministry's high-ranking spokesman told the
local press that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government
highest priority is the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The FTAA will become a priority when the discussion of the
relation of the products that will have priority in the markets
starts, which will not occur before the year 2003, it added.
</P>
<P>
The CNI said that the project to "unblock" the subregional
agenda depends essentially on Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this perspective in which the recent Brazil-Argentina
motor vehicle agreement must be analyzed, and it is this same
perspective which seems to explain the Brazilian decision to
encourage productive investments in Paraguay, as well as the 300-
million-dollar loan granted to that country for public works,"
said the CNI document.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stops Objections to Loans for Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley told a regular briefing
that Albright made the decision after an "extensive and
deliberative process to ascertain the facts and assess how
circumstances were changing."
</P>
<P>
"Her (Albright's) action today allows the Export-Import Bank to
move forward on these loan guarantees," he added.
</P>
<P>
The State Department blocked the loan guarantees to Russia's
Tyumen Oil Co. (TNK) on December 21 last year. Foley said "the
secretary's decision to delay the transactions was based on our
concerns about respect for shareholder and creditor rights in
bankruptcy proceedings in which TNK was involved."
</P>
<P>
Since December, Foley noted, the privatization of TNK was
successfully completed and the company has entered into serious
negotiations with shareholders and creditors of the bank companies
to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
"The loan guarantees would allow TNK to purchase 498 million
dollars in U.S. oil refinery and exploration equipment," Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it was coincidental that Albright's decision
came just days after Vladimir Putin was elected Russia's new
president. He denied it was a goodwill gesture toward the new
Russian leader.

<P>
ATHENS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Foreign Office special
envoy for Cyprus, Sir David Hannay, Friday met with Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou to discuss the Cyprus problem and
European-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Describing their talks as "very useful," Hannay, who arrived
here Thursday from Turkey, said that both sides shared common
ground on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
As for the planned New York proximity talks between Cyprus'
two communities, he said that they were continuing preparations so
that when they reached New York on May 23 the hope that something
good would develop would be a realistic hope.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Papandreou said that apart from the resumption of
talks, there was the new framework which had been shaped through
decisions taken at the December Helsinki EU summit both for Turkey
's candidacy and in relation to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The two communities on the island have held two rounds of U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks, and the third such talks will take
place in May in New York.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Rebound After Four Days Of Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 31 (Xinhua)-- Investors returned to technology
stocks Friday, driving the Nasdaq composite higher after the four
consecutive sessions of falling.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index rose 114.94 at 4,572.83, trimming its losses of 505.14
points in the previous four sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 58.33 at 10,921.92 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 10.66 at 1,498.58.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq rallied as investors rushed to the market for
bargain-hunting of some tech stocks beaten down in the past four
days. Dell Computer, Intel and Cisco Systems rose significantly.
</P>
<P>
A big selloff was sparked Tuesday when Abby Joseph Cohen, a
Wall Street bullish analyst, said technology stocks were fully
valued and had little room for further growth.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq finished this week with a loss of 390 points and is
9.4 percent below the record closing high of 5,048.62 set March 10.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of the Nasdaq index drew some money out of the
blue chip stocks, dragging the Dow index lower. General Electric,
the Dow's component, fell.

The NYSE index rose 2.03 at 647.70 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 9.04 at 1,005.03. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 7.53 at 539.09.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing president of
the U.N. Security Council, Anwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh, said
Friday that the U.N. missions to Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, and
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), are currently under
discussion in the 15-nation body.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh ambassador told a press conference here that
dates of the two proposed mission to leave for their assignments
are yet to be decided, and the composition remains unknown as well.
</P>
<P>
The two missions will be formed among the Security Council
members, he said. "Generally, the Council decides not to be very
selective. They leave it open and volunteers come in and compose a
team."
</P>
<P>
He said that some countries have volunteered to go, but he did
not identify the volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided Tuesday to send a council mission
to Kosovo and the DRC respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to send a council mission to
Kosovo toward the end of April to see how the U.N. Interim
Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) is functioning on the ground and
to press for an end to ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
In another decision, the Security Council decided in principle
to send a mission to the DRC to look into the peace process in the
central African country and the deployment of the 500 military
observers and 5,000 peace-keepers under the February 24 resolution
of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council occasionally sends delegations comprising
several of its members to conduct on-the-spot assessments of
situation of concern to members.
</P>
<P>
One such delegation last September visited Indonesia and East
Timor, where a U.N. administration is helping guide the formerly
Indonesian-ruled territory to independence.
</P>
<P>
Other Council missions travelled to Rwanda and Burundi in 1995
and to Bosnia in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Strives for Openness, Council President Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The president of the U.N.
Security Council for March, Anwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh, said
here Friday that the 15-nation Council has been working hard for
more openness and a larger participation in discussing issues of
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury told a press conference here that the Security
Council, under his presidency, had as many as 10 public meetings,
or open debates, over the outgoing March.
</P>
<P>
"This is a remarkable thing to be done in a month," he said. "
We try to ensure that these meetings provide an opportunity to a
larger membership to come up with views, ideas and suggestions."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held open meetings on the issues, such as
peace-keeping, Iraq, Kosovo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo
problems in March.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the normal practice to brief non-members of the
Security Council, the Bangladesh ambassador has a website set up
for the larger U.N. membership and ensure access to all drafts
under Council consultation by all U.N. Member States.
</P>
<P>
After taking the Council presidency, Bangladesh set two
objectives: one is to make the Security Council more open and more
transparent, and more widely participated by a large U.N.
membership, the other is to make the Security Council more pro-
active.
</P>
<P>
More openness and more transparency in the work of the
Security Council is an issue top on the agenda of the U.N. reform
plan.
</P>
<P>
"This transparency has been appreciated by all, they have
welcomed it, they encouraged us to do more," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Fowler, Canadian permanent representative to the United
Nations, is scheduled to succeed Chowdhury of Bangladesh as
president of the U.N. Security Council as of April 1.
</P>
<P>
The Council presidency changes monthly according to the
principle of alphabetical rotation among the 15 members, including
five permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was elected by the General Assembly to join the
Security Council this year as a one of 10 non-permanent members
for the two-year terms.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the
world at large.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
slammed the European Union (EU), Japan, Mexico and other major
trading partners for alleged trade abuses.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade
Barriers, released by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,
singled out Canada for restricting trade in agricultural products,
EU members for subsidizing the Airbus consortium and Japan for
refusing to open its telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
The 434-page report also criticized South Korea for limiting
access to its automobile market, accused Mexico of failing to rein
in dominant telephone company Telmex, and warned Brazil that its
import policies may violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
</P>
<P>
"Vigorous monitoring and enforcement of trade agreements is a
top priority of this administration," U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement. Another senior U.S. trade
official said Washington could launch WTO complaints later this
year if governments refused to reform.
</P>
<P>
The annual report assesses U.S. commercial relations with 54
major trading partners and highlights policies the United States
said unfairly restricted trade in goods and services.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to a critical assessment in 1999, China was praised
for progress on reforms. The report said the Clinton
administration's trade pact with China would provide U.S.
companies unprecedented access to the vast Chinese market.
