MILLION (PHOENIX) _ Gylene Hoyle's eyes were closed when she made
her $1 million. Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Jay Bell had
nearly fouled out on pop-ups on two previous pitches. And Hoyle,
who saw her chance slipping away, couldn't bear to watch. But on
the next pitch came Bell's game-winning grand slam in the bottom of
the sixth inning against Oakland pitcher Jimmy Haynes. Hoyle, a
31-year old Chandler, Ariz., resident, had won $1 million in a
grand-slam promotion sponsored by Shamrock Farms. By AL TOBY. Story

ARIZONA DIAMONDBACK JAY BELL'S HOMER BRINGS $1 MILLION TO LUCKY

   PHOENIX _ Gylene Hoyle's eyes were closed when she made her $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Jay Bell had nearly fouled
out on pop-ups on two previous pitches. And Hoyle, who saw her
chance slipping away, couldn't bear to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But on the next pitch came Bell's game-winning grand slam in the
bottom of the sixth inning against Oakland pitcher Jimmy Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle, a 31-year old Chandler, Ariz., resident, had won $1
million in a grand-slam promotion sponsored by Shamrock Farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that ball went sailing I was just in a state of shock,''
Hoyle said of the home run into the left-field seats. ``I didn't
even actually see the ball go over the fence because I had my eyes
closed at that point. I only knew that he actually hit the run when
everybody around me started yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle's post-home-run reaction of jumping up and down and
hugging her husband was shown on the stadium's big screen, which
added to the crowd's jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Hoyle had picked the correct inning and
grand-slam hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who knew he was the designated hitter,
</P>
<P>
   said he had every intention of hitting a homer for Hoyle and
halting his hitless streak in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended the series 1-for-14,'' Bell said. ``That one hit was
pretty special. I'm very, very pleased and happy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   What was bigger for Bell, winning a woman $1 million or winning
the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even a good question,'' Bell answered. ``Winning
her $1 million was certainly (more) gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle automatically got the opportunity to participate in the
grand-slam contest when she won tickets to Sunday's game from the
``Tim and Willie Show'' on KNIX-FM (102.5).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to get in the gate because we've never been
here before,'' Hoyle said.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario couldn't have been more gut-wrenching for Hoyle.
After the count was 3-1, Bell fouled off two pitches. The foul ball
before the home run just cleared the backstop's net.
</P>
<P>
   Until today, Hoyle said she wasn't a big fan of baseball.
Hoyle's family coached her on which player to pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of my family are big Diamondbacks fans and they all
said Jay Bell was the best hitter,'' she said. ``He had the most
home runs at that point, so we picked Jay Bell because we figured
he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams said he could tell that Bell was
swinging for the fences after he swatted at three pitches that
would've been ball four.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle, a child care provider, is married and has an 8-year old
daughter, Colleen, and a 7-year-old son, Clayton Jr. Her husband,
Clayton, works as a drill rig operator.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things that Clayton Hoyle said came to mind
after his wife won was the status of a 1986 truck he was thinking
of putting on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real interested in selling it now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock Farms' director of marketing, Ann Puelz-Ocana, said she
didn't expect someone to win after less than two seasons of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't have any idea of how big the odds were in
winning,'' Puelz-Ocana said. ``We thought that it would take
longer. Either way, we're very excited for the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Puelz-Ocana said Shamrock Farms had taken out an insurance
policy that would pay off the winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Other than taking a long-deserved vacation, Hoyle said she
doesn't know what she's going to do with the money. ``My stomach is
dry,'' she said. ``I'm all nervous and shaky. I haven't quite
comprehended all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle's daughter picked her own vacation spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably be going to Disneyland,'' she said. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Over the past two weeks, the Astros' bullpen has
resembled a collection of drowning men trying to stay afloat on
rough and choppy waters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quite frankly, life rafts have been in short supply lately.
</P>
<P>
   But a rare rescue mission was launched Sunday when the Astros
scored five eighth-inning runs, providing a safe late-inning
cushion in a 7-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman
Stadium and securing a sweep of the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima pitched 7 strong innings for his 13th win, and
reliever Jay Powell finished off the Royals with 1 perfect innings
to notch his second save in the Astros' final game before the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owed the bullpen this one,'' said Astros center fielder
Carl Everett, who had a two-run pinch double in the eighth.
``They've been pitching a lot lately, and these last few games have
been tough on them. I know they're tired. It was nice to remind
ourselves that we're capable of scoring some runs and giving those
guys some breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima (13-4) absolutely suffocated the Royals for most of the
day, holding the American League's fifth-ranked offense to five
hits through the first seven innings. The only Royals batter who
reached scoring position before the seventh _ first baseman Jeremy
Giambi _ advanced to second on an error after an infield single in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose pitched a great game,'' Astros interim manager Matt
Galante said. ``He's been getting it done all season, so now we get
to hear his music, which is good, because that means we won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros improved to 14-5 in games started by Lima, who along
with pitchers Mike Hampton and Billy Wagner and first baseman Jeff
Bagwell will represent the team in All-Star festivities in Boston
over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about my first half,'' said Lima, who is
29-12 with a 3.53 ERA since the beginning of last season. ``I
thought maybe I'd win 10 games by the All-Star break but not 13.
That shows that Jose Lima is for real. My goal was to win 20 games
this year, and I've already got 13. Be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it seems the Astros have to be careful simply making
their way from the team bus to the clubhouse without suffering an
injury. Seven players missed time because of injuries on the
10-game road trip, including three who were placed on the disabled
list. Two others _ third baseman Bill Spiers and outfielder Matt
Mieske _ played Sunday despite sore hamstrings.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat amazingly, the Astros managed to win six of the 10
games on the trip, including the sweep of the Royals. The Astros
have swept four three-game series in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going 6-4 on this trip with a MASH unit is pretty good,''
Galante said. ``We knew these games were going to be a struggle
because of the injuries, but we battled through everything pretty
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory left the Astros in a virtual tie for first
place in the National League Central. Cincinnati will be percentage
points ahead of them when they open the second half Thursday night
at the Astrodome against the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Royals starter Jeff Suppan (4-5) appeared to be on top of his
game in the early innings, retiring the first nine batters he
faced. But Craig Biggio led off the fourth inning with his
major-league-leading 38th double and scored on Bagwell's single up
the middle. Spiers also had an RBI single in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals didn't generate any scoring until the seventh inning,
when Jermaine Dye's seeing-eye double dropped between Bagwell and
right fielder Derek Bell, pushing Kansas City's first run across
the plate to make it a 2-1 game.
</P>
<P>
   After playing three consecutive one-run games, the last thing
the Astros needed was another squeaker. They took care of that with
a five-run eighth-inning outburst, highlighted by Everett's double
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who was out of the starting lineup for the third
consecutive game because of a strained left hamstring, upped his
RBI total to 65 _ second on the team behind Bagwell's 78. Everett
drove in 76 runs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinch hitting is the toughest job in baseball, but I've been
playing regularly, so I'm already in the flow,'' said Everett, who
was 2-for-2 with four RBIs off the bench in the three-game series.
``I've said it before: I take pride in being up with runners in
scoring position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sent nine batters to the plate in the top of the
eighth, and the long half-inning took a toll on Lima, whom Galante
described as ``stale'' when he returned to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   An RBI double by rookie outfielder Carlos Beltran and a
run-scoring single by Johnny Damon pulled the Royals within four
runs, and after Lima allowed another base hit, Galante called on
Powell with runners on first and third and two out.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who had allowed a pair of runs in each of his previous
two outings, struck out Dye to end the eighth and retired the side
in order in the ninth to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be as aggressive as I could,'' said Powell,
who has appeared in seven of the Astros' last 11 games. ``I knew I
didn't have anything (Friday night, when he allowed two runs in
one-third of an inning), but this time I was going to make them hit
the ball. I felt a lot better today.''
</P>
<P>
   And the battered Astros no doubt will feel a lot better after
the three-day All-Star break.

EDITORIAL: WHAT JAMES FARMER LEAVES BEHIND

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   James Farmer, the former head of the Congress of Racial
Equality, who died on Friday at 79, was the last of the major civil
rights leaders of his generation, and one of the first to begin the
struggle. Moved by what he had learned in college of Gandhi's use
of nonviolent disobedience, Farmer founded CORE as a local group in
Chicago in the early 1940s, and it was there that he first used
Gandhian tactics to integrate the White City Roller Skating Rink.
</P>
<P>
   It worked in Chicago, and chapters sprang up east and west, in
New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Seattle. But it was
unthinkable to try to take the effort into the deep South in the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the late 1950s and early '60s that black and
white civil rights activists began to defy the laws and customs of
segregation in places like Alabama and Mississippi. To endure the
consequent broken skulls and jaws and legs, to suffer shootings,
burnings, bombings and lynchings, all without violent resistance,
so that the nation could learn from the example of what was done,
required a depth of courage and dignity and faith that has never
been surpassed in the history of this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was one of the principal leaders of that time. He
directed the daring Freedom Rides that began integrating interstate
bus service in the South in 1961. ``My father was a Freedom Rider,
I'm a Freedom Rider's son,'' he would sing out in jail. ``He was
one of the founding fathers not just of the New South, but of the
New America,'' said Rep. John Lewis, who was beaten unconscious and
jailed with Farmer on one of the bus rides.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and CORE also formed an important bridge between the more
traditional, legalistic organizations, like A. Philip Randolph's
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Roy Wilkins' National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Whitney
Young's Urban League, and the newer groups that grew in street
power as the 1960s progressed. Among these were the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee led by Lewis,
Julian Bond, James Foreman and others.
</P>
<P>
   Together, James Farmer and the others led the effort to overcome
a system of legal oppression that had endured, in one form or
another, from the beginning of the nation. That is achievement
enough for their generation. The effort to win greater fairness,
and economic opportunity, remains for ours.

MCCHORD AIRCREW ANSWERS CALL FOR EMERGENCY MISSION TO ANTARCTICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted but jubilant C-141B Starlifter aircrew from McChord
Air Force Base near Tacoma reported success early Sunday after an
emergency mission to airdrop medical supplies at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went fantastically,'' said mission commander Lt. Col. John
Pray in a telephone interview from Christchurch, New Zealand,
shortly after his crew completed the 15-hour round trip to
Antarctica. Six containers of medical supplies were dropped during
a seven-minute pass over Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
beginning at 10:35 p.m. PST Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The airdrop was ordered last week after the National Science
Foundation urgently requested medical screening equipment and
medicine to treat a 47-year-old American woman after a lump was
found in her breast.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name was not disclosed, works as support staff
at the station. She had recently undergone a biopsy and a battery
of tests with the base physician and the results were shipped via
the Internet to doctors in the United States. The treatment they
directed was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its isolated location 800 miles inland from the main
U.S. research station at McMurdo Sound, and because of the extreme
weather conditions during the dark Antarctic winter, it was
impossible to land a plane at the polar camp, officials said. There
are 41 people wintering at the station until the Antarctic spring
arrives in late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other way of getting in there, so an airdrop (of
supplies) is the only option,'' Pray said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo, wrapped in shock-absorbing foam and other materials,
included diagnostic equipment, medicines, fresh food and mail. The
six heavy cardboard crates were rigged with parachutes and marked
with strobes and chemical lights to mark their location, said Tech.
Sgt. Robert Brown, McChord cargo loadmaster on the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the research camp radioed the McChord aircraft
that one of the bundles had broken open on impact and two others
sustained minor damage, but the contents were intact, Pray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the word that everything survived, made it A-OK,''
Brown said. ``That makes us real happy _ especially the
loadmasters, since we packed the cargo ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The C-141B normally flies with a crew of six _ a pilot,
co-pilot, flight engineer and two cargo loadmasters. But the
extended mission over the Antarctic ice cap required three
additional pilots, two navigators, two flight engineers, six cargo
loadmasters, a parachute rigger and a flight surgeon, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The McChord transport plane was escorted to the South Pole by an
Air Force KC-10 Extender refueling tanker, which transferred 78,000
pounds of fuel to the C-141B in a single mid-air maneuver, said
Capt. Martin Oliver, a backup navigator from McChord who worked
with the Christchurch team.
</P>
<P>
   Pray said when the C-141B approached within 25 miles of the
pole, the lights illuminated parachute drop zone were easily
spotted, despite clouds that partially obscured the view.
</P>
<P>
   The air temperature outside the aircraft stood at 80 degrees
below zero, requiring the plane's crew to don arctic weather gear
as the aircraft neared the cargo drop zone, Pray said.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem on the flight occurred as the cargo loadmasters
readied the first two bundles for dropping, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, one of the loadmasters, said when Pray ordered the doors
in the rear of the aircraft opened about nine minutes from the drop
zone, the wind nearly sucked out one bundle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost got away from us,'' Brown said. ``It went about a
quarter of the way out the door.'' Brown and two other loadmasters
_ Staff Sgt. Geraldo Moore and Tech. Sgt. Mike Miller _ were able
to wrestle the bundle back inside. They then successfully threw out
the first two loads as the aircraft flew 700 feet above the ground,
and 10,000 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft then made a second pass over the zone seven minutes
later and dropped four more bundles.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much easier on the ground, where staff at the research
base had just seven minutes to collect the six bundles before the
minus-67 degree cold damaged or destroyed the drugs and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Pray said he and his crew were thrilled to receive the radio
transmission from the polar station that the parachute drop was
successful.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The All-Star break in the WNBA is dawning with the Comets,
champions in each of the league's first two years, again holding
the upper hand on the competition.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the Sacramento Monarchs on Sunday night proved again they
are inching closer with every game. Down by 23 points in the first
half after the Comets' Cynthia Cooper scored 17 of her 31 points in
the first 17 minutes, the Monarchs (10-5) used the 3-point shooting
of Ruthie Bolton-Holifield to get back within two, ultimately
losing 68-63 before a crowd of 12,255 at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Comets enter the All-Star break 13-2, easily
the best in the WNBA. They're three games ahead of the Monarchs in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we blew some leads,'' Comets coach Van Chancellor said.
``But we did hold on to win. And that's the mark of a good team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacramento's got a really good team. They've done a good job
with their team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night in Sacramento, the Monarchs clamped down on
Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes and logged a 74-63 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night there was no containing Cooper, who said
afterward she had as much to prove as far as pride as did the
Comets, who were in search of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself in the awkward position (that) I still have to
prove myself, and it's great because it's motivating,'' she said.
``I think as a team we came out tonight and established ourselves
early, especially on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out there and held them to very few points and made
them work for every single play, every single basket they got. I
think we had a little letdown, but that's sometimes normal. We beat
a good team tonight and got it done, especially on defense and on
the rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding, literally and figuratively, was something the Comets
had to do constantly Sunday in spite of a 17-0 run over a stretch
of 5:10 in the opening half that carried them to a 38-15 lead.
Sacramento, meanwhile, was having little success on either end of
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson had Yolanda Griffith, the Monarchs' leading
scorer, under control. Near the end of the half, Griffith had more
fouls (two) than points (one) and finished with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs were shooting only 25 percent (6-for-24). But
Bolton-Holifield hadn't begun to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like they caught us off-guard,'' Griffith said.
``They were aggressive, and we weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the second half, we calmed down and started playing
Sacramento basketball and got back into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolton-Holifield took charge in the second half like the
Bolton-Holifield who had been so prolific before suffering a severe
knee injury that knocked her out of most of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the big lead, they (the Comets) were really
patient in running our offense and moving the ball,'' Chancellor
said. ``We lost our patience after we got up 23, didn't move the
basketball. And they fell victim to Bolton-Holifield.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruthie hit some big shots,'' Griffith said. ``But the first
half, we couldn't buy a basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a team effort. One person's not going to do it.
It has to be a team effort to beat the Houston Comets. We didn't
get a whole team effort tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 40-25 at intermission, the Comets had begun to feel the
wrath of Griffith and Bolton-Holifield from the end of the first
half into the middle of the second. A 10-2 Monarchs run shaved the
margin at the break.
</P>
<P>
   The run grew to 19-4 over the first two minutes of the second
half as Bolton-Holifield drained her fourth 3-pointer during the
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets still held a comfortable 55-37 lead at the 15:02 mark
before the Monarchs outscored the WNBA defending champions 14-2. A
Cooper basket just as the 30-second clock sounded gave the Comets a
bit of breathing room at 59-51.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, Bolton-Holifield, who led the Monarchs with 20
points, stole a Cooper pass and hit reserve Tangela Smith streaking
upcourt. Smith completed the break with a layup that cut the
Comets' lead to 61-59.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper by that time had moved over to shut off the offense of
Bolton-Holifield. And after Griffith made one of two free throws,
putting Sacramento within 67-63, Polina Tzekova blocked a shot by
Monarchs guard Kedra Holland-Corn.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento then missed its final three field-goal attempts, and
the Comets had secured a rather shaky victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another one,'' said Thompson (14 points, nine rebounds).
``At this point in time, I don't know how much they mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to win as many as we can and get to the
postseason. A lot of these games really don't have faces. It's the
fact that we need to win them. That's what we try to go out and
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sunday, the Comets had to fend off a Monarchs team that
changed from pussycat to tiger to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this game as a game of runs, and they had a big one,''
Thompson said. ``Sacramento is a good team. I don't think anyone
thought they weren't going to try and get back into this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the effort they had. But we stood strong. We held
them off to win in the end.''

ARIZONA DIAMONDBACK JAY BELL'S HOMER
 BRINGS $1 MILLION TO LUCKY WOMAN

Hoyle's eyes were closed when she made her $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Jay Bell had nearly fouled
out on pop-ups on two previous pitches. And Hoyle, who saw her
chance slipping away, couldn't bear to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But on the next pitch came Bell's game-winning grand slam in the
bottom of the sixth inning against Oakland pitcher Jimmy Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle, a 31-year old Chandler, Ariz., resident, had won $1
million in a grand-slam promotion sponsored by Shamrock Farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that ball went sailing I was just in a state of shock,''
Hoyle said of the home run into the left-field seats. ``I didn't
even actually see the ball go over the fence because I had my eyes
closed at that point. I only knew that he actually hit the run when
everybody around me started yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle's post-home-run reaction of jumping up and down and
hugging her husband was shown on the stadium's big screen, which
added to the crowd's jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Hoyle had picked the correct inning and
grand-slam hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who knew he was the designated hitter,
</P>
<P>
   said he had every intention of hitting a homer for Hoyle and
halting his hitless streak in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended the series 1-for-14,'' Bell said. ``That one hit was
pretty special. I'm very, very pleased and happy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   What was bigger for Bell, winning a woman $1 million or winning
the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not even a good question,'' Bell answered. ``Winning
her $1 million was certainly (more) gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle automatically got the opportunity to participate in the
grand-slam contest when she won tickets to Sunday's game from the
``Tim and Willie Show'' on KNIX-FM (102.5).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to get in the gate because we've never been
here before,'' Hoyle said.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario couldn't have been more gut-wrenching for Hoyle.
After the count was 3-1, Bell fouled off two pitches. The foul ball
before the home run just cleared the backstop's net.
</P>
<P>
   Until today, Hoyle said she wasn't a big fan of baseball.
Hoyle's family coached her on which player to pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of my family are big Diamondbacks fans and they all
said Jay Bell was the best hitter,'' she said. ``He had the most
home runs at that point, so we picked Jay Bell because we figured
he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams said he could tell that Bell was
swinging for the fences after he swatted at three pitches that
would've been ball four.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle, a child care provider, is married and has an 8-year old
daughter, Colleen, and a 7-year-old son, Clayton Jr. Her husband,
Clayton, works as a drill rig operator.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things that Clayton Hoyle said came to mind
after his wife won was the status of a 1986 truck he was thinking
of putting on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real interested in selling it now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock Farms' director of marketing, Ann Puelz-Ocana, said she
didn't expect someone to win after less than two seasons of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't have any idea of how big the odds were in
winning,'' Puelz-Ocana said. ``We thought that it would take
longer. Either way, we're very excited for the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Puelz-Ocana said Shamrock Farms had taken out an insurance
policy that would pay off the winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Other than taking a long-deserved vacation, Hoyle said she
doesn't know what she's going to do with the money. ``My stomach is
dry,'' she said. ``I'm all nervous and shaky. I haven't quite
comprehended all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyle's daughter picked her own vacation spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably be going to Disneyland,'' she said. &QL;

BRAWL OVERSHADOWS MARINER LOSS AS GIPSON, HUNTER HURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Frankie Rodriguez pitch was high and inside, a
meaningless offering in a lopsided game. It touched nothing but
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   But on a hot day at Dodger Stadium, the wayward baseball gave
grown men every reason to turn into hot-tempered sandlot kids, the
Mariners and Dodgers letting go of all pent-up frustrations and
joining in a riotous, 15-minute altercation.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas Sunday interrupted an inevitable 14-3 Los Angeles
rout and series sweep, with four Mariners and three Dodgers _ the
group including a player on the disabled list and a coach _ getting
ejected after the last punch was thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the kind of game where we've got two teams
frustrated, with the way they were playing and the way we've been
playing all year, and it just got out of hand,'' said Dodgers
third-base coach Rick Demsey, one of those waved off the field by
the umpires. ``Way out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions could be disastrous for the Mariners, both in
suspensions and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tossed from the Seattle side were closer Jose Mesa, setup man
Jose Paniagua, reliever Damaso Marte and outfielder Jay Buhner.
That's half the bullpen and a key player close to coming off the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Those were prisoners of war. There were casualties, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners utilityman Charles Gipson was taken to a local hospital
with a separated right shoulder after having several players roll
on him as he tried to be peace-maker. He was in such pain, team
officials had to dress him in the clubhouse. His season likely is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Brian Hunter hyperextended his left knee in the
same pileup and could barely walk. He was unsure when he might play
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you don't want to glorify,'' Mariners
outfielder Butch Huskey said, watching his injured teammates move
through the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella declined to speak with reporters after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, getting Ken Griffey Jr.'s 29th homer and little
else, lost their fifth straight game and fell to 42-45 at the
break.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, catcher Todd Hundley and reliever Pedro Borbon
were ejected with Dempsey. Catcher Angel Pena received a forearm
injury, while infielder Dave Hansen hurt a finger.
</P>
<P>
   To hear some of them tell it, the melee was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings us closer together,'' Hundley said. ``We're not
going to put up with that kind of cheap, pathetic play. ... If
you're going to start that stuff, unfortunate consequences are
going to be paid. You're going to end up sacrificing stuff on your
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson had this to say: ``You don't ever
like to see this happen, but it's part of the game. It's part of
sport. Anyone who thought this team didn't have spirit and heart,
we dispelled that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger spilled in the bottom of the sixth inning, with the
Dodgers leading 12-3, three runs in, two runners on and one out.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez sailed a pitch close to Mark Grudzielanek's chin. Both
players started arguing and gesturing. The benches cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start anything,'' the Mariners reliever said. ``It
was straight over the middle of the plate. I was trying to get it
outside. Other people had other issues and went at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Grudzielanek never got close to each other. But as
clusters of players started shoving each other near second base, a
punch was thrown, believed to be by the Mariners' Paniagua. That
set everyone off.
</P>
<P>
   Marte, a Mariners rookie, was spotted landing a punch on Hundley
alongside the third-base line, then receiving one near the
first-base line from Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marte sucker-punched a couple people,'' Hundley said. ``He'd
throw his punch and take off running and then hit someone else. I
saw him hit (Gary) Sheffield.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, being coy and not specifically naming Dempsey as the
perpetrator, said he went to the person who hit Marte and showed
his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him after the game and I congratulated him,'' he
said ``I thought it was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-speaking Marte, using teammate Rafael Bournigal as
an interpreter, felt justified in taking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit me first, from behind,'' Marte said. ``They hit me in
the head, the back. I said I wasn't going to take it anymore. One
of their coaches hit me from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's involvement was unclear; he declined to discuss such
matters. But Buhner was spotted putting Borbon in a headlock near
the Mariners dugout. Borbon, Buhner said, caused Gipson's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Steve Austin coming out of nowhere,'' Buhner cracked,
mentioning the popular pro wrestler before turning serious. ``I was
just trying to get Borbon off Chuckie. I knew his shoulder was
(bleeped) up because he was screaming. It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   After what appeared to be three rounds of blows, the teams were
separated and then ran out on the field once more with Mariners
first baseman David Segui yelling and gesturing. Earlier, Segui and
the Dodgers' Raul Mondesi had wrestled each other to the ground. No
more punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth, the Newport High grad,
thought there was good reason for the melee. Then he found out
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Grudzielanek got hit,'' he said. ``I didn't know
that he didn't until he got back in the box and hit again.''

MARINERS PLANNING TO SHOP FOR MUCH-NEEDED BULLPEN HELP

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once the Mariners have taken their All-Star break
and opened Safeco Field, they finally can get comfortable and
settle into a routine, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. The end of the first series at Safeco will signal
the start of the two-week frenzy leading up to the July 31 trade
deadline. And as has been the case in recent seasons, the club
should be an active participant, according to manager Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   With a disclaimer, of course. There likely won't be any
blockbuster deals now that Randy Johnson has his wish _ no runs,
lots of money. There won't be any quick fixes either, no Andy Benes
stopovers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners intend to do some shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If players are available that could help us for the remainder
of the year and longer, we would look in that direction,'' Piniella
said. ``The rent-a-player, I don't see any need for that. But if
you can find a pitcher or position player that you can project will
help you for a couple years, we would be interested. You need to
keep improving. We're not exactly a powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, what then?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could use help in the bullpen, experienced help,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the halfway point, the M's find themselves with five more
victories and fewer headaches than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is better and the hitting nearly as potent. The
pitching rotation overall has promise, if not this season, than
certainly next. There is a closer with 18 saves, two shy of the
most ever by a Mariner at the break, and Paul Abbott has promise as
a setup man.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, the rest of that bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us could say we could pitch better, but some more so
than others,'' starter Jamie Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   At the break, the M's find themselves with the second-worst
earned run average in the majors, 5.91, exceeded only by Colorado's
6.21.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella says arm injuries incurred in May by veterans Mark
Leiter and Butch Henry threw an already fragile pitching staff into
great disarray, creating the continual shuffle that has forced him
to use 23 pitchers, the most by any team in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams have walked more hitters than the Mariners (374):
Tampa Bay (382) and Colorado (394). Any progress has been greatly
overshadowed by the free pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the pitching has settled a little bit and gotten
better,'' pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``We've switched
people around to see what they could do. But I'm still disappointed
that walks have beaten us. (Saturday) night, we get two outs, then
give up a walk, walk and a single. In the second half, we have got
to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The most pleasant Mariners surprise so far has been rookie
starter John Halama, 7-2 with a 2.89 earned run average. The lefty
is 5-0 as a starter, has the club's only complete game and shutout,
and has surrendered just four runs over 31 innings in his past four
outings.
</P>
<P>
   For everyday players, second baseman David Bell has surpassed
expectations as no other, hitting .270 with 15 home runs and 53
RBIs as a replacement for the injured Carlos Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   The player who has fallen off the most is pitcher Jeff Fassero,
headed for his worst season among nine in the big leagues unless he
undergoes a rapid turnaround. Counting Sunday's defeat, he is 4-9
with a 6.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Among everyday Mariners, third baseman Russ Davis has had his
average plummet more than 30 points (.227), but he has maintained
power (17 homers) and dramatically improved his defense (eight
errors so far to 32 last season). Everyone else has kept pace or
exceeded their offensive projections.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have hurt the Mariners, robbing them of the two veteran
pitchers, shortstop Alex Rodriguez for a month, right fielder Jay
Buhner for two months and designated hitter Edgar Martinez for a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With most of these bodies back in place and a new ballpark to
play in, the Mariners are hoping they're not looking at a lost
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fix a few things here and there, we're in a perfect
attack position,'' outfielder Butch Huskey said. ``It's better to
peak after the break than before the break, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   BOXED IN: Piniella, after yanking Halama out of Saturday's game
and turning to his bullpen in the eighth inning, found his move
even questioned by Dodgers fans. One in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Adame Jr., a 27-year-old Whittier man and former junior
college football player, bounded from his box seat 15 rows up and,
hanging over the dugout, engaged in conversation with Piniella for
several moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Lou, leave him in there. He's a professional. He
knows what he's doing,''' said the 6-foot-1, 265 pound Adame.
</P>
<P>
   GOING, GOING, GONE: Fassero is just the fifth big league pitcher
to serve up 28 homers or more by the All-Star break. His
much-bruised companions are Minnesota's Bert Blyleven, 30 in 1986
and 1987; Atlanta's Phil Niekro, 29 in 1970; and the Chicago Cubs'
Ferguson Jenkins, 29 in 1973. Blyleven finished with 50 and 46,
Niekro 40 and Jenkins cut his losses to 35.

WOMEN'S SOCCER DESERVES A FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Walking out of the Rose Bowl Saturday after
the U.S. women won their World Cup, I heard a father turn to his
twentysomething son and tell him thanks for buying the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' the father said.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the man could be right, but it sure seemed just as
likely that what happened during this captivating 1999 Women's
World Cup is a sign of times to come.
</P>
<P>
   Then, later that evening, I spoke with my mother, who is not a
big sports fan. She did, however, watch the game on television _
one of 40 million Americans to do so _ and she said tears came to
her eyes the moment U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry stopped the
penalty kick and the Rose Bowl erupted with ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself: `She's going to be the hero. She's going
to be the one who wins this game,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe everybody had that same reaction during another
heart-stopping moment, when midfielder Kristine Lilly was in the
absolute right place to head that ball out of the U.S. net to save
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it made you shiver to see Michelle Akers challenge
goalkeeper Goa Hong or fly legs-first into the boards, sacrificing
her body one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it came when Brandi Chastain booted that final penalty
kick into the back of the net and ripped off her jersey in what she
claims was a flash of temporary insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what point made me tear up?'' a friend asked me
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the jets were flying over the stadium before the game and
the girls were jumping up and down. They were just so excited.
They're so real and so giving, like when they thanked the crowd
after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson in there. The images and gestures and mood of
this World Cup were all gutsy and athletic, yet at the same time
they were revolutionary because it was all so feminine, or at least
female, especially in the willingness of the team to share the
moment with each other and anyone who watched them play.
</P>
<P>
   The impression that the '99 Women's World Cup players gave more
than they took is indelible, even when expectations about the
future of their game go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, time and corporate sponsors will tell us whether there
is any chance for a professional women's soccer league. What comes
next will have to be invented _ and we can only hope in some
positive manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so good for our players, but it is a major
challenge,'' World Cup president Marla Messing said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had time to think about the league, but I look at
baseball, basketball, hockey and I don't think we can put together
a league that looks anything like that. We need a new model,
although I don't know what that model would look like,'' Messing
said.
</P>
<P>
   If a women's league presents challenges about how it should be
organized, the women have earned the right to have U.S. Soccer and
its partners attempt to come up with something revolutionary,
something that can assure the women's game a secure place in our
sporting landscape, a business model and marketing relationship in
which it can succeed.
</P>
<P>
   That much the women have earned.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when the big business of sports has driven us into
ugly, sordid, untrusting relationships with so many athletes,
teams, owners and leagues, the women have been the perfect
counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   One day after the World Cup's grand finale, it is abundantly
clear that what struck us most about the U.S. team was its unity,
desire, effort, generosity, commitment and hunger.
</P>
<P>
   No, it certainly did not hurt that the skilled, fit and driven
U.S. team is overwhelmingly attractive. Nor did it hurt that the
principle makeup of the team is smart, white, college educated and
_ just as important _ heterosexual. All this made marketing tickets
and TV that much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 650,000 tickets and the overwhelming attention is quite
an achievement and the team felt successful for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been told we were carrying this tournament,''
midfielder Julie Foudy said after the rush of the U.S. victory
settled down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've answered every single one of the questions. That's what
we talked about in the locker room (after the win). We came in as
the favorites but there was a lot of pressure for us to do well.
That's what gives me such pride. It was such a team effort and this
just shows you women can compete. It can be exciting,'' Foudy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say this Women's World Cup was a three-week event that
picked up steam the closer the U.S. team got to the final. In
reality, this Women's World Cup was at least 27 years in the
making, since a stroke of a pen back in 1972 legislated gender
equity for women's sports in schools that receive public funding.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why the 90,185 people bought out the Rose Bowl _ a
non-traditional (or could it be a new tradition?) crowd of young
girls, boys, families and women.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken a long time to build up to this breakthrough point.
</P>
<P>
   For that, perhaps we should take Title IX and rename it Title
11, just as a way of recognizing how a soccer team took a run at
challenging history and helped brighten a new vision for what women
can do and what sports can look like.
</P>
<P>
   If some view the '99 Women's World Cup as a cult happening,
there are a few new American athletic stars and worthy role models
who won't settle for anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things as players we want,'' Mia Hamm said
after the World Cup was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a professional league. I think this is going to help.
And hopefully the response (to this World Cup) will help not just
women's soccer but men's soccer as well. This can get a lot of
people excited,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, our work isn't done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   If the effort and tenacity the women showed in making this World
Cup what it was, you would have to take Hamm and her teammates at
their word. They have an admiring audience at their feet now.

TOUGH SEASON MADE WORSE BY MARINERS OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Watching the team stagger into the All-Star break like
some gray-muzzled, arthritic malamute, while observing the
financial scar on the face of the new ballyard, it finally dawned
on me what is most aggravating about the recent stewardship of the
Mariners franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have made a hard season brutal.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the team and its public are beaten up _ by far more
than the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The beating is not necessarily fatal, because this week's debut
of the Guilty Pleasure will be cause for celebration and
inspiration. But given the damage already done _ 15 defeats in the
last 22 games, including a season-high five-game losing streak and
a mere half-game out of the AL West cellar _ the new park on its
own is hardly enough medicine for a recovery to playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a substantive influx of talent by the July 31 trading
deadline, the 1999 death spiral under way would mean that Ken
Griffey Jr., and Alex Rodriguez this off-season will have merely
promises and not a single bit of evidence from the shy tycoons
about building a winner in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and A-Rod, along with the rest of the local sports
world, recently have seen what this ownership's promises are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is by far the most difficult of the major spectator
sports to master. As a game as well as a business, baseball takes
the most patience, the most money and the most wisdom. Since the
Randy Johnson debacle of more than a year ago, the franchise has
evinced almost none of those virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the fans is obvious. Not only are the Mariners
second in baseball in attendance decline, the new field's string of
sellouts extends only through the first four games so far. Late
last week there were 15,000 seats available for the July 21 game
against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, Mariners brass perkily said they would cut
off season-ticket sales at 24,000 in order to keep seats available
for the walk-up crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the walk-ups were never threatened. The pre-season sale,
including the half-year at the Guilty Pleasure, ended around
20,000, a grand more than the best season at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the team is no less blatant. Pitching has been in
chaos from the opener, thanks to a salary cap imposed by no rule or
entity other than the owners' reluctance to cash in more Microsoft
stock.
</P>
<P>
   With eight rookie pitchers and 23 overall shuttling in and out
of the clubhouse, it's amazing the laundry gets sorted properly,
much less the signals between catcher and pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Much statistical evidence illuminates the debacle of the one of
the worst staffs in major league history, none more startling than
this: In nearly a quarter of the games in the season's first half,
including Sunday's Hollywood slapstick, Mariners pitching has given
up 10 or more runs.
</P>
<P>
   That's beyond embarrassing. It's debilitating, because a mostly
young, fragile staff burns up more quickly. Besides losing the
games, the flailing relievers waste innings and confidence in
hopelessness, and the hitters are free to indulge their worst
instincts _ fence-busting instead of runner-advancing.
</P>
<P>
   On top of it all, the heavy lifting required to come back from
one-touchdown deficits is emotionally and physically exhausting.
Even the welcome addition of Brian Hunter's base-stealing prowess
is too often useless in context with either big deficits or
late-game relief flops.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the season, a point made earlier here is
offered up again: To tell fans that three rookie starters (Freddy
Garcia, John Halama and Gil Meche) are the stuff of playoff
contention is absurd. When the rooks are backed in the bullpen by
waiver-wire warriors such as Jose Paniagua and Frankie Rodriguez,
it flirts with consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing conclusion is that this 23-year-old team has
expansion- quality pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the prime reason for the desperate scramble has been a
self-imposed requirement to make a little money this season,
apparently no matter what the consequences to ticket sales, public
relations or the baseball futures of its stars and prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has always said the stadium cost overruns had no
impact on the player payroll, Mariners CEO John Ellis finally told
the truth about the club attitude in a Feb. 19 letter to the Public
Facilities District: ``If the owners had to bear the entirety of
the enormous increased costs, in addition to the substantial
operating losses sustained over the past seven years, it would have
an obvious impact on the club's flexibility in struggling to field
a highly competitive team ... ''
</P>
<P>
   In plain English, it's the long-dreaded extortion: Give us the
extra tax money or say goodbye to Griffey and A-Rod.
</P>
<P>
   While the threat was formally in play during spring training,
its public disclosure this month that Griffey is the prime pawn in
a negotiation not of his making comes at the same time management
has requested that he shut up about his obvious dismay with the
dimensions and heavy air in the new park.
</P>
<P>
   With the team in decline at the time of his least favorite part
of the baseball calendar, the All-Star Game, Griffey can't help but
be working on a fairly serious mad-on toward his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   His edginess was apparent last week before a game when he called
up unsolicited to complain to radio station KJR-AM, with whom he
has had no dealings since a host on an affiliated station mocked
his wife a couple of seasons ago. Griffey wanted to deny an Atlanta
newspaper report that he told the bosses he wouldn't re-sign with
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prompted in part by widespread national belief,
further fueled by disclosure of Ellis' own written statements, that
the owners can't sign both stars despite _ and, amazingly, partly
because of _ the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The collective upshot of these developments is that, in addition
to putting a team through a home field change at midseason _
baseball players are notorious creatures of habit who will quietly
nurse multiple complaints about the move _ the owners, instead of
creating an atmosphere of success, have ignited controversies and
distractions that have alienated some in the clubhouse and made
many fans resentful.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime baseball followers know that all clubs go through
changes and turmoil, particularly when a stadium issue is at hand.
The difference here is that Major League Baseball, the state of
Washington and the Puget Sound baseball community have over the
years combined to make a hard game about as easy as it can get for
one franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, baseball backed away from its own policy against
foreign ownership to permit Japanese investment in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, baseball broke down the races in such small divisions
that the Mariners have to be better than only three other teams to
qualify for postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature in 1995 convened a special session to create
massive, controversial public funding for a ballpark. Then in
December 1996, the state, King County and the city capitulated to
further club extortion, creating one of the sweetest leases in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three seasons, the public did its part by
forsaking Seattle summers and showing up 8.4 million strong to a
garage, as well as helping creating the highest local TV ratings in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The response to this overwhelming, spectacular show of support
is a floundering 42-45 team whose stars are edging toward the exit
while their bosses edge toward the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   As far as stewardship of quasi-public institution, it's been
brutal. Absolutely brutal.

L.A. SOCCER MOMS HELPED CREATE FIELDS OF DREAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They opened a new era for soccer, these pioneering
females in a male-dominated sport. Not bad for a bunch of
8-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1969, and the girls tearing up and down the fields of
suburban Granada Hills didn't know it, but they were making
history. The four squads became the first official girls' teams in
the country when they joined the American Youth Soccer Organization
that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved to run. I loved passing. I loved scoring,'' said
Jaymee Jusko, 38, of Long Beach, a player on one of those first
Granada Hills teams. ``I knew I wanted to play and figured I'd be
playing for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was eager to get the women's league started. She was
very, very instrumental. Without her it would've taken another few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Irene Jusko _ the original soccer mom _ had three sons and two
daughters who ended up playing the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the boys began to play at the park, the girls became
interested,'' said Jusko, so she and several other mothers got
together and organized teams from the 60 girls who signed up from
Granada Hills and surrounding communities. The moms even made their
uniforms _ sort of colored ponchos, actually _ by cutting head
holes in 3-by-6 pieces of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   They've come a long way. Now about 40 percent of the 650,000
kids playing AYSO soccer nationwide are girls, said the
organization's national director, Dick Wilson. And he said he
expects the success of the U.S. women's pursuit of the World Cup
will boost sign-ups among girls by 10 percent next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those women are the role models for our kids, and they give
back to the sport,'' said AYSO national public affairs manager
Lolly Keys. ``They are wonderful representatives, and we're really
proud of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls all over are now looking at this team and thinking, I
can live out my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Keys said the season starts in September, ``so if they're not
already signed up, it's getting late.'' Interested parents can call
(800) USA-AYSO for information.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawthorne-based AYSO began in Torrance, 19 miles southwest
of downtown L.A., in 1964, and it sponsors soccer teams nationwide
for children from 4 1-2 (one-half) to 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years after AYSO first admitted girls' teams, 20
percent of the players nationwide were girls, Wilson said. He said
girls' teams formed in Torrance and the South Bay about the same
time or shortly after the Granada Hills teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, while some of the most skilled girls were able
to compete on boys' teams, he said, ``the average athlete was
reluctant to play on a boys' team. But the average girl blossomed
when put on a girls' team.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Keys said, three players on the U.S. team are AYSO
veterans _ Julie Foudy from Mission Viejo, Joy Fawcett from
Huntington Beach and Brandi Chastain from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's marvelous young women have the same opportunities
boys do,'' Irene Jusko said. ``It's just wonderful to see the parks
in the (San Fernando) Valley _ well, all over the city _ just
teeming with children. I think it's really, really exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the girls learn important lessons on the soccer field
that they should carry to their careers and everyday lives, such as
teamwork, and winning and losing graciously.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, though, just learning the rules of the game
was hard enough. Players often abandoned their positions and simply
swarmed the ball during games, said Mario Machado, the Granada
Hills resident, CBS broadcaster and former player who kicked off
the soccer craze in that area.
</P>
<P>
   He began teaching the game to interested boys at his church, St.
John the Baptist De La Salle. Interest grew, the games moved to
Petit Park, and interest grew yet more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a grass-roots program,'' Machado said. ``The girls
wanted to play, and we said, we'll teach you how to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaymee Jusko, who now works as a project manager for a
telecommunications company, loved the game as soon as she started
playing. But she had to give it up when she went to Kennedy High
School, which didn't have girls' soccer. Instead she played
volleyball and basketball, and earned a scholarship to Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Now girls who play soccer have those same opportunities _ to
parlay their skills into a college education, with soccer
scholarships available at universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old girls venturing onto soccer fields today have
wide-open futures compared to what Jaymee Jusko faced 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She imagines what her foreshortened soccer career could have
been if she had been born a few years later, when girls could play
in high school and college and on the national team. She dreamed it
might have been her playing on the Rose Bowl field Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God. Can you imagine?'' she said. ``That would be
awesome. I wish the knees were good enough _ too many slide
tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   But she lauded the achievements of the U.S. women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just salute them,'' she said. ``They've set a great example
for the nation and the whole world.''

   SEATTLE _ Microsoft has improved benefits for the contract
workers who make up a third of its Puget Sound area work force.
</P>
<P>
   But the workers' ongoing discontent _ along with two potentially
expensive lawsuits _ may compel the Redmond software maker to
eliminate or restructure this labor source.
</P>
<P>
   The change could cause reverberations nationwide in the software
industry and other businesses needing a work force that can grow or
shrink to match product life cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of perma-temping at Microsoft could be very near,''
said Marcus Courtney, co-founder of the Washington Alliance of
Technical Workers (Washtech), a labor organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is a legal ruling in a federal lawsuit called
Vizcaino vs. Microsoft. In it, a federal judge ruled that as many
as 10,000 current and former temporary workers at Microsoft are
eligible for appreciation on stock they should have been allowed to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit ``could undermine the entire information economy,''
forcing companies using temps to find some alternative and
companies providing temps to restructure or fold, said Harris
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one worried.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Irvine, president of the local chapter of the National
Technical Services Association, which represents 300 providers of
temporary technical workers nationwide, said members are concerned
their customers ``might be afraid of falling into the same
situation as Microsoft.'' Formerly reliable tests for determining
who should legally be considered a worker's employer ``might work
one day and not the next'' because of the Vizcaino suit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal legislation is pending that may also affect the
temporary-worker industry, noted Toby Malara, the association's
director of government public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temporary agencies have come to the forefront'' in
Washington, D.C., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what form of employment would replace temping and what
would become of the 5,500 to 6,500 temporary workers now in place
at Microsoft, remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are evaluating our options, and we hope that we will always
have the option to engage individuals in a temporary capacity to
address the needs of a rapidly changing high-tech economy,'' said
Sharon Decker, Microsoft's director of contingent staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft is trying to do right by its temps, agreed
five of the six temporary workers interviewed for this story. They
said their work lives have improved since early May, when newly
negotiated contracts went into effect between Microsoft and the 15
principal agencies that supply it with temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest software company told agencies that if they
wanted to continue to do business with Microsoft after May, they
would need to offer benefits including:
</P>
<P>
   _13 paid days off a year, whether as sick leave, compensatory
time, paid vacation or some other form.
</P>
<P>
   _Medical and dental insurance, for which the agency pays half.
</P>
<P>
   _Vocational training worth at least $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _A retirement savings program with some matching by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also reduced, to 15 from more than 100, the number of
agencies with which it contracts for temps, so it could more
closely supervise their benefits offerings. Agencies subcontracting
to those 15 principal agencies would be expected to offer the same
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Five agencies or subcontractors surveyed last week said their
benefits meet or beat Microsoft's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;T Onsite, a Seattle supplier of designers and writers, said it
has increased its IRA contribution rate to 20 percent from 15
percent of pretax earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Volt Computer Services of Redmond, which furnishes software
testers, reported it offers an extra two days vacation annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Write Stuff Inc., a Seattle supplier of communications
workers, said it meets or exceeds Microsoft's requirements and
sends a masseuse to its employees twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   BENEFITS AT OR ABOVE the minimum levels were also reported by
Kelly Services Inc., a Troy, Mich., supplier of administrative
workers, and by H.L. Yoh Co. LLC, a Philadelphia supplier of
testers.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how those benefits are implemented is left to the
agencies, and that means they can choose to offer only the bare
minimums. So some agencies may offer health insurance to
individuals, but not to their families. And the vocational training
offered by some agencies may not go beyond the skill area in which
each temp's job falls.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Lewis, who has worked under contracts at Microsoft for four
years, mostly as a lab engineer, said, ``I would say my personal
situation is not better now than it was on May 2. I get $82 toward
personal medical premiums but none for my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is 40 and the single mother of a 12-year-old, added,
``As a parent, I could use a lot more flex time than the 13 days
per year we get.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft-engineered competition among agencies was supposed to
result in even greater benefits to temps. But the workers are still
chafing under contracts forbidding them from switching from one
agency to another during an assignment. Washtech wants these
provisions eliminated, saying they reduce the choices workers have
among agencies and thereby diminish the agencies' incentives to
compete to offer better benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Volt and Yoh said they won't ax the provisions
because they are too important to the agencies' stability.
Microsoft said it can't force them to.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the improved benefits, many Microsoft temps say they
continue to feel like second-class citizens. Distinctions between
Microsoft employees and the temps, such as different colored ID
badges and e-mail addresses, add to that feeling, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel like I'm set apart because of subtle things,''
like being on separate distribution lists for important documents
and having to get a manager's permission to attend a briefing that
full-time, permanent employees can go to without a second thought,
said Ed Campodonico, who will have been a Microsoft temp for three
consecutive years in October.
</P>
<P>
   And whether they represent policy or are merely careless,
remarks like those by Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei last
month create _ or reflect _ a stigma attached to temps.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said at a meeting of accountants, ``The quality of the
temps is not as good as the quality of the full-time people. ... We
wouldn't necessarily have said we want them for full time.''
</P>
<P>
   He later apologized for and withdrew the statement.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the benefits temps are getting aren't
even close to what Microsoft offers its own employees. On its Web
site, Microsoft brags it offers ``more perks than Seattle has
coffeehouses.''
</P>
<P>
   For employees and their families, including same-sex domestic
partners, Microsoft covers 100 percent of medical, dental and
vision insurance premiums. It offers optional life insurance of up
to $750,000, a group legal plan and pretax deductions for day care
and elder care expenses and health care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) plan allows deferring 15 percent of pre-tax salary,
plus an additional 7 percent after taxes. Contributions are matched
50 percent, up to 6 percent of the employee's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also offers paid maternity and infant-care leave,
financial adoption assistance, personal and family counseling,
health club memberships, matching charitable deductions and
personalized ergonomics consultation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether it's fair that Microsoft employees get
benefits so much richer than those of temporary workers, spokesman
Dan Leach said: ``If you're interested in Microsoft benefits, there
are 2,000 jobs that anyone qualified should apply for.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not that simple. Applying for staff jobs was eased by
Microsoft's May declaration that it would disregard non-compete
clauses forbidding agency employees from becoming Microsoft
employees. Still, it's not necessarily easy to ``convert'' from one
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a full-time job was a grueling process,'' said one
worker who just converted. ``I practically fell into my contracting
job.''
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT AND THE temps seem to be forever at odds. The company
maintains that contract workers make more in wages than its
employees and have more flexible schedules. Temporary workers argue
that they don't make more in wages, that even if they do, their
expenses are higher and that their flexibility is limited by
Microsoft's mandatory one-month time-off periods and by their
agencies' non-compete clauses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of fairness, said David Stobaugh, an attorney in
the Vizcaino suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are truly `temps,' working for a few weeks or
months, fine. But these people aren't temps,'' he said. ``It's easy
to justify treating people differently when you call them something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the lawsuits will undoubtedly affect the
company's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In Vizcaino, the full appellate court most recently refused
Microsoft's petition to rehear a decision in favor of the temps
rendered by a three-judge panel of the court. Now Microsoft will
likely either seek review in the U.S. Supreme Court or face the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Once Vizcaino is resolved, it may be unnecessary to litigate
Hughes vs. Microsoft, a related case seeking back insurance
benefits for the same plaintiffs, Stobaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Vizcaino court) basically told Microsoft they have to
stop pretending these people aren't employees,'' he said. ``And
once they are employees for one purpose, they're employees for
every purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution Microsoft may be considering is expanding its own
work force to create a pool of employees who will move from one
project to another as needed.
</P>
<P>
   If that were cost-effective at current salary levels, it
probably would already have been done. So it may be significant
that in mid-May, Microsoft said it would increase the number of
non-executive job classification levels to 22 from 12. Perhaps it
is preparing to create a floating corps of differently compensated
workers, Washtech's Courtney suggested.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype corps member may be one woman who came to Microsoft
several months ago as a Grade 8. She's a Microsoft employee,
wearing a blue badge, getting full benefits and eligible to
participate in the discounted stock purchase plan, just like any
other Microsoft worker. But she's paid by the hour and hasn't yet
received any stock options, unlike most Microsoft employees, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an employee, but I'm not treated like all the other
employees,'' said the woman, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Though not a temp, she wonders whether she's being treated
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end? asked worker Lisa Lewis. ``Something's got to
give,'' she said. ``What, I don't know.''

BATTLE-WORN AKERS WEIGHING SOCCER RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ What will Michelle Akers do? What should she
do?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough year physically. I have to weigh if I want
to go through this again,'' Akers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she posed the real question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I need to?'' Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when Michael Jordan decided he wanted to go out on
top; in a time when John Elway won his second Super Bowl and walked
away on top of the game; when Wayne Gretzky refused to slog through
another season too hurt to play the way the greatest hockey player
ever will be remembered for playing, Akers should give herself the
time and permission to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   No one would fault her for wanting to hang up her cleats now. No
one will say she has to stick around and risk further injury
because women's soccer needs her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a better team with Michelle on the field,'' U.S. coach
Tony DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the toughest ... player I've ever played with,'' Brandi
Chastain bellowed in the wake of the U.S. women's victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Akers' presence comes at an increasingly painful cost.
</P>
<P>
   She was not on the field when the U.S. won the 1999 Women's
World Cup. After 90 minutes of giving every ounce of blood and
sweat, Akers was in the trainer's room, exhausted, dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's out of it. I've never seen her like that,'' U.S. World
Cup team spokesman Aaron Heiffitz said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   That was really saying something.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how wiped out Akers was after a goal-line
collision with goalkeeper Briana Scurry during a China corner kick,
think about all the times Akers has been down during her stellar
career.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, Akers has battled chronic fatigue syndrome _ a
condition that requires daily management and postgame IV's to help
restore her fluids and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what this woman goes through just to play the
game,'' one team official said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chastain, Mia Hamm was nearly choking up just thinking
about Akers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a champion. I just wished she was on the field with
us at the end. But the fact that she wasn't on the field told me
she had given it her all. We are not the same team without her,''
Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   The toll has been heavy, though. Akers also has had a dozen knee
surgeries. She has broken three bones in her cheek and suffered
more brain-rattling concussions than Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite her lagging health and injuries, Akers overall was
the best United States player during this World Cup. Her ability to
to control the ball and launch her rocket shot were on full
display.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the '99 World Cup, Akers still is the most
dominating player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Akers' relentless effort shored up the U.S. defense and gave the
team its underlying offensive threat. She did the same thing during
a stalwart effort in the quarterfinals against Germany and against
Brazil in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Akers did not make the team's visit to Disneyland Sunday.
However, she did make one statement to The Associated Press,
uttering the question that everyone is asking: Can she do this
again?
</P>
<P>
   After two World Cup wins, an Olympic gold medal and all she has
done for the sport of soccer, Akers has earned the right to end her
career as champion, even if she can't forget the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Akers what she remembers about her first Women's World Cup,
though, and she will tell you it was Pele.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when the U.S. Women's World Cup team took the field in
China, Pele met Akers with a hug and a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sign. An embrace from one champion to another. It was a
moment of mutual respect between a man who uplifted his sport and a
pioneering woman who was doing the same thing for hers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pioneer has made her contributions to the women's sports
revolution. Her place in history is alive and kicking, even if she
decides this is the right time to walk away.

BORBON CONNECTS WITH PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Pedro Borbon
laughed Sunday when reminded that his father, former Reds reliever
Pedro Borbon, played a major role in one of the most famous fights
in major-league history _ the 1973 playoff brawl touched off by
Pete Rose and New York Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   The husky Rose beat Harrelson badly, but the underdog Mets won
the series. Borbon's father was accused of taking a bite out of a
Mets cap during the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon was thrown out of Sunday's 14-3 victory over Seattle for
his part in a 15-minute fight. After the Mariners' Jay Buhner got
him in a headlock, Borbon hit him several times in the face. He
also struck reliever Jose Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see one of my teammates going down, I'm going to get in
there and defend him,'' Borbon said. ``That's the way my dad was. I
don't even know where my cap is now, but I wouldn't have bitten it.
I don't have strong teeth like my dad did. I had someone tell me,
`You look just like your dad,' when they mentioned that fight.''
</P>
<P>
   About his altercation with Paniagua, which died down, then
picked up twice, Borbon joked, ``We Latin guys, we never let it
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned serious, blaming Mariners manager Lou Piniella
for setting the tone for Sunday's brawl. Many think it began
Friday, when Seattle's Freddy Garcia retaliated twice after Ismael
Valdes hit Mariners hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Seattle baseball,'' Borbon said. ``That's the way they
play, that's the way Lou Piniella plays. If you hit my shortstop
I'm going to hit your shortstop. If you hit my third baseman, I'm
going to hit your third baseman. Sometimes, I feel that the league
should go after him instead of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella refused to comment after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka finishes: Darren Dreifort went five innings to end a
personal three-game losing streak, but the most impressive pitching
was done by rookie left-handed reliever Onan Masaoka. He pitched
the final four innings, allowing just one hit and one walk for his
first career save.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka, a starter throughout his minor-league career, said he
is just happy to be here and doesn't think about whether the team
will make him a starter one day. ``The good part is being here and
contributing,'' he said. ``We have a good group out there. We'll
think about that stuff later.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, two potential
free agents after the 2000 season, went a combined 1 for 18 in the
series. The only hit was Griffey's third-inning homer Sunday that
gave him 379 for his career, tied for 38th all-time with Orlando
Cepeda and Tony Perez.... Griffey's two-out homer came on a 3-2
pitch after Dreifort got ahead 0-2.... Eric Young, who has
struggled in the leadoff spot this season, went 3 for 4 with two
doubles, two runs and his 33rd stolen base.... Chan Ho Park,
suspended seven games in June for kicking the Angels Tim Belcher,
was a bystander during most of Sunday's fight: ``I was scared out
there.''

RED SOX DROOP, ENTER BREAK OFF LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BRAVES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those storm clouds that gathered overhead just as Lou
Merloni struck out to end Sunday's 8-1 loss to the Atlanta Braves
did not follow the Red Sox home.
</P>
<P>
   Once they boarded their charter flight to Boston, the Sox not
only left behind the dark skies but a 4-6 road trip, their last bit
of unpleasant business in a National League city, and the
figurative first half of a season in which they exceeded all
expectations, perhaps even their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to answer that question,'' said third
baseman John Valentin, when asked precisely that. ``All I can say
is this team played well in the first half and we weren't expected
to. I've got to give credit to our team. We played hard and won
games against good teams, and we have confidence that we can
compete against good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox resume competing after the All-Star break against
the Phillies Thursday in Boston, they will be fortified not only by
the return of Valentin, who had two singles off Braves ace Greg
Maddux in his first game off the disabled list. They also are
anticipating the return of shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who missed
the last nine games of this trip with a strained left groin, a
stretch in which the Red Sox scored two runs or fewer five times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good ballclub,'' Valentin said. ``We're going to
play well. It's a long season with a lot of ups and downs. The
break is coming at the right time. We're struggling a little bit
right now physically, and mentally we haven't been playing all that
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this team comes to the ballpark and works hard and plays
hard. Obviously, when guys are out of the lineup, it's going to
affect your club. But I thought we've played well with guys out. I
have to hand it to the rest of the guys who've stepped up.
Hopefully, (Tom Gordon) will come back and other guys will get back
in the groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the second half is important. It's a war. Guys
will be prepared to come back and show what we showed at times in
the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not one of those times. Not against Maddux, who gave
one of his virtuoso minimalist performances _ six hits (five
singles), one runner to third base after the first inning, 84
pitches in eight innings _ while rookie Jin Ho Cho absorbed a
lesson in textbook baseball from the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   --First Braves run: A double, ground ball to advance the runner
to third, sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   --Two more Braves runs: Double, a Maddux sacrifice bunt, RBI
single, hit-and-run single, sac fly.
</P>
<P>
   --Fourth Braves run: A home run by Ryan Klesko, who later
dropped a three-run bomb on Tim Wakefield, who pitched the eighth
inning just for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be better, but he's still learning,'' catcher Jason
Varitek said of Cho (2-2), who lasted just four innings and has not
made it past the fifth in his last three starts, which have
resulted in two losses and a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot to learn. I do, too, but he's got a lot of game
situations to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, asked how Cho fits in the team's
second-half plans, said: ``He fits in the fifth hole. And don't
read anything into that.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, the Sox had hoped Ramon Martinez would be joining the
rotation, but that won't happen. Martinez, who had to take three
weeks between rehabilitation starts, is as much an uncertainty now
as Gordon, the closer who is expected to begin testing his bad
elbow after the break. Meanwhile, Juan Pena, the rookie who pitched
so splendidly in two starts before his shoulder went south, has
just begun pitching again, at the lowest rung of the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have lost five of their last seven games,
scored just two runs in their last 24 innings here. Jose Offerman
went 0 for 9 on the weekend. Troy O'Leary had one hit in 11 at-bats
here. Merloni went 0 for 12, Varitek 0 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not swinging the bats as well now,'' Varitek said, ``but
against Tampa Bay we were swinging better than the results showed.
Guys lined into double plays, balls were bouncing over fences,
people were making diving catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what this team is built on. We have to have those
balls fall in. We don't have nine guys in the lineup who are
hitting three bills (.300). But we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are 3-9 in interleague play, with six games left against
National League opponents, the Phillies and Marlins in back-to-back
series after the break. Those games are all at home, so at least
the Sox will be able to employ a designated hitter, which they
weren't able to do in NL parks, where they went 2-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like interleague play, period,'' manager Jimy Williams
said. ``That's my opinion. It's there. We'll go by the rules. But
I'm not an advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, a believer in his team, one that goes into the
break four games behind the Yankees in the AL East, and just three
games ahead of third-place Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We compete,'' he said. ``I think our pitchers have done a
great job. I really do. Overall, offensively, I've gotten some big
hits from a lot of different people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep playing, don't we? That's all. No excuses. Just keep
playing. That's all we're trying to do.''

BURTON IN THIRD GEAR AT NHIS

 LUBE 300-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ The third time around was a gas for Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   After he qualified poorly and started 38th in Sunday's Jiffy
Lube 300 NASCAR Winston Cup race at New Hampshire International
Speedway, Burton knew he faced a monumental uphill struggle if he
intended to drive his No. 99 Ford Taurus from the back of the
43-car field to the front, let alone Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never say if we qualify bad, we can't win,'' Burton said,
``but I have to tell you, going into this race, we didn't think we
had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   After his Roush Racing crew worked feverishly Sunday morning to
change the springs, swaybars, and track bars on his car, Burton
knew all the last-minute alterations made the chances for a
three-peat visit to Victory Lane at NHIS seem remote, at best.
</P>
<P>
   But, lo and behold, at the end of Sunday's race _ which got
underway when Ted Williams gave the command ``Gentleman, start your
engines!'' _ that's exactly where Burton stood: Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, Burton was the winner of the Jiffy
Lube 300, but this time the 32-year-old native of South Boston,
Va., did so at the expense of rookie driver Tony Stewart. Bidding
to record his first Winston Cup victory, Stewart, who led twice for
118 laps (including 103 of the last 105), wound up 10th when he
dropped out of the lead with two laps to go after his No. 20
Pontiac ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out to lunch,'' said Burton, whose victory from 38th
was the deepest in the field a winner has started since Bill
Elliott came from 38th to win the 1988 Firecracker 400. ``But Frank
Stoddard (his crew chief) did a hell of a job, this whole team did
a great job. They got this car in contention to win when nobody
else could have done that. It just wasn't good enough when we
unloaded, but the guys never quit, I never quit and nobody ever got
down. We just kept working.''
</P>
<P>
   So did runner-up Kenny Wallace, who started sixth and never ran
among the Top 10 but somehow managed to work his way up to the
front on the last lap to record his career-best Winston Cup finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Elledge made some great adjustments,'' Wallace said,
saluting the crew chief of his No. 55 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I
messed up on the gears. We should have pulled more gear. We got
second out of it. The car was awesome. It was very fast at the end.
That's how we stayed on the lead; I was conserving fuel there at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   After he pitted for the last time on Lap 195, Stewart and his
crew chief, Greg Zipadelli of Berlin, Conn., gambled and lost when
they tried to stretch their last tank of gas 105 laps. Stewart, who
was involved in a bumping incident with Ernie Irvan on the postrace
cool-down lap, departed the track fuming and without comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was probably going to be a half-a-lap gamble,''
said Zipadelli. ``It showed up to be bigger than that. We thought
we were conserving more fuel throughout the whole run than we had
previously. If we did, and were getting the same fuel mileage we
did earlier, we should have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they came up two laps short when Stewart crossed the finish
line on Lap 298 and radioed his crew, ``We're out of fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart dropped off the pace, John Andretti entered the
pits in second place with a chance to emerge as the leader. All he
needed was a quick splash of fuel. However, Andretti's No. 43
Pontiac coughed and wheezed when the fuel pickup failed and,
finally, stalled as he attempted to exit the pits.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who pitted one last time with 10 laps to go, roared by
and left Andretti's stalled car in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of our team,'' Andretti said. ``But if I couldn't
have won it, or (teammate) Kyle (Petty) couldn't have won it, then
I would have wanted Jeff to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's fourth win of the season and ninth of his career (one
third at NHIS), vaulted him from fourth to second in the Winston
Cup points, 240 behind leader Dale Jarrett (2,839), who finished
fourth after he was bumped out of third by a last-lap altercation
with Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got that trophy and we got those points and I don't care
how we did it _ we did it,'' Burton said when asked if Stewart's
misfortune in any way tainted his $139,490 victory. ``You win races
a lot of ways and to win races you've gotta put yourself in
position. We put ourselves in position and we did a better job than
they did.''

THIS GROUP IS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ They were sitting in their Rose Bowl locker
room before Saturday's World Cup final, getting ready to face the
Chinese in front of 90,000 people, when Sara Whalen turned to
Briana Scurry. ``I'm sad,'' Whalen told her. ``This is the last
game. This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The US women's soccer team had been living, practicing, eating,
playing, traveling, laughing, weeping, bonding together all year.
And now, win or lose, it was over. Twenty women who had vowed to
take two fillings for each other would be taking their gold or
silver medals and going back to husbands, children, boyfriends,
jobs, lives. ``It dawned on us,'' Scurry said, ``that we might
never have this group together again.''
</P>
<P>
   National teams are like infantry platoons. They're made up of
people from Huntington Beach, Calif., and Altamonte Springs, Fla.,
and North Andover, Mass., who are thrown together in close quarters
for months and through the alchemy of stress and a common goal are
bound like blood relatives. Then, when the tournament is over, they
shake hands and head for different ZIP codes.
</P>
<P>
   The Babes of Summer are history. They never will play in another
World Cup. Some of them, perhaps most of them, will be back for
another go in 2003. But not all of them. They can't even be
together at next summer's Olympics in Sydney if they want to be.
The Olympic rosters allow for only 16 players, not 20. ``So we know
we won't have the same group,'' Scurry says.
</P>
<P>
   They may not even have the same coach. Tony DiCicco has been
with the squad since 1991 and has been head man for six years. He
has a wife and four sons, one of whom will be graduating from high
school next year. How much longer can he be a gypsy with a whistle?
</P>
<P>
   ``My 7-year-old asked me, when are you going to get a new job?''
DiCicco was saying, even before the tournament began last month.
``As much as I love this job, there's a price I'm paying. Some days
it seems worthwhile. And some days it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   What else is there to win? What else is there to prove? Seven of
the players have won two world titles. Most of them have an Olympic
gold medal. How many trophy cases do they need to fill?
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Akers has been playing since 1985, when the ragtag
Americans were sewing numerals on hand-me-down men's jerseys. She's
had a dozen knee surgeries, countless concussions, and has been
fighting chronic fatigue syndrome for eight years. She had to be
helped off the field before the final was over and was hooked up to
an IV when her teammates were getting their medals. How much more
can she take?
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Lilly, the Queen of Caps, already has set the world
record for international appearances. Does she want to go for 200?
250? Joy Fawcett has a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old. Will she want
to pull them out of school to have them travel with her again? Mia
Hamm already has scored more goals than any woman in history.
Wouldn't she rather sharpen up her short game and join the LPGA?
</P>
<P>
   The national team isn't what it was when the Americans won their
first Cup eight years ago. It was still a volunteer fire department
then, getting together just before big tournaments, then
disbanding. They played only two matches in 1992. They'll probably
be playing two dozen before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Once the flurry of parades and banquets and appearances is done,
once they've grabbed what's left of summer with their families, the
players will be back in camp preparing for the US Cup in early
October. There's talk of a `gender equity' tour that would take
them to South Africa, to Egypt, to the Middle East. There's a
winter trip Down Under for three matches with the Australians, the
Algarve Cup in Portugal in March, another trip Down Under for a
pre-Olympic tournament, probably a ``road to Sydney'' barnstorming
tour in the States, then the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Not all these players will volunteer to be on the bus that never
stops rolling. Not all will be asked. All they knew, in the Rose
Bowl on Saturday, was that they could count on one more game
together. And only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``So all the emotions came out,'' Whalen, the Natick-born
defender, was saying. ``After all we've been through together for
so long. We were crying before the game. We were crying at
halftime. And we were crying after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were celebrating and mourning while trying to hold
on to a moment that seemed to be moving at warp speed. They just
had been through a scoreless grinder of a final. They had gone to
overtime, then to penalty kicks. They had seen Scurry make a save,
seen Brandi Chastain drill the winner home. Then they were having
gold medals draped around their necks, were taking a victory lap
with Old Glory, were talking to a gazillion notebooks and cameras.
``I don't remember anything that just happened,'' Tisha Venturini
was saying.
</P>
<P>
   It was that way for the Boys of Winter at Lake Placid in 1980.
They beat the Soviets, they won the gold medal, they went to the
White House, and suddenly they were saying goodbye to each other.
``It's over, Jack,'' Dave Silk said to Jack O'Callahan. And then
Silk began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   The Babes of Summer already have been crying and they haven't
gotten to the White House yet. ``I'll probably have post-excitement
syndrome,'' Scurry was saying. ``Be totally depressed for the next
three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry felt that way three years ago, after the Olympic platoon
scattered. Most of them came back for another mission this summer,
but not all of them. Most of them will be back in Sydney. But this
team, these 20 women with two silver fillings and one gold medal,
never will wear a jersey again. The Babes of Summer are history.

FOR U.S. TEAM, PARADE IS JUST THE BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The United States women's national team was
treated to a victory parade Sunday morning at Disneyland, then an
afternoon rally at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop included a parade down Main Street, bands,
dancers, fireworks, confetti showers and workers sticking little
American flags in every empty hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' defender Lorrie Fair said. ``All those
little kids with USA shirts and hats. There wasn't much notice that
we were coming. I was surprised to see so many people in red, white
and blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll find out how many people we've reached in the
days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Sobrero, the gutty U.S. defender who shut down China's Sun
Wen, wondered when her legs would give after a Saturday night that
lasted long into Sunday morning after the postgame party at the
Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We partied and partied,'' Sobrero said. ``It's been crazy, out
of control and I've had about two hours of sleep, but who cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to end. I don't want to go home and not have
these 19 people around me all the time. I like living on cloud
nine, I can always sleep later.''
</P>
<P>
   As the team walked past a crowd estimated at 2,000 at the
Convention Center, many of the young fans held up signs that read,
``I have two fillings,'' referring to the U.S. team's Nike
commercial theme that encourages team camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are just amazing,'' Kristine Lilly said. ``I think
they're capturing what we're all about. That's what we want to do.
Whether it's male or female, they are amazed by what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, without captain Michelle Akers who collapsed at
the end of Saturday's game because of heat exhaustion, was treated
to an entertaining show by midfielder Julie Foudy, who introduced
the U.S. players to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll leave nothing in the closet,'' Foudy said. ``Give me the
microphone and it's trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few introductions, she looked at Saturday's hero Brandi
Chastain. Chastain tossed her shirt to the sky after her
game-winning penalty kick secured the U.S. victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, she's the woman who has an uncanny knack of taking
her clothes off,'' Foudy said. ``She calls it temporary insanity,
but who believes that?''
</P>
<P>
   The team stayed for only a few minutes. They had interviews
scheduled throughout the day and had to board a plane for New York
for more appearances and a spot on Late Night with David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just doing whatever we're told, and having a good
time,'' Danielle Fotopoulos said. ``We're supposed to be on the
cover of Newsweek, Time, Sports Illustrated and People.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, Chastain and Foudy will play in an LPGA pro-am this week
and many of the players will be back in training by summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   The team handed out an itinerary, detailing Team USA's victory
tour, which begins with the U.S. Women's Cup on Oct. 3, in
Columbus, Ohio.

WOMEN'S SOCCER IS OUR GIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I sneered at the thought of a women's professional
soccer league before this Women's World Cup tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world would we want to make fun of this sport
anymore? Major League Soccer has enough naysayers and critics who
think its collapse is around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But the women give us something the men can't.
</P>
<P>
   This is our game. It's not Brazil's, England's or Germany's _
women's soccer is our gig.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer may be a century old in most parts of the world, leaving
our men decades behind, but women's soccer is our new phenomenon.
Let the rest of the world follow us this time.
</P>
<P>
   Need proof, look at Saturday's television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup final between the United States and China
produced the most-watched soccer game ever on U.S. network
television.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' dramatic 5-4 penalty kick win posted a 13.3
overnight rating and a 32 share on ABC, 4 percent more than the
previous record, a 12.8 for the 1994 men's World Cup final, also
played at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ABC estimated 40 million viewers watched the game.
</P>
<P>
   The highest rating for the U.S. men was a 10.4 overnight and 27
share during a 1-0 loss to Brazil during the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see these numbers unless you're watching the NFL,''
said ABC spokesman Mark Mandel. ``If this event were on a Sunday
afternoon, these numbers would be through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like professional baseball, basketball and football,
viewers support sports played at the highest level and American
teams that win championships -- and these women offer both.
</P>
<P>
   While it may take years, if it doesn't fold first, before the
WNBA reaches the doorstep of the NBA, that's not the case in
women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   You think every television and newspaper editor in America
doesn't recognize that Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain, Michelle Akers,
Julie Foudy and Briana Scurry are the most popular soccer players
in America? Or dare we say, the world?
</P>
<P>
   You think every television and newspaper editor wasn't touched
by the theatrics and gut-wrenching performances the women showed
during their 120-minute victory in searing heat?
</P>
<P>
   Our men will always face impossible battles. We don't have the
best players in the world and we can't afford to pay the best
players in the world to come here. And we aren't capable of
delivering men's soccer at the highest level, not unless we invite
Manchester United or a few others in for a friendly.
</P>
<P>
   But women's soccer is different. The best players in the world
and the best team in the world are here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we'll have a professional league after the
(2000) Olympics,'' said Alan Rothenberg, president and CEO of the
1994 World Cup and adviser to the 1999 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are obviously two things that are very
inviting. We would start out clearly as the best league in the
world, whereas the men have a good league but a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the other, we've tapped into a fan base that is excited,
interested and we would love to continue to encourage that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, I can't recall the number of times I've
heard little girls and women explain that the reason they love
women's soccer is because the American players are the role models
they never had.
</P>
<P>
   And surely the chauvinistic pigs will follow women's soccer for
the other reasons found in Gear Magazine. But who cares? It's a
combination that will work.
</P>
<P>
   After a few months off, the women will be at it again, training
for the U.S. Women's Cup in October and a victory tour leading to
the Olympics next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think soccer is strong in this country,'' said forward Mia
Hamm. ``And it scares me to think how really strong it's going to
be.''

WILL BALL KEEP ROLLING FOR US WOMEN? 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The crowd lingered along the Rose Bowl
concourse, pushing up against metal gates and straining to see over
cement walls. The people wanted one last glimpse of their soccer
heroes. Names and faces that went unrecognized less than three
weeks ago were the focus of high-pitched postmatch screams and the
paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   The largest throng gathered at the stadium's south end around
the media tent. Restrained by burly event staff in yellow T-shirts,
fans stuck their cameras between the tent flaps, clicking away at
anything inside. While they waited they sang, ``Ole, ole, ole,
ole,'' the international soccer anthem that rose to American
popularity during the 1994 men's World Cup. They intermittently
chanted, ``U-S-A, U-S-A.'' They cheered loudly as players entered
and exited the tent.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate afterglow of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was
colored red, white, and blue, and the words ``historic'' and
``legacy'' were used to describe the shining moment for female
athletes. The championship celebration, the smiles, and the buzz
surrounding the event were all big. In his postgame comments, US
coach Tony DiCicco addressed a national audience and said that all
Americans had played a part in the US shootout victory over China
in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy is that soccer has for sure captivated America for
three weeks like it did in '94,'' he said. ``Now, we can say
women's soccer or we can just say soccer. Our men captivated this
country just as our women did. Soccer is here, whether you all as
the media think it's an American sport or not. It's only going to
further ingrain itself into our culture and into our society. The
women's side of the game is proving that it's worthy of media
attention. It is entertaining to watch. It's skillful to watch.
Women's soccer and women's athletics are here to stay, and we're
just scratching the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the excitement generated by the US team and its
second world title in eight years was the realization that
Saturday's championship signaled the new apex of women's athletics.
The record-setting 90,185 fans who packed the Rose Bowl and the
portion of the crowd that caused a scene waiting for Mia, Julie,
Brandi, Kate, Carla, and Kristine will not be duplicated anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they recounted their thrilling win on penalty kicks
(5-4), the players understood the team would not continue to
capitivate the country the way it had during the tournament. Now
the Babes of Summer, tournament executives, and those hoping for a
women's professional league will learn the statute of limitations
for World Cup fame and the long-term legacy of the women's national
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to know what the legacy will be, but there are
a few things I feel certain about,'' said tournament president and
CEO Marla Messing. ``One, I believe that the FIFA Women's World Cup
is a sporting event people are going to be interested in and
excited about every four years, and that's going to help fuel the
growth of women's soccer around the world. And two, I think we're
going to see enormous numbers of girls register to play organized
soccer in the fall because they just saw what a great sport it is.
They want to be like Mia and Carla and Julie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just captured the imagination of the American public. It
sounds like a cliche, but this tournament and this team just
captured their imagination to the point where people who don't care
about soccer and don't care about women's sports were captivated,
were watching the games on TV, were buying expensive tickets in
some cases. It struck a chord. I think it's going to take some time
to reflect and figure out what that chord was. Something sort of
superkinetic happened.''
</P>
<P>
   With their victory in the championship game, the women's
national soccer team joined the growing list of successful American
female sports teams capable of creating national interest. It kept
in motion a trend largely started by the success of charismatic
female teams in the 1996 Olympics. From the gold-medal winning
softball team to the gold-medal winning basketball team to the 1998
gold-medal winning ice hockey team to the World Cup victors, the
beneficiaries of Title IX are dominating the international sports
scene, and, finally, the athletes are getting the attention they
felt they deserved all along. (Don't forget that NBC chose not to
broadcast live the inaugural Olympic women's soccer final in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   Messing and her committee of tournament executives took on the
naysayers and showed them a large-scale women's World Cup could be
a success. Saturday's Rose Bowl crowd was the largest ever to
witness a women's-only sports event. And at the time, the 78,972
fans that watched the tournament opener between the US and Denmark
was the largest ever. Soccer fans also flocked to matches that did
not feature the US. At Foxboro Stadium, 28,986 attended the
Independence Day semifinal between China and Norway. Now, the
challenge is to sustain the interest.

WHAT'S IN THE FUTURE FOR WOMEN'S SOCCER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now that the medals have been awarded and the 1999
FIFA Women's World Cup turned into the smashing success many behind
the effort predicted it would become, what will become of the
sport?
</P>
<P>
   For all the gains reaped the past three weeks in this country
and around the world, is women's soccer in America ready to take
the next logical step?
</P>
<P>
   That step, of course, would be the establishment of a women's
professional league, much the same way Major League Soccer grew out
of efforts from the 1994 men's World Cup held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the advent of a pro league is the ultimate goal, the
future also includes a deeper cultivation of the sport at the
grassroots level, something Marla Messing, President and CEO of the
Women's World Cup Organizing Committee, is sure will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to have a huge impact on women's soccer in
this country,'' Messing said. ``I think we will see hundreds and
thousands of girls register for soccer in the fall that wouldn't
have otherwise, but for this event. They want to be like Mia
(Hamm), they want to be like Julie (Foudy), they want to play in a
Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think the impact on the sport is going to be very
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But this impact won't happen simply because people want it to
happen. It will take much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take money like anything else,'' said U.S. team
veteran Joy Fawcett. ``People who love the sport, enjoy watching
it, they might end up having to lose money in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be what corporate America and any potential
sponsors of the league want to hear, but Fawcett speaks the truth.
Historically, start-up pro leagues tend to fail -- financially at
least -- at first before developing a core audience, which
ultimately could lead to success.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. assistant coach Lauren Gregg said establishing a league is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only a possibility, but it's a necessity for us to
stay successful in the world arena,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Team USA's players are hopeful of the signs pointing
toward a new league.
</P>
<P>
   But part of that process includes sustaining some momentum from
the success of this World Cup leading up to the 2000 Olympic Games
in Sydney, which will be held in September of that year. The talk
now is to have a pro league in place by the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to that point, the U.S. team might venture on a
victory tour of sorts across the country to keep that contact with
the public before Sydney, although nothing formally has been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of people who have been awakened to the
sport and have fallen in love with women's soccer,'' said U.S.
forward Tisha Venturini. ``We've got to try and keep the momentum
going this next year. We want to keep people involved and aware of
the sport, so after the Olympics we can start a league.''
</P>
<P>
   The parameters of the league, from the players' perspective, are
quite simple, relatively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, we definitely want to be able to make a living at it
so we don't have to play and then go and get a job,'' Fawcett said.
``But we're not looking for million-dollar salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy has her thoughts on what a women's
league would be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be something where everyone's getting paid, not a
semi-professional league,'' Foudy said. ``It's can't be something
where you only have national-team players getting paid. There would
be eight teams nationwide, in big markets, with a lot of names from
the national team to go behind it to draw for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference in favor of the women's game is that much
of the best soccer already is played here in the states. And
without the same support in other countries, a pro league here also
likely would attract many of the world's greatest stars, eager for
a chance to showcase their talents to an appreciative public.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said a pro league also would enhance possibilities for the
players beyond the current 20-member roster of the national team,
ultimately resulting in a deeper player pool overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other countries have much deeper player pools than we
do and I think a league will help us keep some of our elite players
that right now fall between our youth national team and our women's
team,'' Gregg said. ``Right now, they have to choose `Do I go into
another career or do I starve to stay a soccer player?' So a league
will serve a role.''
</P>
<P>
   But the players that figure to fuel the potential success of a
league know the road won't be an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's a hard road,'' Foudy said. ``A league is a much
different thing than a World Cup. We just hope we can get enough
interest out there. I think the fan base is there to put on a
first-class production.''
</P>
<P>
   Venturini agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you start something new, it's going to take awhile
and it's going to be a rocky road,'' Venturini said. ``It's not
going to be like we start this league and all of a sudden we're
fantastic and everybody comes. It's going to be a struggle and we
know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a success because of the players that we
have and there's a lot of great players out there coming out of
college that aren't on the national team that could help makes this
league. It's just a matter of keeping the people interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest was something that as recently as earlier this decade
couldn't be sustained. The contrast from even eight years ago is a
sharp one when the U.S. won the inaugural Women's World Cup in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to compare,'' U.S forward Mia Hamm said. ``In
'91, we played in anonymity and we won in anonymity. This year,
it's like ...''
</P>
<P>
   The attention, the crowds and the passion for this U.S. team
could be a sign that women's sports, in general, are ready to
explode in the next century. Or it just might mean that Americans
simply love big events, but will do little to sustain interest in a
fringe sport over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said without looking to the future, one
thing is clear in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is here whether you all as media think that it's an
American sport or not,'' DiCicco said. ``I can tell you that my
four sons grew up with it thinking it is an American sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only going to further ingrain itself into our culture and
into our society. And the women's side of the game is proving that
it is worthy of media attention, it's entertaining to watch, it's
skillful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's soccer and women's athletics are here to stay. We're
just scratching the surface.''

BOX OFFICE THUMB PULLS PLUMB IN `PIE'
</HEADLINE>

BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``American Pie'' captured the biggest slice of
business at the nation's multiplexes with a solid $18.1 million at
2,508 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period as the coming-of-age
comedy edged ``Wild Wild West,'' studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The victory for ``American Pie'' came amid this summer's
continued strong pace of moviegoing, with eight entries taking in
at least $7 million. ``It's impressive for `American Pie' to win
the weekend because most of the top 10 films are also geared to
teen-agers,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie,'' made for a bargain-basement $11 million
without major stars, benefited from strong reviews and a buzz of
anticipation that began several months ago. The movie, focusing on
a group of high school males who vow to lose their virginity, could
take in as much as $125 million for Universal by the end of its
run, according to Bucksbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not have asked for more from this tiny little
movie,'' said Universal distribution chief Nikki Rocco. ``Our exit
polls show huge across-the-board appeal and it should play well
throughout the rest of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences for ``American Pie'' were dominated by the target
customers, teens, who constituted 74 percent of all patrons for the
film. ``It's definitely going to cross over to date crowds and
older audiences,'' Bucksbaum said. ``The word of mouth on `American
Pie' is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Arthur Rockwell said Universal had been smart
to open ``Pie'' at a time when teen-age moviegoing is at its
heaviest. ``The studio has to be very happy to have performed this
well in such a strong marketplace,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of holdovers also aimed at teens and young adults
followed closely with Warner Bros.' second weekend of ``Wild Wild
West'' grossing $17.2 million at 3,342 theaters and Sony's third
weekend of ``Big Daddy'' with $16.3 million at 3,254 sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``West,'' as expected, lost 40 percent from the previous weekend
but is still performing solidly with nearly $77 million in a dozen
days while ``Big Daddy'' has topped $116 million in 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fourth weekend of ``Tarzan'' finished fourth with $11.3
million at 3,131 theaters with business dropping just 19 percent as
it continued to dominate the family market and push its total past
$129 million. `` `Tarzan' is really showing tremendous legs,''
Disney distribution head Chuck Viane said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fourth weekend of ``The General's Daughter''
followed with $8.1 million at 2,710 locations to pass $79 million
overall. The mystery-thriller is likely to join the $100 million
club by the end of summer, underscoring the success of the studio's
strategy of counter-programming against the youth-heavy slate.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's eighth weekend of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _
The Phantom Menace'' came in sixth with $7.7 million at 2,447
theaters, 181 fewer locations than last week, as the space saga
topped $385 million. ``Phantom Menace'' will probably pass ``E.T. _
The Extraterrestrial'' at $399.8 million for the No. 3 domestic
spot by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's opening of thriller ``Arlington Road,'' with Jeff Bridges
portraying a professor worried that his neighbors are terrorists,
performed in line with expectations in seventh with $7.4 million at
1,631 theaters, edging Paramount's second weekend of ``South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' with $7.1 million at 2,128 sites and New
Line's fifth weekend of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me''
with $6.5 million at 2,608 sites. The ``Austin Powers'' sequel has
topped $182 million, placing it 34th on the all-time list ahead of
``Liar, Liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's second weekend of ``Summer of Sam'' faded quickly in
10th with $3.4 million at 1,536 theaters, edging Universal's
seventh weekend of ``Notting Hill'' with $3.2 million at 1,579
sites to push its total to $103.3 million. The Julia Roberts comedy
has become the 190th movie of all time and the eighth released this
year to top the $100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Although the slate took in a respectable $115 million during the
weekend, it still trailed the same weekend of 1998, which was one
of the heaviest ever with a $34 million opening for ``Lethal Weapon
4.'' The total for 1999 has now hit $3.3 billion and is about 6
percent ahead of last year at the same point. ``Overall business
has been very solid,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend may also see strong traffic at multiplexes as
Warner Bros. opens the much-anticipated thriller ``Eyes Wide Shut''
with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubrick's final film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good timing to open `Eyes Wide Shut' now because
it's so different from everything else in the marketplace,'' said
Bucksbaum, who predicted an impressive opening weekend of $26
million to $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount will also open ``The Wood,'' a comedy-drama about
friends growing up in the Inglewood area, while Sony debuts
``Muppets From Space'' and Fox rolls out gator-on-the-loose
thriller ``Lake Placid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good diversity of new films, but `Lake Placid' is a
tough sell and it may get buried,'' Bucksbaum said.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros, bless their ravaged anatomy, are thriving on the
miseries of life; or at least, not losing any serious ground. This
is consistent with the team's new war cry, ``Things can always get
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, injuries are part of the game. All teams have them.
You take the bad breaks with the good. (Fill in your favorite
cliche.) A few can get sick of hearing and reading about injuries,
except the Astros have had their share of guys get sick, too.
</P>
<P>
   They have been playing without two starting infielders, their
best outfielder, two catchers, one utility player, one starter and
three relief pitchers. Joe Slusarski, rushed from the minors to
fill one of their vacancies, lasted a total of nearly four innings
before pulling a groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see that with only minor adjustments, the Astros
could field a team of disabled players, sponsored by their local
HMO. And for inspiration, they could call on manager Larry Dierker,
due back soon from brain surgery, and coaches Tom McCraw, battling
prostate cancer, and Jose Cruz, back after being sidelined with an
irregular heartbeat. The next addition to the coaching staff ought
to be a faith healer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the ailing Astros could throw away their crutches,
remove their casts and play, the season wouldn't seem nearly so
interesting. For sheer numbers, there has been nothing to compare
with it in Houston, and in the novelty category you have Moises
Alou, wrecking a knee by falling off a treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   The only development more puzzling than the Astros' epidemic of
injuries is how well they have coped with them. The Central
Division title is no longer theirs to win; it is theirs to throw
away, in sickness or in health.
</P>
<P>
   What do you suppose the odds would have been in April that the
Astros would reach the All-Star break in a virtual tie for first
place with a starting lineup that included Randy Knorr behind the
plate, Bill Spiers at third base, Tim Bogar at shortstop and Matt
Mieske in left? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   But here they are, having swept the Kansas City Royals on Sunday
7-3, with the shy, low-key Jose Lima collecting his 13th win. The
Astros might have the best starting pitching in the National
League, and maybe the defense most likely to make the timely,
sensational play. In Bullet Billy Wagner, they have the closer who
is guaranteed to mess up the bio-magnetic rhythms of opposing
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   You get a sense of how the Astros' pitching staff has gained
respect when you note that three of them _ Lima, Wagner and Mike
Hampton _ are going to the All-Star Game for the first time,
joining the semi-automatic Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio's absence is a bummer, but he doesn't need another
silver punch bowl to convince his peers of his value.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros did not exactly step aside and let the Cincinnati
Reds climb unchallenged back into the pennant race. The Reds earned
their place by winning 10 in a row and performing better on the
road than at home. But the Reds rely on their middle relief to
carry them, and teams that can't trust their starters, and do not
finish well, do not tend to improve under September pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the division remains bunched, the closest team being
seven games back, but none shows any evidence of the right stuff.
What appears to be going on is a tense and shifting battle for the
last four spots in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can beat teams in a variety of ways, and there is
always the prospect they will delight us with a new one. It is a
resourceful team, and a smart one.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting a 2-1 lead in the seventh, with one out and the
go-ahead runs at second and third, Lima struck out two batters
without throwing a strike. His pitches shimmy and shake so much, as
does Lima, that nervous hitters were swinging at pitches in the
dirt. As he crossed the foul line after the third out, Jose did a
graceful little leap, almost a pirouette.
</P>
<P>
   You could hear the grinding of molars in opposing dugouts all
over America. But Lima is clearly the Astros' most colorful pitcher
since the heyday of Good Time Charley Kerfeld, who once failed to
get the money he wanted from the Astros but consoled himself by
holding out for 12 cases of orange Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros broke open the game with a five-run salvo
in the eighth. KC's Jermaine Dye misplayed Carl Everett's sinking
liner, made a desperate dive and saw the ball ricochet off the heel
of his glove and roll dead about 20 feet away. When the Royals
managed to get the ball back into the infield, they found two
Astros almost standing on second, a sight so confusing the second
baseman dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Astros were making mad dashes everywhere, and with plays at
third base and home, the Royals threw late to third and everyone
was safe. This is part luck and part improvisation. This is how a
damaged team wins, the best cure invented for whatever ails you.

STEWART'S LUCK (AND GAS) RUNS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 LUBE 300-STEWART-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Tony Stewart's been here, done this. In just
slightly different fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a fast-running Winston Cup rookie, raced several times
at New Hampshire International in the Indy Racing League. In 1996,
the IRL race was his to win. Less than 20 laps to go and he led by
a couple of laps. And then his engine broke.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Stewart had the field covered again in his first trip
here as a NASCAR Winston Cup driver. He came out of the pits in
front with just over 100 laps to go in the Jiffy Lube 300 and
clearly was the class of the field.
</P>
<P>
   He held off Dale Jarrett and then Jeff Burton and now there were
less than 20 laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   And then Stewart, with crew chief Greg Zipadelli calling the
shots, gambled. While Jeff Gordon, Jarrett, Burton and most of the
frontrunners slipped into the pits for a splash of gas, Stewart
stayed on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Zipadelli took the information he had from his fuel mileage
people and took a calculated risk.
</P>
<P>
   And lost.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart ran out of gas, sputtered down the backstretch on Lap
298, and had to limp into the pits to get enough fuel to finish.
Burton took full fuel advantage and zipped to his third straight
Jiffy Lube 300 win.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finished 10th after a last-lap run-in with Ernie Irvan
and quickly departed the grounds without a word.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan said Stewart ran into him on the last lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he was mad at me or something, I don't know,'' Irvan
said. ``Tony's all right. I'd be pretty upset, too. He was going to
have his first Winston Cup win and it didn't happen. It's just part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zipadelli, who is from Berlin, Conn., and cut his racing teeth
in New England, held court outside The Home Depot hauler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great car,'' Zipadelli said. ``I feel like I let the
team down. We all make mistakes and we've made mistakes all year.
Today just feels like the biggest one.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news was the Joe Gibbs team had Stewart's car running
great and collected its 10th Top 10 finish of the year, maintained
its sixth spot in the points standings, and continued to run away
with the Rookie of the Year race.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's a Cup rookie driver with a Cup rookie crew chief, but
it's definitely a team on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   Which didn't make Sunday's end result sit any better.
</P>
<P>
   There was no second-guessing on the sidelines, said Gibbs, the
former National Football League coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made and everyone felt it was our best
shot,'' he said. ``We just didn't get it. It's hard to predict.
You're trying to guess what's going to happen with a mechanical
engine.''
</P>
<P>
   He never dared, Gibbs said, to think of what might be as the end
of the race neared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried the whole time,'' Gibbs said. ``Like everyone
else, I was holding my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters in the decision was that Kenny Wallace and
Bill Elliott and a couple of others had pitted at about Lap 208 and
thus were able to stretch their mileage and did not need to come in
for gas. Wallace managed to slip into second place and Elliott was
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart takes his 10th and moves on to Pocono in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was probably going to be a half-a-lap gamble,''
Zipadelli said. ``It showed up to be bigger than that. We thought
we were conserving more fuel throughout the whole run than we had
previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just one of those stumbling blocks,'' he said. ``I
guess we shouldn't take chances like that. We ended up with a Top
10 after going for it. We'll just have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting at Pocono.

WOMEN ON WORSHIPFUL WAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe you bounded out of bed early enough Sunday
to catch U.S. defender Brandi Chastain on the television program
``Meet the Press.'' Your Women's World Cup hangover permitting, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain isn't the only member of the winning women's World Cup
team to go where politicians usually tread, merely the first. These
next few days you can count on seeing almost as much of the U.S.
team as you did of Chastain when she stripped down to her sports
bra after Saturday's glorious finish to the third Women's World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Chastain's penalty kick settled in the back of
China's goal than the requests started pouring in. National news
weeklies needed access to the players for cover stories. So did at
least one national entertainment weekly.
</P>
<P>
   And every television talk show from morning to late night was
clamoring for the shiny, happy faces of U.S. soccer's summer
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   It is an awesome wave the U.S. players are riding right now.
Whether it tails off next week or continues building through the
Sydney Olympics next year, this much seems certain: there are more
waves gathering force behind them.
</P>
<P>
   If the thundering reception given the Women's World Cup in this
country proves anything it's that there never has been a better
time to be strong and athletic and female.
</P>
<P>
   In a society that has made no secret of its obsession with
people skinny and frail and female, the Venus worship of these
women of style AND substance is empowering, encouraging, ennobling.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the World Cup. Tomorrow, the White House? You'll have to
forgive women right now for feeling no goal is out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   Americans are a proud and patriotic people. We might not always
vote in numbers too great too ignore, but the roar that drowned out
the final bar of the U.S. anthem before Saturday's title match bore
testimony to our national spirit.
</P>
<P>
   We embraced the Women's World Cup out of love for our country.
It wasn't just our affection for soccer or the amiable U.S. players
that drew us in.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been only about the soccer, the enlightened crowd at
the Rose Bowl would have invested more emotion in Saturday's
third-place match between Brazil and Norway. The crowd of 90,185
looked on with interest but not much intensity as Brazil prevailed
on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, Briana Scurry, Mia Hamm and Company without the USA on
their chests would be like a penalty kick showdown to decide a
championship minus Michelle Akers. It's entertaining, but you can't
help feeling there's some spark missing.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the idea of a barnstorming tour between now and the
Sydney Olympics appeals to us. Why not pit the U.S. women against
foreign teams in friendlies in venues other than the ones they
brought to life during the World Cup?
</P>
<P>
   There's only one way to spread the gospel and that's by reaching
out to the masses. Which brings us to the recognized savior of the
sport, Hamm. The star striker was nailed to the cross during the
World Cup by a few people within U.S. Soccer for stubbornly putting
the tournament ahead of the hype.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve of her, forgoing opportunities to promote her recently
published book and declining invitations to appear on television
talk shows and magazine covers, just so she could concentrate on
beating Nigeria and Brazil and China!
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   In another era, people would have written songs lauding Hamm's
humility. Her reluctance to hog the spotlight would have been seen
as her greatest strength, not a glaring shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   And now? It's all about athletes posing like it's 1999.
Self-effacement is nice, but self-promotion sells. It's nice if you
can undress the competition with your silky moves, but if you bare
your bra after a score or pose nude for a magazine, so much the
better.
</P>
<P>
   Before U.S. Soccer officials dare to come down on Hamm for not
properly promoting her sport, they should consider this: By
refusing to hog the spotlight she gave many of her teammates 15
minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamm wouldn't go on David Letterman, Chastain went in her
place and charmed the smug grin off the late-night talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamm declined to talk to reporters, it gave us no choice
but to get to know her teammates better and share their stories
with the public.
</P>
<P>
   It's great when a sport's biggest star feels comfortable serving
as its lead ambassador, but not everybody is blessed with the
personality of a Wayne Gretzky or a Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The growing media throng has backed athletes today into an
impossibly tight corner. If they actively seek the spotlight, they
are criticized for putting themselves above the team. If they shun
the spotlight, they are called aloof and worse
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, because there are far worse things than watching
Chastain parry with the pundits. Like China's goaltender Gao Hong
and the penalty kicks, they are seriously overmatched.

RACE A NEW BALLGAME FOR TEDDY 
</HEADLINE>
 LUBE 300-WILLIAMS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ He slipped out of the state trooper-green Chevy
and onto the start-finish line of the Jiffy Lube 300 to the cheers
of yet another crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand tall, Ted Williams, stand tall,'' yelled one fan along
the fence at New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, grand hitter of baseballs and grand marshal for
this NASCAR Winston Cup auto race, did just that.
</P>
<P>
   He puffed up his chest and with a big smile met his fans. He
took a breath and said into a microphone for 90,000 race watchers
to hear: ``Gentlemen, start your engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes earlier, Williams had been introduced to a loud
ovation, took a seat, and then shook hands with each of the 43
drivers as they were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the gentlemen started their engines, Williams was
on the other side of the fence and high above trackside for a
television interview with racing announcer Eli Gold. But before
that, his son John Henry took him to the edge of the track for an
up-close-as-you-can-get racing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was enough for me right there,'' Williams said. ``I was
starting to back up.''
</P>
<P>
   He only had seen racing on television, but he could, Williams
said, become a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be right there, when they're going VROOOM,'' he said.
``Boy, it reminds me of when I saw John Glenn go up on his shot.
When you're there and you see that. I'd never seen anything like
this before today.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd impressed him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder where all these people come from,'' he said. ``Boy,
oh boy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he chatted briefly with Kyle Petty as they posed and
shook hands during the introductions and told him how overwhelming
the event was.
</P>
<P>
   And he talked of meeting young Busch North driver Kenny White
the day before. Through a connection made by longtime Williams
friend Dave McCarthy, a New Hampshire State Police major, White's
No. 9 race car is sponsored by the Ted Williams memorabilia
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about what I was going to say to that little
boy,'' Williams said. ``My first inclination was to say to be
careful. Then Ithought I'd tell him to do 10 races and I'd come
see the 11th.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, it seemed, a little nervous about the whole racing
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Williams came to New Hampshire Saturday, attended the grand
marshal's dinner that night, and Sunday was headed back to Boston
for All-Star Game festivities.

WOODRUFF GETS KICK BY BEATING CARLSEN 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ You can find any number of cleated scholars
majoring in field goal at the University of Tennessee, and earning
their keep that way. So why would Christopher ``Country'' Woodruff,
winner of the NCAA tennis title for his hometown college in 1993,
get the idea that he could do it, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just foolin' around,'' says Woodruff, who comes from Knoxville
and ended a two-year drought Sunday by seizing the Hall of Fame
title over Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4, on the
Casino lawn.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't really pictured himself returning to campus as a
football hero a couple of years ago, but fooling around kicking
field goals with a pal nearly got him booted out of tennis for
good. ``My sneaker caught in the ground as I kicked and my left
knee got twisted,'' he says. ``I knew it was bad. Torn cartilage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough to curtail a career that was getting hot in 1997 when
he beat Andre Agassi at the French, won the Canadian Open over Guga
Kuerten, and finished at No. 30. Surgery and a troubled,
longer-than-anticipated recovery dropped him to No. 1,559 in the
rankings as he began the long way back this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great to get back into the top 100,'' says the
willowy 6-foot-2-inch Tennessean. He arrived in town at No. 116 _
the low man on the champions' totem pole this season _ and departed
No. 90.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff's forehand and long legs pulled him through a
serve-and-volleying duet with enough nimble shotmaking to keep a
sun-and-sea breeze-coddled crowd of 3,400 absorbed for 2:18.
</P>
<P>
   Among them a small platoon of Danes in viking-horned helmets and
flapping the country's white-crossed red flag was delighted as its
man, No. 109 Carlsen, progressed to a 4-3 lead in the second. As
the lone Dane to win a pro title (Hong Kong, last year), Carlsen, a
bony 6-4, was making his way nicely with net-skimming backhand
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly Woodruff's serve and forehand passers on the run began
to bite harder. The Tennessean, called ``Country'' by his fellows
because he's so down-home relaxed, went on a seven-game toot to 4-0
in the third, threatening to run the table as Carlsen wiggled out
of four breakers to 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   Then it got too tight and exciting _ temporarily _ for Woodruff.
With a service winner Carlsen averted a match point, got to 2-5,
broke Woodruff despite two more match points, and, at 5-4, clubbed
Country into almost another loss of serve: 0-40 and four break
points.
</P>
<P>
   However Woodruff calmed himself to serve big, make the volleys.
He whewed as the last shot of the match, Carlsen's passing backhand
was ``golly, long by a Tennesee inch, and that ain't big.''

RUMBLE AT THE RAVINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are two ways to view the The Rumble in the
Ravine on Sunday between the Dodgers and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   You could check the videotape of a fight that had more punches
than most Don King or Bob Arum promotions and surmise that the Los
Angeles Dodgers might have found a personality during its
15-minute, sixth-inning, wall-to-wall roll in the dirt with the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could wind up being nothing more than a spat at
recess between two frustrated flyweights.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of the tape supports the latter view. Seattle, armed
with two candidates for the first $20 million-a-year contract in
baseball, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, is three games under
.500 at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have won four straight for the first time since a
five-game winning streak at the end of April, but they will pause
eight games under at 39-47, last in the NL West, and 10 games
behind the Giants. So it all could wind up being nothing more than
great SportsCenter video.
</P>
<P>
   But in a season short on good vibes, most of the Dodgers were
willing to consider the brawl a potential bonding agent, especially
since they also won the game 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Trenidad Hubbard, whose three-run double in
the sixth preceded the brawl and in turn led to his major-league
debut as a catcher. ``Something like this can definitely bring a
team together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You always stick up for your teammates,'' said Dodgers
reliever Pedro Borbon, one of three Dodgers ejected for his role in
the fight, ``especially when you see three guys ganging up on one
and so many sucker punches.''
</P>
<P>
   As brawls go, this one had stamina.
</P>
<P>
   After Hubbard's bases-loaded double made it 12-3, Seattle
reliever Francisco Rodriquez ran a fastball up and in to Mark
Grudzielanek. The Dodgers shortstop took a few steps to the mound
and extended his arms in a what's-up gesture. Rodriquez barked a
few epithets back, took two steps toward the plate, and everyone
ran for the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   The players milled around for about 30 seconds, and it appeared
it might end there. But two Mariners relievers, Jose Paniagua and
Damaso Marte, late arrivals from the bullpen, jump-started the
fracas by jumping Dodgers catcher Angel Pena.
</P>
<P>
   That set off several brush fires. Todd Hundley took off after
Marte after seeing Gary Sheffield get sucker-punched. When two
Mariners grabbed Hundley, Marte then reached over and
sucker-punched Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Dempsey finally wrestled Marte to the ground, where
Dodgers reliever Jamie Arnold righteously avenged the sucker
punches. ``I wasn't trying to escalate things,'' said Dempsey.
``But someone had to take Marte down.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Todd Hollandsworth was on the wrong end of a pile in
front of the Mariners dugout. Borbon pushed Paniagua out of the
fracas, only for Jay Buhner to jump in and throw a headlock on
Borbon. ``That wasn't me,'' Buhner told Seattle writers. ``It was
Steve Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have walked away,'' said Borbon. ``But when you get
hit, you hit back. And we're a family. Hit my teammate, it's like
hitting my brother or my children.''
</P>
<P>
   On the grass behind second base, Devon White and David Segui did
their best to keep the fight going. White eventually gave up the
chase, but after the field had been cleared, Sequi started running
his mouth again and players again ran onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this can pull a team together,'' said Dempsey.
``We finally had a good series and I think this will have a
beneficial effect for us after the break.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson acknowledged some residual value, but he
was more concerned about the down side. Pena hurt his left forearm
in the fracas, Dave Hansen needed a stitch to close a cut in the
little finger of his right hand, and Hundley twisted a knee.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, Dempsey and Borbon were ejected, and suspensions are
likely to follow. The loss of Hundley and Pena forced Hubbard
behind the plate. Seattle infielder Charles Gipson also suffered a
separated shoulder, and Brian Hunter, who wore a footprint on the
back of his jersey, hyperextended his knee. Marte, Paniagua, Buhner
and Jose Mesa were the Mariners ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers, this wouldn't have happened,'' said
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson. ``You don't want to see anyone get
hurt in a fight, and Pena may be hurt bad, at a time when he was
starting to take charge (defensively) and picking up at bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pena had a full day. He was 3 for 3 with a walk,
including his second home run of the season, and he scored four
times, once when he tagged and rambled home on a popup to shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, who stumbled and fell backward making the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Pena's Cadillac trot and pelvic thrust after that home run,
according to some Mariners, was at least partially responsible for
the fracas.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the who, when and how, the Dodgers will at least
spend the next three days feeling they're on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends,'' said Eric Karros. ``If we go on and play well, I
think people will look back at this as a key moment. But we've been
in this position before, when things have happened and people said
`they're ready to take off.'''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, they're ready for the WWF.

SPARKS COOL MERCURY

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks let their defense do
the work, returning to the win column with a 67-58 victory over
Phoenix on Sunday in front of 6,392 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sparks' seventh win in their past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   DeLisha Milton led Los Angeles with 14 points, eight rebounds
and three steals, but more importantly held the Mercury's top
scorer, Jennifer Gillom, to only 11 points on 3-of-14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeLisha is one of the best forwards I've seen,'' Sparks coach
Orlando Woolridge said. ``Her defensive effort was probably the key
for us today.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed 29-26 at the half, but were close unlike
their previous slow start, which ended in a loss to Sacramento on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as promised, Woolridge implemented a new lineup, with
La'Keisha Frett and Gordana Grubin replacing Penny Toler and
Tamecka Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   The change proved effective, particularly with the 6-foot-3
Frett creating mismatches for Phoenix. She had eight points, seven
rebounds and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   Her game has improved recently, which justified her move to the
starting position. As far as starting, Frett said it doesn't
matter, just as long as the team wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think of it as coming off the bench earlier,'' said
Frett, who blamed tendinitis in her left knee for her slow start
this season. ``I just go out there and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   With both teams struggling offensively, the game turned into a
defensive battle with the Sparks taking control in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   After Bridgett Pettis hit two consecutive 3-pointers for the
Mercury, Lisa Leslie scored to give the Sparks (10-5) the lead for
good at 44-42 with 9:16 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (3-10) pulled within 55-54, but the Sparks held on with
Toler converting five of her six free throws in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made key plays down the stretch and they shot the ball,''
said Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller, on crutches with a tendon tear.
``They made the touchdowns that they needed to.''

RICE ANSWERS THE CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHALLENGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There were familiar chants of ``Loo-wee, Loo-wee,'' for
Luis Tiant, who threw out the first ball at Sunday's All-Star
Futures Game at Fenway Park, and ``Dew-ey, Dew-ey,'' for Dwight
Evans as he stepped into the batter's box for the Celebrity Hitting
Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jim Rice, who tattooed the left-field wall and also
dented a Boston Police cruiser parked on the street beyond the wall
during the hitting contest, who really turned on the crowd on
All-Star Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox hitting instructor sent two shots over the screen
atop the Green Monster and another into the net to lead his
``Yawkeys'' team (with actor Matt Damon and Dodgers great Steve
Garvey) to victory _ and one of his drives had a harried Boston
Police sergeant racing into the park to fill out the damage report
for the bruised cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Rice, Fred Lynn (around Pesky's Pole), and Andre
Dawson all cleared the yard and local favorite Doug Flutie looked
as comfortable with the bat as he does throwing a football.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nostalgic and impressive afternoon for Rice, who was
also joined in the contest by former major leaguers Alan Trammell,
Rico Petrocelli, and George Brett as well as Jim Lonborg, who
tossed a few pitches and didn't appear any the worse for wear.
Actors Kevin Costner and Mark Harmon filled out the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was different. It brought back a lot of memories,'' said
Rice, who joked in the post-contest press conference to Garvey, ``I
forgot, are you a legend or an old-timer?''
</P>
<P>
   Once among the most feared power hitters in baseball, Rice,
whose 14 swings produced a variety of deep shots and line drives,
said he hadn't had much time to polish his hitting. But based on
Sunday's display, he didn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took batting practice early in the year maybe six times. It
was fun. But my job is to be the hitting instructor for the Boston
Red Sox,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey was impressed with Rice's staying power even before the
contest _ in the center-field batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was crushing the ball,'' said Garvey. ``I looked at him
and he had the donut on the end of his bat and that's impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge native Damon couldn't resist after that: ``Actually,
we had batting practice with me clinging to his (Rice's) back, so
he could practice carrying me when he swung.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who hit .298 over 16 seasons (1974-89) and was American
League MVP in 1978 when he had more than 400 total bases, said the
ovation he received when he strode into the batter's box and his
name was announced ``brought back a lot of memories. It reminded me
of the '78 season with our great hitting lineup. We'd be down in
the seventh or eighth innings, but no one left the park because
they knew we could explode at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he was introduced as ``a future Hall of Famer,'' Rice,
who hasn't yet been voted into Cooperstown (he ranks 31st all-time
in home runs), said that ``there's no point getting upset about it.
It's like spilling a glass of milk. There's nothing you can do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees farmhand Alfonso Soriano did his best to emulate Rice
during the Futures Game, which pitted a United States team of top
minor leaguers against a World Team. Soriano, a shortstop on the
Yankees' Norwich Double A farm team, crushed a pair of home runs
over the Green Monster to pace a 7-0 World victory and earn MVP
honors.
</P>
<P>
   Two Red Sox prospects, pitchers Tomokazu Ohka (Triple A
Pawtucket) and Sun-Woo Kim (Double A Trenton), worked successive
(first and second) innings for the World squad, with the latter
getting credit for the win. And former Red Sox farmhand Tony Armas
Jr., traded to Boston for Mike Stanley and then by the Red Sox to
Montreal in the Pedro Martinez deal, also went unscathed in an
inning of work.

OTHERS WATCHING CLOSELY MICROSOFT'S SAGA WITH TEMP WORKERS,
LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft has improved benefits for the contract
workers who make up a third of its Puget Sound area work force.
</P>
<P>
   But the workers' ongoing discontent _ along with two potentially
expensive lawsuits _ may compel the Redmond software maker to
eliminate or restructure this labor source.
</P>
<P>
   The change could cause reverberations nationwide in the software
industry and other businesses needing a work force that can grow or
shrink to match product life cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of perma-temping at Microsoft could be very near,''
said Marcus Courtney, co-founder of the Washington Alliance of
Technical Workers (Washtech), a labor organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is a legal ruling in a federal lawsuit called
Vizcaino vs. Microsoft. In it, a federal judge ruled that as many
as 10,000 current and former temporary workers at Microsoft are
eligible for appreciation on stock they should have been allowed to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit ``could undermine the entire information economy,''
forcing companies using temps to find some alternative and
companies providing temps to restructure or fold, said Harris
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one worried.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Irvine, president of the local chapter of the National
Technical Services Association, which represents 300 providers of
temporary technical workers nationwide, said members are concerned
their customers ``might be afraid of falling into the same
situation as Microsoft.'' Formerly reliable tests for determining
who should legally be considered a worker's employer ``might work
one day and not the next'' because of the Vizcaino suit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal legislation is pending that may also affect the
temporary-worker industry, noted Toby Malara, the association's
director of government public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temporary agencies have come to the forefront'' in
Washington, D.C., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what form of employment would replace temping and what
would become of the 5,500 to 6,500 temporary workers now in place
at Microsoft, remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are evaluating our options, and we hope that we will always
have the option to engage individuals in a temporary capacity to
address the needs of a rapidly changing high-tech economy,'' said
Sharon Decker, Microsoft's director of contingent staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft is trying to do right by its temps, agreed
five of the six temporary workers interviewed for this story. They
said their work lives have improved since early May, when newly
negotiated contracts went into effect between Microsoft and the 15
principal agencies that supply it with temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest software company told agencies that if they
wanted to continue to do business with Microsoft after May, they
would need to offer benefits including:
</P>
<P>
   _13 paid days off a year, whether as sick leave, compensatory
time, paid vacation or some other form.
</P>
<P>
   _Medical and dental insurance, for which the agency pays half.
</P>
<P>
   _Vocational training worth at least $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _A retirement savings program with some matching by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also reduced, to 15 from more than 100, the number of
agencies with which it contracts for temps, so it could more
closely supervise their benefits offerings. Agencies subcontracting
to those 15 principal agencies would be expected to offer the same
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Five agencies or subcontractors surveyed last week said their
benefits meet or beat Microsoft's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;T Onsite, a Seattle supplier of designers and writers, said it
has increased its IRA contribution rate to 20 percent from 15
percent of pretax earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Volt Computer Services of Redmond, which furnishes software
testers, reported it offers an extra two days vacation annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Write Stuff Inc., a Seattle supplier of communications
workers, said it meets or exceeds Microsoft's requirements and
sends a masseuse to its employees twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   BENEFITS AT OR ABOVE the minimum levels were also reported by
Kelly Services Inc., a Troy, Mich., supplier of administrative
workers, and by H.L. Yoh Co. LLC, a Philadelphia supplier of
testers.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how those benefits are implemented is left to the
agencies, and that means they can choose to offer only the bare
minimums. So some agencies may offer health insurance to
individuals, but not to their families. And the vocational training
offered by some agencies may not go beyond the skill area in which
each temp's job falls.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Lewis, who has worked under contracts at Microsoft for four
years, mostly as a lab engineer, said, ``I would say my personal
situation is not better now than it was on May 2. I get $82 toward
personal medical premiums but none for my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is 40 and the single mother of a 12-year-old, added,
``As a parent, I could use a lot more flex time than the 13 days
per year we get.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft-engineered competition among agencies was supposed to
result in even greater benefits to temps. But the workers are still
chafing under contracts forbidding them from switching from one
agency to another during an assignment. Washtech wants these
provisions eliminated, saying they reduce the choices workers have
among agencies and thereby diminish the agencies' incentives to
compete to offer better benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Volt and Yoh said they won't ax the provisions
because they are too important to the agencies' stability.
Microsoft said it can't force them to.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the improved benefits, many Microsoft temps say they
continue to feel like second-class citizens. Distinctions between
Microsoft employees and the temps, such as different colored ID
badges and e-mail addresses, add to that feeling, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel like I'm set apart because of subtle things,''
like being on separate distribution lists for important documents
and having to get a manager's permission to attend a briefing that
full-time, permanent employees can go to without a second thought,
said Ed Campodonico, who will have been a Microsoft temp for three
consecutive years in October.
</P>
<P>
   And whether they represent policy or are merely careless,
remarks like those by Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei last
month create _ or reflect _ a stigma attached to temps.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said at a meeting of accountants, ``The quality of the
temps is not as good as the quality of the full-time people. ... We
wouldn't necessarily have said we want them for full time.''
</P>
<P>
   He later apologized for and withdrew the statement.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the benefits temps are getting aren't
even close to what Microsoft offers its own employees. On its Web
site, Microsoft brags it offers ``more perks than Seattle has
coffeehouses.''
</P>
<P>
   For employees and their families, including same-sex domestic
partners, Microsoft covers 100 percent of medical, dental and
vision insurance premiums. It offers optional life insurance of up
to $750,000, a group legal plan and pretax deductions for day care
and elder care expenses and health care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) plan allows deferring 15 percent of pre-tax salary,
plus an additional 7 percent after taxes. Contributions are matched
50 percent, up to 6 percent of the employee's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also offers paid maternity and infant-care leave,
financial adoption assistance, personal and family counseling,
health club memberships, matching charitable deductions and
personalized ergonomics consultation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether it's fair that Microsoft employees get
benefits so much richer than those of temporary workers, spokesman
Dan Leach said: ``If you're interested in Microsoft benefits, there
are 2,000 jobs that anyone qualified should apply for.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not that simple. Applying for staff jobs was eased by
Microsoft's May declaration that it would disregard non-compete
clauses forbidding agency employees from becoming Microsoft
employees. Still, it's not necessarily easy to ``convert'' from one
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a full-time job was a grueling process,'' said one
worker who just converted. ``I practically fell into my contracting
job.''
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT AND THE temps seem to be forever at odds. The company
maintains that contract workers make more in wages than its
employees and have more flexible schedules. Temporary workers argue
that they don't make more in wages, that even if they do, their
expenses are higher and that their flexibility is limited by
Microsoft's mandatory one-month time-off periods and by their
agencies' non-compete clauses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of fairness, said David Stobaugh, an attorney in
the Vizcaino suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are truly `temps,' working for a few weeks or
months, fine. But these people aren't temps,'' he said. ``It's easy
to justify treating people differently when you call them something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the lawsuits will undoubtedly affect the
company's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In Vizcaino, the full appellate court most recently refused
Microsoft's petition to rehear a decision in favor of the temps
rendered by a three-judge panel of the court. Now Microsoft will
likely either seek review in the U.S. Supreme Court or face the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Once Vizcaino is resolved, it may be unnecessary to litigate
Hughes vs. Microsoft, a related case seeking back insurance
benefits for the same plaintiffs, Stobaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Vizcaino court) basically told Microsoft they have to
stop pretending these people aren't employees,'' he said. ``And
once they are employees for one purpose, they're employees for
every purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution Microsoft may be considering is expanding its own
work force to create a pool of employees who will move from one
project to another as needed.
</P>
<P>
   If that were cost-effective at current salary levels, it
probably would already have been done. So it may be significant
that in mid-May, Microsoft said it would increase the number of
non-executive job classification levels to 22 from 12. Perhaps it
is preparing to create a floating corps of differently compensated
workers, Washtech's Courtney suggested.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype corps member may be one woman who came to Microsoft
several months ago as a Grade 8. She's a Microsoft employee,
wearing a blue badge, getting full benefits and eligible to
participate in the discounted stock purchase plan, just like any
other Microsoft worker. But she's paid by the hour and hasn't yet
received any stock options, unlike most Microsoft employees, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an employee, but I'm not treated like all the other
employees,'' said the woman, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Though not a temp, she wonders whether she's being treated
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end? asked worker Lisa Lewis. ``Something's got to
give,'' she said. ``What, I don't know.''

ONE BIG GOAL FOR WOMANKIND
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  All over San Francisco on Saturday afternoon, exasperated men
who wanted to do some shopping were being dragged off the sidewalks
and into smoky bars so their wives and girlfriends could find a TV
and watch a damn ballgame.
<P>
   We guys will never understand why, on a perfectly beautiful
summer day, you gals would choose to be inside, eating junk food
and watching sports.
</P>
<P>
   This female bonding, frankly, we guys just watch it and shake
our heads at the silliness.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened Saturday. Some of us manly men
noticed that the USA soccer girls are kind of cute, and we watched
and got sucked in to the whole spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the kickoff, I was loudly criticizing the
strategy of the coaches and shouting instructions to the USA
players. Geezus, girlfriend, after you pass, break for the goal!''
</P>
<P>
   And this was the first soccer game I'd ever watched.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over _ and it ain't over 'til the fat man
(Pavarotti? Meat Loaf?) sings _ my newspaper instincts kicked in
and I wrote a headline:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hamm on Rye, &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Hold the Mao, &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; With a Shot of Brandi &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the girls have a lot to learn. When Brandi Chastain was
interviewed on TV after her game-winning penalty kick, she froze up
and forgot to snarl and say, ``Everybody wrote us off. The fans and
media said we suck, but we proved everybody wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   That's what you're supposed to say. That's what guys always say
after they win a championship. They're pissed. Or they threaten to
boycott the medal presentation ceremony because they're not allowed
to wear their shoe company's logo. Or they threaten that they won't
be back next year unless they get a better contract.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi was way clueless. She didn't give us one decent winner's
cliche. She spewed out something spontaneous and happy and
inspiring, acknowledging her teammates, the fans, summing up all
the event's impact and cool-ness in a few sentences. I felt so damn
sorry for Brandi not knowing how to act like a boorish winner that
my eyes puddled up.
</P>
<P>
   I would say the entire event, the World Cup and the United
States beating China in front of a zillion fans, was a great moment
for women and athletics, but I know that can't be true, because
President Clinton said it was a great moment for women and
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   My wife was at a workout place, and the women gathered around a
locker-room TV to watch the finish. Kathy says all the women were
crying. Well, sure, they're not used to the cigar smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy heard one woman say, ``As a kid, I could never be anything
but a cheerleader. I've got two little girls . . .'' And there's
the scary part, folks: We're looking at a generation coming up
where it's going to be hard to put together a decent cheerleading
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how far women have come: Before Saturday, the most
dramatic and inspiring moment in women's sports history was
probably the finish of the 1984 Olympics marathon in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time women were allowed to run the marathon in
the Olympics; it took them 88 years to convince Olympics officials
that women can run 26 miles without ruining their mascara. Twenty
minutes after the winner breezed into the Coliseum, a 39-year-old
runner staggered in as if she'd been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriele Andersen-Scheiss, suffering from heat exhaustion,
seemingly near death, seriously, took almost six minutes to run
that last quarter-mile.
</P>
<P>
   She spun, lurched, momentarily passed out on her feet and
finally fell on her face across the finish line. Not exactly
poetry, but proof: Women athletes ain't no sissies.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I swear, my favorite uncrowded jogging path was
stampeded by women runners.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, our girls kept getting knocked down and kicked around,
but they kept getting up, and did they look good? I mean athletic
good. They reminded me of a classic piece of sports commentary,
from the glory days of the basketball Lakers. Warriors center
Clifford Ray was asked what he thought of the wild-running Lakers.
He shook his head slowly and said, ``Legs, legs, legs.''
</P>
<P>
   I had a problem watching Saturday's game on TV. With no
commercials, I didn't know which beer to drink. And the announcers
were so straightforward and informative that I wondered why they
didn't prattle and overanalyze and ass-kiss and lame-joke like the
announcers do on men's sports events. It was disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game (is it called a game? match? tilt?), Mia Hamm
got loose and was flying toward the Chinese goal, and the announcer
screamed out a warning, ``Here's Mia!!!'' It was as chilling as
such calls as ``Here's Jordan to the hoop!'' or ``In the bullpen,
Eckersley is taking off his jacket!''
</P>
<P>
   As I drove over to pick up my wife at her workout place, I was
wondering if the big U.S. win would have any lasting impact. There
was some kind of road work blocking my way, a detour. Maybe I could
sneak through. Nope, a cop coldly turned me away. Man, I hate it
when I get Scurried.

 NEWS &AMP; FEATURE SUMMARY No. 2556 -- July 12, 1999 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. INSTANT COMPANY Not so long ago, it seemed incredible that a
Web company could be born in a mere two years. But rather than
going back to normal, the pace of creation in Silicon Valley now
seems to be speeding up even more. Any Web company that starts out
today and takes two years to get up and running is likely to be
left in the dust. By Po Bronson. From The New York Times Magazine.
Full-length (3,500 words) + edited article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
THE LITTLE WHITE BOMBSHELL Manufactured in secret and taken in the
privacy of a doctor's office, RU-486 will leave the abortion war
without a battleground - and perhaps with a peace treaty in sight.
By Margaret Talbot. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length
(7,600 words) + edited article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
THE COLOUR OF SUSPICION The way cops perceive blacks - and how
those perceptions shape and misshape crime fighting - is now the
most charged racial issue in America. From the front seat of a
police cruiser, racial profiling is not racism, it is a tool, and
cops have no intention of giving it up. By Jeffrey Goldberg. From
The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (8,600 words) + edited
article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
EVEN I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD PITCH THAT GOOD Country music legend
Kenny Rogers, whose current hit is ``The Greatest,'' (a simple song
about a boy, a ball and a bat,) has written a special essay about
the lessons that baseball teaches young and old. ``The Greatest''
captures that moment in every kid's life when the game is more
important than the score. It goes beyond music and baseball. It's
about life.'' By Kenny Rogers. 1,000 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
COLOMBIAN CRISES Colombia is worse off in many ways than it was a
decade ago. The country's violent forces - left-wing insurgents and
right-wing militias - have never been better armed and financed or
held more territory. Colombia's drug economy, with its pernicious
effects, is as pervasive as ever. And the government is running out
of options. By Michael Shifter. From Foreign Affairs Magazine.
1,500 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
MEXICAN NIGHTMARES As Mexico City sinks beneath a wave of crime,
the provinces smolder and drug lords send corruption creeping
through the establishment, Mexico's rulers seem more interested in
fighting one another than their common enemies. For the country to
survive as a democracy, this will have to change - and soon. By M.
Delal Baer. From Foreign Affairs Magazine. 1,800 words.

   A. New Tactic For Tuberculosis Treatment Tuberculosis continues
to infect a third to a half of the world's population. Whereas most
people who carry the bacterium do not get sick, three million
people still die from the disease each year. The current vaccine is
not very effective. Researchers have now found some success with an
experimental genetic vaccine against TB. By Hannah Wunsch. 600
words. (Embargo 19h00 BST Wednesday July 14.)

   B. Infertility Passed From Father To Son A specific cause of
male infertility - a small genetic deletion on the Y chromosome -
can apparently be passed from father to son when the child is
conceived by an assisted reproduction technique. By Hannah Wunsch.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 11, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   LEFT-RIGHT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Liberals and conservatives as
strange bedfellows: Politics has long forged odd alliances but
there is clearly something significant happening to the national
debate when Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and presidential
front-runners rebuff traditional party militants to capture the
center when the nomination process has barely begun. Not long ago,
when people were described as ``left'' or ``right,'' liberal or
conservative, Democrat or Republican, their views on a range of
issues _ on religion and state, education, war and peace, taxation
_ could be inferred. That's no longer the case. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   FUGITIVE-FINANCIERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The tale of Martin
Frankel is already enhancing the lore of that most modern of
outlaws, the fugitive financier. There have been a surprising
number of them in the last three decades, with Robert Vesco being
perhaps the most notorious. And their stories serve as a reminder
that even millions of dollars of loot cannot happiness, at least
when you're on the lam. By Leslie Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ When President Clinton visited
Appalachia to call attention to poverty, his visit had a familiar
air. The Kennedys and LBJ had made the trip more than 3 decades
ago. But although some poverty persists, Appalachia is a very
different place with very different economic development needs than
it was in the '60s. What never seems to change is the mythology of
the place as the poster child for American poverty, an image that
persists, to the region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much
times change. By Peter Applebome. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (New York) _ For many urban parents,
agonizing over whether to send their children to public or private
schools has become a ritual fraught with concerns about money and
fears that a public-school education is a sentence to a life of
second-class opportunities. But hard evidence comparing the
performance of public and nonpublic schools has proven elusive.
Now, though, New York state has released test scores that provide a
rare basis for side-by-side comparison, with surprising results:
There were only modest differences in the performance of private
schools _ mainly Catholic ones _ and public schools. By Anemona
Hartocollis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ In the past decade, the U.S.
military has shrunk, both in size and weaponry. At the same time,
though, the number of peacekeeping missions, relief efforts and
other military operations has proliferated _ from the Persian Gulf
to the Caribbean, from Bosnia to Kosovo. Pentagon's commanders say
the U.S. military today is as consumed with ``operations other than
war'' as a much larger force was with fighting Cold War proxy
battles and preparing to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
The new assignments, they complain, are straining the downsized
military, perhaps to the breaking point. By Steven Lee Myers. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-INSECTS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The last corner of L.A.
County's 4,000 square miles was recently declared officially
colonized by Africanized honeybees. Science has been powerless to
stop the bees' steady northward march from South America. But
Californians have reacted to this latest invader with equanimity
because their state has long been home to a rogues' gallery of
flying, crawling pestilence. By Todd S. Purdum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The suspicions also are
familiar. If an athlete does very well, or if an athlete develops
an injury of illness, charges of drug use spring up automatically.
This raises questions about the ethics of drug use in sports. What
is it, some ask, that is at the root of society's horror of
performance-enhancing drugs? By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS-CHARACTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Character review is as much
a part of becoming a lawyer as passing a bar exam. The arcane
character-and-fitness process, unknown to most of the public but
hotly debated within the profession, is facing new scrutiny after a
drive-by shooting rampage last weekend by a disciple of Matthew
Hale, a white supremacist who had been rejected by Illinois bar
examiners on moral grounds. By Mike Allen.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-HYPE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ernest Hemingway
brilliantly cultivated his own elephantine public image during his
30-year reign as America's most famous writer. But the rough,
cantankerous Hemingway would probably have a difficult time
recognizing himself today in the hype overlicensed Hemingway
products, which reaches full-throttle this week in the buildup to
the centennial of his birth on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with the pros and cons of swimming with dolphins, and the
possibility that George Washington fathered a child with a slave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ALIBIS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Alibis for sale in Japan provide
bogus ``respectability.'' The alibi-ya are essentially conjurers
who help people at the margins of society. For instance, women in
the sex industry are frequent clients of the alibi-ya, which enable
them to tell relatives and even boyfriends about their fine jobs in
a trading company. The alibi-ya provide name cards, pay stubs and
an impressive position in a decent line of work _ all fictitious.
If a caller tries to reach the young woman while she is at her
nonexistent job, a polite receptionist will say she has stepped
out. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   TIBET-LOBBY-REVIEW (Washington) _ A behind-the-scenes look at
why the pro-Tibet lobby can be so effective in Washington. Tibet
sympathizers, who have included figures as diverse as right-wing
Sen. Jesse Helms and the Beastie Boys rock music group, caused the
U.S. to reverse its stance and come out against a World Bank loan
to China intended to help establish Chinese farmers on land the
Tibetans say is traditionally theirs. By David E. Sanger. WITH MAP.

   My, What Big Teeth You Have
</P>
<P>
   A colorful mural at Knossos, Crete, from around 1600 B.C., shows
a school of dolphins swimming in a sea of fish, serene and
seemingly happy. Since then, smiling dolphins have become an icon
of inner peace. Authors and new-age centers hail them as superior
beings with much to teach humans. Swimming with the dolphins, they
say, can heal emotional wounds and open reservoirs of deep
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   But science detectives in Europe and America, following a trail
of bloody clues, have found that dolphins are in fact serial
killers whose butchery is unrelated to the need for food. Citing a
rise in bites, federal officials warn that people who swim with
wild dolphins run the risk of serious injury and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Spradlin, an expert at the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said a man in Brazil who harassed a dolphin was rammed by
it and died from his injuries. ``People tend to anthropomorphize
dolphins,'' he said. ``Most don't understand the safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The dolphin myth was shattered by waves of dead porpoises and
baby dolphins that washed up in Scotland and Virginia. Many corpses
had bruises and broken bones and bore the tooth marks of adult
dolphins. Videotapes of dolphin attacks clinched the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin lovers are attacking the research. Human pollution, some
say, may be driving the dolphins mad. ``I have never found their
behavior even remotely associated with being violent or
threatening,'' said Augusto Medelius, a surfer who has often
witnessed dolphins at play in Peru.

<P>
   The Mystery of Venus and George
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1784 or 1785 a boy was born to Venus, a slave on the
estate of George Washington's half-brother, John Augustine
Washington. The boy, named West Ford, was treated with special
favor. John Augustine's wife, Hannah, instructed in her will that
he should be freed and taught a trade.
</P>
<P>
   So who was West Ford's father? Three of his descendants _ Linda
Bryant of Aurora, Colo., her sister Janet Allen of Peoria, Ill.,
and their cousin, Judith S. Burton of Alexandria, Va. _ say their
family's oral history, passed down in secret for six generations,
records the name of Venus' lover: George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Historians do not agree, for several reasons. Washington may
have been sterile: he had no children with his wife, Martha, who
bore four from her previous marriage. He was highly protective of
his reputation and unlikely to have risked it with an illicit
liaison. And there is no record that he visited his brother's
estate or had any other opportunity to be with Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Far more probable, say historians, is that one of John Augustine
Washington's three sons was West Ford's father. They were young,
unmarried and living on the plantation. One candidate is Bushrod
Washington, who bequeathed land to West Ford and resembled him,
according to portraits. Another possibility is the youngest son,
George Augustine Washington. The middle name may easily have been
lost in the retelling over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many slave-owning families had two sides: the white family and
the unacknowledged children of master-slave unions. The descendants
of Sally Hemings, a slave on Thomas Jefferson's estate, have long
preserved the oral tradition that the third president was their
ancestor, a claim that was long denied by many historians but
dramatically supported by DNA data published last November.
</P>
<P>
   With the Washington and Venus story, there is as yet no DNA
evidence, and so far every available historical fact points to a
Washington other than George.

   Vaccine in Mice Offers Hope in Alzheimer's Fight
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have developed a potential vaccine for Alzheimer's
disease. Researchers at Elan Pharmaceuticals in South San
Francisco, a division of the Elan Corporation of Dublin, used mice
that had been genetically altered so they produced plaques of
amyloid protein in their brains, a primary abnormality in
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   When they vaccinated healthy young mice, the mice grew up
without ever forming plaques; in diseased mice, the treatment
eradicated the plaques and also improved the condition of damaged
neurons and reduced inflammation. Elan hopes to begin human trials
by the end of the year.

   Weapon Against Lung Cancer

   Smokers and former smokers aged 50 and over could greatly reduce
their risk of death from lung cancer by having yearly CT scans of
their lungs, doctors reported. The scans are far better than
conventional chest X-rays at detecting tumors when they are small
enough to be cured, and might increase survival rates from 12
percent to 80 percent, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer
Society said more research was needed before public health

   Hillary Rodham Clinton began her first full-fledged campaign

Moynihan, a fellow Democrat who is retiring from the Senate next

</P>
<P>
   In her first outing in a state in which she has never lived, she
seemed to have nearly as many differences with her husband, the

   Barak Takes Charge in Israel
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, a highly decorated former general, took office as
prime minister of Israel with an absence of pomp. This is not
unusual for Israel, where there is something of an aversion to
standing on ceremony. But it seemed to reflect the long delay _
seven weeks _ between Barak's victory and his swearing-in.

<P>
   The elation of Election Day had deflated during the weeks of
political negotiations to form a wide, seven-party government.
Still, Barak gave an impassioned inaugural speech, in which he

forging a broad regional peace.

   When Salam Al-Marayati was appointed in June to a congressional
terrorism commission, Jewish groups quickly protested. While
Al-Marayati is known as a moderate among American Muslim leaders,
and has built relationships with Jewish groups in Los Angeles,
where he lives, he also has made statements suggesting that
Palestinian terrorism arises from ``despair and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt has withdrawn his
appointment, maintaining that Al-Marayati, who fled Iraq with his

in time.

   My, What Big Teeth You Have
</P>
<P>
   A colorful mural at Knossos, Crete, from around 1600 B.C., shows
a school of dolphins swimming in a sea of fish, serene and
seemingly happy. Since then, smiling dolphins have become an icon
of inner peace. Authors and new-age centers hail them as superior
beings with much to teach humans. Swimming with the dolphins, they
say, can heal emotional wounds and open reservoirs of deep
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   But science detectives in Europe and America, following a trail
of bloody clues, have found that dolphins are in fact serial
killers whose butchery is unrelated to the need for food. Citing a
rise in bites, federal officials warn that people who swim with
wild dolphins run the risk of serious injury and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Spradlin, an expert at the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said a man in Brazil who harassed a dolphin was rammed by
it and died from his injuries. ``People tend to anthropomorphize
dolphins,'' he said. ``Most don't understand the safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The dolphin myth was shattered by waves of dead porpoises and
baby dolphins that washed up in Scotland and Virginia. Many corpses
had bruises and broken bones and bore the tooth marks of adult
dolphins. Videotapes of dolphin attacks clinched the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin lovers are attacking the research. Human pollution, some
say, may be driving the dolphins mad. ``I have never found their
behavior even remotely associated with being violent or
threatening,'' said Augusto Medelius, a surfer who has often
witnessed dolphins at play in Peru.

   The Mystery of Venus and George
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1784 or 1785 a boy was born to Venus, a slave on the
estate of George Washington's half-brother, John Augustine
Washington. The boy, named West Ford, was treated with special
favor. John Augustine's wife, Hannah, instructed in her will that
he should be freed and taught a trade.
</P>
<P>
   So who was West Ford's father? Three of his descendants _ Linda
Bryant of Aurora, Colo., her sister Janet Allen of Peoria, Ill.,
and their cousin, Judith S. Burton of Alexandria, Va. _ say their
family's oral history, passed down in secret for six generations,
records the name of Venus' lover: George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Historians do not agree, for several reasons. Washington may
have been sterile: he had no children with his wife, Martha, who
bore four from her previous marriage. He was highly protective of
his reputation and unlikely to have risked it with an illicit
liaison. And there is no record that he visited his brother's
estate or had any other opportunity to be with Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Far more probable, say historians, is that one of John Augustine
Washington's three sons was West Ford's father. They were young,
unmarried and living on the plantation. One candidate is Bushrod
Washington, who bequeathed land to West Ford and resembled him,
according to portraits. Another possibility is the youngest son,
George Augustine Washington. The middle name may easily have been
lost in the retelling over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many slave-owning families had two sides: the white family and
the unacknowledged children of master-slave unions. The descendants
of Sally Hemings, a slave on Thomas Jefferson's estate, have long
preserved the oral tradition that the third president was their
ancestor, a claim that was long denied by many historians but
dramatically supported by DNA data published last November.
</P>
<P>
   With the Washington and Venus story, there is as yet no DNA
evidence, and so far every available historical fact points to a
Washington other than George.

   Vaccine in Mice Offers Hope in Alzheimer's Fight
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have developed a potential vaccine for Alzheimer's
disease. Researchers at Elan Pharmaceuticals in South San
Francisco, a division of the Elan Corporation of Dublin, used mice
that had been genetically altered so they produced plaques of
amyloid protein in their brains, a primary abnormality in
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   When they vaccinated healthy young mice, the mice grew up
without ever forming plaques; in diseased mice, the treatment
eradicated the plaques and also improved the condition of damaged
neurons and reduced inflammation. Elan hopes to begin human trials
by the end of the year.

   Russia Gains Kosovo Role

   After weeks of wrangling, NATO and Russia agreed on a role for
Russian troops in the peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Paratroopers
who will make up most of Russia's 3,600 troops began arriving at
Kosovo's main airfield on Tuesday, following a tense weekend during
which NATO blocked Russian aircraft from landing.

   The Russians have agreed to serve under NATO command, but they

   Record Set in Mile

   For those who treasure the breaking of supposedly impenetrable
barriers, Roger Bannister will always be a hero. In 1954, the
Briton became the first to run a mile in less than 4 minutes, doing
so in 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. Now international track meets
generally bypass the mile in favor of the slightly shorter 1,500
meters. Still, the mile retains glamour, so there was excitement
when Hicham el-Guerrouj, a 24-year-old Moroccan, lowered the world
record to 3 minutes 43.13 seconds in Rome. Had he run that time in
Bannister's record race, he would have beaten Bannister by 120
yards.

_ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani threatened just that, accusing Con Edison
of not doing its homework.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it did, maybe it didn't, but one indisputable culprit _
and it's Giuliani's pride and joy _ is the city's sizzling economy.

   &UR; STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING &LR;  By Brian Morton. Berkley, $12.95.
Leonard Schiller is an out-of-print novelist in his 70s whose
intensely ordered life is shaken by the arrival of a young woman
who wants to write a master's thesis on his work. Last year in The
New York Times Book Review, William H. Pritchard called this a sad
novel that nonetheless ``works toward affirming and enhancing life
.... As a piece of writing, it's nothing less than a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLD NEW WORLD: GROWING UP IN A HARDER COUNTRY &LR;  By William
Finnegan. Modern Library, $14.95. These four bleak portraits of
young people left behind by America's bustling economy explore how
and why they came to be drawn into lives ruled by drugs, crime,
gangs and extremism. ``The cumulative effect is to create an
unusual kind of sympathy,'' Jack Hitt wrote last year. ``Finnegan
convincingly connects the wayward events in these people's lives to
the messages and forces they detect around them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN: AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY FROM THE INNER CITY
TO THE IVY LEAGUE &LR; , by Ron Suskind (Broadway, $13), is a more
optimistic dispatch, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning series in
The Wall Street Journal, that chronicles the struggle of a poor
black teen-ager to lift himself from his blighted Washington high
school into Brown University. In 1998 the reviewer Sara Mosle
called this an ``extraordinary, formula-shattering book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOME TAME GAZELLE &LR;  By Barbara Pym. Moyer Bell, $11.95. The
author's first novel, originally published in Britain in 1950, is
about two middle-aged sisters living in an English village: One is
hopelessly in love with the local vicar; the other has a thing for
young curates. In 1983 Michael Gorra, reviewing the first American
edition, said the story ``has all the quiet skill, the tough,
reasonable wit and ... the calm integrity of Pym's best work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GENUINE REALITY: A LIFE OF WILLIAM JAMES &LR;  By Linda Simon.
University of Chicago, $18. This biography of America's most famous
philosopher (and the brother of Henry James) reveals how his ideas
were linked to his own experiences, including his troubled
relationship with his father, and how he spent a lifetime coping
with severe depression. The author ``vivifies William James in such
a way that his life and thought come freshly alive for the modern
reader,'' David S. Reynolds wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; ALICE JAMES: A BIOGRAPHY &LR; , by Jean Strouse (Harvard
University, $18.95), the youngest of the James siblings is shown to
have been a formidable figure in her own right: Even though
mysterious illnesses rendered her an invalid for most of her life,
she was a gifted, enigmatic woman whose intellectual powers
intensified over time. In 1980 the reviewer Diane Johnson called
this a ``judicious and beautifully written biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOVES THAT BIND &LR;  By Julian Rios. Vintage International, $12.
The narrator of this Spanish novel recounts his amorous exploits in
a series of letters addressed to an unnamed lover who has abandoned
him in London. Last year the reviewer Abigail Lee Six admired the
author's ``virtuoso use of language: multilingual puns, neologisms
galore, dazzling networks of extended metaphor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL THIS DO? THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS OF AUBERON WAUGH: AN
AUTOBIOGRAPHY &LR;  Carroll &AMP; Graf, $13.95. The son of Evelyn Waugh
recalls life with father, who not surprisingly was exasperating and
extremely hard to please, as well as the rest of his childhood and
his own literary travails. The result is ``a modest but
terrifically entertaining book that's funny, acerbic and a little
sad,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LONG FALLING &LR;  By Keith Ridgway. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$13. The murder of an abusive husband by his long-suffering wife in
rural Ireland is portrayed as an understandable act that raises a
disturbing question: Is the taking of another's life ever
justifiable? Last year the reviewer Rosemary Mahoney called this
first novel skillfully drawn and ``at times excruciatingly
suspenseful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HULLABALOO IN THE GUAVA ORCHARD &LR;  By Kiran Desai.
Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. In this opulent Indian novel, a young man
climbs a guava tree to escape his fellow humans and finds himself
revered as a prophet by both the local villagers and the local
monkeys. ``It's a parable, an allegory, a bittersweet reminder of
the chaos of India,'' Zia Jaffrey wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABOUT THIS LIFE: JOURNEYS ON THE THRESHOLD OF MEMORY &LR;  By Barry
Lopez. Vintage, $13. These essays cover a lot of geographic and
imaginative territory, from Hokkaido and Antarctica to the author's
childhood and the subject of air freight, but at their core is a
fascination with the role of landscape in one's life. ``Lyrical
prose is Lopez's trademark,'' Sara Wheeler wrote in 1998. ``I
enjoyed this rich book hugely.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRANSLATOR &LR;  By Ward Just. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.
The hero of this novel is an expatriate German in Paris who can't
shake his past _ and his memories of World War II _ when he's
called on to help an old friend at the end of the Cold War. ``Just
plots his ironies with a diabolical cunning and patient
thoroughness that make them seem inevitable,'' George Stade wrote
last year.

SLIPPERY SLOPE ON THE PLAYING FIELD

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   It happened again this year. Another drug scandal in sports.
This time, it involved more than a dozen cyclists in Swiss and
Italian races failing blood tests, including Marco Pantani of
Italy, last year's winner of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics are pointing to what they see as a disconnect
between excessive worry over performance-enhancing drugs and
uncritical applause for the other ways of boosting an athlete's
performance _ from high-technology running shoes to chains of
stores devoted to dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The laments over the cycling scandal sounded all too familiar to
anyone who has followed the continuing drama of drugs in sports. A
common reaction is often disgust. French Cycling Federation
president Daniel Baal said with drug use so rampant, ``I can't
watch a fake spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   If an athlete excels _ or develops an injury or illness _
charges of drug use spring up. European cycling officials charged
the athletes with using erythropoietin, or EPO, which raises red
blood cell counts, enabling the blood to carry more oxygen to
muscles. Now, when cyclists sprint up a mountain flawlessly,
spectators may well ask: Is it natural ability combined with tough
training? Or is it EPO?
</P>
<P>
   In the July 1996 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Thomas Murray, the president of the Hastings
Center, an ethics institute, and Dr. Don Catlin, who operates the
Olympic drug-testing lab at the University of California at Los
Angeles, wrote that drug testing in the Olympics ``is an effort to
preserve what is beautiful and admirable in sports and to ensure
that all athletes compete on a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics argue that drug use is not inherently different
from other ways many top athletes try to gain that tiny margin that
separates the winners from the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Take the arguments surrounding EPO. Dr. Norman Fost, the
director of the program in medical ethics at the University of
Wisconsin and an outspoken critic of what he sees as a double
standard, says there are three ways to raise the hemoglobin level
of blood: Train at high altitudes or spend time in chambers with
low oxygen levels, which accomplishes the same thing. Bank your own
red blood cells and then inject them. Or take EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's hypocritical is saying there's something immoral about
using mechanism three or mechanism two,'' Fost said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many argue that taking a drug like EPO is unnatural. What
does it mean to break a world record when the athlete's edge is
supplied by a drug as opposed to something else? ``Tell me a sport
or show me an athlete that doesn't have unnatural assists,'' Fost
said, referring not only to special running shoes and fiberglass
poles for pole vaults but also to secret devices and methods.
</P>
<P>
   When American swimmer Janet Evans won a gold medal in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, she wore a ``slime suit,'' a greasy swimsuit
that had been developed in secret, which slashed her time. At that
same Olympics, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of his
gold medal because he had failed a test for steroids. Fost says Ms.
Evans won praise for using an unnatural assist while Johnson was
vilified.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are chemicals that change the body, but so are special
training diets, says Michael Shapiro, a law professor at the
University of Southern California. So is Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the feelings about drugs is that they somehow make the
athlete superhuman, as opposed to getting a better bicycle or a
better pole vault,'' said James Bakalar, the associate editor of
the Harvard Mental Health Letter. ``When you analyze this, it
doesn't work out too clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't such performance-enhancing drugs dangerous? They are
certainly perceived to be. If spectacular victories raise
suspicions about drugs, so do illnesses. When American sprinter
Florence Griffith Joyner, the winner of three gold medals in the
1988 Olympics, died suddenly last year at age 38 of suffocation
related to an epileptic seizure, there was a spate of unfounded
whispers that drugs had killed her.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar example, Murray writes in a 1983 article for The
Hastings Center Report: ``I have heard reports of two women, world
champions in the 1970s, who appeared to age with stunning rapidity.
While no conclusive proof is possible that these effects were due
to steroids, or even that these two women used steroids, their
women competitors have no doubt that steroids were the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence that athletes were harmed by such drugs is
scanty at best, said Fost. And if people are worried about physical
impairment, he adds, the risks of taking drugs pale in comparison
to the risks of simply playing many of the sports, even noncontact
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Louganis cracked his head on the diving platform,'' Fost
said. ``We didn't say we want to ban diving because of its
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the coercive nature of drugs, the pressure athletes
may feel to use them to keep up with their competitors? By using
drugs, athletes ``have turned a sport into a sophisticated game of
chicken,'' Murray writes.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to take such drugs and most athletes refuse them,
critics say. Yet every athlete takes part in a game of chicken when
it comes to deprivation and risk in training.
</P>
<P>
   Fost says there is perhaps another reason why drugs remain such
a major issue in sports: They can be a welcome diversion from other
issues, like the serious risks of permanent injury in football,
gymnastics and other events. The drug issue, he said, is ``a cheap
fix, a way of appearing concerned about ethical problems in
sports.''

Italy, last year's winner of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics are pointing to what they see as a disconnect
between excessive worry over performance-enhancing drugs and
uncritical applause for the other ways of boosting an athlete's
performance _ from high-technology running shoes to chains of
stores devoted to dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The laments over the cycling scandal sounded all too familiar to
anyone who has followed the continuing drama of drugs in sports. A
common reaction is often disgust. French Cycling Federation
president Daniel Baal said with drug use so rampant, ``I can't
watch a fake spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   If an athlete excels _ or develops an injury or illness _
charges of drug use spring up. European cycling officials charged
the athletes with using erythropoietin, or EPO, which raises red
blood cell counts, enabling the blood to carry more oxygen to
muscles. Now, when cyclists sprint up a mountain flawlessly,
spectators may well ask: Is it natural ability combined with tough
training? Or is it EPO?
</P>
<P>
   In the July 1996 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Thomas Murray, the president of the Hastings
Center, an ethics institute, and Dr. Don Catlin, who operates the
Olympic drug-testing lab at the University of California at Los
Angeles, wrote that drug testing in the Olympics ``is an effort to
preserve what is beautiful and admirable in sports and to ensure
that all athletes compete on a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics argue that drug use is not inherently different
from other ways many top athletes try to gain that tiny margin that
separates the winners from the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Take the arguments surrounding EPO. Dr. Norman Fost, the
director of the program in medical ethics at the University of
Wisconsin and an outspoken critic of what he sees as a double
standard, says there are three ways to raise the hemoglobin level
of blood: Train at high altitudes or spend time in chambers with
low oxygen levels, which accomplishes the same thing. Bank your own
red blood cells and then inject them. Or take EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's hypocritical is saying there's something immoral about
using mechanism three or mechanism two,'' Fost said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many argue that taking a drug like EPO is unnatural. What
does it mean to break a world record when the athlete's edge is
supplied by a drug as opposed to something else? ``Tell me a sport
or show me an athlete that doesn't have unnatural assists,'' Fost
said, referring not only to special running shoes and fiberglass
poles for pole vaults but also to secret devices and methods.
</P>
<P>
   When American swimmer Janet Evans won a gold medal in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, she wore a ``slime suit,'' a greasy swimsuit
that had been developed in secret, which slashed her time. At that
same Olympics, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of his
gold medal because he had failed a test for steroids. Fost says Ms.
Evans won praise for using an unnatural assist while Johnson was
vilified.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are chemicals that change the body, but so are special
training diets, says Michael Shapiro, a law professor at the
University of Southern California. So is Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the feelings about drugs is that they somehow make the
athlete superhuman, as opposed to getting a better bicycle or a
better pole vault,'' said James Bakalar, the associate editor of
the Harvard Mental Health Letter. ``When you analyze this, it
doesn't work out too clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't such performance-enhancing drugs dangerous? They are
certainly perceived to be. If spectacular victories raise
suspicions about drugs, so do illnesses. When American sprinter
Florence Griffith Joyner, the winner of three gold medals in the
1988 Olympics, died suddenly last year at age 38 of suffocation
related to an epileptic seizure, there was a spate of unfounded
whispers that drugs had killed her.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar example, Murray writes in a 1983 article for The
Hastings Center Report: ``I have heard reports of two women, world
champions in the 1970s, who appeared to age with stunning rapidity.
While no conclusive proof is possible that these effects were due
to steroids, or even that these two women used steroids, their
women competitors have no doubt that steroids were the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence that athletes were harmed by such drugs is
scanty at best, said Fost. And if people are worried about physical
impairment, he adds, the risks of taking drugs pale in comparison
to the risks of simply playing many of the sports, even noncontact
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Louganis cracked his head on the diving platform,'' Fost
said. ``We didn't say we want to ban diving because of its
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the coercive nature of drugs, the pressure athletes
may feel to use them to keep up with their competitors? By using
drugs, athletes ``have turned a sport into a sophisticated game of
chicken,'' Murray writes.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to take such drugs and most athletes refuse them,
critics say. Yet every athlete takes part in a game of chicken when
it comes to deprivation and risk in training.
</P>
<P>
   Fost says there is perhaps another reason why drugs remain such
a major issue in sports: They can be a welcome diversion from other
issues, like the serious risks of permanent injury in football,
gymnastics and other events. The drug issue, he said, is ``a cheap
fix, a way of appearing concerned about ethical problems in
sports.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the two decades since John Belushi bellowed,
``Your honey or your wife!'' as a corpulent killer bee on
``Saturday Night Live,'' those relentless, aggressive insects have
passed out of the realm of schlock movies and sketch comedy and
into the daily reality of life in states along the Mexican border,
beginning nine years ago in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the last corner of Los Angeles County's 4,000
square miles was declared officially colonized by Africanized honey
bees, when a swarm was found lurking under the eves of a building
in the desolate desert suburb of Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Science has been powerless to stop the bees' steady northward
march from South America, and the sighting of a single swirling
swarm in a backyard tree can still prompt a brief mention on the
local television news.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing like the panic in the streets that
Hollywood's mid-1970s imagination predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Californians have reacted to this latest invader with
equanimity because their state has long been home to a rogues'
gallery of flying, crawling pestilence. This is, after all, the
place ``where bowers of flowers bloom in the sun,'' and that means
a motley chorus of pests the world over is always buzzing
``California, Here I Come!'' and posing new threats to the state's
$27 billion-a-year agricultural industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are thrips, tiny juice-sucking insects that prey on
avocados, scarring and discoloring the fruit so it looks like a
potato. There are olive fruit flies from the Mediterranean,
discovered here last fall, the first ever in California and perhaps
in all of North America, which leave black olives grayish-white and
rotting. There are red imported fire ants from South America, whose
mounds grow as big as basketballs and make it hard to move
harvesting equipment through orchards.
</P>
<P>
   And now come the Africanized bees, whose ancestors came from
South Africa and were released inadvertently from a Brazilian
breeding experiment 42 years ago. They have gradually moved north
and west, and recently were discovered for the first time east of
the Mississippi River, in Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The bees are no more venomous than their calmer cousins but are
considerably more aggressive, capable of delivering 10 times as
many stings.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the bees stand poised to colonize the commercial
honey-bee hives that are vital to pollinating commercial crops,
principally almond groves. Because the Africanized bees are
unpredictable and harder to manage, they represent a threat to an
important industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have so many things blooming and growing together
here that don't belong together?'' asks Robert Page, an
entomologist at the University of California at Davis who has
helped isolate a gene that may make Africanized bees meaner.
``We've been a real cultural mixing bowl forever. Everybody who
comes wants to bring their favorite plant. And when they come, they
also bring their favorite plant's parasite or disease agent.''
</P>
<P>
   In this state, there is seldom a letup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 the state Department of Agriculture set up the Pest
Detection Emergency Protection division to combat an invasion of
the Mediterranean fruit fly, which attacks 250 types of crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long discussion about what we would do when there
wasn't an emergency project to keep people busy,'' Pat Minyard, the
division's manager, said ruefully, adding: ``We've never had that
situation. There is an extraordinary range of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Jennings, director of Pest Management Policy for the
Department of Agriculture in Washington, said he knew of no formal
ranking of pests by state, but that California and Florida, with
their warm climates, long growing seasons and diverse crops, would
be together at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pest unless it's doing something economically,''
Jennings said. ``What rises to be a pest is a direct function of
what you're growing.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary citizens, Africanized bees can be a severe
annoyance, and there have been a handful of fatalities, including a
72-year-old man who was attacked and killed two years ago in his
mobile home in Casa Grande, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Noise, like that from lawn mowers or leaf blowers, seems to
aggravate the bees. The Africanized variety will chase a human who
disturbs it up to a quarter mile, 12 times as far as the European
bee, and if you duck under water, it will simply outwait you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone should just increase their awareness about
it,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Agriculture
Department. ``There's not really much that we can do to stop its
flow. We live with a lot of pests that can harm you, sting you.
Awareness is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, California works diligently to stop the flow of
pests that pose more immediate threats to agriculture, especially
the various fruit flies that love backyards and commercial
orchards.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, much of San Diego is under quarantine because of
Mexican fruit fly infestations, and big black and white signs
dotting the freeways warn residents not to move fruit from trees in
their own backyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, people don't realize the impact they could
have in bringing even a single piece of fruit,'' Hidalgo said.
``You shouldn't even take it off your property. If you take it a
mile, two miles to your office, now that's an infested area, too.
But it's something we have to basically use the honor system on.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, 10 olive
fruit flies were found in a residential neighborhood, and about 400
have now been trapped in an effort to gauge the scale of the
problem over a 300-square mile area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say it was the first-ever sighting of this pest in
California, though it is widespread in Europe and North Africa.
Unlike other fruit flies, it poses a threat only to olives, but
California is the nation's sole producer of commercially grown
olives, with a 1997 crop valued at nearly $70 million. Most of the
growing areas are well north of Los Angeles, but officials are
taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' said Minyard of the state agriculture department,
``we're just trapping, trying to wait and see.''

IN JAPAN, ALIBIS ARE AN INDUSTRY

<P>
   TOKYO _ Anyone who believes that respectability is priceless has
not been to Japan lately. Here it sells for $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   While the Japanese economy remains a mess, one type of business
seems to be doing well: the alibi-ya, whose name comes from the
English word alibi and the suffix ya, meaning a seller. In essence,
they are conjurers who make people at the margins of Japanese
society look dignified and respectable.
</P>
<P>
   The alibi-ya are the marketplace's way of reconciling a shame
society _ one that emphasizes peer pressure and public shame to
achieve good behavior _ with what are regarded as shameful
industries. Japan, more than most industrialized countries, has
strict bounds of propriety and plenty of minders to see that they
are adhered to. As everywhere, they often are not.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the sex industry are frequent clients of the alibi-ya,
which enable them to tell mom and even boyfriends about their fine
jobs in a trading company. The alibi-ya provide name cards, pay
stubs and an impressive position in a decent line of work _ all
totally fictitious. If a caller tries to reach the young woman
while she is at her nonexistent job, a polite receptionist will
explain that she has stepped out but will return the call shortly.
Then the receptionist passes on the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls want to make their families feel better,'' explained
Kenichi Seko, who runs an alibi-ya called Fuji Operating. ``They
want their families to think that they have a good, proper job.''
Seko sat at a conference table in his comfortable ground-floor
office suite with computers and black leather couches. On the door
are the names of several companies Seko uses on name cards given to
his customers. But there is no mention of Fuji Operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have a girl's family come here looking for
her and see Fuji Operating and realize that it's an alibi-ya,''
Seko explained. ``If anybody comes here, it looks like the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The alibi-ya business sector is, of course, a tiny one by the
standards of Japanese industry, and it began only about a decade
ago. At first it involved just telephone answering services, but
now it supplies various phony employment references and pay stubs
to help clients rent apartments or obtain credit cards. An alibi-ya
can even provide a fake boss to make a wedding speech about what a
wonderful employee the bride was.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are also entering the alibi-ya business. Japan's
cable radio system, with its crystal-clear reception on dozens of
channels, carries one called the ``alibi channel.'' It broadcasts
the honks and rumble of roadside traffic so that a subscriber can
turn on the radio and make a call that sounds as if it were coming
from a telephone booth on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how listeners use the alibi broadcasts,'' said
Yasuhiro Urasaki, a producer for cable radio. ``But I assume that
they use it when they oversleep and miss a meeting with a client.
Then they can put on the alibi program and then call and say,
`Sorry to be late, but I got lost on the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Major train stations also have the equivalent of alibi shops,
selling specialty gifts from all over Japan. Thus if a businessman
has forgotten to get a gift for a friend while on a trip to the
southern city of Fukuoka, he can go to Tokyo Station and get a
typical Fukuoka product like hot pickled pollack roe. Or he can
tell his wife he is going on a business trip to the northern island
of Hokkaido, and then on his way home from his girlfriend's house
swing by Tokyo Station to pick up an appropriate Hokkaido gift,
like Rishiri Island dried kelp.
</P>
<P>
   The sex industry is the main customer for the alibi-ya,
reflecting one of the paradoxes of Japan: A society that puts a
premium on traditional virtue (at least for women) also has a huge
sex industry. ``Japan has modernized in many ways, but mentally
it's pre-modern,'' said Yoko Tajima, a prominent feminist who
teaches at Housei University in Tokyo. ``Even high school students
sell themselves; even housewives sell themselves. But on the other
hand, women are supposed to be virtuous.''
</P>
<P>
   While the United States tends to fill the ranks of prostitutes
at least partly with drug addicts and a large underclass, Japan has
almost no underclass or addicts. So massage parlors are staffed by
middle-class women and girls who are frequently extremely
uncomfortable with what they are doing _ and who are close enough
to their families to want to stay in regular touch.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be that with Japan's recession, a growing
number (though still a tiny proportion) of housewives are worrying
about how to pay the mortgages and are quietly getting jobs in sex
businesses, while telling family members that they are working in
an office or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Respectability is apparently a crucial consideration, for
recruitment advertisements by sexual establishments all focus on
two lures: lots of money and an in-house alibi-ya. Usually the
in-house alibi-ya is just a second telephone line answered in the
name of a different company. Or else it is an affiliated restaurant
where the woman pretends to work. So some women want the greater
protection and benefits of a professional alibi-ya, even though the
fees are hefty _ typically, a registration fee of $100 and then $50
to $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where people don't trust people,'' said
Seko, explaining the attraction of an alibi-ya like his own. ``They
trust where you work, what your position is. It's strange. A girl
can have a huge amount of money in the bank, but a real estate
company won't want to rent to her. And then I put my chop on a
paper, saying she works for me, and then they trust that.''

are adhered to. As everywhere, they often are not.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the sex industry are frequent clients of the alibi-ya,
which enable them to tell mom and even boyfriends about their fine
jobs in a trading company. The alibi-ya provide name cards, pay
stubs and an impressive position in a decent line of work _ all
totally fictitious. If a caller tries to reach the young woman
while she is at her nonexistent job, a polite receptionist will
explain that she has stepped out but will return the call shortly.
Then the receptionist passes on the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls want to make their families feel better,'' explained
Kenichi Seko, who runs an alibi-ya called Fuji Operating. ``They
want their families to think that they have a good, proper job.''
Seko sat at a conference table in his comfortable ground-floor
office suite with computers and black leather couches. On the door
are the names of several companies Seko uses on name cards given to
his customers. But there is no mention of Fuji Operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have a girl's family come here looking for
her and see Fuji Operating and realize that it's an alibi-ya,''
Seko explained. ``If anybody comes here, it looks like the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The alibi-ya business sector is, of course, a tiny one by the
standards of Japanese industry, and it began only about a decade
ago. At first it involved just telephone answering services, but
now it supplies various phony employment references and pay stubs
to help clients rent apartments or obtain credit cards. An alibi-ya
can even provide a fake boss to make a wedding speech about what a
wonderful employee the bride was.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are also entering the alibi-ya business. Japan's
cable radio system, with its crystal-clear reception on dozens of
channels, carries one called the ``alibi channel.'' It broadcasts
the honks and rumble of roadside traffic so that a subscriber can
turn on the radio and make a call that sounds as if it were coming
from a telephone booth on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how listeners use the alibi broadcasts,'' said
Yasuhiro Urasaki, a producer for cable radio. ``But I assume that
they use it when they oversleep and miss a meeting with a client.
Then they can put on the alibi program and then call and say,
`Sorry to be late, but I got lost on the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Major train stations also have the equivalent of alibi shops,
selling specialty gifts from all over Japan. Thus if a businessman
has forgotten to get a gift for a friend while on a trip to the
southern city of Fukuoka, he can go to Tokyo Station and get a
typical Fukuoka product like hot pickled pollack roe. Or he can
tell his wife he is going on a business trip to the northern island
of Hokkaido, and then on his way home from his girlfriend's house
swing by Tokyo Station to pick up an appropriate Hokkaido gift,
like Rishiri Island dried kelp.
</P>
<P>
   The sex industry is the main customer for the alibi-ya,
reflecting one of the paradoxes of Japan: A society that puts a
premium on traditional virtue (at least for women) also has a huge
sex industry. ``Japan has modernized in many ways, but mentally
it's pre-modern,'' said Yoko Tajima, a prominent feminist who
teaches at Housei University in Tokyo. ``Even high school students
sell themselves; even housewives sell themselves. But on the other
hand, women are supposed to be virtuous.''
</P>
<P>
   While the United States tends to fill the ranks of prostitutes
at least partly with drug addicts and a large underclass, Japan has
almost no underclass or addicts. So massage parlors are staffed by
middle-class women and girls who are frequently extremely
uncomfortable with what they are doing _ and who are close enough
to their families to want to stay in regular touch.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be that with Japan's recession, a growing
number (though still a tiny proportion) of housewives are worrying
about how to pay the mortgages and are quietly getting jobs in sex
businesses, while telling family members that they are working in
an office or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Respectability is apparently a crucial consideration, for
recruitment advertisements by sexual establishments all focus on
two lures: lots of money and an in-house alibi-ya. Usually the
in-house alibi-ya is just a second telephone line answered in the
name of a different company. Or else it is an affiliated restaurant
where the woman pretends to work. So some women want the greater
protection and benefits of a professional alibi-ya, even though the
fees are hefty _ typically, a registration fee of $100 and then $50
to $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where people don't trust people,'' said
Seko, explaining the attraction of an alibi-ya like his own. ``They
trust where you work, what your position is. It's strange. A girl
can have a huge amount of money in the bank, but a real estate
company won't want to rent to her. And then I put my chop on a
paper, saying she works for me, and then they trust that.''

EYOND THE BAR EXAM: A QUESTION OF CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   To win admission to the bar in New York state, law school
graduates are asked to deny under oath that they have ever belonged
to any group ``advocating or teaching that the government of the
United States, or any state or any political subdivision thereof,
should be overthrown.''
</P>
<P>
   That question, with its echoes of McCarthyism, is part of a
character review that is as essential to becoming a lawyer in the
United States as passing the bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   The arcane character-and-fitness process, conducted in the
strictest secrecy, got some rare public attention after a series of
drive-by shootings last weekend in the Midwest that may have been
touched off by the denial on moral grounds of a law license to the
leader of a white supremacist group.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, who killed himself last Sunday as the
police closed in on him, was a disciple of Matthew Hale, a white
supremacist whose appeal for a law license had been rejected by the
Illinois bar on July 2, just hours before Smith began his shooting
spree. Hale said that Smith might have taken the rejection as a
sign that the group's rights were being trampled upon.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials in several states said denials of law licenses
on ideological grounds were common in past decades, but are now
rare. Today, denials almost always involve financial problems, drug
or alcohol abuse, or conviction for several serious crimes. Child
support has become a major issue, and applicants in New York have
been turned down for being more than three months behind in their
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial problems that can prevent admission to the bar
include unsatisfied judgments and failure to honor agreements to
pay off credit card debts. And applicants have been denied
admission if they lost time in school because of drug or alcohol
problems, but had not sought treatment, or had multiple convictions
for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In some cases,
the officials said, applicants withdrew their requests for
admission when they realized the bar officials had obtained
information about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who graduated from law school and passed the bar
examination, was rejected by the Illinois Bar Association's
Committee on Character and Fitness last December. The panel said
his racist activities demonstrated that he did not have the fitness
of character to qualify as a lawyer. He heads a white supremacist
group called The World Church of the Creator, advocates white
separatism, and has said he would prefer not to represent black
clients.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Hale last December, the panel said, ``History tells
us that extermination is sometimes not far behind when government
power is held by persons of his racial views.'' Hale has said he
plans to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme cases like Hale's notwithstanding, some experts think
the moral standard for admission to the bar is not taken seriously
enough. Hale was among 25 rejections out of 3,200 applicants in
Illinois last year; in Manhattan and the Bronx, fewer than 10 out
of 2,600 applications were rejected. Nearly all the rejections
involved financial or substance-abuse problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immoral character should not exclude only the Hales,'' said
Richard Zitrin, a San Francisco lawyer who is the co-author of
``The Moral Compass of the American Lawyer'' (Ballantine, 1999). He
said reviews of applicants are not tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of people are flying below the moral-character radar
because too often that element of admission is a rubber stamp,''
Zitrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, James Cohen, the chairman of the legal education
committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
said the reviews have become largely proforma. He recalled the case
of a law student who had three felony drug convictions but was
admitted on the ground that he had demonstrated rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, Cohen said, reviewers know only what the
applicant reports about convictions, debts and other problems.
Lying on an application can lead to disbarment, but Cohen said it
is unlikely that fudgers will be caught. And he said anyone who has
negative information about an applicant is unlikely to intervene,
partly out of fear of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Character and fitness checks, which vary in form and seriousness
from state to state, have their roots in the 12th century. They are
justified on the theory that the court must be able to rely on a
lawyer's word, and attorneys must be trusted with clients' money.
</P>
<P>
   But the standards have varied over the centuries, and critics
say the checks have been used in different eras to prevent members
of minority groups and suspected communists from practicing law.
Several law professors said reviewers should focus on a small list
of criminal offenses like embezzlement that might have a bearing on
the practice of law, and should stay away from free-speech issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old elephants harrumph and say the standards of the bar
are deteriorating and this is no time to yield,'' said Geoffrey
Hazard, a legal ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. ``But
they are generating a ton of paperwork for very little
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the critics' complaints is that the standards are vague.
In New York, for instance, an applicant must demonstrate to a
committee run by the state Supreme Court that he or she ``possesses
the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and
counselor-at-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University who has
studied character committees, said the criteria that exist are
applied with great inconsistency. She found, for instance, that a
committee in one part of a state had rejected applicants based on
parking and fishing offenses, while a committee in another part of
the same state had approved a convicted child molester.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their character flaws, lawyers in Manhattan, at least,
seem to be a patriotic bunch. Confronted with the question about
whether they had ever plotted to overthrow the government, not one
applicant in the last 10 years has answered, ``Yes.''

PUTTING PRIVATE EDUCATION TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For many parents in urban America, agonizing over
whether to send their children to public or private schools has
become a ritual fraught with concerns about money and fears that a
public-school education is a sentence to a life of second-class
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents think private schools do a better job, an
assumption that has grown into a powerful movement for tax vouchers
to help children leave the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But hard evidence comparing the performance of public and
nonpublic schools has proved elusive. This month, however, New York
state released test scores on a new fourth-grade reading and
writing test that provided a rare basis for side-by-side
comparison, and the results were surprising: There were only modest
differences in the performance of private schools _ mainly Catholic
ones _ and public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is far from perfect. For one thing, the test was
new and controversial. Some schools drilled students for months,
even during holidays, while others did little to prepare. The test
was optional for private schools, and many of them opted out _
including nearly all the elite ones in New York City _ making
generalizations about private school performance especially
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was general agreement among educators that the
results present a challenge to the conventional wisdom about public
and private education.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 53 percent of private-school students passed the
test, compared to 48 percent of public-school students. In New York
City the gap was wider: 44 percent of private school students
passed, as against 33 percent of those in public school.
</P>
<P>
   But when students with learning or behavioral problems are
excluded, the scores rise for public schools. (The public schools
have far more of these special education students: 50,519
fourth-graders statewide compared with a mere 647 in private
school, according to the state statistics.) Excluding special
education, 55 percent of students private schools statewide passed
the test, and 52 percent of those in public school. In New York
City, 45 percent of students in private school passed the test, and
37 percent of those in public school.
</P>
<P>
   The new test was administered to 29,000 fourth-graders in 1,024
private schools, 74 percent of private schools statewide.
Ninety-nine percent of the Catholic schools, 686 of them,
administered the test. The next highest participation was among
Jewish schools _ 104 of them, or 61 percent, gave the test. Sixty
nondenominational schools, or 34 percent, participated.
</P>
<P>
   Public-school advocates say the scores show that public schools
have been unfairly maligned. ``The parochial schools didn't shine
at all,'' said Seymour Fliegel, a senior fellow at the Center for
Educational Innovation, a research group that supports public
schools in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Even some voucher advocates acknowledge that the test shows that
private schools are no panacea. ``The private schools really ought
to be doing a whole lot better than they're doing by taking
advantage of their freedom to do things differently, and by
delivering a superior product,'' said Chester Finn, a former Reagan
Administration official now at the Manhattan Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Finn suggests that the dirty little secret behind the new data
is that almost everyone in the education world, whether in public
or private school, is the captive of the same fads, philosophies
and materials disseminated by teaching colleges and textbook
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curriculum of a fourth-grade math class in a private
school is often very close to the curriculum of a fourth-grade math
class in a public school, complete with all the same
vulnerabilities, the same goofiness, often the same textbook and
the same teacher beliefs about what's important,'' Finn said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some previous studies comparing public and
Catholic schools, notably one by sociologist James S. Coleman in
1981 and another by a New York state commission in 1994. Both
concluded that Catholic schools do better, but questions were
raised about their methodologies.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, administered for the first time this year,
required students to read long passages of fiction and nonfiction,
and to write essays about what they had read. It was preceded by
months of feverish cramming and hand-wringing from both teachers
and parents, who feared it was too difficult, and perhaps even
inappropriate for 9-year-olds. It was scored in four levels,
roughly corresponding to minimally skilled, below standard,
proficient and superior, although the state did not endorse any
labels.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave ammunition to people who think Catholic schools
serve disadvantaged students better than public schools. The
private schools, both religious and independent, had just half as
many students at the bottom level, or 8 percent, compared to 16
percent for public schools, excluding special education. Joseph
Viteritti, research director of the Wagner School at New York
University, said this proved that ``fewer kids fall between the
cracks'' in private school. But another explanation, said Fliegel,
is that the most disadvantaged students may be the least able or
motivated to go to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, though, public schools did at least as well as
private ones. Statewide, 5 percent of private school students and
5.6 percent of public school students, excluding those in special
education, scored in the top category; in New York City, the
numbers are 3 percent for private and 3.5 percent for public.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual Catholic schools excelled. At St. Jerome's in
the South Bronx, 29 percent of the students passed the test, ahead
of all but one surrounding public school. Nearby Catholic schools
did much worse, with St. Pius V, for instance, having only 11
percent passing. St. Jerome's is one of New York City's poorest
parishes, where income averages $5,000 per person, said the Rev.
John O. Grange, the parish priest. Some students are the children
of poor, illiterate Mexican immigrants, on scholarship. But Father
Grange said most of the students are slightly better off than those
in nearby public schools. Tuition is $2,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   But in middle-class neighborhoods, public schools tended to
outscore Catholic schools. In affluent Bayside, Queens, for
instance, 81 percent of public-school students passed the test,
compared with 60 percent in Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   Among the independent schools that took the test, variations in
performance discourage sweeping conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The Trinity School on the Upper West Side was one of the top
performers in the state, with 98 percent passing, 30 percent in the
top level, and just 2 percent below standard.. At Manhattan Country
School on the East Side, more children scored in the middle, with
94 percent passing, but only 0.3 percent at the top and 6 percent
below standard. At the Cathedral School in Morningside Heights,
only six students took the test, indicating the danger of making
too much of statistics at all.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, said Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, is that no one type of school is inherently
better or worse. ``You can't really make a blanket statement,'' Dr.
Ravitch said. ``A parent can only make a judgment about what's good
for their own child.''

test, compared to 48 percent of public-school students. In New York
City the gap was wider: 44 percent of private school students
passed, as against 33 percent of those in public school.
</P>
<P>
   But when students with learning or behavioral problems are
excluded, the scores rise for public schools. (The public schools
have far more of these special education students: 50,519
fourth-graders statewide compared with a mere 647 in private
school, according to the state statistics.) Excluding special
education, 55 percent of students private schools statewide passed
the test, and 52 percent of those in public school. In New York
City, 45 percent of students in private school passed the test, and
37 percent of those in public school.
</P>
<P>
   The new test was administered to 29,000 fourth-graders in 1,024
private schools, 74 percent of private schools statewide.
Ninety-nine percent of the Catholic schools, 686 of them,
administered the test. The next highest participation was among
Jewish schools _ 104 of them, or 61 percent, gave the test. Sixty
nondenominational schools, or 34 percent, participated.
</P>
<P>
   Public-school advocates say the scores show that public schools
have been unfairly maligned. ``The parochial schools didn't shine
at all,'' said Seymour Fliegel, a senior fellow at the Center for
Educational Innovation, a research group that supports public
schools in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Even some voucher advocates acknowledge that the test shows that
private schools are no panacea. ``The private schools really ought
to be doing a whole lot better than they're doing by taking
advantage of their freedom to do things differently, and by
delivering a superior product,'' said Chester Finn, a former Reagan
Administration official now at the Manhattan Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Finn suggests that the dirty little secret behind the new data
is that almost everyone in the education world, whether in public
or private school, is the captive of the same fads, philosophies
and materials disseminated by teaching colleges and textbook
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curriculum of a fourth-grade math class in a private
school is often very close to the curriculum of a fourth-grade math
class in a public school, complete with all the same
vulnerabilities, the same goofiness, often the same textbook and
the same teacher beliefs about what's important,'' Finn said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some previous studies comparing public and
Catholic schools, notably one by sociologist James S. Coleman in
1981 and another by a New York state commission in 1994. Both
concluded that Catholic schools do better, but questions were
raised about their methodologies.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, administered for the first time this year,
required students to read long passages of fiction and nonfiction,
and to write essays about what they had read. It was preceded by
months of feverish cramming and hand-wringing from both teachers
and parents, who feared it was too difficult, and perhaps even
inappropriate for 9-year-olds. It was scored in four levels,
roughly corresponding to minimally skilled, below standard,
proficient and superior, although the state did not endorse any
labels.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave ammunition to people who think Catholic schools
serve disadvantaged students better than public schools. The
private schools, both religious and independent, had just half as
many students at the bottom level, or 8 percent, compared to 16
percent for public schools, excluding special education. Joseph
Viteritti, research director of the Wagner School at New York
University, said this proved that ``fewer kids fall between the
cracks'' in private school. But another explanation, said Fliegel,
is that the most disadvantaged students may be the least able or
motivated to go to private schools.

<P>
   When President Clinton headed to the back roads of Appalachia
last week to call attention to those left out of the nation's
pageant of prosperity, his visit had a distinctly familiar air.
John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had all
made the trip more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find many of the poorest Americans living in the
shadow of rickety coal tipples in Appalachian hollows, but
Clinton's visit, in fact, had as much to do with change as
constancy. Despite the poverty that persists, Appalachia is a very
different place with very different economic development needs than
it was in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   What never seems to change is the mythology of the place as the
poster child for American poverty, an image that persists, to the
region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much times change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always glad when we get any kind of attention, because
the region remains so misunderstood,'' said Jean Haskell, director
of the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East
Tennessee State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' she said, ``what happens a lot of the time is
that images are so ingrained, we get, by definition, the same old
culture-of-poverty story. It's a very oversimplified view of the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Images of Appalachian poverty go back to regional writing of the
19th century. But that image of a place ``below the bottom looking
up to see the bottom,'' as one local mayor put it in the 1960s,
took on particular resonance during that era, when the ills of
Appalachia became a prime spur for the War on Poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Appalachia still remains poorer than the nation as a whole, and
in forlorn coal mining communities far off the interstates, life
can seem every bit as dismal as it did 35 years ago. But, by most
measures, Appalachia is becoming less a place apart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, 219 of the 406 counties in the region qualified as
distressed, meaning they had poverty and unemployment levels 150
percent of the national norm, and per capita income two-thirds or
more below the national norm. Today 108 counties are listed as
distressed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, 31 percent of the people in the region lived in poverty
compared with 22 percent nationally. Now the poverty rate is 15
percent, just two points above the national average. Once an
educational wasteland, the region now has a high school graduation
rate slightly above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the region has not shared in the current prosperity. But
from the manufacturing hub of Tupelo, Miss., to the aerospace
center at Huntsville, Ala., to the glutted tourism scene in
Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, Tenn., or the booming retirement and
second-home meccas in Asheville, Cashiers or Highlands, N.C., much
of Appalachia is basking in the same economic glow as the rest of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is the region has progressed
tremendously in the 34 years since Johnson went there,'' said Jesse
White, the federal co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional
Commission, which was established in 1965 to promote economic
development. It is headed each year by a federal appointee and by a
governor of one of the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the old images persist, and were probably reinforced by
Clinton's trip, a subject that people in the region view with very
mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Appalachia has benefited enormously because of
its down-and-out image.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Appalachian Regional Commission has approved
spending $7.4 billion in the region, which covers parts of 13
states. Nearly two thirds of that has gone to build 2,400 of an
anticipated 3,000 miles of highway.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is a short step or two from the image of
pervasive poverty to the stereotype of inbred, gap-toothed
hillbillies who, needy or not, are not necessarily the most likely
targets for corporate recruiters looking for attractive expansion
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to call attention to the problems to get the proper
kind of focus,'' said West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood, the other
commission co-chairman. ``But if you overplay it, then it just adds
to the morale problems and the loss of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   There was both praise for and skepticism about Clinton's talk of
new markets, investment and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   And a bleak analysis would say that, despite the progress, the
region faces enormous new hurdles because its traditional strengths
in natural resources do not go as far in an age defined by
microchips rather than coal mines.
</P>
<P>
   But both White and Ms. Haskell said that the trip reflected a
contemporary approach to the region's economic development _ more
focused on entrepreneurship and long-term investment than on
smokestack chasing or anti-poverty programs. In that sense, White
said, maybe the imagery of the region will finally begin to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very different trip than the one LBJ took in the
1960s,'' he said. ``If you remember, President Clinton's second
stop was to an electronics company started by a man who left the
region and then came back and created good-paying jobs. The last
thing we wanted was for the bad news of Appalachia to be the only
story that came out of this trip.''

 UNDATED: private schools.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the high end, though, public schools did at least as well as
private ones. Statewide, 5 percent of private school students and
5.6 percent of public school students, excluding those in special
education, scored in the top category; in New York City, the
numbers are 3 percent for private and 3.5 percent for public.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual Catholic schools excelled. At St. Jerome's in
the South Bronx, 29 percent of the students passed the test, ahead
of all but one surrounding public school. Nearby Catholic schools
did much worse, with St. Pius V, for instance, having only 11
percent passing. St. Jerome's is one of New York City's poorest
parishes, where income averages $5,000 per person, said the Rev.
John O. Grange, the parish priest. Some students are the children
of poor, illiterate Mexican immigrants, on scholarship. But Father
Grange said most of the students are slightly better off than those
in nearby public schools. Tuition is $2,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   But in middle-class neighborhoods, public schools tended to
outscore Catholic schools. In affluent Bayside, Queens, for
instance, 81 percent of public-school students passed the test,
compared with 60 percent in Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   Among the independent schools that took the test, variations in
performance discourage sweeping conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The Trinity School on the Upper West Side was one of the top
performers in the state, with 98 percent passing, 30 percent in the
top level, and just 2 percent below standard.. At Manhattan Country
School on the East Side, more children scored in the middle, with
94 percent passing, but only 0.3 percent at the top and 6 percent
below standard. At the Cathedral School in Morningside Heights,
only six students took the test, indicating the danger of making
too much of statistics at all.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, said Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, is that no one type of school is inherently
better or worse. ``You can't really make a blanket statement,'' Dr.
Ravitch said. ``A parent can only make a judgment about what's good
for their own child.''

<P>
   The duffel bag full of diamonds makes for a great plot twist, no
doubt about it. Also the ``to do'' list that began, ``Launder
money.'' All in all, the tale of Martin Frankel is already making a
most satisfying addition to the lore of that most modern of
outlaws, the fugitive financier.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a surprising number of them in the last three
decades, with Robert Vesco being perhaps the most notorious. And
their stories serve as a reminder that even millions of dollars of
loot cannot buy happiness, at least when you're on the lam. A good
safe haven is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was a reclusive stock trader who operated from
Greenwich, Conn., where secretive money managers are thick on the
ground. But last year, while John Meriwether and the crew at
Long-Term Capital Management were legitimately losing billions of
dollars through complex trades and threatening the foundations of
the world financial system, prosecutors say Frankel was engaged in
a rather different economic activity: looting insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel disappeared in early May, shortly before firefighters in
Greenwich were called to one of his estates to douse a smoldering
filing cabinet. Investigators found, among other things, the ``to
do'' list, as well as astrological charts created to help answer
the question, ``Should I leave?''
</P>
<P>
   The stars must have been auspicious; Frankel has disappeared,
along with millions (perhaps billions) of dollars, according to
prosecutors and court documents. A diamond dealer has confirmed
that he sold Frankel $10 million worth of stones, and that
associates of the financier packed them up in two suitcases and a
duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel is believed to be hiding in Europe now, but only after
having looked into countries elsewhere that have been safe havens
for other financial fraudsters.
</P>
<P>
   One was Brazil, where Ronald Biggs has become something of a
tourist attraction. Biggs helped pull off Britain's Great Train
Robbery in 1963, and escaped from prison in 1965; he surfaced in
South America in 1970, and has since managed to fend off all
efforts to extradite him (Brazil's excuse was that Biggs had
fathered a son there who would be hurt if his father was sent back
to face the music).
</P>
<P>
   Another spot Frankel studied, according to documents he left
behind, was Israel, which grants citizenship to almost any Jew who
chooses to immigrate (gangster Meyer Lansky was an exception).
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli citizenship did not help Eddie Antar, also known as
Crazy Eddie, whose chain of electronics stores collapsed in 1989.
He disappeared shortly thereafter, and prosecutors and lawyers for
the company's shareholders discovered that Antar had spirited
millions of dollars to Switzerland, Lichtenstein, England, Canada
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Antar may indeed have been a little nuts; the U.S. marshals got
on to him after he demanded that Swiss police help him get access
to a frozen bank account. He had apparently been living the high
life on several continents under several names but was based in
Israel, where he was arrested in 1992; he was sent back to the
United States, where he ultimately pleaded guilty to racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland may be the best haven of all, depending on what you
are charged with. Tax evasion is not cause for extradition there,
which is why Marc Rich is flourishing in the Alpine town of Zug. A
commodities trader accused of tax cheating, he fled to Switzerland
in 1984, and until 1994 ran an extremely successful trading
operation.
</P>
<P>
   For foreign-born swindlers, the United States appears to be a
popular destination. The Irish Times recently reported on the case
of Finbarr Ross, whose financial empire collapsed in 1984 owing
investors millions of pounds. He was arrested last year in
Oklahoma, where he had become an ordained minister at the Light of
Christ Church in the small town of Talequah.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean islands may seem alluring, but they do not always work
out. In the 1980s, J. David Dominelli convinced San Diego's high
society that he was a crackerjack currency trader who would make
them millions. He wasn't and he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   When his scheme collapsed, he fled to Montserrat, a British
colony where he had set up a bank. Maybe he shouldn't have held
that news conference; in any event, he was booted out and sent back
to Miami, where he was arrested. He was sentenced to 20 years for
fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a low profile can be hard for truly proficient
fraudsters. David Friedland, a former New Jersey state senator,
faked his death by staging a scuba-diving accident in the Bahamas
in 1985. Soon he was indicted for stealing $20 million from a union
pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he turned up in the Maldive Islands in the
Indian Ocean, which is pretty much as far from everything as a
fugitive can get. But his flashy style and success as a businessman
(he had a chain of scuba shops) had attracted too much attention,
federal marshals said after they arrested him in 1987. They added
that he had posed for a photo used on a tourism postcard, which may
not have been a great move, stealth-wise.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to fugitive financiers, nobody beats Vesco,
who could have been dreamed up by Graham Greene (or Ian Fleming).
To avoid charges that he had stolen more than $200 million from a
European mutual fund, Vesco fled in 1972 to Costa Rica, which at
the time was a haven for the legally challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Buying influence seems to have been part of his modus operandi;
in addition to contributing to Costa Rican officials, he made an
illegal $200,000 campaign contribution to Richard Nixon. He was
also indicted in the United States in 1989 on charges of organizing
drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with buying governments, however, is that they do
not always stay bought. In the late 1970s, Vesco was forced to move
to the Bahamas, and then, in the 1980s, to Cuba. He appeared to
live under the protection of Fidel Castro, and maintained the usual
trappings of a successful financial fugitive: houses, cars, planes,
yachts and flunkies.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, Cuba charged Vesco with fraud in connection
with a company that was supposed to be developing a cure for
cancer. He was convicted and, when last heard of, was serving a
13-year sentence in a Cuban prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear exactly what ran out, Vesco's money or his luck
(or Castro's patience). But at least it narrows the search for the
latest fugitive financier: Frankel probably has no plans to move to
Havana.

money.'' All in all, the tale of Martin Frankel is already making a
most satisfying addition to the lore of that most modern of
outlaws, the fugitive financier.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a surprising number of them in the last three
decades, with Robert Vesco being perhaps the most notorious. And
their stories serve as a reminder that even millions of dollars of
loot cannot buy happiness, at least when you're on the lam. A good
safe haven is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was a reclusive stock trader who operated from
Greenwich, Conn., where secretive money managers are thick on the
ground. But last year, while John Meriwether and the crew at
Long-Term Capital Management were legitimately losing billions of
dollars through complex trades and threatening the foundations of
the world financial system, prosecutors say Frankel was engaged in
a rather different economic activity: looting insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel disappeared in early May, shortly before firefighters in
Greenwich were called to one of his estates to douse a smoldering
filing cabinet. Investigators found, among other things, the ``to
do'' list, as well as astrological charts created to help answer
the question, ``Should I leave?''
</P>
<P>
   The stars must have been auspicious; Frankel has disappeared,
along with millions (perhaps billions) of dollars, according to
prosecutors and court documents. A diamond dealer has confirmed
that he sold Frankel $10 million worth of stones, and that
associates of the financier packed them up in two suitcases and a
duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel is believed to be hiding in Europe now, but only after
having looked into countries elsewhere that have been safe havens
for other financial fraudsters.
</P>
<P>
   One was Brazil, where Ronald Biggs has become something of a
tourist attraction. Biggs helped pull off Britain's Great Train
Robbery in 1963, and escaped from prison in 1965; he surfaced in
South America in 1970, and has since managed to fend off all
efforts to extradite him (Brazil's excuse was that Biggs had
fathered a son there who would be hurt if his father was sent back
to face the music).
</P>
<P>
   Another spot Frankel studied, according to documents he left
behind, was Israel, which grants citizenship to almost any Jew who
chooses to immigrate (gangster Meyer Lansky was an exception).
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli citizenship did not help Eddie Antar, also known as
Crazy Eddie, whose chain of electronics stores collapsed in 1989.
He disappeared shortly thereafter, and prosecutors and lawyers for
the company's shareholders discovered that Antar had spirited
millions of dollars to Switzerland, Lichtenstein, England, Canada
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Antar may indeed have been a little nuts; the U.S. marshals got
on to him after he demanded that Swiss police help him get access
to a frozen bank account. He had apparently been living the high
life on several continents under several names but was based in
Israel, where he was arrested in 1992; he was sent back to the
United States, where he ultimately pleaded guilty to racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland may be the best haven of all, depending on what you
are charged with. Tax evasion is not cause for extradition there,
which is why Marc Rich is flourishing in the Alpine town of Zug. A
commodities trader accused of tax cheating, he fled to Switzerland
in 1984, and until 1994 ran an extremely successful trading
operation.
</P>
<P>
   For foreign-born swindlers, the United States appears to be a
popular destination. The Irish Times recently reported on the case
of Finbarr Ross, whose financial empire collapsed in 1984 owing
investors millions of pounds. He was arrested last year in
Oklahoma, where he had become an ordained minister at the Light of
Christ Church in the small town of Talequah.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean islands may seem alluring, but they do not always work
out. In the 1980s, J. David Dominelli convinced San Diego's high
society that he was a crackerjack currency trader who would make
them millions. He wasn't and he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   When his scheme collapsed, he fled to Montserrat, a British
colony where he had set up a bank. Maybe he shouldn't have held
that news conference; in any event, he was booted out and sent back
to Miami, where he was arrested. He was sentenced to 20 years for
fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a low profile can be hard for truly proficient
fraudsters. David Friedland, a former New Jersey state senator,
faked his death by staging a scuba-diving accident in the Bahamas
in 1985. Soon he was indicted for stealing $20 million from a union
pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he turned up in the Maldive Islands in the
Indian Ocean, which is pretty much as far from everything as a
fugitive can get. But his flashy style and success as a businessman
(he had a chain of scuba shops) had attracted too much attention,
federal marshals said after they arrested him in 1987. They added
that he had posed for a photo used on a tourism postcard, which may
not have been a great move, stealth-wise.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to fugitive financiers, nobody beats Vesco,
who could have been dreamed up by Graham Greene (or Ian Fleming).
To avoid charges that he had stolen more than $200 million from a
European mutual fund, Vesco fled in 1972 to Costa Rica, which at
the time was a haven for the legally challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Buying influence seems to have been part of his modus operandi;
in addition to contributing to Costa Rican officials, he made an
illegal $200,000 campaign contribution to Richard Nixon. He was
also indicted in the United States in 1989 on charges of organizing
drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with buying governments, however, is that they do
not always stay bought. In the late 1970s, Vesco was forced to move
to the Bahamas, and then, in the 1980s, to Cuba. He appeared to
live under the protection of Fidel Castro, and maintained the usual
trappings of a successful financial fugitive: houses, cars, planes,
yachts and flunkies.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, Cuba charged Vesco with fraud in connection
with a company that was supposed to be developing a cure for
cancer. He was convicted and, when last heard of, was serving a
13-year sentence in a Cuban prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear exactly what ran out, Vesco's money or his luck
(or Castro's patience). But at least it narrows the search for the
latest fugitive financier: Frankel probably has no plans to move to
Havana.

IN U.S. POLITICS, LEFT AND RIGHT ARE CROSSING PATHS

<P>
   The bedfellows get stranger and stranger: Rep. Henry Hyde, the
anti-abortion, right-wing Republican, joins forces with Rep. Barney
Frank, the gay, left-wing Democrat, to curb federal power in
property forfeiture; Ron Unz, the conservative Republican who
helped end bilingual education in California, argues against school
vouchers in the pages of The Nation, a leftist magazine; the
Clinton administration fights its longtime allies, the trade
unions, over their support of steel import quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Politics has long forged odd alliances but there is clearly
something significant happening to the national debate when
give-peace-a-chance Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and the
front-runner for each party's presidential nomination slams the
door on traditional party militants to capture the political center
when the nomination process has barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, when people were described as ``on the left'' or
``on the right,'' liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican,
their views on a range of issues _ on religion and state,
education, war and peace, taxation _ could be inferred. That's no
longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who tried for years to kill the federal Education
Department now want to be known as the education party. The
Democrats, whose long commitment to fighting poverty was evident
last week in President Clinton's tour of the nation's poor areas,
have effectively ended welfare. And the White House, sounding like
a group of Rockefeller Republicans, says a keystone of foreign
policy should be opening the world to U.S. exports and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the big issues that used to divide the left and right _
the Cold War, inflation, crime, welfare _ have just collapsed as
partisan issues,'' said Francis Fukuyama, a professor of public
policy at George Mason University. Fukuyama predicted, in some
fashion, the current confusion a decade ago with a much-discussed
article in The National Interest magazine titled ``The End of
History?'' in which he argued that liberal democracy and a
market-oriented economy together form the only viable option for
modern societies.
</P>
<P>
   Fukuyama was dismissed by those who noted that history, far from
ending, quickly found other conflicts on which to focus: The era of
the angry white male in American politics, followed by the Clinton
impeachment fight, made reports of the death of ideology and the
end of the culture war seem premature.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some believe that the big conflicts are far from over,
that a vague and dangerous centrism has masked, not solved, them.
Republican conservatives, disenchanted by the party's abandonment
of the crusade against abortion and other matters they consider pro
family, said in June they might start a new party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relativism that is being so widely adopted may be the
dominant culture, but there is another culture that is very
uncomfortable with it and is resisting it,'' said conservative
historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, whose book ``One Nation, Two
Cultures'' is to be published this fall by Knopf. ``There are many
of us who are still resisting the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional left is no less incensed by what it sees as the
nation's acquiescence to the Reaganism of the 1980s _ the end of
welfare, the growing resegregation of American schools, the wide
acceptance of the death penalty and the lack of availability of
health care for millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the failure of communism has a lot
to do with the marginalization of the left,'' said Katha Pollitt, a
columnist for The Nation. ``But for me the central value of the
left is a commitment to equality, including economic equality, and
we have less of that today than we had 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, few in this country or abroad argue much any more
with Fukuyama's point about the centrality of markets to modern
societies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hue, national secretary of the French Communist Party,
which in the 1970s and '80s maintained a firm Marxist line, said
recently: ``The Communists are not adversaries of the market. The
Communists have broken with the statist vision of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The leftist governments in Britain and Germany are further
evidence of this change. When the Labor Party leader Tony Blair was
elected prime minister in Britain, a London tabloid ran a
caricature of him dressed in baby clothes as his Conservative
predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, cooed, ``It's a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia today, Communists are considered conservatives and
free-marketers liberals. In Israel, the group that most resembles
the founding socialist Zionists, with their frowzy clothes,
collectivist vision and unyielding dedication, are the right-wing
Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk among former leftists here and in Europe of
something they call the third way, or what may be seen as
capitalism with a conscience. But it is pretty hard to distinguish
it from the compassionate conservatism that serves as the rallying
cry of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the eclipse of the left has clearly played a major
role in the shift, the demise of the right is equally significant.
Paul Weyrich, who coined the phrase ``moral majority'' in the 1970s
and was the godfather of what became a substantial political
movement, said recently that the effort had ended in failure. He
recently urged his adherents to ``tune out and drop out,'' sounding
rather like '60s-era liberals frustrated by the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he will not require judicial nominees to oppose
abortion, which had been a standard Republican position. Evangelist
Pat Robertson has said: ``There's no way that we are going to pass
a constitutional amendment banning abortion. It's just not going to
happen.''

<P>
   A few months ago, when Weyrich said, ``We lost the culture
war,'' he was referring to the fact that most Americans did not
view Clinton's extramarital sex and lies as the basis for
impeachment, but he was also casting the issue in larger terms:
efforts to expunge '60s-era personal morals had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Wolfe, a professor of political science at Boston College,
agrees in some sense with Weyrich. He spent several years
interviewing middle-class Americans for his book ``One Nation,
After All'' (Viking, 1998) and found that most people are far more
tolerant of others and other ways of life than is often assumed.
</P>
<P>
   As Wolfe puts his findings now, ``The right won the economic
war, the left won the cultural war and the center won the political
war.''
</P>
<P>
   While most analysts agree that the nation seems to be entering
an uncharted era of consensual politics, they don't agree on why.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lind, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation in
Washington, has argued in a series of books and articles that what
is really going on is that a university-trained professional
``overclass'' has managed to suppress discussion of class conflicts
that are as powerful as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the new ruling class, Lind argues, is increased
wealth and comfort for itself, and anything that interferes _ curbs
on immigration, labor or free trade, which would make it harder to
find domestic help and cheap employees and the purchase of products
it wants _ is opposed by all members of the class, whether they
call themselves Democrats or Republicans, liberals or
conservatives. Disagreements over so-called wedge issues, Lind
maintains, are a ruse aimed at making the rest of the nation
believe there is debate going on.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Postrel, editor of Reason magazine, a libertarian
monthly, has a different interpretation. In her book ``The Future
and Its Enemies'' (Free Press, 1998), she contends that the old
categories of left and right have lost their usefulness because the
world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A defining question in one era _ whether to nationalize the
railroads, give women the vote, outlaw racial segregation or
abolish the draft _ may be settled and therefore meaningless in
another,'' she writes. ``Nowadays, `conservatives' may support
careers for women, and `liberals' may back the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Postrel urges abandoning traditional political categories
and creating new ones, namely ``dynamists'' _ those who accept and
promote innovation _ and ``stasists,'' who favor a regulated,
engineered world. She clearly comes down on the side of the
dynamists, arguing that only through unregulated experimentation
will society advance materially and intellectually.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of information and technological innovation,
she argues, central planning bodies are impotent; only freedom,
even chaos, will do. By promoting such practices, she says,
societies will progress; by squelching them, they will go the way
of centrally planned governments.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new idea but has come to a kind of fruition. Half
a century ago, conservative economist Friedrich Hayek argued that
socialism had no future because in a modern economy the vast
majority of information generated is local in character and
requires higher and higher degrees of sophistication to grasp. As a
result, distant managers or bureaucrats are unlikely to be
sufficiently nimble or informed to make good decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is not only Soviet-style governments that have been
forced to undergo change but large corporations like IBM, which
nearly collapsed and has had to create more entrepreneurial styles
of work for its employees. With such a focus on individual
initiative and the accompanying access to vast quantities of
information, it is not surprising that broad ideological approaches
are losing out to a case-by-case, problem-solving one. Nor is it
surprising that with increased exposure to other people and ideas
has come increased tolerance and openness to other ways of life.
</P>
<P>
   Unz, the California activist who fought bilingual education,
says he opposes school vouchers because, while competition and
marketing may be good for selling sneakers or soft drinks, they are
bad for public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call myself a Ronald Reagan Republican but I look at things
on a case-by-case basis,'' said Unz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur
who is also pushing campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely appropriate that Silicon Valley has become one of
the country's focal points because its arresting combination of
market economics and informal personal and social behavior _
Reaganesque politics of the 1980s and Clintonesque morals of the
'60s _ seems to define the nation today. Many had previously
thought the two incompatible. Sociologist Daniel Bell once wrote of
the inherent contradiction between the Protestant ethic of
capitalism and the hedonism it created. And Reagan Republicans
tended to think of their goal as reversing the trends of the '60s.
Yet many analysts argue today that the Reaganites accomplished
their own revolution without really shifting the society as they
had hoped; they may have curbed the extremes of the 1960s but much
of the rest has been absorbed into mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lilla, a political philosopher at New York University,
wrote in The New York Review of Books in May that the two
revolutions are coexisting nicely right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are these,'' he wrote. ``The '60s happened, Reagan
happened and for the foreseeable future they will together define
our political horizon. As anyone who deals with young people today
knows, Americans find no difficulty in reconciling the two in their
daily lives. They see no contradiction in holding down day jobs in
the unfettered global marketplace _ the Reaganite dream, the left
nightmare _ and spending weekends immersed in a moral and cultural
universe shaped by the 60's.''

</P>
<P>
   This is not a new idea but has come to a kind of fruition. Half
a century ago, conservative economist Friedrich Hayek argued that
socialism had no future because in a modern economy the vast
majority of information generated is local in character and
requires higher and higher degrees of sophistication to grasp. As a
result, distant managers or bureaucrats are unlikely to be
sufficiently nimble or informed to make good decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is not only Soviet-style governments that have been
forced to undergo change but large corporations like IBM, which
nearly collapsed and has had to create more entrepreneurial styles
of work for its employees. With such a focus on individual
initiative and the accompanying access to vast quantities of
information, it is not surprising that broad ideological approaches
are losing out to a case-by-case, problem-solving one. Nor is it
surprising that with increased exposure to other people and ideas
has come increased tolerance and openness to other ways of life.
</P>
<P>
   Unz, the California activist who fought bilingual education,
says he opposes school vouchers because, while competition and
marketing may be good for selling sneakers or soft drinks, they are
bad for public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call myself a Ronald Reagan Republican but I look at things
on a case-by-case basis,'' said Unz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur
who is also pushing campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely appropriate that Silicon Valley has become one of
the country's focal points because its arresting combination of
market economics and informal personal and social behavior _
Reaganesque politics of the 1980s and Clintonesque morals of the
'60s _ seems to define the nation today. Many had previously
thought the two incompatible. Sociologist Daniel Bell once wrote of
the inherent contradiction between the Protestant ethic of
capitalism and the hedonism it created. And Reagan Republicans
tended to think of their goal as reversing the trends of the '60s.
Yet many analysts argue today that the Reaganites accomplished
their own revolution without really shifting the society as they
had hoped; they may have curbed the extremes of the 1960s but much
of the rest has been absorbed into mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lilla, a political philosopher at New York University,
wrote in The New York Review of Books in May that the two
revolutions are coexisting nicely right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are these,'' he wrote. ``The '60s happened, Reagan
happened and for the foreseeable future they will together define
our political horizon. As anyone who deals with young people today
knows, Americans find no difficulty in reconciling the two in their
daily lives. They see no contradiction in holding down day jobs in
the unfettered global marketplace _ the Reaganite dream, the left
nightmare _ and spending weekends immersed in a moral and cultural
universe shaped by the 60's.''

   WASHINGTON _ It's not every day that Jesse Helms and the Beastie
Boys find themselves comrades in arms.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee and the hip-hop group have in common is contempt for
China for its treatment of Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   The Beasties hold concerts to support the Dalai Lama. Helms
leads the conservative charge against the Clinton administration's
China policy _ coddling dictators to make a buck, he says _ and
inveighs against the World Bank, which he and his allies lump
together with the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund
and other mysterious institutions that often go their own way.
</P>
<P>
   This alliance of convenience came together recently in a
remarkable face-off between Washington and the World Bank over a
development project so small and out of the way that it would
usually attract little notice: A $40 million effort to relocate
58,000 of China's poorest farmers _ they make $60 a year _ to more
fertile land in Qinghai province in western China.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that they would be moving into territory the
Tibetans consider part of their original homeland, even though most
maps show it outside Tibet and the Chinese consider it non-Tibetan
land. Critics said the bank was aiding China's effort to dilute the
minority Tibetan population _ and doing so in the province that was
the birthplace of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies an unusual tale of Washington lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks the Tibet lobby _ best known for patrons like
Richard Gere and Harrison Ford but power-challenged by Washington's
usual measures _ mobilized allies on the far left and the far
right. In a flash it reversed White House policy, and led the
administration's nominee for Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers,
to announce that the United States would try to block the loan. The
World Bank emerged bloodied, and agreed to study the issue anew. It
was a feat that the city's highly paid power brokers could only
admire.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, only the lobbyists with the deepest pockets and the
busiest PACs get that kind of attention. Silicon Valley, source of
all those new-economy campaign contributions, won two tremendous
victories recently: limiting damages from suits arising from Year
2000 computer bugs, and convincing the administration to relax
export controls on powerful but widely available computers,
including sales to China. After years of wrangling, the House
finally passed a financial restructuring bill this month that was
so hotly contested by banks and brokerages, and for so many years,
that many thought Congress would debate it forever to keep the
money flowing in from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while the stars align in a way that smaller
and far less wealthy groups can score a big victory. It helps if
they show pictures of crushing poverty or tell stories of
repression and _ most important _ side with politicians who may
have ulterior agendas. The Tibetan crowd did all of that and won at
least a partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a culmination of forces that have been gathering
steam for years,'' said John Kenneth Knaus, who spent four decades
at the CIA helping the Tibetan resistance fight the Chinese and
recently recounted that struggle in a book, ``Orphans of the Cold
War'' (Public Affairs, 1999). ``They have always been a very
cohesive group, and their story has always had a great appeal in
Congress. But this time they got further.''
</P>
<P>
   China occupied Tibet in 1950, and Tibet's political fortunes
have waxed and waned in Washington depending on the prevailing mood
toward Beijing. China considers it a province, and screams whenever
it believes Washington is meddling in its internal affairs. When
the 64-year-old Dalai Lama shows up in Washington, he is handled
like a chunk of plutonium, meeting the president in diplomatically
staged ``drop by'' visits, sitting in the offices of lesser
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever the Tibet lobbyists had an opportunity, this was the
moment. The accusations of Chinese spying at nuclear laboratories
in the United States and the anti-American protests after the
accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade have left
Congressional conservatives looking for a quick, cost-free way to
lash out at China. Human rights groups have concluded that the
administration's China policy is one of toothless, token
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Onto this battlefield walked the World Bank, whose savvy
president, James Wolfensohn, usually sees land mines ahead and
saunters around them. But China was pressing for this loan as part
of a last series of interest-free deals that end after June 30. The
details were rushed. The environmental studies were done once over
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not only politically offensive,'' said Dana Clark, a
senior attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law.
``It was done in violation of the bank's own policies.'' Meanwhile
China threatened to end its relations with the bank if the loan was
denied _ a step that would give the West less control over
Beijing's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai Lama,
and the International Campaign for Tibet were swinging into action.
Members of the Senate were lined up to ask about the program at
Summers' confirmation hearing. The Treasury, not looking for a
fight at a sensitive time, immediately agreed to oppose the plan.
So did Germany. World Bank officials were called to a meeting on
Capitol Hill and saw the future.
</P>
<P>
   A World Bank official quipped, ``When you have a coalition of
students in California with body piercings saying the same thing as
Jesse Helms, you are on a highway to nowhere.'' On the left and the
right, the official said, the message to the bank was simple: ``If
you do this, we will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn tried to travel to the region himself, then sent a
team to reconfirm that the resettlement of the farmers would be
voluntary, and that children would attend schools reflecting their
ethnic backgrounds. ``This is the first time most of these children
will get a school,'' he said. China, he added, didn't need the
bank's money _ but with it, the West would have a voice in what
China does in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the World Bank's board approved the loan for the
resettlement _ in part because it feared the United States was
moving on an isolationist path that would only worsen relations
with China. But the Chinese won't get the money until an
independent review board within the World Bank looks at the
project. The Tibetan lobby vows to be back.  &QL;

   ``Papa Hemingway'' eyewear, starting at $300, evokes a fashion
mystique. Hemingway himself had a dimmer view of spectacles. A.E.
Hotchner, a friend and biographer, recalled Hemingway's description
of how he bought his first eyeglasses in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   When I hit New York I went to see an eye doctor. That's when I
got my first glasses. I went out of the office with them on and I
saw things so clearly for the first time in my life, I began to get
nauseated. I was only a block from Bob Benchley's, so I went up to
his place and we both got cockeyed drunk and that got me over the
nausea.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Papa Hemingway: A Personal Memoir'' (Random House, 1966)
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 Lillian Ross portrayed a garrulous, rambunctious
Hemingway on a trip to New York City. ``He had on steel-rimmed
spectacles, with a piece of paper under the nose-piece,'' she
wrote. Hemingway's fourth wife, Mary, insisted that he buy a coat
and fix his eyeglasses:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to buy Papa a coat.'' Hemingway grunted and leaned
against the car. ``A nice, rainproof coat,'' Mrs. Hemingway said.
``And he's got to get his glasses fixed. He needs some good, soft
padding for the nose-piece. It cuts him up brutally. He's had that
same piece of paper under the nose-piece for weeks. When he really
wants to get cleaned up, he changes the paper.'' Hemingway grunted
again.

   ``Our products are based on the life-style of Ernest
Hemingway,'' says Alex Malouf Jr., president of the John Richard
Collection, which sells Hemingway home-decor accessories, including
mirrors and wall art. Hemingway safari jackets, fishing caps and
vests have also been licensed. These tributes would have created
considerable merriment at Sloppy Joe's, the Key West, Fla., saloon
that was a Hemingway haunt and where the bartender referred to the
writer and his third wife, Martha Gellhorn, as ``beauty and the
beast.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison more aptly applied to Hemingway, in his
odoriferous Basque shorts tied in the middle with a piece of rope
... ``I am really not abnormally clean,'' Martha would protest many
years later. ``But Ernest was extremely dirty, one of the most
unfastidious men I've ever known.''

   Once, when going away on a trip, Martha asked a friend to look
after her husband:
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your eye on this big clown, see that he's shaved and
cleaned up when you go out on the town.'' While this injunction was
superficially affectionate, it was actually a sign of tension, for
Hemingway's lack of cleanliness was rapidly becoming a serious
problem for Martha. ``The Pig'' was the rather edgy term of
endearment she had fastened on him.

   Thomasville Furniture says Key West and Havana, two places where
the author had homes, are among the locales that ``weave a
beautiful tapestry'' of the Hemingway domestic life style. Others
had a less romantic view of chez Papa. In 1922, the young Hemingway
and his first wife, Hadley, lived in a cheap apartment in Paris
with a hole-in-the-floor toilet.
</P>
<P>
   From the flush-box hung a chain that, when pulled, deluged the
floor of the compartment to a depth of two inches. Those adept at
its use were able to get out of the door before their feet got wet.

   (Martha Gellhorn) objected strongly to the pack of fierce
tomcats he kept in Cuba, which smelled fearfully and were allowed
to march all over the dining room table.

same piece of paper under the nose-piece for weeks. When he really
wants to get cleaned up, he changes the paper.'' Hemingway grunted
again.

   ``Our products are based on the life-style of Ernest
Hemingway,'' says Alex Malouf Jr., president of the John Richard
Collection, which sells Hemingway home-decor accessories, including
mirrors and wall art. Hemingway safari jackets, fishing caps and
vests have also been licensed. These tributes would have created
considerable merriment at Sloppy Joe's, the Key West, Fla., saloon
that was a Hemingway haunt and where the bartender referred to the
writer and his third wife, Martha Gellhorn, as ``beauty and the
beast.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison more aptly applied to Hemingway, in his
odoriferous Basque shorts tied in the middle with a piece of rope
... ``I am really not abnormally clean,'' Martha would protest many
years later. ``But Ernest was extremely dirty, one of the most
unfastidious men I've ever known.''

   Once, when going away on a trip, Martha asked a friend to look
after her husband:
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your eye on this big clown, see that he's shaved and
cleaned up when you go out on the town.'' While this injunction was
superficially affectionate, it was actually a sign of tension, for
Hemingway's lack of cleanliness was rapidly becoming a serious
problem for Martha. ``The Pig'' was the rather edgy term of
endearment she had fastened on him.

   Thomasville Furniture says Key West and Havana, two places where
the author had homes, are among the locales that ``weave a
beautiful tapestry'' of the Hemingway domestic life style. Others
had a less romantic view of chez Papa. In 1922, the young Hemingway
and his first wife, Hadley, lived in a cheap apartment in Paris
with a hole-in-the-floor toilet.
</P>
<P>
   From the flush-box hung a chain that, when pulled, deluged the
floor of the compartment to a depth of two inches. Those adept at
its use were able to get out of the door before their feet got wet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before NATO's bombs stopped falling in
Yugoslavia, the Pentagon's war planners and like-minded lawmakers
on Capitol Hill started asking a question that would have seemed
unthinkable not long ago: Is America's military too small?
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the Soviet bloc fell apart, the nation's
four major armed services have steadily shrunk, both in size and
weaponry. In 1989 there were 2.13 million men and women on active
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. In 1999 there are
1.36 million, a 36 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the number of peacekeeping missions,
relief efforts and other military operations has proliferated _
from the Persian Gulf to the Caribbean, from Bosnia to Kosovo.
Eight years after Saddam Hussein was evicted from Kuwait, the
United States and Britain still patrol over much of Iraq from bases
in the Persian Gulf and Turkey. And since last December, U.S.
pilots have been skirmishing with Iraq's air defenses every few
days.
</P>
<P>
   From missile shots against Islamic terrorist Osama Bin Laden to
drug interdiction in Latin America, the Pentagon's commanders say
the U.S. military today is as consumed with what they call
``operations other than war'' as a much larger force was with
fighting Cold War proxy battles and preparing to stop a Soviet
invasion of Western Europe. The new assignments, they complain, are
straining the downsized military, perhaps to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation where we have a smaller force and we have
more missions,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate's
defense appropriations subcommittee in May. ``We are wearing out
systems. We are wearing out people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assertions seem to guarantee a renewed debate about just
how large a military the United States needs _ particularly since
the questions have arisen just as the Clinton administration and
Congress are eyeing enormous budget surpluses and considering the
first increases in the defense budget since the early years of
Ronald Reagan's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the increases proposed so far have been earmarked for
new weapons, repairs and training, they have also opened the
possibility of expanding personnel, which is by far the most costly
item in the budget because it involves salaries, pensions and
benefits. And that, to some, is no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the services are positioning themselves for the fight
for their part of the budget surpluses,'' said Steven Kosiak,
director of budget studies at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's 78-day air war against Yugoslavia was a resounding
victory for the U.S. military. But the war also exposed weaknesses.
At the height of the bombing, the United States had more than 800
aircraft and 37,500 people committed to the fight. The Air Force,
in particular, was strained, with 40 to 45 percent of its entire
force somehow involved _ a higher percentage than was devoted to
war in either Vietnam or the Persian Gulf, according to a senior
officer. In certain areas, the strain was even greater.
Three-quarters of the force's aerial tanker crews, for example,
were used in the air war.
</P>
<P>
   The effort forced the Pentagon to scale back operations
elsewhere, raising questions about the nation's ability to fight
two major regional wars at once, a core tenet of the military's
strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, pulled out aircraft
patrolling northern Iraq from a base in Turkey to devote them to
pummeling Yugoslavia. (When the United States launched air strikes
against Iraq last December, three months before the Kosovo war,
aircraft were diverted from hurricane relief in Central America.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that NATO's war is won, the problem has not eased, but
simply shifted to the ground. The Army is sending 7,000 soldiers to
keep the peace in Kosovo, most of them from Germany, with no
prospect of leaving soon. There are 7,700 troops in support or
refugee-relief roles in Albania and Macedonia. Nearly four years
after the civil war ended in Bosnia, there are still 6,000 soldiers
deployed there. The U.S. presence in South Korea _ now at 37,000
soldiers _ is nearing its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   This commitment to ever more scattered operations overseas is
perhaps an inevitable manifestation of America's global
pre-eminence, and that sense of permanence is behind the calls for
a reversal of the military's steady downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles Krulak, who recently retired as commandant of the
Marine Corps, said his service needs 5,000 more marines, which
would raise the total to 177,000. The Army's new chief of staff,
Gen. Eric Shinseki, said rethinking the size of the Army _ now at
467,000 soldiers _ was his first priority. Privately, Army
officials say 500,000 would be better.
</P>
<P>
   With the military already facing problems recruiting young
Americans, it is not clear how that could be accomplished. But on
Capitol Hill, lawmakers have heartily endorsed the idea _ and not
just Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to add enough personnel to the force to meet the
demands of the post-Cold War world without wearing out so many of
the wonderful men and women on whom our security depends,'' said
Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House
Armed Services Committee, in a floor speech July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers agree the military is strained, but say the
solution is to scale back its operations. They cite the 270
soldiers still deployed in Haiti and the 870 serving in a
multinational observer force on the Sinai Peninsula that has
monitored the Israel-Egypt peace since 1982. Republicans would like
to see the U.S. troops leave Bosnia, even though peace there is
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Many military analysts, however, say that the problem may not be
as serious as military officers paint it, and that solving it may
not require more troops. These critics say the size of the force
does not matter as much as how well the force is managed.
</P>
<P>
   In the world today, only China has a larger military, with an
estimated 2.5 million troops but nothing like the technological
prowess of the United States. Russia has just over one million men
and women in arms, but they are demoralized, underequipped and
underpaid (when paid at all).
</P>
<P>
   Kosiak said the U.S. military was still arrayed very much like
it was during the Cold War, when hundreds of thousands of troops
hunkered down in Europe and waited for World War III.
</P>
<P>
   The services, especially the Army, have been slow to adapt to
the increase in smaller-scale operations, he said. The military
does not need more troops, he added; it needs to streamline its
bureaucracy so it can better employ the ones it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are operations,'' Kosiak said of today's missions,
``that a military as large as the United States military should be
able to carry out.''

</P>
<P>
   The services, especially the Army, have been slow to adapt to
the increase in smaller-scale operations, he said. The military
does not need more troops, he added; it needs to streamline its
bureaucracy so it can better employ the ones it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are operations,'' Kosiak said of today's missions,
``that a military as large as the United States military should be
able to carry out.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Don't be misled by GOP's silence on abortion
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thought much about the abortion issue lately? Probably not. And
that's the idea.
</P>
<P>
   An eerie quiet has come over many of the usually clamorous
sources of abortion opposition. From Christian Coalition guru Pat
Robertson to hyper-right commentators like Cal Thomas to the pack
of Republican presidential runners wheezing ever farther behind
George W. Bush, the issue is being downplayed. If they are asked,
then, yes, they are still for criminalizing abortion once again,
but the old fire has been banked, or seems to have been.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself, although also on the record for outlawing choice,
says he would not make abortion opposition a pass-fail test for
judicial nominees _ political semaphore meant to signal that he's
not a zealot on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled, however. The play may be shifting but the game
hasn't been conceded. Rather, it is taking new forms. Two,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   First, the savvy abortion opponents have figured out that by
demanding open militance of favored political candidates, they
chase voters, especially women, away from the very candidates who,
in office, could do them the most good _ and that there's no chance
for the constitutional amendment against abortion they've been
filibustering for anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The goal now is to capture the Supreme Court. Three justices,
all GOP appointees, are in their 70s and, especially if a
Republican is elected president, likely will be stepping down in
the next presidency. Chief Justice William Rehnquist has always
opposed the Roe v. Wade decision that found an implied privacy
right to abortion in the Constitution. But one probable retiree,
John Paul Stevens, has supported Roe and another, Sandra Day
O'Connor, wavers.
</P>
<P>
   Litmus test or not, the chances of a Republican president not
appointing justices who would reverse Roe, or so deeply compromise
it as to amount to reversal, are near nil. The seeming quiet you
hear on the issue now is really the sound of a stealth campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the open political action has shifted mainly to the
state legislatures, where it makes little scary noise nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion lawmakers continue inventing ways to make the
theoretical right to abortion difficult to access, with 408
abortion-harassing laws proposed this year to last year's 335.
</P>
<P>
   New state laws have been enacted to impose special regulations
on abortion providers, bar family planning funding to groups that
provide abortion referrals, deny tax exempt status to nonprofit
organizations that have any relationship to abortion, forbid
Medicare providers to offer family planning or abortion services,
prohibit state university hospitals from performing most abortions.
And on and on. A Florida law authorizes anti-choice license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with seven new anti-abortion laws, leads the nation, its
legislature unharried in its busy work by Gov. George W. Bush.
There's less heavy crunching on the footpath but the game, as
Sherlock Holmes was wont to say, is still very much afoot.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Scant repentance from Serb protesters
 &HT;    For release July 14, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each day comes new protests in Yugoslavian towns. The
protesters want Slobodan Milosovic removed from office. While that
may be comforting to the U.S. State Department and NATO, I find
something quite discomforting about it.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters seem to want Milosovic removed for the wrong
reason.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one opposition leader at a Sunday rally in
Kikinda who told the crowd, ``So much evil has been done in our
name,'' the protests principally have to do with the destruction
Milosovic's ethnic-cleansing policy brought on his fellow Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Few, save the speaker in Kikinda, appear to be addressing the
real issue: contrition for what was done to the ethnic Albanians.
Rally after rally throughout the country calls for Milosovic's
removal because of the consequences of his policy.
</P>
<P>
   Among those joining the opposition are Serbian military
personnel, angry because they have not been paid. (Are these the
guys behind the gunsights in Kosovo?) Others are contentious
because of the economic collapse of the country and its
international isolation. Every once in a while, someone will utter
something about what brought all this about: ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a rocket scientist to recognize that Milosovic,
while ordering the policy, was not the only person carrying it out.
Throughout Kosovo, thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed simply
for being ethnic Albanians. To do that _ to shoot or otherways kill
the Kosovars, to dig the mass graves and conceal them _ required
the hard work of a lot of ethnic Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   It took until 52 years after World War II for someone to write a
book about the role of ordinary German people in Hitler's
Holocaust, but one can be written right now about the role of
ordinary Serbian people in dealing with Milosovic's attempt to
clear Yugoslavia of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldhagen's 1997 ``Hitler's Willing Executioners'' would
be the model for ``Milosovic's Willing Executioners,'' because the
Serbs _ numbers unknown _ were just that.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops and civilians turned ethnic Albanians out of their
homes, killed thousands, forced hundreds of thousands of others
across the border with just the clothes on their backs, and looted
or appropriated the property the Kosovars left behind.
</P>
<P>
   (Horribly, the ethnic Albanians, their country returned to them
by outside forces, have gone to revenge, duplicating some of the
atrocities committed by the Serbs _ this time under the very noses
of NATO. A confrontation between NATO and the Kosovar militants is
inevitable.)
</P>
<P>
   When Milan Protic, a popular anti-Milosovic leader, tells the
throng that as a result of so much evil being done in Serbia's
name, ``we have suffered a lot,'' he misses the point _ unless
Protic accepts some of the responsibility on behalf of the Serbian
people.
</P>
<P>
   Milosovic's Serbia has suffered from NATO planes, a consequence
of his policy but the ethnic Albanians suffered far greater
ruination at the hands of Serbian soldiers, volunteers and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It likely is impossible for Serb and Kosovar ever to kiss and
make up, and even if Kosovo achieves total independence, there
still will be a hostile border to share.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs, particularly those demonstrating on the streets,
need to come to grips with the fact that it was they, their sons
and daughters, who participated in what has been termed the most
horrible war crimes in Europe since the end of the World War II.
</P>
<P>
   They should be saying that Milosovic not only should be turned
out but that he must answer before a war crimes tribunal. Then they
should get on their hands and knees to seek forgiveness for
implementing his ghastly policy of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   And they should be telling their protective Russian allies to
tone down the rhetoric against NATO because, after all, what NATO
fought against _ and Russia blindly supported _ was akin to what
happened to the Russian people at the hands of Germans in the 1940s
as well as via the blood binges of Joseph Stalin and some of his
successors.

 &HT;    Garage space: Real, rented, digital
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The first time I visited a self-storage
place, I was writing a story about auto theft. Someone had rented a
closet-sized storage locker and systematically disassembled a
stolen car to fit inside. It looked like an origami auto. A most
impressive sight.
</P>
<P>
   I think of that when I survey my own garage. If I could perform
a similar feat of compacting, I'd have room for everything.
</P>
<P>
   About half of it has been invaded by stuff. Random objects not
useful enough to keep inside, yet somehow not really garbage. Stuff
like my son's vintage computer-parts collection: a CGA monitor
similar to one I once saw on display at a museum, a casing for one
of the original IBM PC-clones _ like the ones the pioneers used to
pop buffalo-hide floppy disks into _ a docking station for a laptop
that hasn't been manufactured for half a decade, a Mac II ... . All
pretty much worthless. All so initially expensive I cannot bring
myself to toss them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the furniture that might just be repairable, or
refinishable or fine to use as soon as fashions change in some
breathtaking manner and avocado is rediscovered as a color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the boxes of stuff unpacked from past moves that
sit under other boxes like buried time capsules.
</P>
<P>
   And the old toys. Disposing of them is as good as admitting that
these teens will never be little kids again. Who is so heartless to
consign a My Little Pony to the landfill?
</P>
<P>
   And this is not mere sloppy living on my part. It is a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Garages and sheds around the country are overflowing into rented
storage places. These establishments are sprouting by the roadside
like mushrooms and gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a billion square feet of store-it-yourself
storage space around the country, according to industry estimates.
That's a very round number, but seems plausible enough. There are a
lot of extra tires and promising furniture refinishing projects out
there.
</P>
<P>
   We have reached an amazing level of widespread affluence in this
nation if we are buying more stuff than our houses can hold. Either
that or grand theft, auto, is a far more widespread pastime than I
was raised to expect.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see this as simple greed. Not only do people buy
more things than they can possibly use, they buy more things than
they can possibly house.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hoarding instinct goes beyond what you can buy or touch.
We now have the technology to be data hogs, virtual pack rats, the
digital equivalent of those old guys who die in houses stuffed with
old newspapers, copies of National Geographic and rolls of string
that ambulance crews must tunnel through with shovels on their way
in.
</P>
<P>
   Zip drives, Jaz drives, Clik! drive combine with monster hard
drives to allow us data storage of size once reserved for the space
program. To live a seemingly normal life yet squirrel stuff away
compulsively.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I look at this Zip disk, it's like going up into the
attic _ only without bumping my knee on a ladder or coughing
through dust.
</P>
<P>
   A Zip disk, the most-used kind, holds 100 megabytes of data in a
plastic square that looks like a slightly bloated floppy disk. It
holds about five times the data of a circa-1986 desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The disk lying here next to my computer holds my checkbooks and
credit cards activity for five years, six years worth of old
columns, three years of e-mails, drafts of letters and articles, a
genealogical program with data files, a few other useful programs,
a mysterious subdirectory marked ``Misc'' and about a dozen
photographs. These words will end up parked there as well. The disk
is not full yet and there's a blank one waiting nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Bit for bit, there is probably more primary source material
about my life on a disk or two than exists about Shakespeare, Jesus
and the Confederate Navy combined.
</P>
<P>
   This much data in the form of yellowing paper would take up a
good chunk of garage space. Knowing this, I'm not one to feel
superior to those who haul their stuff to some store-it yourself
compound. I'm their electronic equal.
</P>
<P>
   But at least I can still park the car.

 &HT;    Shopping online for auto insurance _ it's a good thing
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One Thursday night during the dreadful lull between
``Frasier'' and ``ER,'' I decided to see if I could do something
about my ridiculously high auto insurance. Back in the olden days,
I would have wandered out to wherever I kept my organizer and
scrawled ``call insurance companies about car.'' But given my
tendency to ignore most of the things I write in my organizer, I'd
still be paying many hundreds of dollars too much for car
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That night I saw an ad for an insurance company flash on the TV
with an 800 number and an Internet address. I realize I could have
called the 800 number, which the company said was available 24
hours a day, but that just would have been another item on the
seemingly endless to-do list. However, my computer is conveniently
located in the same room as the TV, and I could log on and off in
time to catch the start of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet gurus say the Net is slowly but surely creating
more-informed consumers. With nearly every major carmaker online,
buyers are walking into dealerships more informed than they once
were. Some turn up at the dealer with printouts of the make and
model they want, complete with pricing for extras and estimated
delivery charges.
</P>
<P>
   When I sat down at my computer to shop for insurance, I didn't
head directly for the insurance company advertised on TV. Instead,
I decided to see if there was some sort of insurance evaluator that
would let me enter the types of coverage I wanted and provide me
with a list of companies that could provide it and at what cost. I
decided to go this route just to see whether the outrageously
expensive insurance company I had wasn't, in reality, one of the
more reasonable companies around.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance comparison shopping is available through the Yahoo!
insurance center, or you can eliminate the middleman and go
directly to www.insweb.com. Through a secure server, users enter
information about themselves, their cars and the amount of
insurance they want. The information is processed, and insurance
companies offering the lowest rates are shown.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about shopping online for insurance, a car, a
house, a mortgage or any big-ticket item is how much control the
user has over the information-gathering experience. When the site
asks you about your current policy, you can step away from your
computer and rummage through your papers for the document without
worrying about leaving an impatient customer service representative
waiting on hold.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible to enter a user name and a password so you
can save the information you've entered. You can come back later
and not have to re-enter everything unless you need to.
</P>
<P>
   The other great thing about using the Web instead of the phone
is that the Web is available the second it occurs to you there's
something you'd like to do, whether it's checking out auto
insurance rates, buying a tie from Lands' End or reading that
newspaper article you've been meaning to get to. And if this is the
episode of ``ER'' where Carol is going to tell everyone she's
pregnant, you can just let the computer sit there and watch a
little TV before picking up exactly where you left off.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web sites offering insurance or loan quotes have this
feature, as well as a guarantee that your information is private
and secure. If you don't see a notice informing you that your
information is being sent via secure server and won't be sold to a
third party, go to another Web site or do it the old-fashioned way
and use the phone. The last thing you want is two hackers in Des
Moines knowing more about your financial situation than you do.
However, most reputable sites such as InsWeb, HomeAdvisor or the
bank mortgage calculators will have taken the appropriate security
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I was indeed paying too much _ way too much, in
fact _ for my car insurance. Not only was I able to find much more
competitive rates, I could ask to be connected to a list of
insurance agents in my neighborhood who would contact me via
e-mail. In a few days, I received a note from the insurance agent
confirming the quote listed on the Web site. Now I have a brand-new
insurance company with reasonable rates and a friendly agent.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could have done the same research by calling
individual companies and asking for quotes, but that takes time,
the kind of time most people don't have. Lots of Web sites like to
say their goal is to help busy people manage their lives.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, whenever people tell me this, I can't help but
wonder who these incredibly busy people are whose lives need all
this care and speed and hand-holding. But it's not really about
hand-holding time-crunched yuppies who want to check their stock
prices between power lunches, but rather about offering consumers
the option of getting things done in their own time on their own
schedule. As Martha Stewart would say, this is a good thing.

 &HT;    Small-town news beats the best politics has to offer
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's time for my take on last week's news _
however warped it may be.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton(END ITAL) has just
wrapped up a three-day swing through upstate New York on what's
been termed a ``listening tour'' to learn about the issues and
interests of the voters, just in case she decides to make a bid for
the Senate seat being vacated next year by the retiring Democratic
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly dairy prices and upstate air transportation problems
loom large on the first lady's agenda. And what's with the pink
pantsuit and pearls? Dressing down for the proletariat?
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani(END ITAL), the
likely Republican candidate for the same Senate seat Clinton has
been eyeballing, in an effort to call to the New York voters'
attention the fact that the first lady has no roots in their fair
state, has announced he's going to go on a fund-raising trip, too.
Guess where? Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   This is getting funnier by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)Current first lady and possible Senate candidate
Hillary Rodham Clinton(END ITAL) is house hunting. Reports have her
looking at $5 million estates in Westchester and $2 million
Manhattan apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Say what? The lady is presently unemployed and even if she does
make it to the Senate, the job doesn't pay that kind of money. And
has she forgotten that her husband, who just happens to owe $20
million in legal fees, will be out of work in another year or so?
</P>
<P>
   May we assume land deals are out?

<P>
   (SET ITAL)Wronged first lady(END ITAL) seeks Senate seat as
therapy? New York women, occasionally referred to as a ``pivotal
voting bloc'' speak out on Clinton's possible candidacy. Most are
impressed with the way she handled Bill's bimbos and think the new
job would be ``good for her'' as well as an inspiration for all
women.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how I look at it, the idea of a trend toward our
country being run by a congress of wronged women scares the hell
out of me.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)The Clinton administration(END ITAL) has announced a
$6 trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years. Hooray! Now
they're busy trying to figure out how to spend it. Boo! Hiss!
</P>
<P>
   Why not send it back where it came from? To us _ the taxpayers?
And don't forget our interest.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)Al and Bill(END ITAL) are separating. Al's nervous
about having his image tarnished with the voters. Bill's fuming.
Tipper and Hillary are doing air kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to watching everybody make nice in public but don't
expect to see them opening supermarkets together.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the rest of the news _ titillating but of lesser
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Marv Albert and his rug are back in the NBC booth after being
fired for making naughty with a lady in a Virginia hotel room. (One
more role model in the sports world?)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas is cavorting with yet another new girlfriend, an
actress by the name of Catherine Zeta-Jones. They're doing the
Continent and the British Isles. (Did he behave like this before he
played the lead in ``The American President''?)
</P>
<P>
   Alec Baldwin (another actor) has been spotted fat in the
Hamptons. (Apparently that's worse than overweight in Hoboken.)
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it, folks. A nutshell recap of last week's
late and breaking.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bit of good news, but it's all local. A neighbor
stopped on my porch to let me know that her granddaughter has
perfect attendance at school.
</P>
<P>
   Another stopped me in the grocery store to say she'd recently
lost her wallet uptown with a week's pay in it. Someone found it,
brought it to her, and refused a reward.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's the kind of news we all like to read. Why can't the
rest of the country be more like Gibsonburg?

 &HT;    Web destinations for vacation plans
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hot, your nerves are shot because the kids are
home from school for the summer, you're broke and the air
conditioner is making a strange grinding noise ... it must be time
for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   What could be better than piling the whole family in the car and
driving for hours or even days to a place that's even hotter and
that will make you more broke?
</P>
<P>
   Since so much fun awaits you, let's at least make the
preparation for the vacation as easy and inexpensive as possible.
That's where the World Wide Web comes in. You can take care of
almost everything while sitting at your computer.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our journey at a terrific site called Travel Zone at
search
</P>
<P>
   .thetrip.com/. This site uses the AltaVista search engine so _
as you would expect _ the main advantage here is the ability to
ferret out almost any vacation-planning information you need.
</P>
<P>
   You can simply type in a word or a phrase, click the button and
get dozens of links to that information. You'll also find some
helpful links on the main page that can take care of chores like
figuring conversion rates for foreign currency, finding maps,
guides to cities and airports, and ways to find low-cost airfares.
You'll also want to check out the main page (www.trip.com/), where
you'll be able to rent a car, book a hotel room, and find airline
fares and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   There's also advice aplenty, including ways to find the lowest
airfare, the way to plan what the site's designers call a
``stress-free trip'' and how to decipher airline codes for various
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's overkill ... perhaps all you really need is a
virtual road map to get you to your destination. The Web is crammed
with virtual map and travel route planning services. Here are two
good ones: MapQuest at www
</P>
<P>
   .mapquest.com/ and Yahoo!'s mapping site at
maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these sites work in much the same way. If you enter a
starting address and the address of your destination, you can get
both a map and printed turn-by-turn directions, complete with
mileage. In most cases, you'll find the directions good _ perhaps
not the route you would choose, but workable. However, as with any
other kind of directions, including the kind you'd get from a
friend, there is the fairly remote chance that you'd figure a
better way on your own. That's why it makes sense to take a peek at
the map for a common-sense check of the driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've covered sites that offer most of the conventional
tools you'll need for planning a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But for some people, vacations are true adventures ... instead
of lying on a Florida beach, they have hang gliding in South
America in mind. If you have the desire and the cash, there's a
nifty Web site that caters to unique vacations. It's called InfoHub
Specialty Travel Guide and can be found at www.infohub
</P>
<P>
   .com/travel.html.
</P>
<P>
   Simply use a pull-down menu to select a country or a separate
pull-down menu to pick an activity (ballooning, volcano tours,
mountain climbing ... if you can think of doing it, it's listed).
You'll also be able to specify a price range that you are willing
to pay by using another menu.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, keep in mind that for information about a specific
location or activity (whether you are planning a trip to
grandmother's or want to explore the Incan ruins), any of the major
search engines can be used. Simply type in the keywords of the city
you want to visit or the activity that interests you.

 &HT;    New TrueReality software allows full Nintendo 64 power
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Mac has always excelled at pretending it was
something other than a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, developers have written software that
lets Macs emulate the Windows operating system, Unix workstations
and the Sony PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   Now a developer has come up with a program that emulates a
Nintendo 64 game player on a Mac. It's called Mac TrueReality, and
online reviewers are reporting that this emulator really works.
</P>
<P>
   True, the first versions of TrueReality were rough. They didn't
support 3-D graphics, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But now developer Niki Waibel has released the first new version
in four months. This version, 1.1.3, is a major improvement. It
runs faster, supports 3-D graphics and plays a greater selection of
games.
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer for the Web site Insanely Great Mac said he
successfully used TrueReality to play such popular N64 games as
``Mario Kart,'' ``Super Mario,'' ``Wave Race,'' ``Star Fox,''
``Bomberman'' and ``Bomberman Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   That developers are undertaking such difficult and risky
projects such as emulators is a good sign for both Apple and the
Mac. For one, it helps expand the Mac market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, people didn't even think it was possible to
emulate the N64 processor,'' notes Web site Mac OS Planet in a
recent review. ``But in almost a year the Mac OS and Apple have
made so many advancements that an N64 emulator is now possible.''
</P>
<P>
   While impressive, TrueReality is not as easy to use as Windows
emulators Virtual PC or SoftPC. The main problem is that N64
software is on cartridges and not computer-friendly disks or CDs.
</P>
<P>
   That means to play N64 games, you must first find computerized
versions of the software. Computerized versions are available _
they really are just the software sheared of the cartridge shell _
but they can be hard to find. The best place to look, of course, is
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you find, remember this: It's illegal to play on a Mac
an N64 game you don't already own.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, you have to get TrueReality. It's available as a
free download from the developer's site at mtr.dht.dk/.
</P>
<P>
   This site also has more information about TrueReality _ how it
works, the history of previous versions and what others have to say
about the program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site has some computerized versions of N64 game
demos to get you started.
</P>
<P>
   To run TrueReality, you'll need a Mac with a PowerPC processor.
The faster the better. You'll also need at least 32 megabytes of
RAM, Apple GameSprockets software and OpenGL drivers.

 &HT;    'Kingdoms' a gothic adventure trip
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Total Annihilation, a maker of real-time war games, has gone
gothic. Its latest title features conquest and warfare among four
mystical kingdoms. Called ``Kingdoms,'' this game is a cross
between ``Warcraft'' and ``Warlords.'' It's published by Cavedog
Entertainment and contains animated violence. The game is
recommended for kids 13 years or older. ``Kingdoms'' is available
only for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   On the lighter side, there's a new computer CD game for girls
who shun conquest and war. It's called ``Secret Diary'' and is
published by Encore Software. ``Secret Diary'' lets girls create
notes and print them out for friends. It also includes a personal
calendar, a diary, an address book and stationery templates. The
game is available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   Had enough of all the Chicken Littles decrying the millennium
bug? Then take a look at ``The Bug Stops Here,'' a humorous look at
the Y2K problem. This book is a collection of cartoons poking fun
at Y2K. The cartoons were collected by Peter de Jager, a Y2K
expert. His book retails for $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Mario has taken up golf. That's right, in his next Nintendo
game, Mario and Luigi take up the clubs. Actually, this latest
Mario Bros. release is a collection of games. You can read a
summary of them in the July issue of Nintendo Power magazine. The
article about ``Mario Golf'' includes two pages of screen shots
from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   If you're an aspiring writer, you might want to check out a new
Web site called RoseDog. RoseDog has set itself up as a middleman
between writer and publisher. The site lets writers publish
excerpts of their work online. The idea is that agents and
publishers visiting the site will read your work. RoseDog also
awards prizes for new work. The site is free, and you'll find it at
www.RoseDog.com/.

 &HT;    View of Atlanta's downtown available online
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of Atlanta's nicest views recently became a lot
more visible.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Dial restaurant, atop downtown's Westin Peachtree Plaza
hotel, has a 360-degree view of Atlanta. A while back, the hotel
started charging non-guests $5 to take the glass elevator ride to
the top of the 73-story hotel. The Web camera gives the same view
for free to anyone with a computer and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is mounted on the revolving bar level of the Sun Dial
restaurant. You can see it at sundial.directsight.com/.
</P>
<P>
   To fix a faucet, go to how-to site
</P>
<P>
   If you're wired but don't know how to wire, Better Homes and
Gardens' Web site might be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.bhglive.com/homeimp/index.html, is an encyclopedia
of home improvement and home repair tips, divided into five
categories: wiring, decks, plumbing, carpentry, and masonry and
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The tips and instructions are adapted from the Better Homes and
Gardens how-to books. The Home Improvement Encyclopedia has more
than 2,000 pages of content and 53 animated demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The site was ranked as one of the Internet's 50 most useful
sites by Yahoo! Internet Life.
</P>
<P>
   Bulk-buying discounts on brand names offered
</P>
<P>
   Small booksellers have found that size matters and have
struggled to compete with the big retailers that can buy in bulk
and sell for less. Now maybe you can get the same advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site that launched last month, www.mercata.com, hopes to
bring bulk buying to individuals over the Internet. With Mercata's
``power buy,'' people can buy brand-name products _ JVC stereos,
Kodak cameras and Toshiba televisions _ for a limited time at group
discounts. Shipping is free, also for a limited time.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can recommend products for Mercata to offer. For now,
the site offers consumer electronics, sporting goods, power tools,
lawn and garden equipment, specialty gifts, and items for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata's product line includes Baby Jogger, Braun, Bushnell,
Coleman, Cuisinart, General Electric, Top-Flite and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata, funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan
Ventures, also offers customers a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on
products, customer service from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. EDT Monday through
Friday and real-time delivery tracking.
</P>
<P>
   Explore our planet and all its many layers
</P>

Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.discovery.com/exp
</P>
<P>
   /earthjourneys/earthjourneys.html, has features that let
visitors take a closer look at our planet. Peel the Planet lets
people look at the different layers of the Earth and find out how
each layer is formed and what function it serves. Click Through
Time lets people examine 5 billion years of the Earth's
development, focusing on high points such as the Ice Age and global
warming.

   Lovett or leave it: Finding right CD price
</P>
<P>
   The number of places on the Web where you can buy things is
getting almost too big to manage. And, unlike with the telephone,
there are few ways to make sure you are getting the best deal ahead
of time when you check the price of a CD or any other product
available online.
</P>
<P>
   One site, www
</P>
<P>
   .bottomdollar.com, works as a comparison shopper. Choose a
category, such as music, type in a singer, such as Lyle Lovett, and
in a few seconds the search engine produces several prices for Lyle
Lovett CDs and cassettes at several different Web sites, with
prices ranging from inexpensive to unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   The site was chosen by Cool Site of the Day,
www.coolsiteoftheday
</P>
<P>
   .com, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom Dollar's power shopper is described as a virtual Brillo
pad to scour the Web to get the best deal.

 &HT;    Computer recipes to keep a cook going
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the small advantages of old age is a
willingness to avoid pontificating on subjects about which one
knows nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when it comes to reviewing a computer cookbook, I
always turn to Mrs. Warner, who is the best cook I know. She hates
it when I say that, because she doesn't particularly enjoy cooking.
</P>
<P>
   She quite graciously submitted these comments on Sierra's new
Mastercook Suite featuring Betty Crocker recipes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I searched for my mother's vegetable beef soup, which I was
pretty sure came from a Betty Crocker cookbook, circa 1940, and
found one very close to it in the section called Kitchen Classics.
Mother had added okra, but everything else was the same _ beef,
potatoes, carrots, onions, celery and cabbage. It took me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, no bologna
</P>
<P>
   (To see if it would take me back, I searched for my mother's
bologna salad, a dish so disgusting I had wiped it from my memory
until my sister mentioned it recently. MasterCook Suite, I can
assure you, makes no mention of bologna in any form. Back to you,
Mrs. Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Each recipe includes serving suggestions (a salad and bread
for mother's soup) and, of course, number of servings, ingredients,
directions, cooking time, preparation time, categories (beef pot
pie was listed in five categories: Beef, Breads, Luncheon, Main
Dishes, Pies &AMP; Pastry). Some recipes also include Cuisine and
Notes. Boston brown bread is American Cuisine; notes suggested
substituting dates for raisins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source is usually included _ many copyrighted by General
Mills, and many from such kitchens as the Texas Beef Council and
Pepperidge Farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is based on individual books. They range from the
four Betty Crocker cookbooks (`Best of Baking,' `Best of Healthy
and Hearty Cooking,' `Cookie Book' and `Basics') through `Casual
Dining' to `Famous American Chefs' to `Quick Fix' to `What to Fix
for Dinner' _ 26 books in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition analysis has come a long way from the days of the
first computer cookbooks. Entering ingredients is easy in
Mastercook Suite, and nutrition analysis is instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has all the standard features _ it will generate a
shopping list, tell you what you can make when you tell it what is
in your pantry, suggest menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggested a rather daunting dinner party menu for six that
was a far cry from the store-baked ham and twice-baked potatoes I
usually serve. The menu: Crab-stuffed Mushrooms, Mandarin Hazelnut
Salad, Halibut With Mushroom and Shrimp Sauce, Garlicky Greens and
Beans, Bow Knot Dinner Rolls and Ginger Pudding. Total calories
come to 932 per guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tips section is particularly helpful. Information ranges
from adzuki beans (a small reddish-brown bush bean cultivated in
China and Japan) to zymurgy (the science of fermentation,
especially as it applies to brewing). This section also presents
film clips of various kitchen techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it, straight from her mouth. I might add that she
examined the program while I was consuming the better part of a
loaf of her fresh-baked walnut wheat bread.

 &HT;    Photo system helps customers look their best
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Embarrassed when you're required to show your
passport or student ID because you despise that goofy photo? Here's
help.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has come up with a Digital Passport Photo System that lets
you preview and pick your preferred passport photo before it's
printed.
</P>
<P>
   Moto Photo Inc., headquartered in Dayton and America's largest
franchiser of one-hour photo processing and portrait stores, is the
first chain in the nation to install the new service. It's
available at five of the six area Moto Photo stores.
</P>
<P>
   According to executive vice president David Mason, the system
not only adds value for customers, but the storeowner benefits from
reduced paper waste and a lower media cost than chemical-based
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system also produces photo stickers _ a hot item with
younger audiences,'' Mason said. ``Photo postcards and multiple
reprints of all images can also be produced, creating a variety of
business possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's digital photography marketing manager David Longendyke
says the traditional method involves taking a picture, pulling the
film out of the camera, waiting it to develop, peeling it apart and
then looking at the print.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point the store owner has already spent the money on
the film or the print and if the eyes are shut or there's a funny
expression, the store operator either has to take another shot _
which costs them money _ or the customers end up with a picture
they don't really like,'' he explained. ``If it's for a passport
they're going to have it for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's system allows customers to review and proof photos
electronically. The system allows the store operator to shoot up to
30 high-resolution images and preview them with the customer on the
camera's display. The desired photo is then printed on U.S. State
Department-accepted high performance laminated paper media in
approximately 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been great!'' said Scott Guyton, general
manager of Moto Photo at Washington Square. ``My crew loves it
because it's much easier to use than the Polaroid versions. The
customers love it because the color comes out much better and
because they can see it on the screen before we print it.''
</P>
<P>
   Price of the entire system is $2,500. Two passport photos are
approximately $19.95 at Moto Photo stores.

 &HT;    Yahoo policy crosses property lines
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This week, a huge Internet battle was resolved
and if you publish or plan to self-publish on the Web, its
implications will affect you.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started in June when Yahoo changed the terms of its
service policy on Geocities.com, the Web hosting site it now owns.
The new service policy transferred Yahoo's own policies onto
Geocities. The policy, which created an instant uproar in the
Geocities community read, in part, ``By submitting Content to any
Yahoo property, you automatically grant Yahoo the royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and full sublicensable right
and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate''
Web pages submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Translated into English, the policy says that Yahoo would own
anything people publish on their own sites _ including original
content, graphics, text and video posted on personal Web pages _
and could use it for whatever Yahoo wanted to, royalty-free.
</P>
<P>
   Web authors, a group notoriously vocal in their efforts to
protect their right to post family vacation photos on the Web
without having to cower to The Man, started a boycott of Yahoo.
Their main point of contention was that the policy was retroactive:
it affected content that had already been created and posted as
well as future Web creations.
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities watchdogs went into action, creating a Boycott
Yahoo Web site and altering their Geocities pages to make them
gray, which they called the ``Haunting of Geocities.''
</P>
<P>
   They advised Net activists to use other search engines and to
repost their sites using other free Web hosts that compete against
Geocities. Suddenly, Yahoo was in the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the Internet company recognized the error of its
ways and changed its policy. In an open letter addressed to
``Homesteaders,'' the company said it made a mistake, trying to
merge the terms of services for two companies into one.
</P>
<P>
   The Boycott Yahoo site announced ``It's Over!'' and the Haunting
of Geocities became the Rehabitation of Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resolution, the Yahoo flap is an important lesson in
the increasingly complex issue of copyright law on the Internet.
There are a few absolutes: If you use your company's computer for
e-mail and you check it on company time, chances are you don't own
it and you have no privacy. If you create Web content for a company
as a full-time worker, you don't own what you write. And you
generally give up your rights of ownership on e-mail you receive
using a free Web-based mail service. After all, the information is
housed on their server and you're using their resources to log in.
That's part of the agreement you sign when you log in.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the creative author of a work is the legal copyright
owner, but what about republishing rights and the right to use user
pages to promote a site such as Yahoo? Could Yahoo reprint
Geocities Web sites on a CD-ROM, for instance, as an archive?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dreitler, an intellectual property lawyer specializing in
trademarks and the Internet, says questions like this will continue
to arise as more people publish on the Web, and many more cases
will erupt as companies try to establish boundaries on what belongs
to them and what belongs to users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one example of the stickiness on issues of ownership on
the Internet,'' said Dreitler, who works for Vorys, Sater, Seymour
and Pease in Columbus, Ohio. ``In the Yahoo case, they argued that
they have a role in the creation of the work because they make the
technical adjustments that go into it. But if all they're doing is
posting it up on the Web, that's a fairly aggressive position. The
owner under copyright law is the person who creates the work _ that
in my opinion is the person who sits down at the computer and
creates a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The best defense against such problems, Dreitler said, is to
read the fine print _ the sometimes convoluted service agreements
you're asked to agree to when you sign up for a free Web service or
when you install new software.
</P>
<P>
   Many users don't read the agreements and don't know what rights
they're giving up. For instance, buying a copy of Microsoft Word
doesn't entitle you to ownership of the software _ only a license
to use it. It's all in the license agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people don't read that, they never do,'' Dreitler said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yahoo case, the boycott was justified _ the rules were
changed long after the game was being played. But as an increasing
amount of our time and work goes online, it's important to know
what we own and what we don't.

 &HT;    The scoop: News on Internet might not be fit to print
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Be suspicious of anything I say about newspapers and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I've been around both for a long time, and sometimes
a guy can spend so much time in his own back yard that he no longer
notices the trees there. But, given that warning, I'm going to stay
in my own back yard today.
</P>
<P>
   It's on my mind because a lot of smart people, even folks in my
own business whom I respect, worry that somehow the Web and all the
news sites there have turned the newspaper into some sort of a
dinosaur, doddering around on its last legs, dying slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is simple and logical. In the old days, it was
difficult-to-impossible for individuals and poorly funded small
start-ups to create a competing newspaper. Marketing people would _
in their own jargon _ say that the barrier was cost of entry. In
plain English, it means that the cost of starting a conventional
print newspaper from scratch is so high that it creates a barrier
most people can't cross.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the Web. All of a sudden, anyone could get a Web
site, put news on it and call that operation an electronic
newspaper. Instead of a big printing press and trucks to deliver
the paper and staffs of thousands, they needed an Internet
connection, the ability to type and some news to publish. And,
since defining news is like defining love (it is whatever it seems
to be to the person involved), that part was easy.
</P>
<P>
   So, understandably I think, bosses at newspapers started to
worry _ with that barrier down _ that the days of traditional
newspapers were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe you've noticed this yourself, but sometimes the
bosses are wrong. This is one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a newspaper, you're paying for a lot more than the
printing press and all those trucks. What you are buying _ and I
know this sounds corny, but a lot of true things do sound that way
_ are the services of professionals with ethical standards. While
you may see newspapers as biased and often wrong (lots of people
do), you'd have to hang out at one for 30 years or so _ and I've
done that _ to see just how seriously most newspaper folks treat
their task of presenting the news accurately and fairly. They often
do it imperfectly, but the real marvel of a newspaper is how often
it is done right.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, as with airline pilots, lawyers and doctors, plenty of
mistakes are made, and there is the normal distribution of idiots
and jerks. But maybe that's a good comparison. While there are
undoubtedly physicians who are stump dumb and others who are evil,
you'd still rather take pot luck with a physician if you need
medical help than seeking out your neighbor who had just finished
the ``Brain Surgery for Dummies'' book.
</P>
<P>
   And now we're getting to one of my real fears about the Web.
I'll start by acknowledging that there are all sorts of wonderful
sites, filled with information you can access seven days a week, 24
hours a day. And newspapers aren't alone in seeing others step into
their traditional roles. You'll find information and advice for
law, medicine, fixing the drain in the kitchen sink and even coping
with your neurotic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   That scares me. Let's create a perfect world where every one of
these sites is manned by really smart and decent people who do
their best. Even then, if I had a serious need for legal, medical
or plumbing help, I'd call a professional. And, when you consider
that the world is not a perfect place, and that some of the bad
information on the Web is presented just as slickly as the good
information, well ... what a mess.
</P>
<P>
   The day may come when a computer can fix a leaky pipe, cover the
news professionally or create an airtight legal document. But that
day is not here. So, enjoy this new world of instant information
but also avoid the temptation to think that everything that looks
good is good.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: The exterior of a black car parked in the sun
is hotter than a white car, but does it affect interior
temperature? Does the AC work harder in the black one, with a
noticeable difference in gas mileage? Is window tinting a factor?
</P>
<P>
   _ John Nemetz
</P>
<P>
   A: The air conditioner's effect on your gas mileage is minimal.
Purchase a light-colored car in hot states. Black holds heat; white
reflects it. Anything to help thighs unstick from the seat. Need a
big difference in car temperature? Buy one with a light interior,
says auto AC guru Eddie Creel of Nelson Automotive. Medium fan
speed (rather than high) lowers the air temperature quickly. Window
tinting also helps. Park in the shade and leave windows cracked
whenever possible. Car parked/cooking in the sun all day? Roll down
the windows for the first few driving minutes to let hot air
escape. What does this AC sage drive? White cars with light gray or
tan interiors. White hides scratches as well as dents better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I ordered some Roger Bros. flatware in 1991. I built my
dining room and dishes around it. Many pieces have disappeared in
little hands. I recovered a few from the sandbox. It was ZIA
stainless steel. I can't find replacement pieces anywhere. _ Jule
Vigness
</P>
<P>
   A: This popular pattern is often in stock at Wilma Saxton,
stainless flatware replacement service. Call (800) 267-8029 and
leave your list of desired pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My father's brother, who no one has seen in more than 30
years, is the recipient of a part of my grandfather's (his
father's) estate. My father and uncle have been trying to find him
for months, but have been unsuccessful. The authorities need his
Social Security number to locate him, but the Social Security
Administration will not release it due to confidentiality
requirements. If he is not located, the money, now escrowed by the
court, will go to the State of Texas in seven years. Do you know
any means to get his Social Security number or another way to
locate a missing person? _ Bennett Brooke
</P>
<P>
   A: You can try a private detective, but you can also use a
little-known service from the Social Security Administration:
letter forwarding. Circumstances? It must involve a matter of great
importance, such as a death or serious illness in the missing
person's immediate family, or a sizable amount of money due the
missing person. Your situation fits. Forwarding letters with a
humanitarian purpose is free; a $3 fee is charged for others (check
payable to the Social Security Administration). Each letter is read
before forwarding _ so send it unsealed. Enclose nothing of value.
But do send identifying information: your uncle's date and place of
birth, his father's name and mother's full birth name. Requests are
sent to: Social Security Administration, OCRO, Division of
Certification and Coverage, 300 N. Greene St., Baltimore, MD 21201.
Q: I volunteer for a nonprofit organization and am involved with
hiring. We have just hired a new employee and used a service to do
a criminal background check. What are the guidelines on placing the
report in the employee's personnel file? If we cannot keep it
there, how do we prove a search was done? _ Doris M. Hug
</P>
<P>
   A: Oddly enough, the Fair Credit Reporting Act covers the use of
this information, and the Federal Trade Commission has authority. A
credit report is any consumer report used to screen eligibility for
a variety of things: to receive credit or to land a job. The
information you secured is for a specific purpose. An unauthorized
use _ such as selling it to another party _ is prohibited. I would
advise prudence and limit the access to such personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was outraged over the sentence of 20 years probation given
to the woman who pleaded guilty to smothering eight of her children
over a period of two decades. I'd like to write the Philadelphia
district attorney to protest. _ C.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: The prosecutor was Charles Gallagher; the district attorney,
Lynne Abraham. Both can be contacted at 1421 Arch St.,
Philadelphia, PA 19102. Part of Marie Noe's sentence is five years
of house arrest (with an electronic bracelet) as well as
psychiatric therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a ``Cotton-eyed Joe''? I am not talking about the
dance or the song. In the song ``Harbor Lights,'' there are harbor
lights, in ``Harvest Moon'' there is a harvest moon, so what is a
``Cotton-eyed Joe''? _ Roy McCoy
</P>
<P>
   A: A person. The phrase cotton-eyed was used to describe folks
who had a condition that made their entire eye appear milky or
white, according to Dr. Francis Abernethy of the Texas Folklore
Society. Local retinal surgeon Dr. Armie Harper says the white
appearance may have been caused by cataracts or perhaps a corneal
scar. However, it was probably pterygium, a condition affecting
those who worked outside _ farmers, field hands, etc. Pterygium,
caused by overexposure to the sun and wind, covers the eyes in
reddish-white film.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know the dimensions of the luggage allowed as
a carry-on. I know there is a certain limit at check-in. _ David S.
</P>
<P>
   A: The suggested size is 9 by 13 by 23 inches to fit under the
seat or in the overhead compartment, but the rule is a combined
size of 45 inches (height, width and length), says American
Airlines, whose weight limit is 70 pounds per bag. Weight limits
vary by carrier. (Hey, if you can't lift it, maybe you shouldn't be
carrying it on the plane). The limit of two carry-ons per passenger
does not include normal-size purses, coats or items that assist
those with disabilities. Grouse about passengers with carry-ons?
The practice allows baggage handlers to move checked luggage
quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've finally found a solution for the mosquitoes that bother
us in our baby wading pool outside _ citronella tiki torches. But
now, I'm wondering if all the black smoke they put out is dangerous
for my baby. _ B. Rowan
</P>
<P>
   A: The Central Texas Poison Center says the smoke may irritate
eyes, but is not toxic. For safety, keep the center's number handy
_ (800) 764-7661.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband's source of wingtip dress shoes in a size 14 EEE
(black or cordovan) has been discontinued. After trying two big and
tall catalogs and several local sources I am at the end of my
shoestring! _ Laurie Stauffer
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing worse than an unshod husband. Time to develop some
new mail order sources for wingtips: Reyers Shoe Store at (800)
245-1550 and E. T. Wright Executive Shoes at (800) 934-1022 (free
catalog). Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at
P.O. Box 670, Austin, TX 78767 or e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com.

 &HT;    Web destinations for vacation plans
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hot, your nerves are shot because the kids are
home from school for the summer, you're broke and the air
conditioner is making a strange grinding noise ... it must be time
for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   What could be better than piling the whole family in the car and
driving for hours or even days to a place that's even hotter and
that will make you more broke?
</P>
<P>
   Since so much fun awaits you, let's at least make the
preparation for the vacation as easy and inexpensive as possible.
That's where the World Wide Web comes in. You can take care of
almost everything while sitting at your computer.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our journey at a terrific site called Travel Zone at
search
</P>
<P>
   .thetrip.com/. This site uses the AltaVista search engine so _
as you would expect _ the main advantage here is the ability to
ferret out almost any vacation-planning information you need.
</P>
<P>
   You can simply type in a word or a phrase, click the button and
get dozens of links to that information. You'll also find some
helpful links on the main page that can take care of chores like
figuring conversion rates for foreign currency, finding maps,
guides to cities and airports, and ways to find low-cost airfares.
You'll also want to check out the main page (www.trip.com/), where
you'll be able to rent a car, book a hotel room, and find airline
fares and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   There's also advice aplenty, including ways to find the lowest
airfare, the way to plan what the site's designers call a
``stress-free trip'' and how to decipher airline codes for various
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's overkill ... perhaps all you really need is a
virtual road map to get you to your destination. The Web is crammed
with virtual map and travel route planning services. Here are two
good ones: MapQuest at www
</P>
<P>
   .mapquest.com/ and Yahoo!'s mapping site at
maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these sites work in much the same way. If you enter a
starting address and the address of your destination, you can get
both a map and printed turn-by-turn directions, complete with
mileage. In most cases, you'll find the directions good _ perhaps
not the route you would choose, but workable. However, as with any
other kind of directions, including the kind you'd get from a
friend, there is the fairly remote chance that you'd figure a
better way on your own. That's why it makes sense to take a peek at
the map for a common-sense check of the driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've covered sites that offer most of the conventional
tools you'll need for planning a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But for some people, vacations are true adventures ... instead
of lying on a Florida beach, they have hang gliding in South
America in mind. If you have the desire and the cash, there's a
nifty Web site that caters to unique vacations. It's called InfoHub
Specialty Travel Guide and can be found at www.infohub
</P>
<P>
   .com/travel.html.
</P>
<P>
   Simply use a pull-down menu to select a country or a separate
pull-down menu to pick an activity (ballooning, volcano tours,
mountain climbing ... if you can think of doing it, it's listed).
You'll also be able to specify a price range that you are willing
to pay by using another menu.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, keep in mind that for information about a specific
location or activity (whether you are planning a trip to
grandmother's or want to explore the Incan ruins), any of the major
search engines can be used. Simply type in the keywords of the city
you want to visit or the activity that interests you.

 &HT;    New TrueReality software allows full Nintendo 64 power
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Mac has always excelled at pretending it was
something other than a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, developers have written software that
lets Macs emulate the Windows operating system, Unix workstations
and the Sony PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   Now a developer has come up with a program that emulates a
Nintendo 64 game player on a Mac. It's called Mac TrueReality, and
online reviewers are reporting that this emulator really works.
</P>
<P>
   True, the first versions of TrueReality were rough. They didn't
support 3-D graphics, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But now developer Niki Waibel has released the first new version
in four months. This version, 1.1.3, is a major improvement. It
runs faster, supports 3-D graphics and plays a greater selection of
games.
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer for the Web site Insanely Great Mac said he
successfully used TrueReality to play such popular N64 games as
``Mario Kart,'' ``Super Mario,'' ``Wave Race,'' ``Star Fox,''
``Bomberman'' and ``Bomberman Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   That developers are undertaking such difficult and risky
projects such as emulators is a good sign for both Apple and the
Mac. For one, it helps expand the Mac market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, people didn't even think it was possible to
emulate the N64 processor,'' notes Web site Mac OS Planet in a
recent review. ``But in almost a year the Mac OS and Apple have
made so many advancements that an N64 emulator is now possible.''
</P>
<P>
   While impressive, TrueReality is not as easy to use as Windows
emulators Virtual PC or SoftPC. The main problem is that N64
software is on cartridges and not computer-friendly disks or CDs.
</P>
<P>
   That means to play N64 games, you must first find computerized
versions of the software. Computerized versions are available _
they really are just the software sheared of the cartridge shell _
but they can be hard to find. The best place to look, of course, is
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you find, remember this: It's illegal to play on a Mac
an N64 game you don't already own.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, you have to get TrueReality. It's available as a
free download from the developer's site at mtr.dht.dk/.
</P>
<P>
   This site also has more information about TrueReality _ how it
works, the history of previous versions and what others have to say
about the program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site has some computerized versions of N64 game
demos to get you started.
</P>
<P>
   To run TrueReality, you'll need a Mac with a PowerPC processor.
The faster the better. You'll also need at least 32 megabytes of
RAM, Apple GameSprockets software and OpenGL drivers.

 &HT;    Shopping online for auto insurance _ it's a good thing
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One Thursday night during the dreadful lull between
``Frasier'' and ``ER,'' I decided to see if I could do something
about my ridiculously high auto insurance. Back in the olden days,
I would have wandered out to wherever I kept my organizer and
scrawled ``call insurance companies about car.'' But given my
tendency to ignore most of the things I write in my organizer, I'd
still be paying many hundreds of dollars too much for car
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That night I saw an ad for an insurance company flash on the TV
with an 800 number and an Internet address. I realize I could have
called the 800 number, which the company said was available 24
hours a day, but that just would have been another item on the
seemingly endless to-do list. However, my computer is conveniently
located in the same room as the TV, and I could log on and off in
time to catch the start of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet gurus say the Net is slowly but surely creating
more-informed consumers. With nearly every major carmaker online,
buyers are walking into dealerships more informed than they once
were. Some turn up at the dealer with printouts of the make and
model they want, complete with pricing for extras and estimated
delivery charges.
</P>
<P>
   When I sat down at my computer to shop for insurance, I didn't
head directly for the insurance company advertised on TV. Instead,
I decided to see if there was some sort of insurance evaluator that
would let me enter the types of coverage I wanted and provide me
with a list of companies that could provide it and at what cost. I
decided to go this route just to see whether the outrageously
expensive insurance company I had wasn't, in reality, one of the
more reasonable companies around.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance comparison shopping is available through the Yahoo!
insurance center, or you can eliminate the middleman and go
directly to www.insweb.com. Through a secure server, users enter
information about themselves, their cars and the amount of
insurance they want. The information is processed, and insurance
companies offering the lowest rates are shown.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about shopping online for insurance, a car, a
house, a mortgage or any big-ticket item is how much control the
user has over the information-gathering experience. When the site
asks you about your current policy, you can step away from your
computer and rummage through your papers for the document without
worrying about leaving an impatient customer service representative
waiting on hold.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible to enter a user name and a password so you
can save the information you've entered. You can come back later
and not have to re-enter everything unless you need to.
</P>
<P>
   The other great thing about using the Web instead of the phone
is that the Web is available the second it occurs to you there's
something you'd like to do, whether it's checking out auto
insurance rates, buying a tie from Lands' End or reading that
newspaper article you've been meaning to get to. And if this is the
episode of ``ER'' where Carol is going to tell everyone she's
pregnant, you can just let the computer sit there and watch a
little TV before picking up exactly where you left off.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web sites offering insurance or loan quotes have this
feature, as well as a guarantee that your information is private
and secure. If you don't see a notice informing you that your
information is being sent via secure server and won't be sold to a
third party, go to another Web site or do it the old-fashioned way
and use the phone. The last thing you want is two hackers in Des
Moines knowing more about your financial situation than you do.
However, most reputable sites such as InsWeb, HomeAdvisor or the
bank mortgage calculators will have taken the appropriate security
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I was indeed paying too much _ way too much, in
fact _ for my car insurance. Not only was I able to find much more
competitive rates, I could ask to be connected to a list of
insurance agents in my neighborhood who would contact me via
e-mail. In a few days, I received a note from the insurance agent
confirming the quote listed on the Web site. Now I have a brand-new
insurance company with reasonable rates and a friendly agent.
</P>
<P>
   I probably could have done the same research by calling
individual companies and asking for quotes, but that takes time,
the kind of time most people don't have. Lots of Web sites like to
say their goal is to help busy people manage their lives.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, whenever people tell me this, I can't help but
wonder who these incredibly busy people are whose lives need all
this care and speed and hand-holding. But it's not really about
hand-holding time-crunched yuppies who want to check their stock
prices between power lunches, but rather about offering consumers
the option of getting things done in their own time on their own
schedule. As Martha Stewart would say, this is a good thing.

 &HT;    Georgia girls gear up for next World Cup
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you got a kick out of watching the U.S. women's
national soccer team play in the Women's World Cup last week, wait
until next time _ when some Georgia girls may have their shot at
the goal and the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The next Women's World Cup won't be played for another four
years. By then Alison Lovelace, 18, of Dallas, Ga., and twins Nancy
and Julie Augustyniak, 20, of Peachtree City could be vying for a
spot on the next national team. Alison and Nancy already play on
younger-level national teams, and Julie is an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting to think about,'' says Nancy, who admits
she's a little nervous when people say she or her sister could make
the next World Cup team. ``I never thought I would make it this
far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Augustyniak sisters started playing soccer when they were 5
years old. They have soccer scholarships at Clemson University and
hit the field for the United Soccer League's Atlanta Classics team
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   They also travel all over the country to train. In February,
Nancy worked out in Florida, where she teamed up with some of the
U.S. Women's World Cup players.
</P>
<P>
   Alison spent the World Cup in Oklahoma City, where she was
competing with her Tophat Soccer Club team members in the Southern
Regional Championships.
</P>
<P>
   These girls aren't the only ones displaying fancy footwork in
Georgia. Girls' soccer has exploded here since the 1970s. Young
girls may start out on recreational teams, but many are moving on
to high-level competition within their leagues throughout the state
and even the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia has a lot of female players knocking on the door of
the national teams,'' says Jacob Daniel, state director of coaching
at the Georgia State Soccer Association.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the fields are overflowing with girls who could turn
out be the next Mia Hamm or Michelle Akers. About 850 girls don
shin guards and cleats during the fall and spring seasons in
Atlanta's Tophat Soccer Club alone. And Rick Skirvin of the Georgia
State Soccer Association says more than 350 teams of girls travel
all around Georgia competing in matches at the state's premiere
Athena level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's recreational or fiercely competitive, many agree
soccer teaches leadership, teamwork and self-esteem _ and it has
great health benefits. It can also open the door to college
scholarships, where women's soccer programs are catching on like
wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all Tophatters that continue competing all the way
through high school get scholarships to college or use soccer to
help them get into schools that don't offer scholarships, like
Princeton,'' said Cy Strickler, founder of the girls-only Tophat
Soccer Club.
</P>
<P>
   But the important thing to remember, say Nancy and Julie, is to
play only if you're having fun. And don't forget about academics.
It's a fun sport, but ``soccer can only take you so far,'' Julie
says.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU WANT TO JOIN
</P>
<P>
   If you want to join a soccer team, now is the time to register.
Some clubs have already had tryouts, but others will be looking for
players throughout the summer. To find out about teams near you,
call the Georgia State Soccer Association at 770-452-0505 and ask
for a list of leagues in your area. You can also log on to the
Tophat site at www.tophatsoccerclub.com.

 &HT;    Students speak up on violence, videos, family
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ High school students participating in a recent
academic contest said they believe the family is the cause of _ and
the cure for _ violence in the United States, according to a
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine percent of the students surveyed said bad parenting
is most responsible for violent acts in schools, and 36 percent
said the most important factor in reducing crime is the family.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the students said that violent games and movies
do not lead kids to imitate aggressive behavior. And one-third said
there was no need to shield kids from the games and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of respondents said the country's gun control
laws were too soft, but 61 percent felt handguns should not be
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic surveyed 171 high school students last month. The
students were competing in the company's 1999 Academic Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark on the move
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in North Carolina has moved from
its old perch on a badly eroded beach. It will take several more
weeks for it to settle in at its new home, 1,600 feet from the
rough Atlantic surf.
</P>
<P>
   Movers still must slide the 129-year-old lighthouse the final
108 feet of the 2,900-foot trip, then ease it onto rails over a
concrete pad. During the next two months, crews will build a new
foundation for the nation's tallest lighthouse. It's 208 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service decided to spend $10 million to move
the landmark before it tumbled into the sea. The move was expected
to take four to six weeks, but it took only three.
</P>
<P>
   China busts smugglers
</P>
<P>
   Investigators uncovered a smuggling ring that used China's
postal service to sell thousands of skins and other parts of
endangered tigers, leopards and cobras.
</P>
<P>
   Police seized a half-ton of animal parts, including monkey
skulls, elephant tusks and cobra and pit viper skins. It was the
largest such seizure in five decades, an official Chinese newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers used regular mail service to avoid border
controls, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese use these endangered animal parts in traditional
medical cures. People in wealthy Chinese communities in Hong Kong,
Taiwan and Southeast Asia have bought many animal parts from
smugglers.

 &HT;    Photo system helps customers look their best
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Embarrassed when you're required to show your
passport or student ID because you despise that goofy photo? Here's
help.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has come up with a Digital Passport Photo System that lets
you preview and pick your preferred passport photo before it's
printed.
</P>
<P>
   Moto Photo Inc., headquartered in Dayton and America's largest
franchiser of one-hour photo processing and portrait stores, is the
first chain in the nation to install the new service. It's
available at five of the six area Moto Photo stores.
</P>
<P>
   According to executive vice president David Mason, the system
not only adds value for customers, but the storeowner benefits from
reduced paper waste and a lower media cost than chemical-based
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system also produces photo stickers _ a hot item with
younger audiences,'' Mason said. ``Photo postcards and multiple
reprints of all images can also be produced, creating a variety of
business possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's digital photography marketing manager David Longendyke
says the traditional method involves taking a picture, pulling the
film out of the camera, waiting it to develop, peeling it apart and
then looking at the print.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point the store owner has already spent the money on
the film or the print and if the eyes are shut or there's a funny
expression, the store operator either has to take another shot _
which costs them money _ or the customers end up with a picture
they don't really like,'' he explained. ``If it's for a passport
they're going to have it for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's system allows customers to review and proof photos
electronically. The system allows the store operator to shoot up to
30 high-resolution images and preview them with the customer on the
camera's display. The desired photo is then printed on U.S. State
Department-accepted high performance laminated paper media in
approximately 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been great!'' said Scott Guyton, general
manager of Moto Photo at Washington Square. ``My crew loves it
because it's much easier to use than the Polaroid versions. The
customers love it because the color comes out much better and
because they can see it on the screen before we print it.''
</P>
<P>
   Price of the entire system is $2,500. Two passport photos are
approximately $19.95 at Moto Photo stores.

<P>
   Total Annihilation, a maker of real-time war games, has gone
gothic. Its latest title features conquest and warfare among four
mystical kingdoms. Called ``Kingdoms,'' this game is a cross
between ``Warcraft'' and ``Warlords.'' It's published by Cavedog
Entertainment and contains animated violence. The game is
recommended for kids 13 years or older. ``Kingdoms'' is available
only for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   On the lighter side, there's a new computer CD game for girls
who shun conquest and war. It's called ``Secret Diary'' and is
published by Encore Software. ``Secret Diary'' lets girls create
notes and print them out for friends. It also includes a personal
calendar, a diary, an address book and stationery templates. The
game is available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   Had enough of all the Chicken Littles decrying the millennium
bug? Then take a look at ``The Bug Stops Here,'' a humorous look at
the Y2K problem. This book is a collection of cartoons poking fun
at Y2K. The cartoons were collected by Peter de Jager, a Y2K
expert. His book retails for $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Mario has taken up golf. That's right, in his next Nintendo
game, Mario and Luigi take up the clubs. Actually, this latest
Mario Bros. release is a collection of games. You can read a
summary of them in the July issue of Nintendo Power magazine. The
article about ``Mario Golf'' includes two pages of screen shots
from the game.

   If you're an aspiring writer, you might want to check out a new
Web site called RoseDog. RoseDog has set itself up as a middleman
between writer and publisher. The site lets writers publish
excerpts of their work online. The idea is that agents and
publishers visiting the site will read your work. RoseDog also
awards prizes for new work. The site is free, and you'll find it at
www.RoseDog.com/.

 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The All-Star Game was a week away when the shocking
news broke.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers wereafoot. Yes, indeed. Someone operating out of a
flower shop near the Boston Common had sold an All-Star Game ticket
for _ grab onto the nearest railing _ $4. How scandalous! That was
more than 300 percent above the face values of reserved tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but scalpers beware. Boston Braves management was saying,
``We know who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Globe's Melville E. Webb Jr., ``up at the
Beehive there is a record of every ticket issued. To whom, and the
address to which tickets have been sent _ and the location.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus ca change, etc. The year was 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Often forgotten is that the first baseball All-Star Game staged
in Boston took place, not at Fenway Park, but at the larger
National League Field, or Beehive, or, as it would soon be known,
Braves Field. The game was notable for many reasons. It was the
first National League victory in the four-year-old competition, it
was stained by the strange sight of 17,000 empty seats, it was
highlighted by some sensational pitching by the inimitable Dizzy
Dean, and it represented perhaps the only time Joe DiMaggio was
ever humiliated on the ball field.
</P>
<P>
   Believers in omens had a funny feeling about this game before it
ever started. For a huge story on the morning of the game concerned
the fact that American League All-Stars Goose Goslin, Schoolboy
Rowe, Rollie Hemsley, and umpire Bill Summers (one of three Bay
State natives working the game) had been involved in a train wreck
southwest of Cleveland while traveling from St. Louis. The men were
unhurt, but they did arrive in Boston accompanied by a buzz.
</P>
<P>
   The empty seats came about due to a regrettable, if earnest,
decision by Braves management to treat the game as any other in
fairness to the average fan. The reserve seat sale was restricted
to 17,000. The remaining 25,000 ``rush'' seats would be placed on
sale the morning of the game. Communication was poor. Falsely
believing the game was sold out, many thousands of interested
people stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   What they missed was a game described by no less an authority
than Grantland Rice as ``the most entertaining and feature-studded
of all to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The National League won, 4-3, building a 4-0 lead after five and
then holding on when the Americans scored three in the seventh off
Curt Davis and threatened for more only to have the rally squelched
when DiMaggio, in the midst of a classically frustrating day, saw
his sizzling line drive caught by Leo Durocher to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The game included a somewhat controversial solo homer by
National League center fielder Augie Galan, whose wrong-field shot
in the fifth hit the foul pole (in those days the league ground
rules differed; in the American League it would have been a foul
ball because it landed foul) and a mammoth solo clout by the
American's Lou Gehrig to lead off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Iron Horse was, to that point, an All-Star flop. En route to
the game, Gehrig had said, ``I've got the worst All-Star record in
the game, and I'm going to do something about it.'' A 430-foot
homer made him feel better.
</P>
<P>
   The unquestioned pitching star was NL starter Dizzy Dean, then
25 years of age and enjoying what would prove to be his last great
season (an injury in the '37 game would wreck his career). Ol' Diz
was in superb form on this day, working three scoreless innings
marred only by a pair of walks. Otherwise . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't hit him at two paces with a handful of shot,''
declared Rice, who added, ``Diz had more smoke than a burning oil
well and he handled the crack sluggers of the American League as if
they had been members of a kindergarten school with camp colic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy crabbed about the two walks and his one time at bat (a
whiff), but he couldn't deny he had his good stuff. ``The old fog
ball goes in any league,'' he smirked. As a bonus, he even picked
Gehrig off first base in the second.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio represented the flip side of the equation. The rookie
right fielder came into the game as young royalty (batting third,
no less), and left it a humbled young man.
</P>
<P>
   He was 0 for 5 _ the only man with five official at-bats _ and
he three times made the final out of the inning. He had a man on
each time and advanced not one. He hit into a first- inning double
play. He had another comebacker to Carl Hubbell. In the field,
things were even worse. He misplayed a second- inning Gabby
Hartnett liner into a triple. He fumbled a Billy Herman single for
an error when Herman advanced to second.
</P>
<P>
   When he did sting the ball, shortstop Durocher caught it to end
the seventh with two aboard. A foot or two either way and he would
have provided the AL with the winning runs. As a finale, he came up
with Charlie Gehringer standing on second as the tying run with two
away in the ninth. He popped up.
</P>
<P>
   How, people wanted to know, could such a great fielder make such
a poor play on Hartnett's liner in the second? With no chance of
catching the ball, he tried for a shoestring catch. The ball rolled
and rolled and rolled, sufficient for the wheezing backstop (not
for nothing was Hartnett known affectionately as ``Old Tomato
Face'') to lumber into third. According to the Globe's esteemed
James C. O'Leary (an official scorer), Hartnett ``chugged into
third base with the speed of an ox-cart in reverse.'' For emphasis,
O'Leary pointed out that ``it takes the Gabber a couple of
generations to get around third base without the assistance of a
home run and a horse-and-buggy.'' Sounds like DiMag could have
thrown out Gabby at first if he'd thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   The performance left a lasting impression on DiMaggio, who
devoted a full four pages to it in his 1947 autobiography, ``Lucky
To Be A Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you remember the game,'' DiMag wrote. ``I'll never
forget it, much as I'd like to . . . The National League didn't
really win it. I lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee manager Joe McCarthy, at the helm because Mickey Cochrane
was in the midst of a nervous breakdown, told his rookie sensation
not to let it get him down. While DiMaggio did not brood, he did
reflect. ``I think the 1936 All-Star Game may have been the most
important event in my baseball career,'' he said. ``It opened my
eyes to many truths, to the fact that anything can happen in any
one ball game, or series of ball games; that things are hardest
just when they look easiest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was looking pretty easy for the home team by the fifth
inning. The NL had scored two in the second off Lefty Grove when
Chicago's Frank Demaree singled and scored on the much-discussed
DiMaggio misplay of Hartett's low liner to right, followed by a
Pinky Whitney sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Grimm's boys got two more in the fifth off Detroit's
Rowe. The Cubs' Galan, an old West Coast buddy of DiMaggio's,
pushed one down the right-field line. The ball hit the foul pole
and bounded into foul territory. Today? No argument. Then?
Confusion. In the American League, it could have been either a
double or a foul ball. In this National League park, however, it
was a home run. Herman singled and moved to second when DiMaggio,
in his own words, ``needed five minutes before I was able to pick
it up.'' Ducky Medwick singled home Herman for the National
League's final run.
</P>
<P>
   The AL hadn't been able to touch either Dean or Carl Hubbell,
managing but two hits after six innings. But things turned around
quickly when Grimm summoned his own Curt ``Coonskin'' Davis to
start the seventh. Gehrig got his team rolling with a long homer to
right. The Cubs righty easily retired Earl Averill and Bill Dickey
on infield rollers, but Goslin and Jimmie Foxx delivered
back-to-back pinch-hit singles to keep the inning going. McCarthy
sent up yet another pinch hitter, his own George Selkirk, and his
walk loaded the bases for Luke Appling, whose ground single between
first and second on a 2-2 pitch brought the AL within one.
</P>
<P>
   Grimm lifted Davis in favor of Lon Warneke, another one of his
Cub hurlers. He walked Gehringer, and that brought up DiMaggio, by
now 0 for 3 and clearly identified as the man against whom all the
fates had been conspiring.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio connected, sending a scorcher toward left-center. This
not being DiMaggio's day, shortstop Durocher was able to make the
catch. ``The drive spun Durocher halfway around, but did me no good
at all,'' DiMaggio lamented.
</P>
<P>
   The AL had another opportunity in the eighth, placing men on
first and third with two outs off Warneke. The ever-menacing Foxx
was at the plate, but Warneke struck him out.
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't the end of it. With two away in the ninth,
Gehringer doubled to left. DiMaggio would have one more chance for
redemption. Let him tell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have tied it up with a base hit,'' he wrote, ``but
there were no hits in my bat that afternoon. I popped to Herman and
headed for the clubhouse, a young man who had learned something and
learned it the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's own satisfaction in the game was scant. The losing
pitcher was Grove, a Red Sox. Foxx looked particularly bad as he
struck out with two on in the eighth. The only Bee on the squad was
Wally Berger, who had to watch as manager Grimm played Galan, his
own center fielder, for nine innings. And then there was the
embarrassing matter of the 17,000-plus empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   Bees general manager Bob Quinn was chastised for witholding so
many seats for game-day sale, thus proving beyond argument the
validity of the old saying, ``The road to hell is paved with good
intentions.'' Every writer in town took a crack at defending the
good honor of Boston, but it does seem that they all had failed in
the simple act of communication. Fans honestly believed there were
few seats to be had.
</P>
<P>
   There were 25,000 seats available on the morning of the game by
design, and yet, according to the Globe's Jerry Nason, ``some of
the boys who pound typewriters for a living took it for granted
that the ball park would be jammed and wrote accordingly . . . In
short, Boston was frightened away from the National League Field by
those stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. The 25,556 who did show up got to see 15 Hall of Famers
put on a rousing ballgame. They missed Ol' Diz at his best. Equally
fascinating, they missed the Great DiMaggio at his worst. They
might even have agreed that paying four dollars to a scalper was a
worthy investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bully game,'' declared Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis,
the commissioner of baseball, ``It maintained the standard of the
All-Star Games and I hope we shall see many others like it. These
games are a great thing for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Were. And are.

   ATLANTA _ One of Atlanta's nicest views recently became a lot
more visible.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Dial restaurant, atop downtown's Westin Peachtree Plaza
hotel, has a 360-degree view of Atlanta. A while back, the hotel
started charging non-guests $5 to take the glass elevator ride to
the top of the 73-story hotel. The Web camera gives the same view
for free to anyone with a computer and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is mounted on the revolving bar level of the Sun Dial
restaurant. You can see it at sundial.directsight.com/.

   Lovett or leave it: Finding right CD price
</P>
<P>
   The number of places on the Web where you can buy things is
getting almost too big to manage. And, unlike with the telephone,
there are few ways to make sure you are getting the best deal ahead
of time when you check the price of a CD or any other product
available online.
</P>
<P>
   One site, www
</P>
<P>
   .bottomdollar.com, works as a comparison shopper. Choose a
category, such as music, type in a singer, such as Lyle Lovett, and
in a few seconds the search engine produces several prices for Lyle
Lovett CDs and cassettes at several different Web sites, with
prices ranging from inexpensive to unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   The site was chosen by Cool Site of the Day,
www.coolsiteoftheday
</P>

 &HT;    Computer recipes to keep a cook going
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the small advantages of old age is a
willingness to avoid pontificating on subjects about which one
knows nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when it comes to reviewing a computer cookbook, I
always turn to Mrs. Warner, who is the best cook I know. She hates
it when I say that, because she doesn't particularly enjoy cooking.
</P>
<P>
   She quite graciously submitted these comments on Sierra's new
Mastercook Suite featuring Betty Crocker recipes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I searched for my mother's vegetable beef soup, which I was
pretty sure came from a Betty Crocker cookbook, circa 1940, and
found one very close to it in the section called Kitchen Classics.
Mother had added okra, but everything else was the same _ beef,
potatoes, carrots, onions, celery and cabbage. It took me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, no bologna
</P>
<P>
   (To see if it would take me back, I searched for my mother's
bologna salad, a dish so disgusting I had wiped it from my memory
until my sister mentioned it recently. MasterCook Suite, I can
assure you, makes no mention of bologna in any form. Back to you,
Mrs. Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Each recipe includes serving suggestions (a salad and bread
for mother's soup) and, of course, number of servings, ingredients,
directions, cooking time, preparation time, categories (beef pot
pie was listed in five categories: Beef, Breads, Luncheon, Main
Dishes, Pies &AMP; Pastry). Some recipes also include Cuisine and
Notes. Boston brown bread is American Cuisine; notes suggested
substituting dates for raisins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source is usually included _ many copyrighted by General
Mills, and many from such kitchens as the Texas Beef Council and
Pepperidge Farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is based on individual books. They range from the
four Betty Crocker cookbooks (`Best of Baking,' `Best of Healthy
and Hearty Cooking,' `Cookie Book' and `Basics') through `Casual
Dining' to `Famous American Chefs' to `Quick Fix' to `What to Fix
for Dinner' _ 26 books in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition analysis has come a long way from the days of the
first computer cookbooks. Entering ingredients is easy in
Mastercook Suite, and nutrition analysis is instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has all the standard features _ it will generate a
shopping list, tell you what you can make when you tell it what is
in your pantry, suggest menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggested a rather daunting dinner party menu for six that
was a far cry from the store-baked ham and twice-baked potatoes I
usually serve. The menu: Crab-stuffed Mushrooms, Mandarin Hazelnut
Salad, Halibut With Mushroom and Shrimp Sauce, Garlicky Greens and
Beans, Bow Knot Dinner Rolls and Ginger Pudding. Total calories
come to 932 per guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tips section is particularly helpful. Information ranges
from adzuki beans (a small reddish-brown bush bean cultivated in
China and Japan) to zymurgy (the science of fermentation,
especially as it applies to brewing). This section also presents
film clips of various kitchen techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it, straight from her mouth. I might add that she
examined the program while I was consuming the better part of a
loaf of her fresh-baked walnut wheat bread.

 &HT;    Yahoo policy crosses property lines
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This week, a huge Internet battle was resolved
and if you publish or plan to self-publish on the Web, its
implications will affect you.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started in June when Yahoo changed the terms of its
service policy on Geocities.com, the Web hosting site it now owns.
The new service policy transferred Yahoo's own policies onto
Geocities. The policy, which created an instant uproar in the
Geocities community read, in part, ``By submitting Content to any
Yahoo property, you automatically grant Yahoo the royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and full sublicensable right
and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate''
Web pages submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Translated into English, the policy says that Yahoo would own
anything people publish on their own sites _ including original
content, graphics, text and video posted on personal Web pages _
and could use it for whatever Yahoo wanted to, royalty-free.
</P>
<P>
   Web authors, a group notoriously vocal in their efforts to
protect their right to post family vacation photos on the Web
without having to cower to The Man, started a boycott of Yahoo.
Their main point of contention was that the policy was retroactive:
it affected content that had already been created and posted as
well as future Web creations.
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities watchdogs went into action, creating a Boycott
Yahoo Web site and altering their Geocities pages to make them
gray, which they called the ``Haunting of Geocities.''
</P>
<P>
   They advised Net activists to use other search engines and to
repost their sites using other free Web hosts that compete against
Geocities. Suddenly, Yahoo was in the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the Internet company recognized the error of its
ways and changed its policy. In an open letter addressed to
``Homesteaders,'' the company said it made a mistake, trying to
merge the terms of services for two companies into one.
</P>
<P>
   The Boycott Yahoo site announced ``It's Over!'' and the Haunting
of Geocities became the Rehabitation of Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resolution, the Yahoo flap is an important lesson in
the increasingly complex issue of copyright law on the Internet.
There are a few absolutes: If you use your company's computer for
e-mail and you check it on company time, chances are you don't own
it and you have no privacy. If you create Web content for a company
as a full-time worker, you don't own what you write. And you
generally give up your rights of ownership on e-mail you receive
using a free Web-based mail service. After all, the information is
housed on their server and you're using their resources to log in.
That's part of the agreement you sign when you log in.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the creative author of a work is the legal copyright
owner, but what about republishing rights and the right to use user
pages to promote a site such as Yahoo? Could Yahoo reprint
Geocities Web sites on a CD-ROM, for instance, as an archive?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dreitler, an intellectual property lawyer specializing in
trademarks and the Internet, says questions like this will continue
to arise as more people publish on the Web, and many more cases
will erupt as companies try to establish boundaries on what belongs
to them and what belongs to users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one example of the stickiness on issues of ownership on
the Internet,'' said Dreitler, who works for Vorys, Sater, Seymour
and Pease in Columbus, Ohio. ``In the Yahoo case, they argued that
they have a role in the creation of the work because they make the
technical adjustments that go into it. But if all they're doing is
posting it up on the Web, that's a fairly aggressive position. The
owner under copyright law is the person who creates the work _ that
in my opinion is the person who sits down at the computer and
creates a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The best defense against such problems, Dreitler said, is to
read the fine print _ the sometimes convoluted service agreements
you're asked to agree to when you sign up for a free Web service or
when you install new software.
</P>
<P>
   Many users don't read the agreements and don't know what rights
they're giving up. For instance, buying a copy of Microsoft Word
doesn't entitle you to ownership of the software _ only a license
to use it. It's all in the license agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people don't read that, they never do,'' Dreitler said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yahoo case, the boycott was justified _ the rules were
changed long after the game was being played. But as an increasing
amount of our time and work goes online, it's important to know
what we own and what we don't.

 &HT;    The scoop: News on Internet might not be fit to print
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Be suspicious of anything I say about newspapers and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I've been around both for a long time, and sometimes
a guy can spend so much time in his own back yard that he no longer
notices the trees there. But, given that warning, I'm going to stay
in my own back yard today.
</P>
<P>
   It's on my mind because a lot of smart people, even folks in my
own business whom I respect, worry that somehow the Web and all the
news sites there have turned the newspaper into some sort of a
dinosaur, doddering around on its last legs, dying slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is simple and logical. In the old days, it was
difficult-to-impossible for individuals and poorly funded small
start-ups to create a competing newspaper. Marketing people would _
in their own jargon _ say that the barrier was cost of entry. In
plain English, it means that the cost of starting a conventional
print newspaper from scratch is so high that it creates a barrier
most people can't cross.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the Web. All of a sudden, anyone could get a Web
site, put news on it and call that operation an electronic
newspaper. Instead of a big printing press and trucks to deliver
the paper and staffs of thousands, they needed an Internet
connection, the ability to type and some news to publish. And,
since defining news is like defining love (it is whatever it seems
to be to the person involved), that part was easy.
</P>
<P>
   So, understandably I think, bosses at newspapers started to
worry _ with that barrier down _ that the days of traditional
newspapers were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe you've noticed this yourself, but sometimes the
bosses are wrong. This is one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a newspaper, you're paying for a lot more than the
printing press and all those trucks. What you are buying _ and I
know this sounds corny, but a lot of true things do sound that way
_ are the services of professionals with ethical standards. While
you may see newspapers as biased and often wrong (lots of people
do), you'd have to hang out at one for 30 years or so _ and I've
done that _ to see just how seriously most newspaper folks treat
their task of presenting the news accurately and fairly. They often
do it imperfectly, but the real marvel of a newspaper is how often
it is done right.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, as with airline pilots, lawyers and doctors, plenty of
mistakes are made, and there is the normal distribution of idiots
and jerks. But maybe that's a good comparison. While there are
undoubtedly physicians who are stump dumb and others who are evil,
you'd still rather take pot luck with a physician if you need
medical help than seeking out your neighbor who had just finished
the ``Brain Surgery for Dummies'' book.
</P>
<P>
   And now we're getting to one of my real fears about the Web.
I'll start by acknowledging that there are all sorts of wonderful
sites, filled with information you can access seven days a week, 24
hours a day. And newspapers aren't alone in seeing others step into
their traditional roles. You'll find information and advice for
law, medicine, fixing the drain in the kitchen sink and even coping
with your neurotic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   That scares me. Let's create a perfect world where every one of
these sites is manned by really smart and decent people who do
their best. Even then, if I had a serious need for legal, medical
or plumbing help, I'd call a professional. And, when you consider
that the world is not a perfect place, and that some of the bad
information on the Web is presented just as slickly as the good
information, well ... what a mess.
</P>
<P>
   The day may come when a computer can fix a leaky pipe, cover the
news professionally or create an airtight legal document. But that
day is not here. So, enjoy this new world of instant information
but also avoid the temptation to think that everything that looks
good is good.

IN '46, WILLIAMS LED BOSTON BARRAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fifty-three years ago, when all the players were white
and most of the best ones were in the American League, the All-Star
Game came to Fenway Park for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a special game because the boys were back from war, and
Ted Williams dominated like no man in the history of the midsummer
event. Against the National League in 1946, Ted went 4 for 4 with a
walk, two homers, and five RBIs in a 12-0 victory. Don't bother
waiting for anyone to duplicate the feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a special team that year,'' says Williams, who will
throw out the ceremonial first pitch Tuesday night. ``We won the
pennant easy and all the rest. In those years, we were dominating
that game pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13th All-Star Game was played on July 9, 1946, a summer in
which the Red Sox were shredding the American League. The Sox were
en route to their first pennant since 1918, and eight Boston
players _ Williams, Dom DiMaggio, Bobby Doerr, Rudy York, Hal
Wagner, Dave Ferriss, Mickey Harris, and Johnny Pesky _ graced the
AL roster. Pesky, DiMaggio, Williams, and Doerr batted 1-2-3-5 in
the AL lineup. Sadly, the ``other'' DiMaggio, Joe, did not play.
The Yankee Clipper was injured a day earlier in Philadelphia and
did not make the trip to Boston. Brother Dominic started in center.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the eight-man Boston contingent, there was some local
controversy regarding AL manager Steve O'Neill's (then of the
Detroit Tigers) selections. Sox fans wanted to see Boston righty
Tex Hughson (en route to a 20-win season), and they also wanted to
know why Sox manager Joe Cronin wasn't part of the AL coaching
staff. Reporters speculated that Cronin was omitted because he
didn't get along with St. Louis Browns skipper Luke Sewell, who was
part of O'Neill's All-Star staff. (O'Neill later managed the Red
Sox and was the only manager Williams disliked.)
</P>
<P>
   Fenway was sold out (34,906, which yielded a gate gross of
$111,338.75) for the big game and owner Tom Yawkey accommodated the
press throng of 200 reporters and photographers, throwing a huge
bash at the Copley Plaza the night before the game. He also built
temporary press boxes on the first and third base rooftops. The
auxiliary All-Star press seating eventually became Fenway's
permanent roof boxes, still among the best seats at the old park.
Proving that things don't change much, the Sox this year have built
two more press additions to accommodate the Knights of the
Keyboard, and the extra seats are expected to stay for the rest of
the year, if not longer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of World War II, there had been no All-Star Game in 1945
and NL All-Star Frank McCormick, a Phillies first baseman, said,
``I don't think I've ever seen a more festive occasion than the
1946 All-Star Game. Guys who hadn't seen one another in years were
crossing back and forth before the game to shake hands and visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Feller, another war veteran who had pitched nine innings for
the Indians two days earlier, started for the AL and allowed two
hits and struck out three in three innings. On his way to a 26-win,
348-strikeout season, Feller was credited with the victory. He was
followed to the mound by Detroit's Hal Newhouser (who had also
pitched two days earlier) and St. Louis's Jack Kramer. The trio
allowed only three hits and fanned 10 National Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Williams and the American League offense that got the
headlines. Teddy Ballgame walked in his first at-bat, which came
against Claude Passeau, the Cub pitcher who'd surrendered Ted's
game-winning All-Star homer in Detroit in the stardust season of
1941.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Ted faced Brooklyn righty Kirby Higbe and hit a
line drive 420 feet into the sixth row of the center-field
bleachers to give the AL a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As the rout continued, Williams singled home a run in the fifth,
then singled again in the seventh. In the bottom of the eighth,
with the game hopelessly out of reach, NL manager Charley Grimm
called for Pittsburgh righty Rip Sewell. Sewell's best-known pitch
was the infamous ``eephus'' ball. The eephus was a high lob that
dropped through the strike zone as if it had fallen from the sky.
It was the subject of much conversation, and before the '46 game,
Williams had asked Sewell if he'd dare throw the pitch in the big
game. Sewell promised to serve one to The Kid.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the eighth, Vern Stephens set the table with a
single to right, bringing Ted back to the plate with two men aboard
and the AL leading, 9-0. On his first delivery, Sewell wound up
mightily, then floated an eephus toward home plate and Williams
almost hurt himself with a wicked cut that resulted in a feeble
pop, out of play. Sewell managed to sneak a fastball past Ted for a
called strike, missed on another eephus, then tried a third
moonball and Williams literally stepped into the pitch and smacked
it into the right-field bullpen, where it was caught by Williams's
teammate, Harris. Ted laughed all the way around the bases.
According to Sewell, Williams was the only man who ever hit an
eephus pitch for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted took a couple of steps to get to that ball,'' teammate
DiMaggio says with a chuckle. ``He was probably a little bit out of
the batter's box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a chance to talk to Sewell after that,'' says
Williams. ``How he could get it over the plate with the trajectory
he had was a big secret. But he just kept throwing 'em.'
</P>
<P>
   The game proved to be a dress rehearsal for the 1946 World
Series. (Sox fans are welcome to consider this an omen of things to
come.) The Globe ran the box score in big type on Page 1, right
next to a story about two downtown Boston parking lots that had
increased their all-day rate to a whopping $1 per day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day all around for the National League. Compounding
the indignity of the 12-0 beating, NL president Ford Frick had his
wallet stolen from his Boston hotel room and arrived at the park
with only 38 cents in his pockets. Frick would have his revenge 15
years later when came back to Boston as baseball commissioner and
sent everyone home when it started raining with the All-Star game
tied, 1-1, after nine innings. It remains the only tie in All-Star
history. Ted Williams threw out the first ball in that one, too.

WHEN RED SOX PLAYED STARRING ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Eighty ballplayers have been selected to represent the
Red Sox in baseball's All-Star Game. Ted Williams provided the most
memorable moments, but it hasn't been all Ted since the Sox were
first represented in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Other Sox have starred and struggled in the big game. Carl
Yastrzemski won an MVP trophy in a losing cause and Roger Clemens
won an MVP in an American League victory in 1986. Young Bill
Monbouquette was roughed up by the National League when he started
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have had some unlikely All-Stars, such as Gerry
Moses and Scott Cooper (twice). One player _ Oil Can Boyd _ bolted
from the ball club because he wasn't selected to the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox top, non-Ted, All-Star moments:
</P>
<P>
   1. Dick Radatz vs. Johnny Callison, 1964 _ Radatz was dominating
the NL, fanning 10 batters in 4 2/3 innings in two games. At Shea
Stadium, he was en route to the game's MVP Award when Callison
stung him with a three-run, walk-off homer in his third inning of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Radatz: ``Callison was the only guy I faced twice in the game.
He came up in the seventh and hit a pretty deep fly ball to Mantle
in center field. I was throwing as good as I can throw. He got my
attention. I asked Bobby Richardson, `who was that?' The seventh
and eighth were fine and we had a 4-3 lead in the ninth. I walked
Willie Mays on a 3-2 pitch. I had him struck out on ball three but
the umpire missed it. There were about 50,000 people at Shea, and I
could feel the ground shaking behind the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struck out (Henry) Aaron on three fastballs around his
knees. Then there was an error and a couple hits and the score was
tied and Callison came up again. He got halfway up to home plate
and stopped and went back and got Aaron's bat, which was lighter. I
tried to get the ball in on him and I got it over the inside part
of the plate. When it left his bat, there wasn't any doubt. First
pitch. And that MVP Corvette . . . they pulled it right out of my
garage and drove it into his.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Clemens MVP in 1986 _ This was the year the Rocket swept the
awards. He started the season 14-0, finished 24-4, and won the Cy
Young and MVP trophies. It was only fitting that he won the
All-Star MVP with three perfect innings in his hometown of Houston.
He remains the only Sox hurler credited with an All-Star win, and
in four appearances with the Red Sox, he compiled a 1.50 ERA over
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens's nine outs in '86: Tony Gwynn, Ryne Sandberg, Keith
Hernandez, Gary Carter, Darryl Strawberry, Mike Schmidt, Dale
Murphy, Ozzie Smith, and Kevin Bass.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens's outing was rare for a Sox hurler. Through the years,
Boston's All-Star hurlers have struggled to the tune of a 1-7
record and 6.67 ERA against NL batters.
</P>
<P>
   3. Yaz MVP in 1970 _ This game is remembered for Pete Rose's
head-first smash of Ray Fosse with the winning run for the NL, but
Boston's slugging outfielder was the MVP, going 4 for 6 with an RBI
in the AL's 12-inning, 5-4 loss. Yaz played center field, left
field, and first base for Earl Weaver and later donated his MVP
trophy to President Nixon, who watched the game from a box seat at
Riverfront Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bobby Doerr hits a three-run homer in a 5-3 AL win in 1943 _
This was one of the non-classics of the war years. Most of the best
players were missing, but that didn't stop Boston's Hall of
Fame-bound second baseman from cracking a three-run blast off Mort
Cooper in the second inning. This game also featured a homer by
Vince DiMaggio, the ``other'' DiMaggio brother, plus 2 1/3 innings
of stellar relief from Johnny Vander Meer _ the man who pitched
back-to-back no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Doerr played 1,865 big-league games, all at second base, all for
the Red Sox. He was a nine-time All-Star and started five times,
but this was his only All-Star homer. It provided all the runs
Dutch Leonard, Hal Newhouser, and Red Sox teammate Tex Hughson
would need.
</P>
<P>
   5. Yaz's three-run, pinch-hit homer in 1975 _ In 14 All-Star
games, Yaz hit .294 (10 for 34) with two doubles and five RBIs. His
shot off Tom Seaver at Milwaukee's County Stadium was his only
All-Star homer. The AL lost, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   6. Fred Lynn's homers in 1976, '79, and '80 _ Lynn played in six
All-Star Games for the Red Sox, homering in half of them. He tapped
three pretty good pitchers: Tom Seaver in '76, Steve Carlton in
'79, and Bob Welch in '80. The '76 home run came at a time when
Lynn had slightly fallen out of favor with Red Sox Nation. On the
heels of his magical rookie season, Lynn and teammates Rick
Burleson and Carlton Fisk held out at the start of the '76 season
and had only six homers at the All-Star break. The game was held in
Philadelphia and Lynn stayed at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, which
later phoned him to warn him about numerous guests who'd contracted
Legionnaires' disease after staying there. Lynn's '79 shot was a
first-inning Kingdome blast off Carlton. He tagged Welch at Dodger
Stadium a year later. After he was traded to California, Lynn hit
his most memorable blast, a grand slam off Atlee Hammaker at
Comiskey Park in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   7. Rookie Don Schwall pitches at Fenway in 1961 _ Schwall was en
route to the AL Rookie of the Year Award and Paul Richards let him
pitch three innings in his home park. In relief of Jim Bunning,
Schwall gave up five hits in three innings and allowed the NL to
tie the game on Bill White's sixth-inning infield single. He struck
out two, walked one, and hit Orlando Cepeda with a pitch. He would
go on to become the Red Sox' first Rookie of the Year (the award
originated in 1946), and was traded to the Pirates in a deal that
brought Dick Stuart to Boston in 1963. Schwall went 15-7 in his
rookie season, but never again won 10 games and finished 49-48 for
his career.
</P>
<P>
   8. Bill Monbouquette routed in 1960 start at Kansas City _ White
Sox manager Al Lopez tabbed Monbouquette to start the first of two
All-Star Games. The Sox were not known for their pitching and it
was an honor for a young righty from Medford to start.
Unfortunately, Monbouquette surrendered five runs in two innings
and took the loss at Municipal Stadium. Four of the first five
batters he faced (Willie Mays, Eddie Mathews, Hank Aaron, and Ernie
Banks) are members of the 500-homer club. Monbouquette surrendered
homers to Banks and Braves catcher Del Crandell.
</P>
<P>
   Monbouquette: ``I didn't pitch well. My location wasn't good. I
tried to come up and in on Banks and left it out over the plate and
he deposited it over the wall. I hung a curveball to Crandell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it was quite a thrill to be selected to start. I found
out the night before. I was only 23 or 24 years old. I guess it's
not every day a kid from Medford gets a chance like that.
Naturally, I was disappointed I didn't pitch very well. I remember
that it was about 126 degrees on the field and somebody tried to
make me feel better by telling me that Yogi Berra called the wrong
pitches. We had the next day off and flew to New York, and I
remember sitting in the hotel lobby and Stan Musial walked by and
said, `Did you eat yet? Come on with us.' It was a great thing for
him to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Three Sox start the 1967 game _ It may not seem like a big
deal today, but Red Sox fans took great pride in seeing
Yastrzemski, Tony Conigliaro, and Rico Petrocelli all starting the
All-Star Game in Anaheim in the summer of 1967. It had been more
than a decade since the Red Sox were respectable and seeing three
Boston jerseys at the start of the game somehow legitimized the '67
Sox as pennant contenders. Jim Lonborg also made the '67 All-Star
team, but did not pitch because he'd hurled the Sunday before the
break.
</P>
<P>
   Yaz, who went 3 for 4 with two walks in the 2-1 loss, said ``to
have four Red Sox players there gave us a lot of confidence as far
as the pennant race was concerned. It made us feel legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   10. Oil Can snubbed again _ The Can got wiggy when he wasn't
named to the All-Star team in 1985, then pulled a five-star nutty
when the same thing happened in 1986. He threatened to kill Jim
Rice and apeared on the cover of a local tabloid newspaper, tossing
liquid at a photographer. The Can was 11-6 when he was snubbed. His
tirade produced a suspension and resulted in Boyd checking into the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester when the
Sox insisted he undergo drug testing. While the All-Star Game was
played in Houston, Boyd was charged with complaints of assault and
battery on a police officer in Chelsea. Charges were later dropped
and Boyd came back to make a start in the 1986 World Series.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: The exterior of a black car parked in the sun
is hotter than a white car, but does it affect interior
temperature? Does the AC work harder in the black one, with a
noticeable difference in gas mileage? Is window tinting a factor?
</P>
<P>
   _ John Nemetz
</P>
<P>
   A: The air conditioner's effect on your gas mileage is minimal.
Purchase a light-colored car in hot states. Black holds heat; white
reflects it. Anything to help thighs unstick from the seat. Need a
big difference in car temperature? Buy one with a light interior,
says auto AC guru Eddie Creel of Nelson Automotive. Medium fan
speed (rather than high) lowers the air temperature quickly. Window
tinting also helps. Park in the shade and leave windows cracked
whenever possible. Car parked/cooking in the sun all day? Roll down
the windows for the first few driving minutes to let hot air
escape. What does this AC sage drive? White cars with light gray or
tan interiors. White hides scratches as well as dents better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I ordered some Roger Bros. flatware in 1991. I built my
dining room and dishes around it. Many pieces have disappeared in
little hands. I recovered a few from the sandbox. It was ZIA
stainless steel. I can't find replacement pieces anywhere. _ Jule
Vigness
</P>
<P>
   A: This popular pattern is often in stock at Wilma Saxton,
stainless flatware replacement service. Call (800) 267-8029 and
leave your list of desired pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My father's brother, who no one has seen in more than 30
years, is the recipient of a part of my grandfather's (his
father's) estate. My father and uncle have been trying to find him
for months, but have been unsuccessful. The authorities need his
Social Security number to locate him, but the Social Security
Administration will not release it due to confidentiality
requirements. If he is not located, the money, now escrowed by the
court, will go to the State of Texas in seven years. Do you know
any means to get his Social Security number or another way to
locate a missing person? _ Bennett Brooke
</P>
<P>
   A: You can try a private detective, but you can also use a
little-known service from the Social Security Administration:
letter forwarding. Circumstances? It must involve a matter of great
importance, such as a death or serious illness in the missing
person's immediate family, or a sizable amount of money due the
missing person. Your situation fits. Forwarding letters with a
humanitarian purpose is free; a $3 fee is charged for others (check
payable to the Social Security Administration). Each letter is read
before forwarding _ so send it unsealed. Enclose nothing of value.
But do send identifying information: your uncle's date and place of
birth, his father's name and mother's full birth name. Requests are
sent to: Social Security Administration, OCRO, Division of
Certification and Coverage, 300 N. Greene St., Baltimore, MD 21201.
Q: I volunteer for a nonprofit organization and am involved with
hiring. We have just hired a new employee and used a service to do
a criminal background check. What are the guidelines on placing the
report in the employee's personnel file? If we cannot keep it
there, how do we prove a search was done? _ Doris M. Hug
</P>
<P>
   A: Oddly enough, the Fair Credit Reporting Act covers the use of
this information, and the Federal Trade Commission has authority. A
credit report is any consumer report used to screen eligibility for
a variety of things: to receive credit or to land a job. The
information you secured is for a specific purpose. An unauthorized
use _ such as selling it to another party _ is prohibited. I would
advise prudence and limit the access to such personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was outraged over the sentence of 20 years probation given
to the woman who pleaded guilty to smothering eight of her children
over a period of two decades. I'd like to write the Philadelphia
district attorney to protest. _ C.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: The prosecutor was Charles Gallagher; the district attorney,
Lynne Abraham. Both can be contacted at 1421 Arch St.,
Philadelphia, PA 19102. Part of Marie Noe's sentence is five years
of house arrest (with an electronic bracelet) as well as
psychiatric therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a ``Cotton-eyed Joe''? I am not talking about the
dance or the song. In the song ``Harbor Lights,'' there are harbor
lights, in ``Harvest Moon'' there is a harvest moon, so what is a
``Cotton-eyed Joe''? _ Roy McCoy
</P>
<P>
   A: A person. The phrase cotton-eyed was used to describe folks
who had a condition that made their entire eye appear milky or
white, according to Dr. Francis Abernethy of the Texas Folklore
Society. Local retinal surgeon Dr. Armie Harper says the white
appearance may have been caused by cataracts or perhaps a corneal
scar. However, it was probably pterygium, a condition affecting
those who worked outside _ farmers, field hands, etc. Pterygium,
caused by overexposure to the sun and wind, covers the eyes in
reddish-white film.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know the dimensions of the luggage allowed as
a carry-on. I know there is a certain limit at check-in. _ David S.
</P>
<P>
   A: The suggested size is 9 by 13 by 23 inches to fit under the
seat or in the overhead compartment, but the rule is a combined
size of 45 inches (height, width and length), says American
Airlines, whose weight limit is 70 pounds per bag. Weight limits
vary by carrier. (Hey, if you can't lift it, maybe you shouldn't be
carrying it on the plane). The limit of two carry-ons per passenger
does not include normal-size purses, coats or items that assist
those with disabilities. Grouse about passengers with carry-ons?
The practice allows baggage handlers to move checked luggage
quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've finally found a solution for the mosquitoes that bother
us in our baby wading pool outside _ citronella tiki torches. But
now, I'm wondering if all the black smoke they put out is dangerous
for my baby. _ B. Rowan
</P>
<P>
   A: The Central Texas Poison Center says the smoke may irritate
eyes, but is not toxic. For safety, keep the center's number handy
_ (800) 764-7661.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband's source of wingtip dress shoes in a size 14 EEE
(black or cordovan) has been discontinued. After trying two big and
tall catalogs and several local sources I am at the end of my
shoestring! _ Laurie Stauffer
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing worse than an unshod husband. Time to develop some
new mail order sources for wingtips: Reyers Shoe Store at (800)
245-1550 and E. T. Wright Executive Shoes at (800) 934-1022 (free
catalog). Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at
P.O. Box 670, Austin, TX 78767 or e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com.

IT WAS TEDDY'S BALLGAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teddy Ballgame might as well be Teddy All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed the greatest individual performance in the game's
history, bashing two homers and going 4 for 4 with a walk and five
RBIs in a 12-0 victory in his hometown park in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the most dramatic home run in All-Star history, a
three-run, game-winning blast in the ninth at Tiger Stadium in the
mythic summer of 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In another emotional moment, he threw out the first ball at the
1953 All-Star Game at Crosley Field in Cincinnati just four days
after his discharge from the US Marines. The Red Sox brought him
out of retirement to perform the same service when the All-Star
Game was last held in Boston in 1961, and he'll do it again Tuesday
night when the baseball world descends on Olde Fenway one last time
before this century is done.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star Game was invented by a Chicago sportswriter
in 1933, Ted Williams has probably participated in more All-Star
moments than any other ballplayer. And not all the moments were
good. In 1950, Ted broke his left elbow when he crashed into a
fence in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked the All-Star Game because I got a chance to see
all the pitchers,'' Williams says today. ``I wanted to see the best
pitchers, and the best pitchers in the league with the best records
were there, and I got a big kick out of that. I enjoyed that.
Sometimes I got struck out, but I enjoyed being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Never content to be the best hitter, Williams liked the
All-Star Game because it was a chance to do more research on the
genre of humans he hated most: major league pitchers. The All-Star
Game was one-stop shopping for Ted _ a chance to see all the best
hurlers in one place on one day.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle owned the World Series, Ted
Williams owned the All-Star game. In 18 midsummer classics,
Williams hit .304 (14 for 46) with four homers and 12 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't remember throwing out the first ball before the
boring (a 1-1, rain-stopped tie) Fenway All-Star Game of 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my kid did that,'' Williams says. ``That was my
first year after I stopped playing, and I did a lot of fishing and
worked with Sears, Roebuck, and I was traveling around to boat
factories and engine factories.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he does it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm's about the same,'' he says. ``Not very good. But
certainly going back to Boston will be big. There's a bunch of
memories. I think the All-Star Game is a special time for any
ballplayer. I think it ought to be. You're there with all the great
players. They've been through the mill. They talk the same
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now 80, has suffered a couple of strokes and a broken
hip in recent years. His vision is not good and he gets around
either in a wheelchair or with a walker. But he's still in demand
for ceremonial tosses. Last year he threw first balls in Florida
and San Diego, and just last month Ted lobbed a short strike to
Mike Piazza before a Red Sox-Mets game at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Ted didn't make the All-Star team his rookie season. Boston's
representatives in the 1939 game were Jimmie Foxx, Lefty Grove, Joe
Cronin (all Hall of Famers), and Roger Cramer. Ted's first All-Star
Game was a 4-0 loss to the Nationals in St. Louis in 1940. He hit a
couple of feeble grounders, was replaced by Hank Greenberg, and
vowed to do better next time.
</P>
<P>
   In the legendary summer of '41, Williams was en route to his
.406 season and DiMaggio was in the midst of his 56-game hitting
streak when the All-Star Game came to Detroit. At the break,
DiMaggio's streak was at 48 games and Williams was batting .405.
</P>
<P>
   Ted drove in the American League's first run with a
fourth-inning double, but the AL trailed, 5-3, and Williams was due
up sixth in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Hayes popped up to start the inning, and Williams
figured he'd never get to bat. But Ken Keltner reached on an
infield single, then Joe Gordon singled, and Cecil Travis walked.
Joltin' Joe was next and he hit what should have been a game-ending
double play, but a sliding Travis disrupted Billy Herman at second
and Herman's throw to first was wide of the base. Keltner scored
(he would later be the man who stopped Joe D's streak), and that
brought Ted to the plate with two on, two out, and the AL trailing,
5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cub righty Claude Passeau, who had fanned Williams in the
eighth, was on the mound. Ted fouled the first pitch, then took two
balls. On Passeau's fourth offering, an inside slider, Williams
launched a game-winning, three-run bomb into the stands in right.
This homer has been replayed about 10 million times and it's
impossible to forget Williams's sheer joy as he claps his hands and
jumps around the bases. He was 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic DiMaggio, Ted's teammate and Joe's brother, had a great
view from the on-deck circle. ``Those two guys were the two main
guys in the victory of the American League over the National
League,'' he said. ``Joe beat out that hard grounder that gave Ted
a chance to come to bat. They had a powwow on the mound and I was
in the on-deck circle, thinking they'd walk Ted to get to me. It
was the only thing to do. But they pitched to Ted and, oh god, it
was only a matter of if that ball was going to stay in the park.
Ted was prancing up and down. I can't ever remember seeing him so
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ted downplays the event as merely ``one of my
highlights,'' but in his autobiography he refers to the home run as
``the most thrilling hit of my life.'' It's still considered
baseball tragedy that Williams's greatest hardball moments came in
All-Star Games, while Joe DiMaggio is remembered for winning World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Ted went 1 for 4 in the 1942 All-Star Game at the Polo Grounds,
then joined the massive war effort for the next three years. In
1946, he returned to the All-Star Game with his tour de force at
Fenway Park. Williams's Fenway All-Star homer off Rip Sewell's
famous eephus pitch is still one for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Ted's next All-Star moment of any significance was at Comiskey
Park in 1950 when, in pursuit of a Ralph Kiner fly ball, he slammed
into fence and broke his elbow in the first inning of a 4-3 NL win.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a half-century later, Williams has complete recall of the
play:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fly ball to left-center. Kiner hit it and his ball
always kept carrying and carrying. I was running and running, and I
was going to get it, but I didn't realize how close I was. I got
the ball and turned around and there's the fence right there. I
turned around and tried to hold myself off, but I broke my left
elbow. I didn't hit the wall that hard, but I was like this
(gestures with elbow extended as if to break a fall) when I hit it
and I just crushed my left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played two or three more innings. I put the American League
ahead two innings later. It hurt me the rest of the year; in fact,
they weren't even sure I was going to play anymore. Doc (Jack)
Fadden was a tremendous trainer and he knew exactly what I had done
and he said, `This is pretty serious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``That fence was all concrete,'' remembered Dom DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning development. Williams had always insisted it
was a bad idea to crash into walls while playing defense. To get
hurt in a game that didn't count in the standings seemed even more
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Ted stayed in the game for eight innings. Casey Stengel was the
AL manager and he kept checking to see if the slugger was OK.
Williams made another good catch on a second Kiner fly ball and hit
his own fly ball to the warning track. Ted's fifth-inning single
put the AL ahead, 3-2, but after he fanned in the eighth, he was
replaced by Dom DiMaggio. Two days later, Williams underwent
surgery that sidelined him for two months and crushed Boston's
pennant hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams already had 25 homers at the All-Star break, but would
hit only three more the rest of the year. He played in 89 games in
1950, but still managed 97 RBIs. To this day, he says his elbow was
never again right and he was never the same hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Ted was in Korea, serving as John Glenn's wingman during the
1952 All-Star Game, but returned from war in time to throw out the
first ball at the midsummer festival in '53. Three years later, he
hit his fourth and final All-Star homer, a shot off Warren Spahn in
a 7-3 AL loss at Griffith Stadium in Washington. Williams was one
of four players who homered in the game, a lofty group that
included Willie Mays, Stan Musial, and Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   By 1958, Ted was still an All-Star, but no longer a starter. His
last All-Star appearance was in 1960 when he hit a seventh-inning
pinch single off Cardinals righthander Larry Jackson at Yankee
Stadium. His next All-Star moment will be Tuesday night.

   MOSQUITO-BITES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Some people seem to attract
mosquitoes more readily than others, and health experts say the

through a person's skin. And that's bad news for active people. The
more you move around, the more carbon dioxide you produce. By

   TEENMAGS (Undated) _ We have a proliferation of magazines for

   CHEVRON (San Francisco) _ These are heady times in the oil
industry, what with the whiplash of merger, crude oil prices on a

PLAYING POWER BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Shoulder to shoulder with Ken Boyer, decked out in his
spotless Milwaukee Braves baggy white woolens, Hank Aaron listened
intently to the part about the prize money. Every ballplayer did.
This was 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Home Run Derby, the television show that brought together the
game's greatest long-ball hitters of the day, offered the chance
for big-leaguers to add significantly to their income. A chance to
win a couple thousand dollars, maybe $5,000, maybe $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like that got a man's ear. With a few good strokes, a
year's pay could be pocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the guys participating,'' Aaron said, ``it was a chance to
make some extra money. Hey, that was 40 years ago. They weren't
throwing money around like now.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, 10 of baseball's biggest hitters will try to cut
tiny Fenway Park even further down to size when they compete in the
wildly popular Home Run Derby segment of Major League Baseball's
All-Star bash. A multimillionaire cast of crushers will step to the
Back Bay plate and, with their hits over the Wall and blasts into
the bleachers, lead the packed house through crescendos of
``ooohs'' and ``ahhs'', their Louisville Sluggers and Adirondacks
temporarily transformed into a maestro's baton.
</P>
<P>
   How different it will be from the Home Run Derby television show
of '59. Hosted by Mark Scott, who died of a heart attack at age 45
soon after recording the last segment, the show was an exercise in
understated simplicity. Still aired today on ESPN Classic, it is
also painfully corny, to the point of being laughable, as if culled
from an ``I Love Lucy'' episode _ at any moment you expect Fred and
Ethel to wander across the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were only 26 episodes of Home Run Derby. Aaron, 25
at the time, ultimately was the top money-winner. He took the cash
home to Mobile, Ala., and bought his father a grocery store,
helping the senior Aaron retire from his days of lugging rivets for
the Alabama Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The store's gone now,'' said Aaron, who went on to be the
game's all-time long-ball hitter, totaling 755 homers in 23 years,
``but the building's still there. Last I knew, it was for sale.
That money was a big help back then. My father worked very hard,
all his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's format was simple: each week, two big-leaguers went
head-to-head for nine innings, swinging for the ivy-covered fences
at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. Built in the 1920s for the Pacific
Coast League, Wrigley briefly served as the first home of the Los
Angeles Angels before it was razed in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   During filming, the stands were empty. The pitchers who lobbed
up batting-practice cupcakes, local minor-leaguers, were never
identified, nor were the outfielders or catcher. Any ball that
didn't leave the yard was ruled an out. ``It's a home run or
nothing here in Home Run Derby,'' Scott would incessantly chime in.
If a batter didn't swing, and umpire Art Passarella called it a
strike, that too was an out.
</P>
<P>
   The hitter who wasn't at the plate shared a long stick
microphone at a desk with Scott, the two trading oft-strained
comments while balls were sprayed around the park. Invariably, talk
centered on a batter's stance, his swing, how he got ``good wood on
the ball.'' Scott constantly reached to break the silence after
routine outs. (``There's a high pop _ that's a home run in an
elevator shaft.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the action was captured by a camera behind home
plate. The production was dressed up only by generic closeups of
the hitters spliced in before they took their next rip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was so hokey that it was good,'' said Loren
Matthews, who as ESPN's senior vice-president of programming
brought the old show back on air in '89. ``And you look at the guys
they had _ that was a pretty darned good roster.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially airing in syndication around the US at the start
of the '60s, film of the 26 episodes remained in storage at MGM in
California for over a quarter-century before being revived by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We essentially found it lying in a vault with dust all over
it,'' recalled Matthews, now executive vice-president of ESPN
Regional TV in Charlotte, N.C. One of ESPN's program managers at
the time brought the old series to Matthews's attention. ``I looked
him right in the eye and said, `Get me Home Run Derby.' I
remembered watching it as a kid. I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron topped all hitters with $13,500 in winnings, followed by
Mickey Mantle ($10,000), and Red Sox slugger Jackie Jensen
($8,500). In all, there were 20 participants, including Willie
Mays, Harmon Killebrew, Frank Robinson, Rocky Colavito, Eddie
Mathews, and Al Kaline.
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Jensen, reached recently at her home in Virginia, said
her late husband often spoke of how he enjoyed participating in the
Derby. Friends still send her tapes when he appears on ESPN reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always struck by how serious he was,'' she said. ``I mean,
I have to laugh sometimes, he had such grim determination. Mantle
always looked relaxed, no matter what, but Jack's there, so
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before he died of a heart attack in '82, Jensen was
back at Fenway for an old-timer's game, Katharine recalled. Ted
Williams was there, too. She was struck by Williams referring to
his pals in the players' lounge that day as ``the Tall Ships of
baseball.'' She thinks of that remark with great fondness when she
watches her late husband on the Home Run Derby reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that old show has begun to have a special place in the
hearts of fans,'' she said. ``It was all so simple, and it was
before the big money. All these years later, I think fans have
become a little discouraged by the dollars _ the high cost of
games, the huge salaries and all.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got his invitation to be on the show, Aaron recalled, he
made it a point to be in shape. He remembers the show's promoter
telling him not to worry, that if he failed to win in his first
appearance, he would be called back for a later show.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't counting on that,'' said Aaron, a senior
vice-president with the Atlanta Braves. ``They had Mantle. They had
Mays. Here I was from Milwaukee, a much smaller market, and I just
figured, `No way are they going to bring yours truly back if I
don't win.' I was going out there to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Classic recently aired the Aaron-Ken Boyer matchup. Fresh
from squeezing out a victory over Killebrew in the prior
installment, Boyer tells Scott early on ``I know I'm gonna have to
hit a few to beat this boy _ because he can hit 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point in his career, Aaron had 179 homers after six
seasons with the Braves. Young, fit, and wide-eyed, he overcame a
6-3 deficit and dumped Boyer, 9-6. Two thousand dollars richer,
Aaron moved on to the next duel with Jim Lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, Home Run Derby lives on, brought back to life
in '85 when Major League Baseball first folded it into its All-Star
package.
</P>
<P>
   In its infancy, it was black and white, simple and understated.
Today it's a full-blown happening, with crowds jumping, cameras
covering every angle, packed full of high-fives, chest-beatings,
and triumphant fist-clenchings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has grown in stature,'' said Aaron. ``It's really
caught on. People love home runs, they always will, the ball going
out is the ultimate for the fans. The home run derby is great. But
baseball's got to be careful, too. As much as I like the game, love
it, I think it's reached the point where it squeezes all the
vitamins and all the dollars out of it. You have to pay to see Home
Run Derby now. To me, baseball's got to learn to give something
back, let the fans come in an enjoy themselves. I don't think we
have to grab every nickel that's out there.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He paused. He'd never done that before _ he was always
in a racehorse rush to get down to business _ but then, he'd never
seen anything like this before.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he'd charged out of the dugout as if he were storming an
enemy fortress, as usual. When he arrived at the mound, breathless,
he'd dropped to his knees and rearranged the dirt just so, as
usual. And as he peered in at the catcher, he'd moved his lips
constantly, conducting an apparent conversation with the baseball,
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But now he couldn't help himself. He wanted to take all this in.
So he slowly turned, first one way, then another, making a complete
circle, surveying the scene at Veterans Stadium: the dugouts
stuffed with the biggest names in the sport; the ABC cameras
beaming this tableau to the world; the 63,974 Philadelphia fans
bellowing in anticipation, including commissioner Bowie Kuhn and
Gerald Ford _ the president of the United States, for crying out
loud. And as he peered back in at the catcher, one thought
ovewhelmed him: ``Seventy thousand people here, and if I don't
throw the ball, they're still waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him for wanting to freeze this moment forever?
It was a strange time to be catching his breath, but it was about
the first chance he'd had. Two head-spinning months, eight
whirlwind weeks lifted from a fairy tale, had culminated in this:
the starting pitching assignment for the American League in the
1976 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 15, when he'd thrown six no-hit innings and wound up
with a two-hitter in his first major league start, he had
metamorphosed from Mark Fidrych, the kid from nowhere _ all right,
from Northborough, Mass., but who had ever heard of that? _ to Mark
``The Bird'' Fidrych, delightful alien from another baseball
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The success and saga built _ to a 9-2 record and a 1.78 earned
run average, punctuated by a 5-1 victory over the Yankees June 28
at Tiger Stadium, a nationally televised Monday night lovefest that
47,855 Detroit fans refused to leave until he took a curtain call.
And in the process, he'd somehow become a phenomenon, a mania, a
freakish deity almost.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kimm, his personal catcher with the Tigers, had seen
countless pieces of evidence, especially after a game in New York.
Fidrych got in a car with some friends and was immediately engulfed
by worshipping fans, making it look as if he were riding in a
vehicle built entirely of human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Staub, the Detroit right fielder and his All-Star
teammate, had never heard anything like the cacophonous salute that
followed the Monday night win. He'd gone into the Tiger clubhouse,
where Fidrych was undressing, and told the bewildered 21-year-old _
ordered him, finally _ to get back in uniform, because the
foot-stomping, girder-shaking crazies chanting, ``We want the
Bird,'' weren't going to be satisfied until he gave them an encore.
Staub just about had to pull him down the runway, the euphoria
echoing from above, and push him up the dugout steps, instructing
him to use his cap like a clock, turning and doffing it at every
imaginary 10-minute interval. Staub, a 14-year veteran, no longer
was taken aback by much in baseball, but this was the greatest
vicarious thrill he'd ever experienced.
</P>
<P>
   It was like this all the time, all over. A Fidrych start was
estimated to be worth at least an extra 20,000 fans on the road,
and opposing clubs would call ahead, clamoring for him to take his
turn in their town. For the woebegone Tigers, limping toward a
fifth-place finish in the AL East, the rookie was responsible for
an increase of 400,000 in attendance. And when they arrived in a
new city, it was as if a rock tour had rolled in; the fans
beseeched and besieged Fidrych, and while he was provided no
special security, Ralph Houk, his 56-year-old manager, said he
would volunteer to be his bodyguard, so much did he love the kid.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the results Fidrych produced with his
93-mile-per-hour fastball, his impeccable control, his sinister
sinker, and slider that dipped below a hitter's ankles _ after the
hapless soul had swung and missed _ it was his antics and persona
that enchanted the general populace.
</P>
<P>
   They had bought the media's spin that his various quirks were a
showman's flourishes. They didn't understand that there was a
logical purpose to each so-called eccentricity.
</P>
<P>
   The race to and from the mound was to keep him energized. The
mound maintenance was to put the dirt in perfect order after the
opposing pitcher had left an uncomfortable hole in his wake. The
gladhanding of teammates after nice defensive plays was a
spontaneous gesture of gratitude. And those chats with the ball
actually were soliloquies in which he reinforced to himself what he
needed to do. These were all things his father, Paul, an assistant
school principal, had taught him from the time he was old enough to
grip a ball, and no one had taken particular note of them before.
Not even the previous year at Triple A Evansville, where, instead
of walking around the railing in front of the dugout, he would jump
over it.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no misunderstanding the rest of it. His eagerness,
his enthusiasm, his pure joy in playing the game were genuine. And
his awe at being able to play it at the highest level _ even for
the major league minimum salary of $16,500 _ was endearing. He was
an original, a true innocent, who had people wondering, in veteran
Tigers catcher Bill Freehan's words, ``This kid is from Boston?
Shouldn't he be more sophisticated?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, because that wasn't him. Never had been. While he was
growing up in Northborough, playing baseball had been its own
reward; he'd more or less stumbled into all this.
</P>
<P>
   He had been unwittingly riding the wave since he and his pals
from the Northgate neighborhood _ Kevin Hart and Danny Coakley and
Donnie Raycroft and Tommy Sullivan _ made their own diamond in the
field behind Mr. Dumas's house and Mr. Conway's place, where they'd
spend every summer day unless they were playing over at Proctor
School.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he wasn't merely a pitcher; he considered himself a
player, a kid who'd go wherever just to get into a game. In fact,
he spent his first summer of American Legion ball as a shortstop;
it wasn't until the following year, when Tommy Sullivan beat him
out at short, that he asked the coach, Ted Rolfe, for a chance to
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Duly impressed as he watched the kid take his tryout throws,
Rolfe said, ``Why didn't you tell me last year you could pitch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you didn't ask,'' said Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three summers, he was Rolfe's ace, and the coach
was forever grateful when he beat Northborough's archrival,
Milford, each year on the Fourth of July before holiday crowds of
2,000-2,500.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, he was still just a kid who wanted to play, and
in high school at Algonquin Regional and during his senior year at
Worcester Academy, he'd be at first base or in the outfield when he
wasn't on the mound. Sure, Worcester coach Tom Blackburn knew he
had something special and would save Fidrych for the toughest teams
on the schedule: the Brown and Dartmouth and University of
Massachusetts freshmen. But while both Rolfe and Blackburn marveled
at Fidrych's intensity and enthusiasm and reverence for the game,
they didn't project a major league future for him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   The summer after his senior year, he went to work at Zecco &AMP;
Co., a Northborough outfit that remodeled gas stations, among other
projects. On weekends, he pumped gas at the local Sunoco station.
His only ambition was to raise money for his freshman tuition at
Old Dominion, where Blackburn had helped him gain admission _
without a baseball scholarship _ at the last minute. The baseball
draft? He didn't know when it was. He didn't think it concerned
him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the day his buddy Jimmy Carlson, a baseball fanatic who
devoured the sports pages, came roaring up to the Zecco lot on his
Yamaha 250 and announced, ``Fidy. Tenth-round draft pick. Detroit
Tigers,'' it didn't make much of an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the end of the week, when he came home from the gas
station for lunch and found Joe Cusick, a Tiger scout, sitting
there, did he realize he had an alternative to majoring in
electrical engineering at Old Dominion, a destination with little
appeal because he was a reluctant student.
</P>
<P>
   Cusick asked him if he wanted to play pro ball. Fidrych didn't
hesitate. ``What else am I gonna do?'' he asked himself. ``Go to
college? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   So he signed on the spot for a $3,000 bonus, which went for car
payments and to fulfill his Worcester Academy tuition obligation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only now did he begin to consider himself a pitcher, and even
then, he wasn't sure what kind. At his first pro stop, Bristol,
Tenn., of the Appalachian League in the summer of 1974, he was told
he would be used as a long man. He had to ask what a long man was,
and for the first two weeks, he discovered there was no need for
one, so effective were the Bristol starters.
</P>
<P>
   When roving minor league pitching coach John Grodzicki dropped
by the bullpen to ask how things were going one day, Fidrych told
him, ``I don't even know what a game looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   Grodzicki provided his salvation. Alleycat Johnson wasn't doing
the job, so Fidrych became the new short man. That's how he
finished the season.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he shot through the system without even
realizing it. At Single A Lakeland, he became a starter, though
nobody told him why and he didn't ask.
</P>
<P>
   He also picked up a nickname. Taking note of his brown tangle of
unruly ringlets, Lakeland coach Jeff Hogan approached him on the
bus one day and said, ``You're not Fid anymore. I watch `Sesame
Street' with my little daughter, and you remind me of that guy, so
from now on, you're `The Bird Man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't bother Fidrych in the least; he'd watched Big Bird
with his kid sister, and, anyway, he didn't care what they called
him as long as they kept pitching him.
</P>
<P>
   They did, at different levels and in different roles. Not far
into the season, the closer at Montgomery developed a sore arm, so
Fidrych became a Double A short man. And when the incumbent
returned, it was on to Evansville for Fidrych, a starter once
again.
</P>
<P>
   And a prospect, too, though again it was news to him.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... to him.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was invited to the parent club's spring training at Lakeland
in 1976, and he figured, ``Well, if they're gonna have me here, let
me show what I can throw.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was still just going with the flow, unaware that he was
impressing the brass and his teammates, who disregarded his
peripheral routine and loved playing behind him because, as his
Single A catcher, Lance Parrish, put it, ``He worked fast, threw
strikes, and kept the defense in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, his fellow prospects were shipped out until late in
camp, only Fidrych and Frank MacCormack remained. Even then, he
assumed he'd be around for only another week or so, to serve as
afterthought fodder in exhibition blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. He clinched a major league roster spot in his
final audition against Cincinnati, during which he impressed Reds
manager Sparky Anderson not only with his pitching but with his
exuberance. ``Like one of those big flies that flit all over the
place,'' said Anderson. ``They hit a window and _ boom! _ they
bounce off there and head somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidrych landed on the Detroit roster. General manager Jim
Campbell gave him the news, along with orders to get to a Lakeland
clothing store post haste and come back with a more suitable
wardrobe than the T-shirts and cutoffs he always sported.
</P>
<P>
   Fidrych returned emptyhanded, and Campbell growled, ``Where are
those clothes I told you to buy?'' Fidrych explained that he
couldn't afford any of the $100-and-up suits, and Campbell
demanded, ``What about your signing bonus?'' Already gone, what
little there was of it, explained Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   So Campbell took him in tow back to the store and told the clerk
to put the purchases on his tab, sort of a bonus signing bonus.
Fidrych promptly picked out four suits and a London Fog coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's all it took?'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, as long as it's your money,'' said Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   One oversight. He forgot about footwear, so his new ensemble was
set off by a pair of tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't such an easy fit on the Detroit pitching staff. Houk
had vowed not to throw him to the wolves, and for the first month
and a half, his workload consisted of two relief appearances
spanning one inning.
</P>
<P>
   Only when his roommate, veteran righthander Joe Coleman, fell
ill with the flu in mid-May did Fidrych get a start. He was
supposed to be a one-time, emergency fill-in. But he proceeded to
baffle the Indians _ while network cameras cut away from the other
Saturday afternoon telecasts and focused on his no-hit bid and
unique sideshow _ and earned a regular spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman soon was traded, and Fidrych went on his magical ride,
though he had no time to digest its public relations implications;
he was too caught up in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So he was stunned during a game the first week in July when
Detroit publicist Vince Desmond went on the public address system
at Tiger Stadium and informed the crowd, ``We have found out who is
starting the All-Star Game and who the starting pitcher will be _
our own Mark `The Bird' Fidrych.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was immediately halted _ the opposing pitcher simply
stopped working for three or four minutes because of the
distractions _ while the crowd roared, Fidrych's teammates pushed
him out of the dugout to absorb the adulation, and tears welled in
the rookie's eyes. ``It's everybody's goal,'' he thought, ``and
I've made it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 24 hours before he stepped on the mound at the Vet had been
the biggest blur as Fidrych's stream-of-consciousness routine _
``If it comes into his head,'' said All-Star outfielder Fred Lynn
of the Red Sox, ``it comes out his mouth'' _ took over
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the game, he had been summoned to a luncheon at
the All-Star hotel, the Bellevue-Stratford, where an outbreak of
Legionnaires' disease would soon claim 29 lives. Nobody had told
him about either the luncheon or the proper attire, so he showed up
on the dais wearing a dungaree shirt with a flower print, only to
discover that everyone else in the room was in suitcoat and tie.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was memorable for other reasons. Fidrych got
introduced to many of his heroes _ ``Pleased to meet you, Mr.
Garvey,'' he told the Dodgers first baseman _ but what struck him
most was the arrogance of the National Leaguers. Pete Rose, Johnny
Bench _ the whole world champion Reds contingent, in particular _
were serving humble pie for dessert. They'd won 12 of the last 13
All-Star Games, and they told Fidrych and his teammates, ``Why
don't you guys just collect your meal money and go home?''
</P>
<P>
   Then NL pitchers John Montefusco and starter Randy Jones
switched identities when they introduced themselves to Fidrych. So
when it came time for the standard photo of the opposing starting
pitchers, Fidrych went up to Montefusco and said, ``Come on, Randy,
they want us.'' And Montefusco cackled, ``You don't even know who
you're pitching against, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   That cinched it. Fidrych was now on a crusade to beat the NL.
</P>
<P>
   On game night as the main event approached, fellow Tiger and
All-Star Ron LeFlore informed Fidrych that President Ford wanted to
meet the players, especially the Detroit representatives, since the
president was a Michigander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't it wait until after the game?'' asked Fidrych. ``I'm
trying to concentrate on the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, no, it couldn't, LeFlore told him. So Fidrych, ``doing his
Bird jibber-jabbering,'' according to another first-time All-Star,
George Brett, met Ford, who invited him to take a private guided
tour of the White House ``that the public doesn't get to see.'' The
president would show him around himself, and if he weren't there,
``then his son, Chris Ford, said he'd do it,'' said Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that would be Jack Ford, who recently had been in the
news for dating Chris Evert, but Fidrych could be excused for the
mixup. His mind still was elsewhere _ on those cursed National
Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was atop the mound at the Vet, in prime time on July
13, the focal point of the baseball universe, with the game
literally in the palm of his hand, where it had figuratively rested
for two dizzying months. Finally, his reverie was interrupted when
Rose, the NL leadoff batter, stepped to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the pest, Rose _ who had advised his teammates beforehand
to lay off the low stuff and wait for a high pitch _ reached him
for a single. The next batter, Mr. Steve Garvey, sliced a triple to
right beyond Staub's reach. Damn. Two batters and already it was
1-0. One out later, yet another of those blasted Reds, George
Foster, brought in Garvey with a ground out.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his two-inning stint was uneventful, but Fidrych
left with a 2-0 deficit, and he would go down in history as the
losing pitcher in the NL's 7-1 romp.
</P>
<P>
   He also was denied one of his secondary goals, a chance to hit.
He'd brought along a bat and helmet from Detroit, and when it came
time for the pitcher's spot in the order in the top of the third,
he begged AL manager Darrell Johnson of the Red Sox for the
opportunity to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' said Johnson. ``You've given up too many runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even for a pitch or two?'' pleaded Fidrych.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Johnson, ``because I know you'll swing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a consolation prize, Hal McRae, who would pinch hit for him,
let Fidrych stand in the on-deck circle until his turn came. Then
Fidrych retreated into the AL dugout. He went up and down the line,
shaking each man's hand, thanking them all for making his All-Star
debut memorable.
</P>
<P>
   And he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He never pitched in an All-Star Game again. He seldom pitched in
the majors again. After finishing the 1976 season with a 19-9
record and league-leading 2.34 ERA that earned him Rookie of the
Year honors, he was standing next to Staub in Lakeland the
following spring, recklessly shagging flies as the mood struck.
</P>
<P>
   Staub called him over to the sidelines and sternly lectured him
for 20 minutes, telling him he was too valuable a commodity, had
too good a thing going, to be cavorting like this. Be careful,
Staub admonished. Take it easy.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to the outfield, a fly ball headed their way.
Fidrych asked Staub if he was going to get it. Staub declined. So
Fidrych leaped for the ball _ and when he landed, he ripped up
cartilage in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which hurt worse,'' he says now, ``my knee or my
head after Rusty whacked me with his glove and said, `What did I
just tell you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   After a delayed start to his season, he pitched well enough to
be selected an All-Star again, but he never made it to the game at
Yankee Stadium. Just before the break, having unintentionally
altered his motion to favor his surgically repaired knee, he felt
something give in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It never came around, though at the time, nobody knew exactly
why. Not until 1985 was the problem diagnosed: a rotator cuff torn
in the front and back. Fidrych underwent surgery to fix it, but by
then, he'd been out of the majors for five years, having gone 10-10
since his rookie joyride, and he'd retired from baseball in 1983
after yet another abortive comeback, this time with the Red Sox'
Triple A affiliate in Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Today he lives modestly in Northborough with his wife, Ann, and
12-year-old daughter, Jessica, in a modernistic three-bedroom house
that overlooks a 107-acre farm Fidrych is restoring. Since leaving
baseball, he's been a subcontractor, hauling asphalt and gravel in
his 10-wheel truck. The house, the farm, and the truck all were
purchased with money from his second major league contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a great life now,'' he says, sitting in his living room
as the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park approaches. ``I got a
family, I got a house, I got a dog. I would like my career to have
been longer, but you can't look back. You have to look to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he has only one regret. He never took that White House
tour with one of the Fords.

SOLECISMS, GAFFES AND BOO-BOOS GET THEIR AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>

   The moment has arrived for our annual coveted Bloopie Awards.
Note how the adjective  &UR; coveted &LR;  (from  &UR; cupidus &LR; , ``desirable,''
its heart penetrated by Cupid's arrow) is wedded to the proper noun
 &UR; Bloopie &LR;  (from  &UR; blooper &LR; , an  &UR; oops &LR;  sound influenced by  &UR; blunder &LR; ,
originally a baseball term for a ball looped by the batter just
beyond the infield, and if not caught synonymous with  &UR; Texas
leaguer &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Jamming words together, with the second word capitalized in lieu
of a space separation (you hear this,  &UR; TimeWarner &LR; ,
 &UR; DaimlerChrysler &LR;  and  &UR; PricewaterhouseCoopers &LR; ?), is the ultimate
symbol of merger used by giant corporations eager to get really
close. And because  &UR; coveted &LR;  is most often married to any award,
why not the covetedBloopie Awards for solecisms in advertising
copy?
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes, please.
</P>
<P>
   A triple Bloopie to Motorola, for its ``Digital DNA'' ad in
Newsweek and The New Yorker, showing an unhelpful repairman with
the name tag ``Earl'' sitting next to an unused phone. (No, not the
Maytag man; Motorola stole the idea.) The caption reads, `` &UR; Who'd
of thought that an electronic chip inside your car could help you
avoid curbs, other cars, and best of all, Earl in repair. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Allen, the literate comedian, sent me a copy of a note he
shot off to Christopher Galvin, boss of Motorola. ``Question: At
the advertising agency that placed this ad for you was there
literally no one in a position of authority aware of the fact that
the phrase `would of' is grammatically unjustified and that the
correct version is `would have' or `would've'?''
</P>
<P>
   The pronunciation of contractions is called verbal reduction.
(Why? I dunno, but ommina find out.) If spoken in jest, a
dialectical  &UR; who'd a thunk &LR;  would have worked, and so woulda  &UR; who
woulda thought &LR;  (as in  &UR; woulda-coulda-shoulda &LR; ). But to write  &UR; of &LR; 
to express the contraction  &UR; 've &LR;  is a solecism.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the half of it. As Harvey Phillips of New York
points out, Motorola's sentence has three errors; its digital DNA
is all thumbs. The second is a misplaced comma: In  &UR; avoid curbs,
other cars, and best of all, Earl in repair &LR;  we have a series. As
the Times stylebook says, ``In general, do not use a comma before
 &UR; and &LR;  in a series.'' (Strunk and White disagree, citing  &UR; red,
white, and blue &LR; , but theirs is a little book.)
</P>
<P>
   Even if you accept as correct a serial comma after the
next-to-last item in a series, I think it is a mistake to write
 &UR; curbs, other cars, and best of all, Earl in repair. &LR;  The
interjected  &UR; best of all &LR;  should stand alone, separated from the
rest of the sentence by commas, dashes or parentheses. Thus, the
punctuation should be  &UR; curbs, other cars and, best of all, Earl in
repair &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in this triple-helixed DNA of error, let's look at the
Motorola  &UR; Who'd of thought &LR;  sentence in its totality, as Grace
Thaler of Boston suggests. It's a question. How do you punctuate a
question? With a question mark, not with a period.
</P>
<P>
   The chagrined but good-humored CEO, Galvin (let's face it, what
happened to Coke in Belgium was worse), wrote back to Steve Allen,
who caught only one of the errors: ``Couldn't agree more! It was
stupid. We pulled the ad series.''
</P>
<P>
   And now to the ``There's No  &UR; Their &LR;  There'' Bloopie, named after
the Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown's campaign against Gertrude Stein's
municipal slur. (Brown is a brown is a brown.)
</P>
<P>
   In an ad by Crystal Cruises in The New Yorker, we read, `` &UR; A
different writer, editor, or cartoonist from The New Yorker will
join us for each segment, offering their thoughts and observations
through on-board discussions. &LR; '' ``Alas,'' writes Sharon King Hoge
of New York, ``where are the fact checkers?'' (She means copy
editors; fact checkers are in a lower pay grade.)
</P>
<P>
   A horror of seeming sexist forces some writers into the
improperly disagreeing use of the nonspecific plural pronoun. `` &UR; A
different writer, editor, or cartoonist &LR;  ((they go for the Strunk
advice on serial commas, not mine)) ...  &UR; offering their thoughts &LR; ''
is a mistake. The subject is singular ( &UR; a different writer &LR; , not
 &UR; different writers &LR; ), and the agreeing pronoun should be  &UR; his, her &LR; 
or the tedious  &UR; his or her &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to make the subject plural:  &UR; Different writers, &LR; 
etc. ...  &UR; offering their thoughts &LR; , but that would commit the
cruise line to dragging more than one writer out of the ship's bar
to each segment. The best formulation: Get rid of the  &UR; their &LR; 
there. Thus: ``A different writer ... will join us ... offering
thoughts and observations.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up in this category is Chivas Regal Scotch whisky (Chivas
comes from the old Gaelic  &UR; seimh as, &LR;  ``a narrow place,'' and is
the name of the distillery's founders), for `` &UR; Some are born with a
silver spoon in their mouth &LR; .'' As Michael Stronger of Brooklyn
notes,  &UR; Some &LR; , construed as plural (``Some are''), agrees with
 &UR; their &LR; , but leaves one spoon in one mouth. To the sound of
``oom-pah-pah,'' say ``Some are born with silver  &UR; spoons &LR;  in their
 &UR; mouths &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The Veddy Veddy Wrong Use of Latin covetedBloopie to
Bloomingdale's for advertising `` &UR; Veni-Vedi-Vici &LR; '' (``I Came, I
Saw, I Conquered'') cuff links.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the historian Suetonius, Julius Caesar succinctly
summed up his Pontic triumph with the alliterative `` &UR; Veni, vidi,
vici &LR; ,'' with the  &UR; V &LR;  pronounced as  &UR; W &LR; . That middle V-word is the
Latin  &UR; vidi &LR; , from the root  &UR; videre &LR; , ``to see,'' and is not
 &UR; vedi &LR; , from the Bloomingdale's copy department, rooted in error.
(I never took Latin, but am told that  &UR; vidi &LR;  is in the first-person
singular perfect active indicative, and sounds like one flake of
the Breakfast of Champions.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a covetedBloopie to Columbia House, the Squad Squad's
favorite home video mail-order company: ``Each video contains two
1-hour episodes on each video.''

BOYS GO FOR THEIR SLICE IN `AMERICAN PIE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple pie will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Why, we can't say. It would ruin the surprise. It would ruin
your appetite. More to the point, it would strain the bounds of
good taste in a family newspaper, which is loathe to describe in
detail any unorthodox sex act performed by hormonally over-equipped
teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   So you'd better use your imagination, because ``American Pie''
does not. Nothing in this gleeful ode to testosterone is underdrawn
_ no primal urge of the pubescent male, no graphic description, no
powerfully revolting joke. Besides Mom's apple pie, other mundane
objects newly minted as nauseating plot devices (or sex tools, or
both) include tube socks, laxatives, beer and a flute. The flute
incident is only alluded to, but the beer, laxatives and tube socks
all take turns holding the spotlight. Among other things. Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   All throat-clearing aside, ``American Pie'' is a movie about
young male virgins who really, really, really, really want to have
sex. Really. This means its subject matter and pronounced
hubba-hubba content will strike the viewer in one of two ways: a)
dead accurate and insanely funny; or b) irrelevant to one's own
adolescent experience.
</P>
<P>
   This particular critic, having never been a teen-age boy, must
confess to falling into the second category of reactions. This
particular critic must also confess to laughing anyway. Sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of ``American Pie'' are four desperate high school
seniors: Jim (Jason Biggs), a good-natured kid with no love life;
Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a brandy-snifting sophisticate with no
love life; Oz (Chris Klein), a lacrosse star who looks and sounds
like Keanu Reeves but still has no love life; and Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas), who has a love life but thus far hasn't persuaded his
girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), to have sex. (In truth, they have
plenty of sex they just don't have intercourse. Apparently Kevin
and Vicky watched the impeachment trial.)
</P>
<P>
   Together, this foursome of frustrated masculinity makes a solemn
pact: They vow to lose their virginity before they graduate. ``This
is our very manhood at stake!'' quoth Kevin, in an impassioned bit
of speechifying. ``Yes, we will make a stand! We will succeed!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus inspired, each member of the quartet chooses a strategy.
Kevin turns up the heat on Vicky. Jim sets his sights on Nadia
(Shannon Elizabeth), a Czech exchange student. Finch pays a friend
(the ever-worldly Natasha Lyonne) to spread rumors about his
manhood. Oz, going ``sensitive,'' joins a choral group, where he
meets a Heather Graham lookalike named, umm, Heather (Mena Suvari).
The ensuing mishaps unfold with unwavering crudity and mostly good
humor, although an episode involving Internet voyeurism goes way
past the point of innocent fun; peeping Toms have gone techno.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' is the brainchild of brothers Chris and Paul
Weitz, a first-time producer and director who together wrote the
screenplays for ``Antz'' and the less-than-hormonal ``Madeline.''
The screenplay is by another relative newcomer, Adam Herz, whose
previous writing credits consist of unsold sitcom scripts and here
springs fully formed from the brow of the Farrelly Brothers.
Whether the barf-inducing gross-outs in ``American Pie'' are meant
as a subtle homage to the Farrellys' ``There's Something About
Mary'' is unclear, but probably not: They're probably just
barf-inducing gross-outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' is cute. The four lunks are cute, their
girlfriends are cute, their friends are cute, even their parents
are cute. Jennifer Coolidge has a short but sultry bit as a
classmate's hot mom, and Eugene Levy brings his Groucho eyebrows
and deadpan timing to a brilliantly dorky turn as Jim's dad; their
birds-and-the-bees discussions are the best scenes in the film.
</P>
<P>
   And it is, in its own, sophomoric way, sincere. Though it never
looks at the serious side to sex (pregnancy? AIDS? morality?
naaaah), it does take a few spare nanoseconds to question the
wisdom of chasing sex for sex's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never even had sex, and I'm already sick of it!'' gripes
Jim near the end of the movie. But then the moment ends, and before
long the young man has resumed his quest with renewed dedication.
Boys will be boys, and then some.

ADD A DOSE OF CAUTION TO HERBAL REMEDIES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of cayenne peppers and eucalyptus leaves
 By SCOTT IRWIN AND MARY LOFTUS 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first sign of a sniffle sends some people straight to the
medicine cabinet for a dose of echinacea. But they might want to
take a measure of caution along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal remedies _ ancient medicines that are still the norm for
80 percent of the world's population _ are continuing to grow in
popularity in the United States as natural alternatives to
conventional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A third of all Americans have tried such plant extracts to
combat depression, disease, memory loss, fatigue and stress. More
than $12 billion was spent on natural supplements in 1997, nearly
double what was spent in 1994. And medical research is supporting
claims that herbs such as St. John's wort and kava may indeed have
beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities including Mel Gibson, Ann Landers and Larry King
have recommended herbal elixirs. And on the Internet, scores of
companies hawk self-proclaimed natural remedies that offer cures
for everything from hot flashes to attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, reports of unwanted side effects are
surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have connected some of the most popular herbs _
St. John's wort, echinacea and ginko _ with infertility. St. John's
wort has also been linked to high blood pressure. And many herbal
remedies, including kava, are not recommended for pregnant or
nursing women.
</P>
<P>
   Because herbal remedies are considered ''nutritional
supplements'' instead of medications, they are not regulated by the
Food and Drug Administration in the same way that prescription and
over-the-counter drugs are. The effectiveness of most herbal
remedies is often anecdotal, with little scientific research to
explain how they might work. Consistency can vary from brand to
brand, so that one product may be more potent than another.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of regulation, along with a desire to have more
control over one's own health, has fostered a climate in which an
increasing number of people are comfortable treating themselves
with herbal remedies without consulting a doctor. The shelves of
the average health food store promise relief from depression, acne,
hot flashes and the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   And while they may deliver good results for some people, they
require caution for others. A person who self-medicates with a
natural remedy runs the risk of triggering an allergic reaction or
misdiagnosing a serious ailment and delaying a more effective,
mainstream treatment. Some of the popular remedies shouldn't be
used at all when certain conditions exist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary O'Brien, author of ''Complimentary Medicine: A
Practical Primer'' and a physician at Coastal Area Health Education
Center in Wilmington, N.C., says one example is the widespread use
of echinacea, the herb that has become so popular for fighting off
cold and flu symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain people should not take echinacea under any
situation,'' O'Brien said. ''That's not on the bottle. But if they
have a disease that attacks the autoimmune system, such as lupus,
rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, echinacea can actually
worsen that.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, people take herbal remedies while they are
taking other over-the-counter or prescription medications. The
result can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when dextromethorphan, an ingredient in cough
syrup, combines with St. John's wort, a popular herbal treatment
for depression, it can cause serotonin syndrome, a condition
characterized by rapid pulse, high fever and convulsions that can
be fatal. Other herbs, such as ginkgo biloba, shouldn't be taken
with blood thinners.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complex and often combustible nature of human
chemistry, health practitioners urge people to consult their
physicians and pharmacists before beginning herbal treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ideal situation is to have doctors and pharmacists who are
well-trained in herbal treatments,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries _ Germany, for example _ herbal remedies have
been used for years, and the government holds manufacturers to
strict standards for ingredients and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, there are no such safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   When you open a bottle of nutritional supplements, you can't be
sure of what's inside. The active ingredient might be present in
such small percentages that it is ineffective, some ingredients may
not be listed at all, and the claims of what the supplement can do
may not be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal reports of people who developed serious side effects
from herbal supplements have shown up in medical journals and
national magazines:
</P>
<P>
   --The New England Journal of Medicine carried reports of six
people who developed severe illnesses from herbal remedies,
including lead poisoning, impotence and abnormal heart rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   --Another study found that a third of 260 traditional Chinese
medicines were contaminated with heavy metals such as lead or
arsenic. And four patients were hospitalized after drinking Chinese
kombucha tea as a remedy for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   --A hospital reported a patient whose skin became hypersensitive
to the point that even a mild breeze was painful _ her reactions
were traced to the St. John's wort she was taking for depression.
Another elderly woman's sudden high blood pressure was linked to
St. John's wort.
</P>
<P>
   --A new study by researchers at Loma Linda University in
California suggests that the side effects of some popular herbs,
including St. John's wort, echinacea and ginkgo, could include
blocking contraception. The study also uncovered suggestions of
genetic damage to sperm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Research on herbs has lagged in the United States because
companies have little incentive to spend $500 million on 10 to 15
years of tests _ as pharmaceutical firms typically do to check out
new medications,'' says journalist John Greenwald, in an article on
herbal healing in Time magazine. ''Unlike drugs, most herbal
preparations cannot be patented, so the testing company would not
be rewarded for its efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA would have to prove that a supplement is unsafe before
they could take it off the shelves, but it has no authority to test
nutritional supplements.
</P>

   Still, say advocates of herbal remedies, we shouldn't dismiss
all supplements because of a few bad reactions or ineffective

   Alice MacDonald, 57, of Savannah, Ga., says she hasn't had a
severe cold since discovering echinacea about seven years ago. ''I
start it immediately when I feel like I'm coming down with
something, and it never happens,'' says MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, the Wilmington physician, says herbal remedies are a
good option when used appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's lacking in this picture is a sense of balance or
perspective,'' says O'Brien. ''Conventional Western medicine is
unparalleled in its treatment of acute illness and injury. But when
it comes to degenerative conditions and illnesses, there is a role
for alternative medicine.''

GROUND COVERS: A CARPET MADE OF LEAVES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of two ground covers

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a plush carpet made of gleaming leaves instead of fibers,
ground covers can stretch beneath trees and shrubs, beside fences,
around rocks, mailboxes, and lamp posts. They can edge a mixed
garden or shrub border or cover a hard-to-mow slope _ an
impressively large range of jobs performed by a versatile group of
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous lawn, which consumes the most ground in the
majority of landscapes, can qualify as a ground cover. But the term
usually refers to decorative perennials, vines, and low-growing
shrubs that will spread across beds carved into the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Ground covers are plants on the move. They may creep over the
soil surface like ivy, sprout from underground stems like
bugleweed, spread with plantlet-bearing runners like strawberries,
or have an expanding waistline of upright stems called suckers like
dwarf bush honeysuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The mobility of ground covers can be a boon to low-budget
gardeners. You can start with a clump from a friend's yard. By
making cuttings or divisions, you can propagate it into several or
dozens of new plants to spread across beds large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive growers such as sedums, ivies, wintercreeper, and
periwinkle provide maximum beauty for amazingly little effort. When
used in a new ground cover bed, they must be weeded regularly, like
when growing flowers or vegetables. But once ground covers fill in,
they can monopolize the space, smothering weeds and needing nothing
more than a little watering during an extended drought.
</P>
<P>
   The most common ground covers are shade-tolerant evergreen vines
such as English and Boston ivy, pachysandra, and periwinkle. These
brighten the winter landscape and make ideal companions for
evergreens or deciduous trees and shrubs with bright bark or
berries.
</P>
<P>
   During the growing season, these popular evergreen ground covers
tolerate shade beneath deciduous trees and thrive where lawns grow
anemic from solar-deprivation.
 &UR; Mix and Match &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can plant masses of a single type of ivy, pachysandra or
periwinkle to make a uniform expanse of greenery and striking sweep
of color. When used over a large area, the size and the shape of
the bed becomes a bold, visually powerful landscape element.
</P>
<P>
   But in smaller or more complex gardens, you may prefer
interesting blends of ground cover plants. As in a perennial
garden, you could mix taller with shorter, bold-leaved with
fine-leaved, or flowering with evergreen or variegated-leaved
ground covers. Here are some of the less common choices you might
want to use in your yard.
</P>
<P>
   --Sedges (Carex spp.): These are grass-like plants that form
expanding clumps. While some species _ like ornamental grasses _
grow well in sun, many sedges prefer moist shade. This makes them
particularly useful beneath mature shade trees or in gardens on the
shady north side of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best sedges for ground covers are the wood sedge and
the Bowles Golden variety. The latter has arching golden-centered
leaves that reach 18 to 24 inches high. It bears willowy flower
spikes from late spring to early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not all sedges are well behaved enough for mixed ground cover
plantings. Gray's sedge, for instance, spreads aggressively and may
overwhelm nearby plants.
</P>
<P>
   --Stonecrops (Sedum spp.): These small but mighty creepers have
petite and beautiful succulent leaves and clusters of bright
star-shaped flowers. The leaves on varieties such as ruby Dragon's
Blood and green, cream, and pink Tricolor stonecrop can be as
attractive as the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-covering sedums, including species such as Sedum spurium
and Sedum acre, hug the ground, reaching only a few inches high. If
given full sun and well-drained soil they require, a single plant
can spread to several feet across.
</P>
<P>
   --Hardy Geraniums (Geranium spp.): If provided with full or
partial sun and good garden soil, hardy geraniums are likely to
live for decades. Most are clump formers with sprawling stems that
can cover some ground. Geranium ibericum, with 20-inch high,
blue-violet flowers, works well as a mid-garden ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   A few hardy geraniums are true creepers. Bigroot geranium (G.
macrorrhizum), which bears pink or white flowers in early summer,
can grow to 24 inches wide, or even wider.
</P>
<P>
   For the front edge of a ground cover garden, try 4- to 6-inch
tall Geranium sanguineum var. striatum, a long bloomer with pale
pink flowers, and Geranium x cantabrigiense Ballerina with
attractive gray leaves and red-veined pink flowers.
</P>
<P>
   --Sages (Salvia officinalis): For a sunny garden of well-drained
soil, try mixing silver and golden-variegated sages, aromatic herbs
that can be used in cooking. When planted 18 inches apart, they
sucker and fill in to make a solid planting about 2 1/2 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   This ground cover may need regular replanting in northern
climates because golden-variegated sages, such as Icterina, are not
reliably hardy.
</P>
<P>
   --Junipers (Juniperus spp.): These evergreen shrubs come in
prostrate forms that can spread 2 to 6 feet across a sunny garden
with well-drained soil. The feathery branches are particularly
attractive when grown beside a sidewalk which they will lap over,
softening the edges.

ADD A DOSE OF CAUTION TO HERBAL REMEDIES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of cayenne peppers and eucalyptus leaves
 By SCOTT IRWIN AND MARY LOFTUS 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first sign of a sniffle sends some people straight to the
medicine cabinet for a dose of echinacea. But they might want to
take a measure of caution along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal remedies _ ancient medicines that are still the norm for
80 percent of the world's population _ are continuing to grow in
popularity in the United States as natural alternatives to
conventional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A third of all Americans have tried such plant extracts to
combat depression, disease, memory loss, fatigue and stress. More
than $12 billion was spent on natural supplements in 1997, nearly
double what was spent in 1994. And medical research is supporting
claims that herbs such as St. John's wort and kava may indeed have
beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities including Mel Gibson, Ann Landers and Larry King
have recommended herbal elixirs. And on the Internet, scores of
companies hawk self-proclaimed natural remedies that offer cures
for everything from hot flashes to attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, reports of unwanted side effects are
surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have connected some of the most popular herbs _
St. John's wort, echinacea and ginko _ with infertility. St. John's
wort has also been linked to high blood pressure. And many herbal
remedies, including kava, are not recommended for pregnant or
nursing women.
</P>
<P>
   Because herbal remedies are considered ''nutritional
supplements'' instead of medications, they are not regulated by the
Food and Drug Administration in the same way that prescription and
over-the-counter drugs are. The effectiveness of most herbal
remedies is often anecdotal, with little scientific research to
explain how they might work. Consistency can vary from brand to
brand, so that one product may be more potent than another.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of regulation, along with a desire to have more
control over one's own health, has fostered a climate in which an
increasing number of people are comfortable treating themselves
with herbal remedies without consulting a doctor. The shelves of
the average health food store promise relief from depression, acne,
hot flashes and the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   And while they may deliver good results for some people, they
require caution for others. A person who self-medicates with a
natural remedy runs the risk of triggering an allergic reaction or
misdiagnosing a serious ailment and delaying a more effective,
mainstream treatment. Some of the popular remedies shouldn't be
used at all when certain conditions exist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary O'Brien, author of ''Complimentary Medicine: A
Practical Primer'' and a physician at Coastal Area Health Education
Center in Wilmington, N.C., says one example is the widespread use
of echinacea, the herb that has become so popular for fighting off
cold and flu symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain people should not take echinacea under any
situation,'' O'Brien said. ''That's not on the bottle. But if they
have a disease that attacks the autoimmune system, such as lupus,
rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, echinacea can actually
worsen that.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, people take herbal remedies while they are
taking other over-the-counter or prescription medications. The
result can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when dextromethorphan, an ingredient in cough
syrup, combines with St. John's wort, a popular herbal treatment
for depression, it can cause serotonin syndrome, a condition
characterized by rapid pulse, high fever and convulsions that can
be fatal. Other herbs, such as ginkgo biloba, shouldn't be taken
with blood thinners.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complex and often combustible nature of human
chemistry, health practitioners urge people to consult their
physicians and pharmacists before beginning herbal treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ideal situation is to have doctors and pharmacists who are
well-trained in herbal treatments,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries _ Germany, for example _ herbal remedies have
been used for years, and the government holds manufacturers to
strict standards for ingredients and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, there are no such safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   When you open a bottle of nutritional supplements, you can't be
sure of what's inside. The active ingredient might be present in
such small percentages that it is ineffective, some ingredients may
not be listed at all, and the claims of what the supplement can do
may not be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal reports of people who developed serious side effects
from herbal supplements have shown up in medical journals and
national magazines:
</P>
<P>
   --The New England Journal of Medicine carried reports of six
people who developed severe illnesses from herbal remedies,
including lead poisoning, impotence and abnormal heart rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   --Another study found that a third of 260 traditional Chinese
medicines were contaminated with heavy metals such as lead or
arsenic. And four patients were hospitalized after drinking Chinese
kombucha tea as a remedy for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   --A hospital reported a patient whose skin became hypersensitive
to the point that even a mild breeze was painful _ her reactions
were traced to the St. John's wort she was taking for depression.
Another elderly woman's sudden high blood pressure was linked to
St. John's wort.
</P>
<P>
   --A new study by researchers at Loma Linda University in
California suggests that the side effects of some popular herbs,
including St. John's wort, echinacea and ginkgo, could include
blocking contraception. The study also uncovered suggestions of
genetic damage to sperm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Research on herbs has lagged in the United States because
companies have little incentive to spend $500 million on 10 to 15
years of tests _ as pharmaceutical firms typically do to check out
new medications,'' says journalist John Greenwald, in an article on
herbal healing in Time magazine. ''Unlike drugs, most herbal
preparations cannot be patented, so the testing company would not
be rewarded for its efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA would have to prove that a supplement is unsafe before
they could take it off the shelves, but it has no authority to test
nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, say advocates of herbal remedies, we shouldn't dismiss
all supplements because of a few bad reactions or ineffective
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Alice MacDonald, 57, of Savannah, Ga., says she hasn't had a
severe cold since discovering echinacea about seven years ago. ''I
start it immediately when I feel like I'm coming down with
something, and it never happens,'' says MacDonald.
</P>
<P>

good option when used appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's lacking in this picture is a sense of balance or
perspective,'' says O'Brien. ''Conventional Western medicine is
unparalleled in its treatment of acute illness and injury. But when
it comes to degenerative conditions and illnesses, there is a role
for alternative medicine.''

   WACO, Texas _ The way Texas has administered charter schools in
their infancy, it's easy to get the notion that public education is
a clambake. You just heat up the coals and hand out the clams.
</P>
<P>
   The Emma L. Harrison Charter School was handed roughly $850,000
_ that's some shells. The costly disaster now stands as a monument
to the ``educational entrepreneurship'' touted by Gov. George W.
Bush on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison is the first operating charter to have its charter
revoked. Bush is correct that Texas has success stories to tell
about charter schools, but this success appears to be more by
happenstance than design. Texas sauntered into this arena with
precious little design.
</P>
<P>
   Observers without rose-colored shades say that lack of state
oversight has other charter schools tiptoeing on insolvency's ridge
while doing some of the same things that got Harrison shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A postscript to last week's decision on Harrison was that the
Texas Education Agency announced it would hire six additional
staffers to monitor the 168 charter schools authorized in this
Texas boot scoot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the blame is not the state's alone. Harrison
officials' attempts to shed blame are pathetic. They flagrantly
abused the public trust and the intent of charter dollars, which
weren't to be used on building needs but on students. Teachers
missed paychecks. Unemployment and retirement system funds weren't
paid. Funds were co-mingled with those of the East Waco Community
Center. The school ran up a debt approaching $400,000. The charter
board operated below radar. The school refused to let the public
see records, ask questions, observe official actions.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of this charter school, we are left to reflect on
some of the destructive bromides of those who wonder aloud about
blowing up our public schools and starting all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Let's create charters. Let's remove all those bureaucratic
controls. Accountability? They'll take TAAS. That'll do it. And,
while we're at it, why not invite private and church schools to the
clambake through vouchers? At least Texas has refrained from the
latter for another legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, let's all decry bureaucracy and state oversight. Who
campaigns as pro-bureaucracy? Off with bureaucrats' heads, we say.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you know what the Emma L. Harrison Charter School was? A
school without bureaucracy or state oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the Harrison charter school tracks some of
those with privatized state services _ privatization being just
about as easy a sell these days as shaved ice.
</P>
<P>
   So we privatize. And when the private company carrying out the
public bidding fields questions about doing something questionable
with public dollars, it says, ``None of your business. That's
proprietary.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventures in charters and privatization both should remind us
of the necessity to have checks and balances, and public oversight,
and, arghhh, bureaucracy. Because you know what? The most clumsy,
burdensome bureaucracy is us.
</P>
<P>
   Every session of the legislature we have people elected by the
public who try to do their best to keep the public out of its own
business, trying to blot out the light, trying to make things more
``efficient'' _ meaning less encumbered by the messy business of
public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate chapter that was Emma L. Harrison Charter School
should make us all a little more respectful of things like public
oversight, ``burdensome'' regulations, prying media types and all
those things that make democracy messy.
</P>
<P>
   Take them away, and look at the mess you cause.

BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GREAT STANLEY K. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick, ever the control freak when it came to his
films, is pulling strings from the grave as the world prepares for
his final cinematic statement, ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick finished editing the film shortly before his death in
March at age 70 and had already made sure the marketing elements
were in place. He approved the movie poster (designed by his wife,
Christiana Kubrick), outlined the content of previews and
television ads and formulated a detailed plan for selling the
picture to a public already saturated with movie hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanley had laid most of this out before he died,'' said
Warner Bros. senior vice president for publicity Nancy Kirkpatrick.
``He was a meticulous planner. He was the architect of all of his
marketing campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's well-known mania for secrecy has been defied in recent
weeks with an unauthorized review of the film that appeared last
month in a London newspaper and a just-published memoir by the
screenwriter who worked with him on ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still seems to be in control.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 30 years _ since ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' in 1968
_ Kubrick exercised near-total command of all aspects of his films
as director, producer, editor and sometimes cinematographer and
co-writer. He oversaw everything from production design to the
dubbing of foreign-language trailers. Apparently no aspect of the
film was too inconsequential for him to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   And he was infamous for demanding that actors perform a scene
30, 50 or even 100 times until the great director deemed it
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   He was indulged in all this because of his reputation as a
cinematic genius who brought us unique films that told stories in
unusual ways. ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``Paths of Glory,'' ``2001'' and
``A Clockwork Orange'' are considered landmark movies, each with a
distinct look and tone. Kubrick's reputation afforded him an
autonomy enjoyed by virtually no other American director.
</P>
<P>
   And with that autonomy came an obsessive secretiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Warner Bros., curious about the Kubrick films they
were financing, could read his screenplays only by flying to
London. (Kubrick had moved to England in the '60s and, phobic about
air travel, never returned to his native United States.) There they
were allowed to peruse the script in a hotel room with a Kubrick
associate hovering nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The director's cast and crew members were sworn to secrecy _ and
invariably toed the line. The privilege of working with Kubrick was
considered compensation enough for keeping a lid on information
about the production.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the husband-and-wife stars of
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' have clung to Kubrick's master plan. They've
granted interviews to several national magazines but have declined
to give any specifics about the film's content.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion Kubrick's secretiveness seemed beyond all reason. In
the just-published Eyes Wide Open, screenwriter Frederic Raphael
describes how Kubrick sent him photocopied pages from ``a gray and
dated-looking text'' and asked for his ideas on adapting the book
into a screenplay. All references to the author's name and the
novel's title had been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael almost immediately recognized the writing style as that
of turn-of-the-century Viennese author Arthur Schnitzler. In fact,
the book was Schnitzler's Traumnovelle (published in English as
Rhapsody: A Dream Novel. But Kubrick stubbornly refused to confirm
that fact until he was certain he was going to hire Raphael to
write the screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later the two men barely weathered a crisis over
the secrecy issue. Working with Kubrick, Raphael shifted to
contemporary New York Schnitzler's story of a marriage threatened
when a husband and wife begin to exchange their sexual fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael sent a copy of the first draft to his longtime agent as
proof that he had met his contractual obligations and now should be
paid for his efforts. This routine business practice horrified
Kubrick, who demanded that Raphael produce a list of anyone who may
have read the screenplay, how many copies had been made and who
received them.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael reports that he was bemused by this paranoia,
particularly since Kubrick regarded a screenplay merely as a
skeletal framework. The real substance of a Kubrick film sprang
from on-the-set variations and improvisations created by the
director and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is morbidly afraid of giving away any of his secrets,''
Raphael writes, ``the best of which may be that he has none.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the rumor mill
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's secretiveness may have originated in his psyche, but
it had a very pragmatic effect. The very lack of information makes
``Eyes Wide Shut'' all the more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick hadn't released a film since 1987, which alone was
enough to crank up the rumor mill. But there were reports that this
film would push on-screen sexuality to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   There's no record of Kubrick or anyone on his staff saying that
he wanted to make a pornographic movie. But he was happy to let
filmgoers believe it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly before his death in 1995, writer Terry
Southern (Kubrick's collaborator on ``Dr. Strangelove'') said
Kubrick had entertained the notion of making a sexually explicit
movie for years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Southern, some 30 years ago the two men had been
screening porn movies when Kubrick commented, ``Wouldn't it be
interesting if one day someone who was an artist would do that _
using really beautiful actors and first-rate equipment?''
</P>
<P>
   Southern turned that idea into a novel, Blue Movie, which was
dedicated to ``the great Stanley K.'' In the book a world-class
movie director tackles pornography, saying: ``I've got to find out
how far you can take the aesthetically erotic _ at what point, if
any, it gets to be such a personal thing that it becomes
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   It's now pretty clear that whatever else it is, ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' is not pornographic _ at least in the view of the ratings
board of the Motion Picture Association of America, which has given
the movie an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   But just the lurid suggestion that Kubrick was making a sexually
explicit film was enough to raise ``Eyes Wide Shut's'' currency.
</P>
<P>
   The big tease
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe the advertising approach Kubrick envisioned
for ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Warners' Kirkpatrick called it ``a tease
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He never used those words directly with me,'' she said in a
recent telephone interview from Los Angeles, ``but that's exactly
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's manipulation of the media reached its zenith at the
ShoWest convention held in Las Vegas in March. There an eager
audience of movie exhibitors got a first glimpse of footage from
Kubrick's film.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-second clip, edited by Kubrick, showed Kidman slowly
removing her earrings while looking into a mirror that reflected
her nude body. A naked Cruise approaches and begins fondling and
kissing her.
</P>
<P>
   There was no dialogue, just a bluesy chant on the soundtrack
that repeated the words ``Baby did a bad, bad thing; baby did a
bad, bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Warners' Kirkpatrick says: ``Stanley had actually instructed his
production team to have it distributed worldwide within a couple of
hours of the Las Vegas showing.''
</P>
<P>
   So within hours of its debut, the clip was on TV (in edited
form) and all over the Internet in all its naked glory.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before his death, Kubrick also instructed his
associates on how to cut 30-, 60- and 90-second trailers for the
film. The earliest of these showed scenes from the movie _ again
with no dialogue and against the ``bad, bad thing'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there's no dialogue, you can put any story you like in
there,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``It was brilliant because it allowed
audiences to impose their own ideas on the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick left detailed instructions about how and when
promotional items for the film were to be distributed and when
critics would see ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' (Reviewers in some cities saw
it Thursday; Kansas City writers will see it Wednesday.) Kubrick
even specified which stills could be used to promote the film.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the control of Kubrick, though, is Raphael's
just-published memoir. According to Kirkpatrick, Kubrick's
survivors are ``upset that he breached that confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Raphael (whose screenwriting credits include ``Two for
the Road,'' ``Darling'' and ``Far From the Madding Crowd'')
contributes to the tease campaign by declining to give away too
much about the project. His book is mostly about his encounters
with Kubrick, whom he describes as ``a movie director who happens
to be a genius rather than a genius who happens to be a movie
director.''
</P>
<P>
   A far greater betrayal, in the view of Kubrick's people, was the
review of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' written by Alexander Walker and
published June 22 in the London Evening Standard. Walker, a Kubrick
friend and biographer, saw the film at a private screening arranged
by the family.
</P>
<P>
   In his review, he described the movie as ``a story of how an
apparently happily married couple, rich, successful New Yorkers,
the sort we call the `Beautiful People,' are set at odds with each
other by their dreams and fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   The title, Walker wrote, ``connotes a spellbound state _ the
mood of a waking dream,'' and the revelation by Kidman's character
of an infidelity ``sends her husband rebounding into a world of
sexual possibilities, including a posh masquerade ball that quickly
turns into a huge orgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Walker delivered a rave: ``Even at its most baffling,
it is an astonishing work made with masterly control and at the
same time a humanity that this director's detractors have insisted
he did not possess. ... This valedictory production is a victory
for its maker's unending quest to make his reach exceed his
grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   But his liking the film did not excuse running the review early,
Kirkpatrick said. ``That review was, to me, the most shocking
betrayal. Raphael's book seems to me to be a case of a writer with
an experience he felt compelled to write about. But Walker was a
family friend. They showed the movie to him, and he betrayed their
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has declined comment except to issue a statement through
the Evening Standard that he ``was not under any embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, on Friday, Americans finally will get to see what
all the furor is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what people think it is,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``But
then were any of his movies ever what people thought they were
going to be?''

BEDWETTING, THOUGH FAIRLY COMMON, DISTRESSES KIDS, PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with school-age kids who wet their beds.
Lori knows that. She's a nurse in the Children's Mercy Hospital
clinic that treats bedwetters. Lori wet her bed until she was 12,
and her 5-year-old daughter does the same now.
</P>
<P>
   Lori knows that bedwetting wasn't her fault and that it isn't
her daughter's fault. She knows bedwetting is thought to be
hereditary and isn't a sign of behavioral or emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Lori doesn't want her last name mentioned. It's too
embarrassing. She'd rather the whole world not know her ``dirty
little secret,'' even though lots of people are former or current
bedwetters.
</P>
<P>
   It's commonly estimated that 5 million to 7 million children and
adolescents (girls 5 and older and boys 6 and older) wet their
beds, including 15 percent of 5-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast majority of those cases, bedwetting is a symptom of
an immature ``brain-bladder connection,'' according to Bradley
Warady, a pediatrician who specializes in kidney-related ailments
at Children's Mercy Hospital. And in many cases it's just a matter
of time until it clears up.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors can contribute to bedwetting, Warady said.
Wetters might have relatively small bladders or might produce
unusually large amounts of urine. It's also likely that bedwetters
don't sense when their bladders are full.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children who don't feel that fullness when they're
sleeping do sense it when they're awake, however, Warady noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although bedwetting isn't generally thought to result from
emotional troubles, it can cause emotional troubles in young
bedwetters and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be some problems with their self-esteem,'' Warady
said. ``They won't go to overnight camps, and they won't sleep at
friends' houses for fear of wetting the bed. Often if they go to a
friend's house, they won't sleep all night for fear of wetting the
bed. That's difficult for an 8- or 9-year-old who wants to be like
his friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori remembers that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was abnormal. I had no idea other kids wet the
bed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lori did go to slumber parties, where she did her best to stay
up all night and then slept all the next day at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the standard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, too, feel the strain of bedwetting, or nocturnal
enuresis, as it is formally known. They tire of changing and
washing sheets, and ``some think the children are doing it on
purpose as a way to get back at the parents for whatever,'' Warady
said. Nothing could be further from the truth, he said. No kid
wishes to urinate on himself or herself.
</P>
<P>
   Lori remembers being accused of being too lazy to get up to go
to the bathroom at night. But she doesn't remember feeling the
urge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't ever wake up in the middle of the night and feel I
needed to go to the bathroom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, many children were sent to mental health
professionals for a cure to their bedwetting, Warady said.
Centuries earlier, ``extremely traumatic'' treatments such as
``penile scalding'' were employed in an effort to convince children
to stop wetting the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Bedwetters have been and _ in too many cases _ still are
punished, Warady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally beyond their control, so punishment has no role
at all. That's something we really stress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several approaches recommended by Warady and William
Warzak, a clinical psychologist at the University of Nebraska
Medical Center in Omaha who treats bedwetters and researches the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Several simple behavioral changes can be helpful, they said,
including eliminating or greatly restricting caffeine late in the
day. As a diuretic, caffeine contributes to urine production.
</P>
<P>
   Although some parents limit the amount their children drink in
the evening, there isn't much evidence that works, according to
Warzak.
</P>
<P>
   He is a believer in behavior modification techniques, such as
requiring children to help clean up after a bedwetting episode and
having them keep a record of their wet and dry nights. He suggests
rewarding children when they comply with the procedures that have
been outlined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do those things, you get pretty good results,'' Warzak
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more costly interventions, including alarms that
awaken children when they begin to wet the bed and drugs that
reduce the need to urinate at night.
</P>
<P>
   The alarms have existed for a long time, but in the last decade
or so they have been improved and reduced to about the size of a
pager, Warady said. The alarm attaches to a waistband and vibrates
or rings when the child begins to urinate.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm has the best track record, Warzak said. About 70
percent of the children who try it learn within 12 weeks to awaken
themselves in time to get to a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of drug treatments are also available. Amipramine,
which is an anti-depressant, seems to increase bladder capacity,
Warzak said.
</P>
<P>
   Desmopressin acetate, or DDAVP, is a manmade compound very
similar to a naturally occurring hormone that enables the kidney to
reabsorb water, thereby reducing urine production. The DDAVP is
delivered through either a pill or a nasal spray.
</P>
<P>
   The medications have ``a fairly high relapse rate,'' according
to Warzak. However, they can be useful in keeping beds dry until
children's urinary systems reach maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can take heart in the fact that, in the vast majority of
cases, bedwetting stops on its own, according to Warzak. Each year
about 15 percent of bedwetters spontaneously stop.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about bedwetting, call the National Kidney
Foundation's toll-free hot line, 1-888-WAKEDRY. A brochure is
available, as well as a referral to doctors in Greater Kansas City
who have indicated a willingness to treat bed wetting.

IT'S STRICTLY CATS RULE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARJEAN BUSBY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Living with nine cats and one Siberian husky sounds crazy
enough, but then you read on. Author//photographer Bob Walker and
his wife, Frances Mooney, have redesigned their San Diego home so
it's like a feline playground with offbeat perches.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred feet of elevated walkways, for example, satisfy the
cats' preference for heights and bird's-eye views. A ceiling-high,
rope-covered post caters to their scratching instinct.
</P>
<P>
   No pussyfooters, they can scurry down a spiral staircase to the
television room or descend a 16-foot carpeted ramp in the owners'
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   For his second illustrated book, Cats Into Everything (Andrews
McMeel Publishing, $18.95), Walker takes readers through routine
activities, including shaving with a curious fat cat on his
shoulder. When Mooney makes an afghan from recycled sweater yarn,
furry thieves run off with the colored wool she needs.
</P>
<P>
   For chapters called ``Fur in Our Food'' and ``Not a Creature Was
Stirring,'' Walker achieved novel photo shots through
unconventional approaches.
</P>
<P>
   - He placed a camera underneath a glass-top table to record
house pets lapping milk with scratchy tongues, getting combative on
catnip and devouring a well-balanced people meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always act as if they are one meal away from
starvation,'' he writes. ``Unfortunately for them, their ample
girth betrays their plaintive meows.''
</P>
<P>
   - By mounting a motorized camera on the bedroom ceiling, Walker
recorded various sleeping positions of the cats and couple for more
than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A powerful flash illuminated our bed every 13 minutes,'' he
explains, but after a couple of nights ``everybody slept
comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm reception of Walker's 1996 book, The Cat's House,
prompted Kansas City-based Andrews McMeel Publishing to tap
Walker's skills as photographer, writer and designer once again.
His wife, a colorist and do-it-yourself decorator, shares his sense
of whimsy. Their original interest involved a gallery operation and
framing pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Walker comments on their set-up:
</P>
<P>
   ``Living and working with a household full of felines has
demonstrated what all cat lovers know: Cats will purr and play and
carouse their way into all aspects of their feeders' lives. Whether
we're working, eating, sleeping or socializing _ our cats are into
everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's most frequent questions deal with his ``least
favorite cat task.'' Do you use clumping or regular cat litter?
Answer: clumping. How often do you clean your cat boxes and how
many do you have? Every other day, five boxes, he replies.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, he's the one in the house who does it.

KEEPING MOSQUITOES AT BAY NO SIMPLE CHORE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Some people seem to attract mosquitoes more
readily than others, and experts say the attraction has mostly to
do with the amount of carbon dioxide that comes through a person's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not blood type,'' said Dr. Jonathan Day, a medical
entomologist at the University of Florida. Day has spent 20 years
studying diseases that are transmitted by insects. ``It's not what
you eat or what you don't eat. It has to do with the amount of
carbon dioxide you produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The body emits carbon dioxide through the breath and through the
skin. Mosquitoes are attracted to the carbon dioxide that comes
through the skin, said Day. The more you produce, the more
mosquitoes are drawn to you.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for active people. The more you move around, the
more carbon dioxide you produce. Also, when the muscles work they
produce a waste product called lactic acid. This comes through the
skin and attracts mosquitoes, Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that draw the bugs in are body temperature and
size. The larger and warmer you are, the more likely you are to
attract mosquitoes, Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Dark colors also make you an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosquitoes tend to fly pretty close to the ground,'' Day said.
``They look at you against the horizon, so dark colors stand out.''
The best color to wear is yellow, Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Alligator trapper Tony Hunter grew up hunting in the Florida
Everglades, where the mosquitoes would surround the boats in a
faint black fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried everything,'' he said, ``eating garlic and vitamin
B1, but personally I never really noticed a difference. I think we
just gave them a little more flavor in their meal.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst, he said, was when he and his friends heard that
parsley might help and they sprinkled everything they ate with the
flakes. ``Nasty stuff,'' he said. And it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Boch of the Center for Progressive Medicine in
Albany uses nutritional supplements and herbs in his practice, but
he hasn't found anything that works well to repel mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have luck with high doses of vitamin B1 (100
milligrams, two or three times a day), he said. ``But it doesn't
work for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Boch said he isn't overly impressed with garlic as a repellent
either.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical insect repellent is the best thing to keep mosquitoes
away, according to both Hunter and Day. Both said repellents with
the ingredient DEET work well.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter uses the strongest DEET spray he can find when he goes
out on his job as an alligator nuisance trapper for the state of
Florida. But, he said, mosquitoes have their favorites.
</P>
<P>
   On the hunts, some people spend the trip smacking at bugs and
getting bothered and bitten, while others like himself get away
with a few welts.

<P>
   Here are some tips for reducing mosquito populations around your
home:
</P>
<P>
   Lawn: Mow at least once a week during spring and summer.
Mosquitoes like to hide in tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges/bushes: Keep them trimmed. The more shade you have, the
more mosquitoes will be attracted to your yard.
</P>
<P>
   Tire swing: Drill drainage holes in the bottom to avoid stagnant
water, a mosquito breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kiddie pool: Empty out water once or twice a week. Standing
water can become stagnant and produce optimum mosquito breeding
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sand box: Make sure toys are not left for long periods of time
with standing water in them. A sand pail full of water is a
potential breeding ground for mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue: Shelter it during rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Bird bath: Empty water at least once a week to avoid stagnant
water.
</P>
<P>
   Trellis: It can block the wind, which keeps mosquitoes away. Try
not to have too many objects in your yard that will block the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Rain gutters: Don't forget to clean them out: Debris can block
water from flowing, creating a mosquito haven.
</P>
<P>
   Garden/ornamental pond: Stock goldfish, which will eat mosquito
larvae that float on top of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Pool: Be sure to skim regularly because mosquitoes lay their
eggs on the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Poolside bushes: Keep them trimmed. The shade of the bushes
combined with the humidity of the pool provides mosquitoes with an
ideal haven.

`FESTIVAL CAPITAL' IS A BARGAIN FOR AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM REYNOLDS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Though it's just a short distance from the U.S.
border, it doesn't take long to realize that Montreal is truly a
different world.
</P>
<P>
   From the barrage of questions at the Customs patrol station on
the border to the intimidating French highway signs, and right down
to having to deal with Canada's $2 coin, Montreal feels unique from
the moment you cross the Pont Jacques Cartier or the Pont Champlain
to reach the island city.
</P>
<P>
   But once you're actually in the city, whether you're fluent in
French, know only two phrases or are completely baffled by the
language, it's easy to be swept away by how simple it is to find,
not only your way around, but to find a plethora of things to do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   First, take notice of the fact that Montreal is turning into a
fine day, weekend or longer getaway spot for several reasons, the
best of which is the exchange rate of the strong U.S. dollar into
Canadian currency. Right now, you can get about $1.40 Canadian for
$1 American, and even though things tend to be priced a tad higher
than in the States, the exchange rate pretty much assures you of
getting more bang for your buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do tend to get many visits from Americans, and as you know,
that's likely attributed to the exchange rate right now,'' said
Sylvie Bouchand, a waitress at a club on Crescent Street, a
must-stop for the party set. ``The rate is bad for us because of
the taxes, but with the tourism, it is good.''
</P>
<P>
   For the sports fan, there's Montreal Expos baseball. And since
the club only draws an average of 8,800 fans per night to cavernous
Olympic Stadium, tickets are readily available not to mention
cheap. The best seats in the house go for the equivalent of about
$20 U.S. ($33 Canadian), and even the bleacher seats ($7 Canadian,
or about $4.50 U.S.) provide a good view of the on-field action.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to Olympic Stadium than Expos baseball. The
building was constructed in 1976 to host the Olympic Summer Games,
and can be seen on clear days from more than five miles away,
thanks in large part to the 552-foot curved tower atop the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cable car rides to the top of the tower are available, and the
view _ even, believe it or not, on cloudy days _ is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Not into sports? Near the stadium sits the Biodome, a must-stop
for those with interests in science and a particularly popular spot
on either very hot or very rainy days. The building usually offers
exhibits of four ecosystems _ tropical and Laurentian forests, the
marine environment of the St. Lawrence River and the polar world.
All displays are in English and French, and the staff, like many
workers in Montreal, are bilingual, so communication isn't a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Biodome doesn't compare with the ecological
experience downtown, as Montreal's Botanical Garden is the second
largest in the world, behind only Kew Gardens in London. The
Botanical Garden keeps a minimum of 28,000 species on display and
plans on offering more during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   One of the popular tourist stops in Montreal is St. Joseph's
Oratory, which sits atop Mount Royal. It was founded by the Blessed
Andre Bresette, who died in 1937 and was beatified in 1982. The
Brother of the Holy Cross, who was better known as ``Frere Andre,''
was credited with thousands of cures, drew more than 1 million
people to his funeral there, and more than 100,000 people still
visit the shrine annually, many still looking for cures.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown and night life scenes are filled with opportunity,
from dance clubs to restaurants, coffeehouses and the Hard Rock
Cafe, which teems with tourists on a nightly basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too crowded,'' Bouchand said. ``We (meaning the locals)
like to stay away from the crowds sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although natives sometimes prefer to stay away from the crowds,
the city's tourism board welcomes the activity, and proclaims
Montreal as ``the festival capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers, take delight. Not only are Peel and St. Catharine
streets lined with shops, but a 29-kilometer-long underground
section of the city is devoted to shoppers and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Underground City'' has 1,700 boutiques, department stores,
restaurants, movie houses, theaters and exhibition halls, as well
as seven major hotels, 1,615 housing units, thousands of offices,
the central train station and so on. Plus, like the rest of the
city, use of the Metro system is readily available.

INDIA'S CONFLICT WITH PAKISTAN BRINGS OUT FLAG-WAVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSSOORIE, India _ The searing heat of summer normally drives
thousands of Indians up to Mussoorie and other colonial-era resorts
that the British called ``hill stations.'' But this year, far fewer
are fleeing the baked plains for the cool mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   The Cricket World Cup competition, played at venues in the
Netherlands, Ireland and Britain and culminating with the June 20
final at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, kept tens of millions of
Indians glued to satellite-fed transmissions of the slow-paced
sport, yet another legacy of the British Raj.
</P>
<P>
   Also, people are uneasy over the fighting at Kargil, a village
near the truce line that divides Indian and Pakistani sectors of
disputed Kashmir, explained the owner of Padmini Niwas, a
turn-of-the-century, tin-roofed inn known in pre-independence days
as Rushbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the clashes have united this sprawling
nation and unleashed a torrent of frothy patriotism. Indian
officers in media interviews speak of ``gallant'' action by their
men, giving a quaint, almost World War I flavor to the conflict and
its coverage. Enlistment reportedly has skyrocketed. Newspapers and
corporations compete to raise money for families of those slain at
Kargil.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Indian troops have been engaged in hand-to-hand
combat, recapturing bunkers atop mountain peaks that 700
``intruders'' quietly had seized without a fight at the end of a
milder than usual winter. India says the occupiers are regular
Pakistani troops and Muslim ``mercenaries''; Pakistan says they are
Kashmiri freedom fighters and ``mujahideen'' (holy warriors), who
receive only its moral and political support.
</P>
<P>
   When Indians are not exuberantly waving flags, they are quietly
seething over what many see as an intelligence failure. The
intruders were spotted not by army patrols or the border security
force but by a goat herder who chanced upon the strangers in March.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict's first casualty was the unprecedented outpouring
of goodwill for Pakistan engendered by the simple act of starting
regular bus service between New Delhi, the Indian capital, and
Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   In March, as Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee made the
inaugural run that many saw as heralding an era of friendly
relations, infiltrators were digging in on peaks overlooking a
strategic road near Kargil. After their discovery, they mowed down
row upon row of Indian troops inching up to entrenched positions.
</P>
<P>
   It was seen as a betrayal by Pakistan, and such a startling stab
in the back that many Indians believed that Pakistan's new army
chief had ordered the Kargil infiltration _ strategically clever,
but diplomatically short-sighted _ without the knowledge of
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Pakistani statements later
indicated there was no independent army move.
</P>
<P>
   But what is clear is that the subcontinent lost yet another
opportunity to overcome old animosities and finally build bilateral
cooperation for the benefit of the two peoples. Though traditional
military rivals, Muslim Pakistan and Hindu-dominated India were
part of British India before independence in 1947 and are extremely
close culturally.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Pakistan do it?
</P>
<P>
   Since it officially doesn't concede its troops are even involved
_ except in tit-for-tat artillery duels _ there is no official
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   At times of domestic political turmoil, both sides have cited a
perceived, or fabricated, threat from the other to divert public
attention. But at this time, Sharif holds a solid parliamentary
majority and has neutralized most political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking among some in New Delhi is that it was Pakistan's
last chance to seize any advantage in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The drawn-out guerrilla campaign to win Kashmir's independence
from India had lost much support in the predominantly Muslim
region. Indeed, attacks had dropped off so precipitously that in
the past year tourists were returning to the region's
breathtakingly beautiful lakes and mountains after more than a
decade. Moreover, Pakistan's successful nuclear test last year, in
answer to an earlier one by India, gave the country an intense
feeling of invulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Although the neighbors had twice come to blows over Kashmir,
never before had both been armed with nuclear weapons. Yet the
threat of a nuclear holocaust, while discussed in India's energetic
press, curiously has not created much of a stir.
</P>
<P>
   A story given more prominence quoted Indian cricket star Kapil
Dev as demanding that matches with Pakistan be canceled until its
troops withdraw from Kargil. In Pakistan, the story bigger than the
risk of nuclear annihilation was the disclosure that its top
cricket players publicly boozed in London nightclubs before the
Australians trounced them in the World Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict is deadly serious business.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pakistanis and Indians are convinced that casualties are
far higher than what their respective governments officially say.
Indian troops have not been outfitted with high-altitude gear and
Pakistanis, frequently short of supplies, at times have been
reduced to eating ice sprinkled with sugar. And fighting has been
so intense at times that the wounded have been left on
mountainsides 28 hours before seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the two adversaries have in common is the word to
describe their battle fallen _ ``martyrs.''

LEAVE BERKELEY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What if Europeans had settled the West Coast
before the East Coast? That was the question raised by a friend,
and his guess was that they never would have left California.
</P>
<P>
   No one would have crossed the desert to a land of humidity and
slush, just to find Guldens in them thar Coney dogs. We'd never
have learned what lousy pastrami we have here.
</P>
<P>
   The descendants of the Pilgrims would have stayed by the pool in
their basic black Speedos, dipping sourdough into extra virgin
olive oil, while sipping a dry but impertinent chardonnay. You'd
never catch them washing down dry turkey on white bread with
cranberry juice. Never mind how sexy, beautiful and temperate
California is.
</P>
<P>
   The food alone is enough to make a Puritan have a nice day.
</P>
<P>
   This all came to me after going to New York City and dining in a
new restaurant called the Berkeley Bar &AMP; Grill, which was conceived
as a tribute to Alice Waters and the California food revolution
that started at Chez Panisse almost 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the only California revolution recognized in New York
was the right turn on red. Never mind such advances as Silicon
Valley, extreme games or pizza with blue potatoes on it.
</P>
<P>
   California always has been a Woody Allen joke.
</P>
<P>
   I was eager to see what a New York restaurant based on exotic
California would be like. The Berkeley Bar &AMP; Grill's owner, Drew
Nieporent, who co-owns New York's famous Tribeca Grill with Robert
De Niro, once said that restaurants in New York always look east to
Europe, and never look west to California.
</P>
<P>
   When I called to make a reservation, the woman who answered the
phone knew who I was. It turned out she had just moved to New York
from Nieporent's restaurant in San Francisco, Rubicon. I imagined
Jimmy Breslin and Mayor Rudlolph Giuliani having to wait in line,
while San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and I got a table.
</P>
<P>
   I should have suspected the Berkeley Bar &AMP; Grill wouldn't be
authentic, because no one in Berkeley knows who I am.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is trapped in the glass of the Sony Plaza on
Madison Avenue, so it's sleekly un-Chez Panissey. That's excusable,
but the sound system was playing Crosby, Stills and Nash.
</P>
<P>
   What was this, a theme restaurant? TGI Berkeley's? The menu,
though, was as Berkeley as a Birkenstock, with a ``Berkeley Bar &AMP;
Grill'' logo that looked just like the work of Alice Waters' friend
David Goines. Maybe he even designed it.
</P>
<P>
   The menu featured Shattuck Avenue comfort food like goat cheese
salad, pot-au-feu and osso bucco with toasted couscous, along with
the required references to sources of ingredients, like ``Chatham
Bay cod.''
</P>
<P>
   I used to live in Chatham, Mass., and didn't want to be
disappointed with tributes to two towns I know, so I ordered the
turbot. The fish was excellent, but the plate was too organized to
be authentically Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes and zucchini were carved like little pieces of
soap, the way they do in culinary academies, not the Chez Panisse
kitchen, where vegetables are meant to look as naive and natural as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   And how come the ``Spring Soupe au Pistou'' was made with winter
root vegetables? Forget the dinner roll. New Yorkers know pastrami,
but they still don't get bread and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The verbiage was as self-congratulatory as anything in the Bay
Area, though. The wine list said selections were made with Berkeley
in mind, ``the idealized Berkeley that has inspired two generations
of American chefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The idealized Berkeley also inspired free speech, and the menu
freely spoke too much. The name of the artist in the kitchen was
even listed as ``Patricia Williams, Loving Chef.''
</P>
<P>
   And get this. One of the desserts was called ``Hash Brownies
with Cherry Garcia.'' It was a brownie topped with Ben &AMP; Jerry's
ice cream, and for $9 you didn't even get high. Instead you got a
sprinkling of oregano.
</P>
<P>
   We paid about $150 for an idealized Berkeley meal that ended in
a rip-off dope joke even Woody Allen would edit out.
</P>
<P>
   But I must say, the place was comfortable, the staff pleasant,
and the food was better than the $300 meal we had at the pompous
four-star restaurant Jean- Georges, a perfectly executed New York
theme restaurant, appropriately located in one of Donald Trump's
towers.
</P>
<P>
   At this joint, which features stiff waiters bearing sickly sweet
sweetbreads under silver domes, the bread looked oddly like Acme
bread from downloose Berkeley. The waiter made a big show of
bringing two kinds of butter, salted and unsalted, with a leaf
pressed into the latter for identification.
</P>
<P>
   Both kinds of butter were terrible. Butter, bread, salad _ those
are the kinds of things Northern Californians notice while New
Yorkers are looking around to see who else is there.
</P>
<P>
   You can eat well cheaply in New York. Start spending money, and
you're a fool.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why they don't understand the food revolution in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   What they seem to have missed is that it's about food.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: It's Paris, my love
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The hotel where I almost always stay is small and
comfortable and, though not air-conditioned, has something that
other Paris hotels lack _ a staff that knows me by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, Mr. Murray,'' the manager announces as I enter the small
lobby. ``Welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   A long way from home, I like the recognition. I like, too, that
in Paris my name is pronounced mur-RAY. I wish now I'd have brought
my beret.
</P>
<P>
   I love this part of Paris, a street of bistros, bakeries and
flower shops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pantheon is only around the corner. The Sorbonne, at the
center of the Latin Quarter on St. Germain, is a five-minute walk.
A bit farther is the Seine, Notre Dame and the American bookstore
with the fabled name of Shakespeare and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sidewalk cafes, of course, are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I have to re-educate myself as to the art of lingering at a
table long after the glass is empty. It's an un-American kind of
leisure, to simply sit and do nothing, but I am working hard to
persevere in my restraint.
</P>
<P>
   A cigar helps. So does a copy of the International Herald
Tribune. So does the weather, hardly 80 degrees and tempered with a
light breeze.
</P>
<P>
   I feel very much at home, and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think everyone has two hometowns: the one where you
are born and the second where your heart is. Paris quickly becomes
everyone's other hometown.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never been to Paris, you should come and find out for
yourself, as it is to be walking down a tree-lined boulevard and
suddenly _ Voila! _ you have found your heart.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, there is a love story being written here at every
turn. But it is not simply lovers embraced on park benches. It is
more than that. All of Paris is in love.
</P>
<P>
   All of Paris is in love with Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difference found nowhere in America, perhaps nowhere
else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ The people of New York claim that they (heart) New York. But
theirs is a love-hate relationship at best.
</P>
<P>
   _ In thriving cities such as Atlanta or Houston, the feeling
often may take the form of civic pride. But pride is not love.
</P>
<P>
   _ In small-town America like where I live, it is more a sense of
kinship, a place where you grew up, where your parents and
grandparents grew up before you, and your children since. Family
may be love, but it is not a love story.
</P>
<P>
   But Paris! It is a city dedicated to art and beauty. Its street
scenes are like vistas. Gorgeous monuments or grand fountains await
at one corner or the next. The City of Light is a city of life.
</P>
<P>
   It's for good reason that all of Paris is in love with Paris.
But it's more than that. Paris, it would seem, loves its people in
return.
</P>
<P>
   That's something I can only guess at. To visit Paris is not
enough. You would have to live in Paris. Such is the commitment of
love.
</P>
<P>
   What is the difference between visiting Paris and living in
Paris?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly this:
</P>
<P>
   It is the difference between love and unrequited love.
</P>

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The national debt explained
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This goes back to the Reagan administration. Ronald Reagan and
his fellow Republicans had crabbed for decades about the federal
deficit. Nothing, not even motherhood, came close to zapping waste,
fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Then Reagan got into office, slashed taxes, built up the
military, and ran up the biggest deficit in the history of the
universe. Deficits, Republicans explained, were only bad if you
looked at them in some dumb, outmoded way.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, who said he wouldn't, raised taxes, complaining
tax-and-spend Democrats made him do it. Bill Clinton raised taxes,
and now, riding an economic boom, says we're drowning in cash.
Enough, he says, to patch up Social Security, Medicare and the
defense budget. Along about 2015 we wipe out the national debt, a
nifty 3,000 kazillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say yeah sure okay that's fine we can do some good
stuff for the old folks, but what we really need is to cut taxes.
And anyhow Bill Clinton dammit is stealing our best ideas, which,
by the way, we now oppose.
</P>
<P>
   I'll miss the national debt. It was something you could count
on.

(For use by SLANG partners) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of the movies hyped as ``must-sees'' in
recent years have been of the sci-fi, special effects genre: movies
like ``Godzilla'' and ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace.'' Despite a general sense among viewers that we're seeing
more sex on screen than ever, such movies feature virtually no sex.
Those big movies that do feature sex today tend to turn it into a
raunchy joke (``There's Something About Mary'') or an act of
violence (``The General's Daughter'').
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the late Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' on the
horizon, we once again have a film that is creating enormous
pre-release ``buzz'' for its reported exploration of the psychology
of sexual desire, rather than its violence or fancy visual tricks.
Though the movie doesn't open until Friday, the trailer _ featuring
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, nude and fondling each other _ has
been causing a stir for months.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a TV ad for the movie has debuted, showing Kidman
in her underwear and hinting at some kinky goings-on. And last
week, Time magazine devoted its cover and eight pages inside to
``Stanley Kubrick's haunting final masterpiece,'' calling it a
``Freudian interpretation of jealousy and sexual obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there has always been sex on celluloid, from the
earliest, silent short subjects that depicted scandalously long
kisses and love triangles. By the early sound era, movies were
routinely trading on racy subject matter to lure viewers. Illicit
sexual affairs and scantily clad starlets were staples of a number
of movies in the early '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as more recently, the industry was pressured to clean up
its act. To stave off government regulation, the Motion Picture
Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) set forth a strict,
voluntary set of standards. Often referred to as the Hays Code
(after MPPDA head Will H. Hays), the production code went into
effect in July 1934. It read like a Ten Commandments of ``thou
shalt nots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No picture shall be produced which will lower the standards of
those who see it,'' read one of the document's general principles.
``Indecent or undue exposure is forbidden .... Scenes of passion
should not be introduced when not essential to the plot ....
Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embracing, suggestive
postures and gestures, are not to be shown,'' read some of the
code's other mandates.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye ``It Girl'' Clara Bow and the lustful Mae West; hello
Donna Reed and Doris Day. According to ``Becoming Mae West'' by
Emily Wortis Leider (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1997) West's first
post-code picture, ``Goin' to Town,'' ``was put through the
wringer'' to clean up any possibly objectionable scenes, dialogue
and song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, in 1936, William Randolph Hearst's papers
launched an all-out attack on the ``lewdness'' of West's ``Klondike
Annie.'' Soon after, Mae West parted ways with her studio.
Paramount couldn't stand the heat anymore, and Mae West without sex
just wasn't Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   There were occasional challenges to the absolute authority of
the production code during the next several decades (the code
remained in force until 1966). Movies such as Howard Hughes' 1943
film ``The Outlaw'' went right up to the edge of what was
acceptable. ``The Outlaw,'' remembered for the enduring image of a
ripe-and-ready Jane Russell reclining in hay, pushed code
boundaries with its very apparent obsession with Russell's ample
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there remained a thriving industry that pumped out
low-budget, non-studio exploitation pictures, which were outside
the MPPDA's jurisdiction. This helps explain, for example, such
staples of the drive-in as women-in-prison movies.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the 1960s that vivid portrayals of sex
resurfaced in mainstream films. This was largely thanks to an
influx of young filmmakers who worshipped sexual liberation and
European cinema, which had always been much more open to sexual
content.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hosoda, who has made it his life's mission to catalog
``where to find your favorite actresses and actors nude on
videotape'' through his self-published ``Bare Facts Video Guide,''
pegs the wave of nudity and sex that began to hit American cinema
in the '60s to such European films as ``I Am Curious (Yellow),'' a
1967 Swedish picture about the sexual adventures of a female
sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans are much more blase about sex and nudity ... . We're
kind of a puritanical country,'' said Hosoda, who is based in the
Silicon Valley area. ``These European films definitely influenced
American films ... (major actors such as) Jane Fonda and Jon Voight
started doing nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hollywood suddenly moved beyond the mild nudity and
double entendres of the previous couple of decades to frank
depictions of sexual perversity and fantasy: Mrs. Robinson (Anne
Bancroft) seducing Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) in ``The
Graduate.'' Jane Fonda romping in next to nothing in
``Barbarella.'' Jon Voight playing a hustler in ``Midnight
Cowboy.'' European director Bernardo Bertolucci pushing the
envelope with ``Last Tango in Paris,'' starring Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
   This trend continued into the early '80s, when such pictures as
``American Gigolo'' were released. Richard Gere, the star of that
film, recently recalled, ``Everyone that was making that movie
(which came out in 1980) loved European films. It was perfectly
natural to us (to depict sex in a frank way). We thought it was
more aberrant to be like Doris Day and Rock Hudson. I mean, that
was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the body-baring work of such actors as Gere, Voight and
Brando, Hosoda notes that most male nudity in American movies has
been for humor. ``Male nudity tends to be done for laughs: Almost
every comedian, starting wtih Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman, did
some nudity,'' Hosoda said.
</P>
<P>
   If male nudity from the beginning was kept a joke due to
Americans' discomfort with anything that could be construed as
homoerotic, most nudity and depictions of sex were soon to follow
into the ``for laughs'' vein. In its time, ``Tango'' wasn't just
explicit and kinky; according to its champions, it shattered social
conventions in its portrayal of two strangers who seek an
understanding of themselves through rather anonymous sex with one
another. Some cineastes even heralded such movies as ``Tango'' as
part of a new wave of pictures that would liberate American cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in search of the broad and predominantly young audience
that fueled the astounding box office for such pictures as ``Star
Wars,'' American films took a turn back in the other direction.
While nudity and sex stayed, it was played in a totally different
way. It was sex from an adolescent boy's perspective: naughty and
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the multibillion-dollar porn film industry proves
that there is a big audience for pure, raw sex _ disproving any
notion that the more conservative tack in many of today's movies is
due to any such change in public taste. If anything, porn,
especially its easy availability in the home through video, may
have drained off some of the audience that attended sexy movies a
couple of decades ago just to ogle.
</P>
<P>
   More recent attempts to sell sex in mainstream movies such as
``Striptease'' and ``Showgirls'' have fared poorly at theaters,
though they've often made back their money on video.
</P>
<P>
   If it's box office the studios are after, it's doubtful we'll
see any significant return to '70s-style movies following the
opening of ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Kubrick's films have not generally
been top-grossing hits, and ``Eyes'' will surely not outperform
such puerile summer films as ``Big Daddy.'' Will it be, as one
publication asked, ``the sexiest movie ever''? Maybe not. But it
may prove an interesting gauge for Americans' level of comfort with
real sexual issues, circa 1999. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Though the late Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' doesn't
open until Friday, the trailer, featuring Nicole Kidman and Tom
Cruise nude, has been causing a stir for months. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. In the 1960s, Hollywood suddenly moved beyond mild nudity and
double entendres to such depictions as Mrs. Robinson (Anne
Bancroft) seducing Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) in ``The
Graduate.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. In 1973, European director Bernardo Bertolucci pushed the
envelope with ``Last Tango in Paris,'' starring Marlon Brando and
Maria Schneider. &QL;

I'LL TAKE LIFE, THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GERALD NACHMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Death is making a remarkable comeback, all
things considered. Life should be doing half so well.
</P>
<P>
   Dying, according to informed sources, has had a bum rap and
isn't nearly as negative an experience as previously imagined _
good news for the middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
   There was a day, within my own time line, when dying was
something people avoided until the very last moment, but things
have taken a turn for the better, kick-the-bucket-wise.
</P>
<P>
   Death is suddenly fashionable, like some kind of ultimate
weight-loss program. Grief counseling is a booming industry and
seminars on death and dying are popping up like '80s self-esteem
courses. An affirmative attitude toward dying is self-esteem's
final triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from recurring books on the subject, such as the
best-selling ``How We Die,'' wherein Dr. Sherwin Nuland describes
the down-and-dirty facts of death, we've been treated to two major
PBS series _ one on the big D itself, another on near-death
experiences. It made dying sound like such movies as ``Ghost,''
``Always,'' ``Heaven Can Wait,'' ``Truly, Madly, Deeply'' and
``Inventing Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   They all portray dying as an experience not to be missed, where
a good time is had by all. There is much talk of dying as a
``journey'' _ not the familiar depressing trip whence no traveler
returns but, rather, as a neat ride at some terminal Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you're no longer alive, but death is likely to be far
more interesting than life. Or so it's been painted lately by
writers, movie directors and TV producers who know a good thing
when they see it and have begun to, well, beat the subject to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Dying, insist death's new public relations people, is just ``a
part of life,'' a transition, like graduation day, and shouldn't be
feared but graciously welcomed, like an uninvited wedding guest.
</P>
<P>
   I've read some of the pop death literature but, scaredy cat that
I am, I still tiptoe around the topic.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big sissy about dying. If only I could learn to relax
about death, I might enjoy the sensation, yet I'm an old-fashioned
guy when it comes to my own demise. Frankly, the more happy talk I
hear about death, the more I worry. When it comes to goodbyes, I
still tend to get all teary-eyed, especially when it's me that's
heading off for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Even death's jolly spin doctors _ Nuland, Kubler-Ross and Jack
Kevorkian _ confess that dying has its down side, but even ``Dr.
Death'' somehow has made the subject newsworthy, almost
titillating.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, all those poor souls eventually died, but what matters is
that they ``died with dignity,'' which always sounds as if they lay
on their death beds in tuxes and cocktail dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Dying with dignity _ that's the ticket for the enlightened
Nineties. Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worries on
the doorstep, just traverse your feet, to the shady side of the
street!
</P>
<P>
   Dying with dignity, maintains the pro-death faction, is less
painful than regulation croaking. Instead of gasping those final
breaths, one now has the option of going out with head held high,
laughing at the Grim Reaper all the way to the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Much was said of how Jacqueline Kennedy and Richard Nixon
``taught us how to die.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm probably just a slow learner but I haven't quite got the
knack of it yet. I haven't learned to ``come to terms with death.''
Yet death, says Nuland, ``is not the enemy, disease is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to split hairs here, Doc, but I say death is the ultimate
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   While it would be lovely to say ``au revoir'' in style and give
the deceased a proper sendoff (``Champagne for the entire intensive
care unit!''), death does tend to make a man cranky.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough to watch the nightly news update of people
being killed in ingenious new ways without having to endure talk
shows that want you to feel cheerier about expiring, advising us to
think of death as a sort of apres-Golden Years. The premise seems
to be that, since death gets us all sooner or later, let's make
death our little friend, so as to demystify it.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'm all for mystifying death as much as possible. I don't
care to know the details of my final days, nor do I plan to go
smiling into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   I'll worry about all that when the final knock comes. It will
give me something to do while I wait, instead of thumbing old
copies of Today's Health.
</P>
<P>
   I have made out both a dying will and a living will. But that's
all the will I can muster right now about the actual ``dying
process'' _ as the neo-deadheads call it, as if discussing the fine
points of making cheddar cheese.
</P>
<P>
   I much prefer death to remain a nice big fat surprise, just like
good old life itself.

SEX AND CINEMA GO HAND IN HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of the movies hyped as ``must-sees'' in
recent years have been of the sci-fi, special effects genre: movies
like ``Godzilla'' and ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace.'' Despite a general sense among viewers that we're seeing
more sex on screen than ever, such movies feature virtually no sex.
Those big movies that do feature sex today tend to turn it into a
raunchy joke (``There's Something About Mary'') or an act of
violence (``The General's Daughter'').
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the late Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' on the
horizon, we once again have a film that is creating enormous
pre-release ``buzz'' for its reported exploration of the psychology
of sexual desire, rather than its violence or fancy visual tricks.
Though the movie doesn't open until Friday, the trailer _ featuring
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, nude and fondling each other _ has
been causing a stir for months.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a TV ad for the movie has debuted, showing Kidman
in her underwear and hinting at some kinky goings-on. And last
week, Time magazine devoted its cover and eight pages inside to
``Stanley Kubrick's haunting final masterpiece,'' calling it a
``Freudian interpretation of jealousy and sexual obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there has always been sex on celluloid, from the
earliest, silent short subjects that depicted scandalously long
kisses and love triangles. By the early sound era, movies were
routinely trading on racy subject matter to lure viewers. Illicit
sexual affairs and scantily clad starlets were staples of a number
of movies in the early '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as more recently, the industry was pressured to clean up
its act. To stave off government regulation, the Motion Picture
Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) set forth a strict,
voluntary set of standards. Often referred to as the Hays Code
(after MPPDA head Will H. Hays), the production code went into
effect in July 1934. It read like a Ten Commandments of ``thou
shalt nots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No picture shall be produced which will lower the standards of
those who see it,'' read one of the document's general principles.
``Indecent or undue exposure is forbidden .... Scenes of passion
should not be introduced when not essential to the plot ....
Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embracing, suggestive
postures and gestures, are not to be shown,'' read some of the
code's other mandates.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye ``It Girl'' Clara Bow and the lustful Mae West; hello
Donna Reed and Doris Day. According to ``Becoming Mae West'' by
Emily Wortis Leider (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1997) West's first
post-code picture, ``Goin' to Town,'' ``was put through the
wringer'' to clean up any possibly objectionable scenes, dialogue
and song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, in 1936, William Randolph Hearst's papers
launched an all-out attack on the ``lewdness'' of West's ``Klondike
Annie.'' Soon after, Mae West parted ways with her studio.
Paramount couldn't stand the heat anymore, and Mae West without sex
just wasn't Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   There were occasional challenges to the absolute authority of
the production code during the next several decades (the code
remained in force until 1966). Movies such as Howard Hughes' 1943
film ``The Outlaw'' went right up to the edge of what was
acceptable. ``The Outlaw,'' remembered for the enduring image of a
ripe-and-ready Jane Russell reclining in hay, pushed code
boundaries with its very apparent obsession with Russell's ample
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there remained a thriving industry that pumped out
low-budget, non-studio exploitation pictures, which were outside
the MPPDA's jurisdiction. This helps explain, for example, such
staples of the drive-in as women-in-prison movies.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the 1960s that vivid portrayals of sex
resurfaced in mainstream films. This was largely thanks to an
influx of young filmmakers who worshipped sexual liberation and
European cinema, which had always been much more open to sexual
content.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hosoda, who has made it his life's mission to catalog
``where to find your favorite actresses and actors nude on
videotape'' through his self-published ``Bare Facts Video Guide,''
pegs the wave of nudity and sex that began to hit American cinema
in the '60s to such European films as ``I Am Curious (Yellow),'' a
1967 Swedish picture about the sexual adventures of a female
sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans are much more blase about sex and nudity ... . We're
kind of a puritanical country,'' said Hosoda, who is based in the
Silicon Valley area. ``These European films definitely influenced
American films ... (major actors such as) Jane Fonda and Jon Voight
started doing nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hollywood suddenly moved beyond the mild nudity and
double entendres of the previous couple of decades to frank
depictions of sexual perversity and fantasy: Mrs. Robinson (Anne
Bancroft) seducing Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) in ``The
Graduate.'' Jane Fonda romping in next to nothing in
``Barbarella.'' Jon Voight playing a hustler in ``Midnight
Cowboy.'' European director Bernardo Bertolucci pushing the
envelope with ``Last Tango in Paris,'' starring Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
   This trend continued into the early '80s, when such pictures as
``American Gigolo'' were released. Richard Gere, the star of that
film, recently recalled, ``Everyone that was making that movie
(which came out in 1980) loved European films. It was perfectly
natural to us (to depict sex in a frank way). We thought it was
more aberrant to be like Doris Day and Rock Hudson. I mean, that
was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the body-baring work of such actors as Gere, Voight and
Brando, Hosoda notes that most male nudity in American movies has
been for humor. ``Male nudity tends to be done for laughs: Almost
every comedian, starting wtih Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman, did
some nudity,'' Hosoda said.
</P>
<P>
   If male nudity from the beginning was kept a joke due to
Americans' discomfort with anything that could be construed as
homoerotic, most nudity and depictions of sex were soon to follow
into the ``for laughs'' vein. In its time, ``Tango'' wasn't just
explicit and kinky; according to its champions, it shattered social
conventions in its portrayal of two strangers who seek an
understanding of themselves through rather anonymous sex with one
another. Some cineastes even heralded such movies as ``Tango'' as
part of a new wave of pictures that would liberate American cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in search of the broad and predominantly young audience
that fueled the astounding box office for such pictures as ``Star
Wars,'' American films took a turn back in the other direction.
While nudity and sex stayed, it was played in a totally different
way. It was sex from an adolescent boy's perspective: naughty and
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the multibillion-dollar porn film industry proves
that there is a big audience for pure, raw sex _ disproving any
notion that the more conservative tack in many of today's movies is
due to any such change in public taste. If anything, porn,
especially its easy availability in the home through video, may
have drained off some of the audience that attended sexy movies a
couple of decades ago just to ogle.
</P>
<P>
   More recent attempts to sell sex in mainstream movies such as
``Striptease'' and ``Showgirls'' have fared poorly at theaters,
though they've often made back their money on video.
</P>
<P>
   If it's box office the studios are after, it's doubtful we'll

 UNDATED: ... the Aussies, too.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tangibly obvious is the way he has grown into the role of the
American Mr. Davis Cup, once occupied (much more hysterically) by
John McEnroe. McEnroe anointed Courier the other day as ``The guy
who's making Americans interested in the Cup again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever anxious to answer the call of country, and nearly always
successful, McEnroe, however, often carried combativeness too far
and was a walking international incident. That's one reason Courier
is the best choice for the captaincy when the time arrives for
Gullikson to step down.
</P>
<P>
   An example: McEnroe antagonized the French by calling them
``frogs'' and less complimentary names. Courier charmed them by a
singular act of an American champion in Paris, giving his trophy
acceptance speeches in French. It helped that he had a French
girlfriend at the time _ the preferred method for learning any
language _ but it was also an indication that this high school
dropout has made far more of his travels than virtually all of his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   A cosmopolite, he seeks out the essence of the countries he
visits. Not easy, even for a curious James. An athlete, naturally
concerned with being ready to work, will understandably confine
himself to hotel, rest, practice, the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is too interesting to limit yourself to tennis,'' says
un-tunnelized Courier, an avid reader, musician _ ``of sorts,
guitar and drums'' _ listener to all music, rock to Rachmaninoff,
and explorer of foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   That his tympanic Backside Boogie _ shuffle left to drill an
inside-out forehand diagonally to the right corner _ is functioning
forcefully once more is ``gratifying.'' He terrorized the world
with that shot for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be back in good health again is very gratifying,'' he says.
``I'm not concerned about being No. 1 again, but I sure didn't like
going down so far. It was mostly injuries that did it. The worst
was the sore right bicep that plagued me for a couple of years.
Doctors couldn't figure it out. It was really frustrating. I
decided it was up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Courier _ heal thyself. And he did, ``by reforming myself
and my rackets. Balls we use have gotten generally heavier. I had
to catch up with the trend. I did more weight-lifting to increase
my strength. Then Jay Schweid, the master stringer, and I started
tweaking my rackets. What were the variables? It was trial and
error, but after a lot of tweaking we came up with a heavier
racket, 4-5 grams, and looser stringing, and the pain went away. We
design them and Jay gets them custom-made at a factory in Asia. I
haven't endorsed a racket since '89. These are distinctive, right
out of the Schweid-Courier book.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier's bookish habit earned him a few knocks in 1993 at the
ATP Championships in Frankfurt. He brought a novel onto court and
perused it during a changeover while losing to Andrei Medvedev. It
was his 90 seconds of leisure, wasn't it? Karsten Braasch, the
iconoclastic German, used to smoke an occasional cigarette between
games. No rules govern that brief sojourn. But literature and
nicotine are discouraged pastimes at play.
</P>
<P>
   At Birmingham, Courier was reading (not on court) ``The Perfect
Storm,'' and he lived up to that title. Currently he's deep into
the Japanese novelist Murakami's ``Hard Boiled Wonderland and the
End of the World'' (the English version; his Japanese vocabulary
doesn't go much beyond sushi). Surely Courier intends to transform
Longwood into a hard-boiled wonderland run by the homebodies and a
world's end for the Aussies' '99 shot at a 27th Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't read too much into these titles,'' he advises.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but Davis Cup has been on his mind since boyhood (something
that never afflicted Sampras until, the tardy volunteer says,
``Birmingham inspired me'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 11 when I went to Harry Hopman's tennis camp at Bardmore
(Fla.), and that's where I was first aware of the Cup,'' Courier
says. ``Of course, Mr. Hopman was the all-time captain of those
great Australian teams of the '50s and '60s, and he told us it was
the greatest thing in tennis to play for your country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, when I moved in at Nick's (the Bollettieri boot camp at
Bradenton) we all would watch Cup matches on TV when two of Nick's
kids, Aaron Krickstein and Jimmy Arias, were playing for the US. It
seemed terrific, a different, more exciting atmosphere than a
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my first live taste when I went to Peru as a team
sparring partner in 1988, Andre's (Agassi) debut. Latin America was
something else, very nationalistic, loud. They put me on to play an
exhibition the second day against one of their guys, Alejandro
Aramburo. It was an (exhibition), no pressure on me. But they were
his home folks in Lima, and he choked badly. I won quick, and felt
sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt sorry for himself in the din of Mexico City, glad that
Gilbert took him, the rook, off the hook. But by 1997 Courier was
blooded. He savored the drums and clamor of Brazil, the fervently
patriotic crowds at Ribeirao Preto, where he responded by sticking
out that husky, try-and-beat-me chest and carried the weekend by
stopping the boys from that hood, Fernando Meligeni in five, and
French Open champ-to-be Guga Kuerten in a long four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that kind of atmosphere, and I hope it's that way at
Longwood _ for us. Though Courier doesn't approach McEnroe's US Cup
singles record (16-9 to 41-8), he has been Crunch Man big time,
scoring the decisive win in five of those 13 victories during his
team streak. Thrice, more than any other American, he has succeeded
in the super pressure cooker of an ultimate fifth match with the
score 2-2: over Jacco Eltingh at Rotterdam in 1994; Russian Marat
Safin at Atlanta last year; Rusedski at Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The incomparable imbroglio with Australia very well could come
down to a fifth match Sunday, Courier facing off with the kid,
Hewitt. Courier would salivate. So would all the bag boys across
the US because this unassuming, small-town kamikaze guy is the
people's choice as a tennis player.

A WARNING ON THE COMING BUDGET-PRIORITY TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- For the most part, news that the president and
congressional leaders are about to start serious talks about
national priorities for the next decade is reason to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, serious talk leading to serious action on the
basic shape of a force as huge as the $1.5 trillion federal
government has almost always had to be bipartisan and collegial.
And that tends to be for the better.
</P>
<P>
   But not now, and certainly not this week. In fact, a grand
budget deal between President Clinton and the Republican Congress,
giving each side the core of what it wants, would run a large risk
of being the worst imaginable outcome for the country, threatening
one of the main pillars of the current prosperity _ a responsible
fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the first topic that each side wants to bring up if
both indeed start talking this week as planned. The Republicans
want to talk about tax cuts, and the president wants to discuss
changing and expanding Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   One side has priorities that, whatever their merits, reduce
revenues substantially; the other has priorities that, whatever
their merits, increase expenditures substantially. The most common
GOP tax-cut dream is worth at least $800 billion over the next
decade; the net cost of the Clinton Medicare package is $374
billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   They are reconcilable, even if pared back, only if the two sides
decide to use a projected operating budget ``surplus'' that
currently exists only as a projection by each side, based on some
of the most crackpot assumptions in the history of federal
budgeting. The current shorthand in politics and journalism, that
they have $1 trillion to fool around with, is nuts.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe this will happen. I particularly can't believe
that Clinton would place at risk one of his most significant
accomplishments _ a fiscal policy that has directly liberated a
trillion dollars or so for investment by the private sector, and a
lowering of interest rates that has freed up even more.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more than enough deal-making talk to raise a red
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news is alarming. Within the Social Security system,
revenues continue to outpace benefits payments, and will continue
to do so for many years, given a decent economy. And there is
almost a bipartisan agreement to use all of whatever surplus there
is only within the system to pay down federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   That's fantastic. It is no substitute for inevitable change, but
down the road this responsible act of walling off Social Security
surpluses will make change vastly less wrenching for future
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The red flag needs to be raised about blank ink beginning to
show up outside Social Security. To say there is roughly $1
trillion to play with over the next 10 years is madness. Here's
why.
</P>
<P>
   When the last, relatively small steps were taken two years ago
to balance the overall budget, Congress and Clinton also agreed to
increase spending on some agreed on priorities like education and
to cut income taxes primarily for working families with children.
</P>
<P>
   To make the numbers work, however, they reintroduced two
dangerous concepts from the crazy, triple-digit-deficit 1980s _ the
rosy scenario and the magic asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the deal makers severely tightened the spending
caps that regulate spending that is subject to annual
appropriations. They then assumed that these ``savings'' they had
made on paper would continue into the future.
</P>
<P>
   This is a slight variation on the fictions used by Ronald Reagan
and Congress starting in 1981. Back then, budgets were ``balanced''
on the assumption of economic performance that everyone knew would
not occur (the rosy scenario) as well as by a spending category
usually marked with an asterisk (savings to be proposed later).
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the rosy scenario involves spending, and the
magic asterisk is the same. That's because not one dime from the
tighter caps has in fact been saved; all the action since the 1997
deal has been in the other direction _ for the military, for
highways, for airports, for farmers. Some $21 billion in add-ons
last year were called ``emergencies'' to dodge the rules, and
another $20 billion-plus has already been approved this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``surplus'' outside Social Security assumes cutting
overall appropriations below this year's level for the upcoming
fiscal year, making further cuts in non-inflated terms for each of
the next two years, and then keeping the caps at no more than the
inflation rate after 2002.
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, there isn't a Republican or a Democrat who
believes congressional majorities exist or should exist to pass
bills specifically establishing these caps in the coming weeks. And
yet the ``surplus'' not only assumes it, it assumes caps all the
way through the year 2009 that are lower in uninflated dollars than
the ceilings for the year 2002 that everyone treats as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has at least proposed adjusting the caps
realistically, adding a higher cigarette tax and other changes that
at least constitute an idea. But he has made his proposals to a
dysfunctional Congress under Republican control. The Republican
direction, which both assumes the ``surplus'' for a decade and
seeks nearly a trillion dollars in tax cuts, makes the 1980s look
responsible by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a deal that tries to accommodate the two political
parties could be so dangerous. The alternative _ doing as little as
possible beyond protecting Social Security _ is minimalist, but
preferable.
</P>
<P>
   And that would leave the question of national priorities for the
next decade to the presidential campaign, in the admittedly
quixotic hope that the candidates might discuss the future
specifically and responsibly.

NO. 1 IS NO LONGER TOP PRIORITY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They'd finished their private practice session at the Harry
Hopman Tennis Academy in Tampa, winding down a week of leisurely
preparation for the clay-court season, and now Pete Sampras and his
coach, Paul Annacone, were killing time in their condominium at the
Saddlebrook resort.
</P>
<P>
   As they lounged on the couch, Annacone picked up the remote and
started channel-surfing. Horse racing. Click. Baseball. Click.
Hockey. Click. Tennis. Cli . . . Wait a minute. This might be
interesting. Or lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Annacone waited to see whether Sampras would grab the control
and hurl it through the screen. There was no reaction, violent or
otherwise. So Annacone kept the station tuned to the United States'
first-round Davis Cup series in Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
   The series Jim Courier, Todd Martin, and Alex O'Brien were
playing for the Americans. The series they were supposed to lose.
The series Sampras had been asked to play by captain Tom Gullikson
and US Tennis Association president Julia Levering, who both had
made visits to his Los Angeles home _ an unusual gesture for a
captain, an unprecedented one for a USTA head _ three months ago at
the start of the year. The series Sampras had refused to play,
publicly proclaiming that Davis Cup was not a priority for him, not
compared to winning Grand Slam events and preserving his world No.
1 ranking; then he'd skipped the year's first major, the Australian
Open, citing fatigue, only to show up on national television
convalescing by playing 90 holes of golf in the Bob Hope Desert
Classic. The series that had prompted Gullikson to say upon
arriving in Birmingham, ``You'd think he'd look at me and see my
brother'' _ making the snub personal by invoking the ghost of his
twin, Tim Gullikson, who had been Sampras's coach, mentor, and
spiritual guide before dying of brain cancer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The series that had made Pete Sampras a pariah in American
tennis circles, denounced for selfishness, disloyalty, and being
downright unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Annacone had not really expected Sampras to go ballistic; he
wasn't one to betray his emotions one way or another. But he
noticed that Sampras was as focused on the screen as he was,
sensing the same things he did. That the excitement and tension in
Birmingham fairly burst through the tube. That the Americans were
waging a positively heroic battle against Britain's best, Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski, and darn it if they might not win this
thing somehow. That the nationalism and teamwork, so contrary to
the nature of singles tennis, were real and significant, at least
on selected weekends like this first one in April.
</P>
<P>
   So Annacone figured this might be the proper time to lay out
some career options for his player. Gently, of course, for he had
noticed some subtle changes in Sampras's demeanor toward the end of
1998. That's when Sampras did something he'd never done: played six
weeks in a row, slummed through the European indoor circuit in Lyon
and Vienna and Stuttgart and Paris, all to satisfy an objective
that had come to consume him _ surpassing Jimmy Connors's record
and ending up as No. 1 in the world for a sixth straight year. It
had been a singular opportunity, Annacone realized, and Sampras had
made it, had seized his place in history. But at what expense? He'd
grown more irritable over little things, more impatient about
inevitable travel inconveniences that he used to shrug off, and he
wasn't eating well. So God only knew how he'd react to this pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you like to be there, with that type of intensity and
atmosphere,'' Annacone said to Sampras as he pointed to the
captivating drama in Birmingham playing out before them, ``instead
of in some first-rounder in San Jose or Scottsdale?''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't even sure Sampras had heard him. His condo mate was
transfixed by the screen. ``Listen to that noise,'' was all Sampras
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Annacone kept prodding. ``Wouldn't you like to be part of
that?'' he asked. ``You've got a choice, Pete. You can play in
matches that really matter to you and maybe risk the No. 1 ranking.
Or you can grind it out at all those little tournaments to protect
your ranking and maybe shorten your career by a year or two. It's
up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   They parted that weekend without anything being settled.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gullikson picked up his phone at home a week later. He was
still feeling the exhilaration of the Birmingham bombshell, the
palpitating 3-2 US upset that had gone extra innings, as it were,
coming down to an 8-6 Courier win over Rusedski in the fifth set of
the deciding match. Next up for the United States was a
quarterfinal against Australia at Longwood Cricket Club in
Brookline in July to commemorate the centennial of the year
Bostonian Dwight Davis donated the cup symbolizing international
team tennis supremacy. But Gullikson wasn't thinking about that
just yet. He was still savoring the unlikely triumph, still
accepting kudos _ none unlikelier than this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' Pete Sampras said on the other end of the
phone. ``That was terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson thanked him and figured that was that. It never had
been personal, anyway, despite his reference to Tim. Tennis was one
thing, friendship another, and he and Sampras always would be
friends _ and this certainly was a nice gesture. He prepared to
hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play Davis Cup,'' Sampras said. ``Just doubles. If
it's OK with you and Jim and Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was it OK? Sampras will be in Brookline next weekend, alongside
his American teammates _ Courier, Martin, and O'Brien _ to face the
Australian side of Patrick Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt, and the Mark
Woodforde-Todd Woodbridge doubles duo.
</P>
<P>
   Was it OK?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for Pete,'' says Gullikson. ``I think it's
great for the US Davis Cup team. I think it's great for tennis.
We've got the No. 1 player in the world of the last six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that again. It turns out that Sampras's obsessive
achievement will dilute his gallantry. He insisted on playing
exclusively doubles because he didn't want to step on the toes of
Courier and Martin, who got the Americans this far. ``Those guys
are the reason we're playing in Boston,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He even called Courier and Martin to seek their blessing. ``I'm
willing to play for the year and I'm willing to play doubles,'' he
told them, ``and if you're not comfortable with that, I won't be a
party of it. I don't want to ruffle anyone's feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough of this noble nonsense. Gullikson never accepted
Sampras's proviso; he only granted permission _ in about a
nanosecond after the offer was made _ for Sampras to join the team.
Anyway, after losing in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, Martin
volunteered to defer to Sampras in singles, saying he'd felt all
along Sampras should be used in that role. And Gullikson has
maintained from the start that the decision on how he deploys his
lineup will be his alone. So Sampras probably will play doubles
Saturday. And he'll definitely play singles Friday and Sunday.

WHAT IS REALLY COOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was roughly 35 years ago, as a teen-ager, that I became
strongly aware of the perils of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a freshman in high school in 1964, the U.S. surgeon
general released a headline-making report that cited cigarette
smoking as the leading cause of death from lung cancer and as a
major contributor to emphysema and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, I read an article in Reader's Digest titled
``I Am Joe's Lungs.'' It somberly detailed how cigarette smoking
destroys alveoli, tiny air sacs in the lungs that are critical to
breathing. If I had any lingering doubts about the dangers of
smoking, that article vanquished them.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of smoking would later be brought home to me in a
much more personal way. Both my father and an aunt died in their
late 50s. Longtime smoking habits contributed to their
unnecessarily premature deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those experiences in my background, I had mixed
emotions about a courtroom verdict in Miami on Wednesday that could
prove a big-time headache for Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   A jury concluded that the nation's five largest tobacco
companies showed ``extreme and outrageous conduct'' by selling
cigarettes and other products that they knew caused fatal illnesses
such as lung cancer and emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   In upcoming phases of the trial, the jury potentially could
decide to award billions of dollars in damages to hundreds of
thousands of current and former Florida smokers whose health has
been damaged by tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are being sued for $200 billion. The case is
especially significant because it is the first class-action lawsuit
by smokers ever to go to trial. If the plaintiffs win, it could
trigger a wave of new class-action litigation by smokers in other
states and put renewed pressure on government officials to clamp
down on tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that, for the most part, I reveled in the Miami
jury verdict. I have little respect for the tobacco industry. I
could not in good conscience work in such an industry.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's hard to be wholly sympathetic to the
smokers suing the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that most people who grew up in the United
States in the last several decades could have been totally unaware
of the dangers of smoking when they took up the habit _ even if
they were only young teen-agers when they did so.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the surgeon general's report in 1964, there was
substantial research indicating that smoking was a no-no for those
who wanted to live a long, healthy life. Logic would dictate that
the tobacco industry would die a natural death from a lack of
customers even if cigarettes were a penny a pack.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami lawsuit, the plaintiffs contend that the tobacco
industry conspired to hide the danger and addictiveness of
cigarettes. Indeed, there is little doubt in my mind that the
industry has sought for decades to distort the truth and conceal
damaging information about tobacco's ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   But let's face it, for the tobacco industry to attempt to hide
the dangers of smoking is like an elephant trying to hide the fact
that it's big. It's been painfully obvious for decades that tobacco
is a killer.
</P>
<P>
   So when I see on an American Lung Association Web site that the
number of American teen-age smokers is estimated at 4 million or
more, I shudder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I posed this question to my 20-year-old, non-smoking
daughter: What possesses so many young people to take up smoking,
when they almost inevitably must know that it is a nasty,
expensive, life-shortening habit?
</P>
<P>
   ``They just think it looks cool,'' she informed me.
</P>
<P>
   That brought my dad to mind. A star athlete in high school who
was very physically fit in his younger years, he told me he started
smoking at age 18 because... he thought it looked cool. By the time
he had a major heart attack at age 51, and a cardiologist insisted
he stop smoking immediately, he didn't think tobacco was quite so
cool anymore. He quit smoking that very day and never puffed
another cigarette. But the ravages of a sustained 33-year nicotine
habit already had taken their toll and almost certainly contributed
to the massive heart attack that killed him seven years later.
</P>
<P>
   Once you start smoking, it's hard to stop. The American Lung
Association estimates that, of the 47 million Americans who smoke,
31 million would like to stop.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is that an estimated 44 million adults are
ex-smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's cool.

JACKSON COULD HELP DEMOCRATS THE MOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; President Clinton's trip last week to some of the nation's
areas of extreme poverty, with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson in the
entourage, may have much more significance than any of the
president's previous domestic tours.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's achievements in the international arena _ his
efforts toward Mideast peace, or his intervention in Kosovo _ he
appears to be setting his sites on creating a domestic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, not only would he be credited with diminishing
the worst aspects of poverty in the nation, he could also reduce
another domestic problem: the Monica Lewinsky affair and his
subsequent impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his acquittal, and the feeling among most Americans that
his impeachment was simply an attempt by right-wing Republicans to
drive him from office, the episode may still leave a stain on his
presidency. The right domestic detergent could help wash most of it
out.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be other reasons Clinton decided to go high
profile with an economic program largely developed by Rev. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was warmly received at virtually every poverty area he
and Clinton visited, and he ended up getting almost as much
favorable coverage as the president. The week built on the public
relations gains Jackson made earlier this year with his highly
successful effort to free the four American soldiers captured by
Slobodan Milosevic's troops in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The more positive Jackson's image these days, the better it will
be for two political hopefuls close to Clinton _ Vice President Al
Gore Jr. and New York Senate hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, once a threat to Democratic presidential contenders,
today is both a supporter and an asset. No longer running for
president himself, he is comfortable and more effective in his
active ad hoc role as an advisor.
</P>
<P>
   He is now in a position to aid Gore's presidential campaign and
Hillary Clinton's senatorial campaign. And both are likely to need
his help to counter the huge financial support their Republican
opponents will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has the ability to galvanize and motivate that coalition
to go to the polls and vote Democratic. Perhaps that is why some
political analysts suggest that the electorate is likely to see
more of Jackson in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   They also predict we'll see more of Clinton, as he helps
transfer his coalition's support to Gore nationally and to Mrs.
Clinton in New York. In short, expect a high-profile
Jackson-Clinton team in months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Gore and Hillary might have support is also the areas
where the voters may be apathetic or uncertain,'' said
Atlanta-based pollster Harry L. Ross. ``Jackson, as a spokesperson
for Gore and Hillary and as a motivator to the voters, can remove
the apathy and uncertainty from members of the coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's active presence in the 2000 election may also make a
difference in statewide and regional elections where he can
motivate blacks, Hispanics and other members of the Clinton
coalition to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Jackson's ability to bring these voters to the polls
could result, especially in close elections, in Democrats winning
enough seats to regain control of the House, and perhaps even the
Senate, next year.
</P>
<P>
   As another political analyst noted, there is one word that sums
up Jackson's role in the campaign: ``turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore has the support of the Clinton coalition, it is
another thing to get its members to vote. Elections are about who
shows up at the polls, and Jackson, as he has proven in the past,
is about getting people to show up at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could be an especially important asset to Gore's
campaign in those key states where a few percentage points make a
difference. Jackson could also help motivate Hillary Clinton's
supporters in areas of New York that are crucial to her election,
particularly in black, Hispanic and more liberal areas of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's alliance with Clinton these days would never have been
foreseen, given their uneasy relationship during the 1992
presidential campaign. That was when Clinton criticized a member of
Jackson's panel, rap singer Sister Souljah, at his Rainbow
Convention for having earlier made anti-white remarks. He also
faulted Jackson for inviting her to his forum. Jackson later
criticized Clinton for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But that event appears to be all but forgotten between the two,
as the two men have grown closer. Their relationship was cemented
when Jackson became Clinton's spirtual adviser, as well as his
political friend, during the Lewinsky-White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The two potential beneficiaries of Jackson's enhanced political
status, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, might consider that the more
warmly they, too, embrace Jackson, the more likely they will enjoy
a strong turnout of supporters on election day.

STRAIGHT FROM `THE WOOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It &UR;  &LR; all started with a student film called ``Blacktop Lingo.''
Executives at Sundance Institute had gotten an eyeful of Rick
Famuyiwa's short at the 1996 Sundance film festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It explores the connection between basketball and jazz music
in a very original way,'' remembers Michelle Satter, director of
Sundance Institute's feature-film program. ``It made us very
excited about him.''
</P>
<P>
   They were so excited that a year later the 1996 graduate of the
University of Southern California's film school was still on
Sundance executives' minds as they tried to fill about 10 slots in
its summer filmmaking lab. (Sundance gets about 3,000 applications
a year for the program.)
</P>
<P>
   Sundance representatives tried calling Famuyiwa, but the
telephone numbers were always disconnected. They tracked him down
to different addresses, but no luck. Famuyiwa had moved two or
three times that past year.
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa and Sundance finally came together when a college
friend of Famuyiwa's sent the organization an application. A
tenacious Sundance associate recognized the friend's name from the
credits in ``Blacktop Lingo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like, `Oh, do you still keep in contact with Rick?'
'' recalls Famuyiwa, during a recent telephone conversation from
Los Angeles. ``He was like, `Yeah, I work with him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both were salesmen at a Los Angeles Niketown, a popular stop for
recent USC and UCLA graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was selling shoes,'' says Famuyiwa, who recently turned 26,
laughing. ``I needed to pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa sent Sundance a copy of his coming-of-age screenplay
``The Wood,'' which he had co-written with USC professor Todd Boyd.
Over the next two years, Famuyiwa fine-tuned the script at
Sundance, got MTV Films interested in producing the movie, and
hired young actors Omar Epps, Taye Diggs, and Sean Nelson for key
roles. All that work finally pays off when the film opens this
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa still seems surprised by his relatively fast rise from
talented USC student to first-time director of a studio film. The
trajectory has landed him on a short list of young black Hollywood
filmmakers that includes John Singleton, the Hughes brothers, and
Kasi Lemmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought I would maybe raise the money'' to make ``The
Wood'' himself, says Famuyiwa, ``or go to an independent company
like Working Title or Good Machine and get my litle budget and
no-name actors and make my film. For it to happen this way is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Satter links Famuyiwa's success to his ``grounded'' personality.
On the phone, he speaks slowly and deliberately, laughing easily
and often. But he's a talker who doesn't need much urging to chat
about details in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great energy,'' says Satter. ``He's a big guy, but
he has a real kindnes. You can see it in the film. It has great
heart and humor to it. You feel that you're seeing his vision and
his self on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Boyd, who's morphed from Famuyiwa's professor to friend to
writing partner and producer since meeting him in 1992, ``I think
Rick has a very unique perspective. His parents immigrated to
America from Nigeria _ I always call him the true African-American.
I think because of that he has a unique view on life. What makes
good filmmakers is people who have a view that's outside of the
mainstream, or outside of the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' tells the tale of three twentysomething buddies who
summon up memories of their friendship hours before one of them is
scheduled to traipse down the aisle. Like many first-time
filmmakers, Famuyiwa wrote about what he knew.
</P>
<P>
   The story is set n ``the Wood,'' the black, middle-class
neighborhood in Inglewood, Calif., where Famuyiwa grew up. And yes,
it's based on the reaction Famuyiwa had when one of his two best
friends from his teenage years announced he was getting married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until that point you're just going full steam ahead,'' he
explains. ``It was the first time I looked back and said `Wow, you
know, we've been through a lot in the time we've known each other.'
''
</P>
<P>
   During those formative years, Famuyima didn't dream of having a
film career. He loved movies growing up, but ``I never saw
filmmaking as a viable option. . . . I had no idea you could go to
school for film. The concept was, like, foreign to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Famuyiwa's mom, Florence, to remember the movie
camera she had purchased for her 11-year-old son. He used it to
make silent films with his younger brother. But when Famuyiwa
entered USC, he was a basketball-playing political-science major
with an eye on law school.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when Famuyiwa discovered that he was attending a
college with what he modestly calls a ``pretty good'' film school.
He took some classes, saw some films _ he remembers ``JFK'' in
particular _ and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember all the controversy and discussion and debate
surrounding'' Oliver Stone's movie about the Kennedy assassination,
says Famuyiwa. ``I felt that would be a great thing to do, to kind
of affect people in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa found his mother surprisingly supportive of his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comforted her that there was an actual degree you
could get in it,'' says Famuyiwa. He'd slip his mother USC
pamphlets bragging that 80 percent of the film school graduates
wound up working in the business. ``I don't know where they got
that figure from,'' he adds dubiously. ``But, you know, I guess
even if you're a PA (production assistant, a low-level support
staffer), they consider that work.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some tough times, however. Famuyiwa spent two years
after school writing and pitching stories to the studios. That
period included his infamous Niketown stint. The memory now makes
Florence Famuyiwa chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were like sad days,'' she says. ``I was like, `God,
what's going on? This kid went to a very reputable school. He did
very well.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Famuyiwa wasn't always impressed with the Hollywood he
encountered during that time. While he acknowledges that the
industry has become more open to African-American talent, he
believes many executives are willing to showcase blacks only in B
movies with comedic or violent ghetto content.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one producer in particular who produced one of these
hip-hop comedies,'' said Famuyiwa. ``His whole idea was black
audiences are sophisticated, but I guess not sophisticated enough
to embrace things other than `Booty Call' and `How to Be a Player.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The recent failures of ``Beloved'' and ``Why Do Fools Fall in
Love'' have only made things worse, says Famuyiwa: ``The kind of
roles and scripts and stories that are being sold and are being
embraced are quite often not really of high quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Famuyiwa had a different vision, so he eagerly grabbed the
opportunity to develop ``The Wood'' through Sundance's rigorous
filmmaker's lab. For four weeks in the summer of 1997, a group of
creative advisers _ it included directors Jon Amiel and Michael
Apted, casting director Mali Finn, and actors Kathy Bates and
Denzel Washington _ aided Famuyiwa in casting, shooting, editing a
few scenes from the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say USC was my undergraduate experience and Sundance
was my graduate school,'' says Famuyiwa. ``You make films at USC
but (Sundance) is the first time you get a chance to make films in
the process that you do professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The smooth ``lab'' experience carried over to the set when ``The
Wood'' was finally shot. (Producers Ron Yerxa and Albert Berger
brought the script to MTV after seeing it performed at an LA
screenplay reading sponsored by Sundance.) The only difference,
Famuyiwa says, was the addition of politics as he dealt with the
studio and a gaggle of agents and managers for the actors.
</P>
<P>
   As Famuyiwa awaits reaction to ``The Wood,'' he's keeping busy.
He's already working on a new romantic comedy. And there's some
interest in transforming ``The Wood'' into a television show.
Famuyiwa and Boyd are now writing a pilot for the project.
</P>
<P>
   But the ever-humble Famuyiwa isn't getting too excited about his
blossoming television career. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``After looking at this past fall's schedule, this might just be
an exercise,'' he says, laughing. ``You know, I thought it was bad
in films, but television is like completely white. . . . There are
no ethnic characters, stories or anything. It's kind of amazing.''

ANOTHER SEASON IN OZ 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Augustus Hill, a dreadlocked young black inmate in a wheelchair,
is being bound with rope by some white men. Augustus is angry _
perennially seething _ but he sits impassively, stoically. Behind
him hangs a large Confederate flag. His hands are tied, then his
feet, with the kind of thick rope someone might use for a lynching.
The knots are pulled tight. It's a disconcerting scene _ even if
Augustus Hill is a fictional character played by actor Harold
Perrineau, and even if this is all taking place on a television
soundstage.
</P>
<P>
   And . . . action. Hill looks the camera in the eye, telling a
story directly to the viewer: It seems this truck full of ``Aryan''
males, the driver being the son of a neo-Nazi fellow inmate in
Hill's prison, Oz, has roped a black man to a truck and dragged him
to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who's coming to Oz?
</P>
<P>
   ``Prisoner number 99S333, Andrew Peter Schillinger,'' intones
Hill of the driver. ``Convicted February 16th, '99, murder in the
second degree, possession of narcotics. Sentence, 50 years. Up for
parole in 20.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way every episode of the HBO series ``Oz'' begins:
with Hill, the narrator, introducing us to a new prisoner or the
current conflict in the prison. The ``Oz'' folks call this bit
``the box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ugly,'' says the director, Keith Samples, sitting 30 feet
in front of Parrineau, as another take of ``the box'' is shot.
</P>
<P>
   The show's creator and co-executive producer, Tom Fontana,
smiles and says, ``That's the `Oz' motto: `Simple, but sick.' ''
The dragging scene was shot earlier the day, near dawn, in
Brooklyn. Everyone knew they were creating a raw echo of a
horrifying real-life crime, the one that last summer took the lilfe
of James Byrd Jr. in Texas. Cast members said everyone wanted to
get it done as quickly as they could, with as few takes as
possible. There's a good deal of humor flying around the set where
``the box'' is shot, but there wasn't out there on the Brooklyn
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``Oz.'' The name is short for Oswald State
Correctional Facility: Level Four, and inside Oz is a special
community of prisoners who live in an innovative zone called
Emerald City. It is bright and clean, with no cell decorations
permitted and doors made with unbreakable glass, not bars. (Fontana
modeled it after a New Jersey facility.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Oz,'' which starts its third season on HBO this week
(Wednesday, 10 p.m., with repeats on Thursday, Saturday, and next
Monday), is the best-written, hardest-edged drama on TV these days,
network or cable. (Due to its harsh content, of course, it could
only be made for cable.) It has also become a showcase for
actor-directors such as Matt Dillon and Chazz Palminteri. It's one
of the best ensemble dramas ever written for the medium. And it is
the most brutal. The violence shown in previous seasons has
included a bloody riot, a crucifixion, brandings, rapes, a naked
man strung up with carvings in his chest. You may or may not see
the full act of violence, but ``Oz'' never flinches from
dramatizing its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Moreno, who plays one of the show's kind characters, Sister
Peter Marie Reimondo, says her mother has seen the show just once _
out of respect for her daughter _ but that's it. ``Oz'' is a
hellish place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a drama that has the magnified impact of ``Scared
Straight.'' This place is no fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' agrees Fontana. He's seen other prison movies,
but says the famous documentary starring inmates ``is the movie I
remember seeing and being very impressed by.''
</P>
<P>
   The fictional land of ``Oz'' is located in an unspecified state
prison. All the interior scenes are shot on the 60,000-square-foot
sixth floor of the Chelsea Market building on Ninth Avenue in
Manhattan. When they're not on the set, the main actors hunker down
in tiny cell-like dressing rooms. ``You don't see daylight,'' says
Eammon Walker, who plays prisoner Kareem Said. ``It's like living
in prison. We see each other all the time, we breathe each other
in.'' They film about 8 to 12 minutes of footage a day. Each
episode costs about $1 million. About 50 actors pass through in a
season; another 100 may be hired as extra prisoners or guards.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Oz,'' everyone _ prisoners, guards, visitors _ is on edge.
It's a world of competing cliques and warring ethnic factions,
tribe against tribe. Black thugs, black Muslims, neo-Nazis, the
Italians, the Latinos, a couple of Irish, a couple of old-guy
lifers. This season _ which will focus on the inmates and their
families outside _ a Russian mobster joins them. There's one woman,
a beguiling nymphomaniac/killer mom who's on death row. Liaisons
are struck, deals are made, drugs are snorted, alliances are
formed. Between the prisoners, with the guards, who are far from
scrupulous. Those relationships _ always contracts in mutual
interests _ are often shattered. Betrayal is just around the
corner. Everyone's a con man. Today's victim is tomorrow's
victimizer. It's one endless vicious cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life expectancy in `Oz' is not all that great,'' deadpans
actor J. K. Simmons, who plays the neo-Nazi Vern Schillinger,
father of the hate killer who will be joining the population.
</P>
<P>
   The show is not easy to watch, especially when the violence
escalates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a responsibility,'' says Fontana, ``that if I
am going to do violence, then that violence should be terrifying
and everybody watching that goes, `Oh my God, I don't ever want to
be close to that.' I want to be shocking, but I don't want it to
have a half-life. I want it to be something. Repulsive.''

BIG NAMES, LITTLE READERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's Della and Maria and Dr. Laura and Jamie Lee. These
pop-culture icons earn their suppers in different ways _ Reese and
Shriver on television, Schlessinger on radio, and Curtis in films.
But they've all hopped on the same trendy bandwagon. A wagon that
shows no signs of slowing down in our media-driven society.
</P>
<P>
   These celebrities are children's book authors.
</P>
<P>
   Book industry purists may have reservations about calling them
``authors.'' But the literati can't dispute the fact that
well-known names on picture books for wee folks have proven strong
sellers. Often, celebrity equals talk-show appearances equals
front-of-the-bookstore placement equals big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Shriver's recent book, ``What's Heaven?,'' appeared
on the New York Times bestseller list for seven weeks, sharing the
spotlight with such established fiction writers as Mary Higgins
Clark, Stephen King, and John Grisham. And the book's sales figures
have shot above $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Roback, children's book editor of Publishers Weekly, says
few writers can pen a solid children's book, even authors who
successfully write adult books. Danielle Steel's children's books
were ``awful,'' she says, and Patricia Cornwell's recent book for
kids is ``dreadful.'' Maria Shriver's book, which concerns dealing
with death, ``has sold well because of who she is, the subject
matter, but also because she tells her story in an honest and
straightforward way. But, of course, her ability to generate media
coverage has been a driving force behind sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some teeth-gnashing by thoroughbred children's book
editors and shop owners over celebrity books, they do agree on one
thing _ Jamie Lee Curtis's books are popular not because she's a
likable actress and a member of Hollywood royalty but because she's
a talented author working with an imaginative illustrator, Laura
Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie Lee has a voice,'' says Roback. ``And she's proven
herself with not one but three books (``Tell Me Again About the
Night I Was Born,'' ``When I Was Little: A Four-Year-Old's Memoir
of Her Youth,'' and ``Today I Feel Silly'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids liked her first book and therefore looked forward to her
second and third. Kids are very discerning. They don't care about
celebrity. They don't even know who some of these people are. They
only care about the story,'' says Roback.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver _ an NBC TV journalist, mother of four, wife of actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger, and member of the Kennedy clan _ says she
started noting the concerns and worries of her children, especially
her oldest daughter, Katherine, following the death of family
matriarch Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began jotting down their questions on little pieces of
paper, and also their answers,'' says Shriver, during a telephone
interview from her home in Santa Monica, Calif. ``I had no
intention of writing a book. But what made me first think about a
book was that I didn't find anything out there for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Shriver was 9 when her uncle John was assassinated and 12 when
her uncle Robert was murdered. She remembers how shattered family
members were at the time and how alone and confused she felt with
her feelings and grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to tell kids that it's OK to cry, that it's OK to
feel all the emotions a death can stir up,'' says Shriver. ``And
the response to my book has been so satisfying to me. It seems to
have unearthed a whole lot of things for a lot of people _ of all
ages. It's still such an uncomfortable subject for people to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought this was just a children's book,'' says
Shriver. ``I also thought it was a book that could be right up
there with Grisham and Stephen King. My publisher thought I was
crazy. But I'm very driven and goal-oriented, and my book's done
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Detwiler, owner of Buttonwoods Book Store in Cohasset,
says the Shriver book sold well in her store because of the
publicity as well as the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she did a good job, although my own religious
persuasion is different,'' says Detwiler. ``The book can be useful
for family discussions. But my own favorite on the same subject is
`When Someone Dies' by Sharon Greenlee, an elementary school
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Schmitz, owner of the Children's Book Store in Brookline,
says she finds most celebrity books appalling, although she
concedes Shriver's book is the most useful and the least offensive
of the latest trio _ Shriver, Reese, and Dr. Laura. But she thinks
the illustrations in Shriver's book are amateurish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even stock Dr. Laura's book (`Why Do You Love Me?'),''
says Schmitz. ``It's badly done, like most celebrity books. They
are didactic and seem to be done to satisfy the ego of the person
writing, instead of the intended audience. These celebrities don't
really know anything about children's literature and how it works.
Della Reese's book (`God Inside of Me') is well meaning but not the
kind of book a child would want to hear a second time. Plus the
illustrations and text don't work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese, star of the top-rated television series ``Touched by an
Angel,'' says she wanted to write a book that would help children
understand that there is a piece of God in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in the schools and with these kids shooting each
other is all because they have no basis in God,'' says Reese by
phone from California. ``If they had God in their lives, they'd
have no reason to stick a needle in their arm or carry a pistol.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura, host of a radio advice talk show that is syndicated
on more than 400 radio stations nationally, says she remembers her
son Deryk, now 13, asking her one day in the kitchen, when he was
6: ``Mom, why do you love me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' she says, during an interview from her home
in southern California. ``At the time, I wasn't into God and tried
to explain to my son that I loved him because he came from me and
his daddy. Now I'd say to him what God says _ I love you because
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger says it took her years to get her children's book
published, until she tapped the publisher of her successful adult
books, HarperCollins. She says she plans a series of books to
promote a dialogue between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity phenomenon began, most observers agree, when
singer-songwriter Carly Simon hooked up with her Vineyard neighbor,
Doubleday editor Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, a decade ago and
published ``Amy the Dancing Bear.'' It didn't hurt, some say, that
Simon was also ``umbilically connected'' to the publishing world
via Simon &AMP; Schuster, a house founded by her father. The same year,
1989, Britain's Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, came out with her
first ``Budgie the Helicopter'' book.
</P>
<P>
   Preempting these authors was singer and actress Julie Andrews,
who wrote a book called ``Mandy'' in the 1960s. But she published
it under her married name, Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't trying to cash in on her celebrity,'' says Roger
Sutton, editor of Horn Book Magazine. ``Jamie Lee's books aren't
bad, but Maria Shriver's and Della Reese's books are too preachy,''
he says. ``What's missing from most of these celebrity books is a
good story. A sermon is no substitute for a story. Plus there are
so many other good books out there. Would Maria Shriver's book have
been published without Maria Shriver as the author? The answer is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   But publishers are increasingly focused on making money, says
Sutton. For years, ``children's books were segregated from this
behavior, but that's not true anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus there's a lot of people out there who think it's easy to
write a children's book because children are so cute and sweet. But
that's not true. Children are just like the rest of us _ they're
very complicated. When parents are buying books, they shouldn't
think about what kind of message it might bring to a child but
their own reaction to the book. Take a book like `Where the Wild
Things Are.' You can't help but have a response to it. And that's
true of all the other classics. Kids don't want to be preached to
and don't want to be talked down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity books are stocked mainly by the large chain stores and
outlets that buy in bulk and then rapidly move books on and off the
highly visible sales tables. Many such books don't even reach the
shelves of small, independent children's bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We handle these kinds of books on a very token level,'' says
Carol Chittenden, owner of Eight Cousins bookstore in Falmouth.
``We never feature them prominently. I don't think they hamper good
books from being published. What they can do, however, is reduce a
person's sense of just how wonderful a good children's book can
be.''

HOW DO TREES STAY GREEN WHEN IT DOESN'T RAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do trees stay so green during drought, while grass goes
dormant and flowers wilt?
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's every root for himself out there when water gets scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper, wider roots of a tree can find water in places where
the shallower, narrower roots of grass and other small plants can't
reach. Trees are powerful engines at drawing water out of the soil,
which gives them advantages when things get dry. A decent size tree
can move as much as 1,000 gallons of water a day from the soil, all
the way up the trunk and out the leaves. To do this heavy H2O
lifting, they use a sophisticated suction system that works much
like a straw. On the bottom of the leaves of all green plants,
including trees, are little pores called stomata. These tiny holes,
which you can see with just a magnifying glass, breath in carbon
dioxide to use in photosynthesis. But they give off water vapor. In
other words, they sweat. When a water molecule escapes from a stoma
on a tree leaf, it pulls on the next water molecule inside the leaf
that it's attached to. That molecule pulls the H2O further inside
the leaf . . . and on and on, creating a giant suction system that
stretches down the trunk and into the roots and literally out into
the soil. Trees actually draw water up like a straw.
</P>
<P>
   Trees also get help in extending their reach from another whole
organism, called mycorrhizae, which weave their fine fibers in and
among the fine tips of the tree roots. The tree supplies the fungus
with carbon, and the fungus spreads way beyond the roots to collect
water and bring it back to the tree. Other plants get fungal help,
but not as much.
</P>
<P>
   Roots grow preferentially, depending on where they find water. A
tree will grow more roots where it finds moisture, than it will in
places where the first exploratory roots find things too dry. In
soil where tree and grass roots intermingle, tree roots usually
win.
</P>
<P>
   In dry conditions you might even see yellow or brown lines in
your grass. That's where tree roots are outcompeting grass roots
for the available water. In some places, like golf courses or those
maniacally manicured suburban lawns, the grass is so healthy, with
roots so thick, that it can actually outcompete tree roots for
water.
</P>
<P>
   During droughts, many plants close their stomata by directing
more water into guard cells that circle the pores. The guard cells
swell, squeezing the stomata closed. Some plants can do this in
just a few minutes when things get dry.
</P>
<P>
   But that comes at a price. Remember, the stomata are the way the
trees take in the CO2 they need to photosynthesize and provide the
plant with energy. If they close their pores to avoid water loss,
they shut off their ability to feed themselves and growth is
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   When grass has to close its stomata for a long stretch, it
responds by going dormant, sending its nutrients to the roots to
wait for water.
</P>
<P>
   Closing stomata also makes plants less able to produce the
defensive molecules that fight disease or insects.
</P>

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When I first heard about Louisiana's plan to
require kindergarten through fifth grade public school students to
call their teachers ``Sir'' or ``Ma'am'' _ and put courtesy titles
before the adults' names _ I thought it was an OK idea but no big
deal. I agreed with the bill's sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Don
Cravins, who figured: ``We're not trying to say this is the answer
to discipline, but what do we have to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Then I started thinking: The whole nation really does have a
respect problem. Not just with kids in public schools, but with
most people. In most places.
</P>
<P>
   Given that California is the most populous state _ and the
leader in lifestyle legislation _ what good might come from a
mandated injection of that uncommon practice, ``common courtesy''?
How far might a law (or five) similar to Louisiana's move us toward
being a kinder, gentler, more respectful California?
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few ideas for the California Legislature to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding on the Louisiana law, every person who works in or
comes to a public building _ not just school kids _ would be
required to address everybody else as ``Sir'' or ``Ma'am'' and by
the appropriate courtesy title: Mr., Ms. or, if requested, Miss or
Mrs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Because California already requires smokers to step outside
restaurants and bars if they want to light up, how about a
companion law that treats cell phones the same as cigarettes? You
want to blab on one _ you gotta take it outside.
</P>
<P>
   No one (yet) has proved that cell phones cause cancer, but their
use at a nearby table definitely interferes with proper digestion.
Because most people who use cell phones seem compelled to shout
into them, they also raise anxiety and stress levels.
</P>
<P>
   More important, from their loud tweetering ringers to the way
they leave the companions of their users ignored and staring
blankly into space, cell phones are rude.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even though sport utility vehicles are gas guzzlers and
hazardous to the safety of people who drive ordinary-size cars,
SUVs proliferate on California freeways, country roads and urban
streets. One of the rudest aspects of them is that they block the
view of traffic (and changing traffic lights) from smaller cars.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice to have a law requiring SUV drivers to roll
down their windows and give periodic traffic reports to the people
behind them? The Department of Motor Vehicles might even work out a
simple hand signal code covering the five most common traffic
conditions. (A raised middle finger would not be included.)
</P>
<P>
   _ In a related matter, imagine how far it might go toward
restoring civility if we passed a law that made it illegal not to
let at least one waiting vehicle into street traffic or a freeway
on-ramp line.
</P>
<P>
   The mean, insulting practice of gazing dead ahead, pretending
you don't see a pleading driver, is not only disrespectful, it
contributes to road rage. To paraphrase the California almond
growers, all we ask is one car a commute.
</P>
<P>
   (As an appendix, I suggest jail for drivers who ``forget'' to
signal for a left turn or who blast a horn at someone who _ signal
twinking _ is making a legal left.)
</P>
<P>
   _ My last proposal is to put teeth (and money for cops) into a
law that's already on the books of California's cities and towns.
Everyday it is broken; everyday civilization gets dissed in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Make it a three-strikes felony not to pick up after your dog.
</P>
<P>
   You want disrespect? There is no more pungent an example than a
pile of what used to be Kibbles'n'Bits on your doorstep, in your
driveway or at the base of your struggling sapling amongst the
impatiens and pansies.
</P>
<P>
   Any other suggestions?

 ISLAND FALLS, Maine: ... even scientists.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rising backlash has prompted some food processors, who buy
most of the genetically modified crops, to distance themselves from
the new products. McCain Foods USA, the world's biggest buyer of
potatoes, requires growers to declare if they are using genetically
modified potatoes, effectively discouraging them from using
Monsanto's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear at all where this will shake out in terms of
consumer reaction, so, from a business perspective, you have to be
able to respond,'' said Frank Van Schaayck, head of the potato
group at McCain Foods USA.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in the middle are the farmers who flocked to the new seeds
in the first place. ``We're getting beaten to death on this,'' said
Shur, who grows almost exclusively for Monsanto's potato-growing
subsidiary, NatureMark.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the rise of genetically modified foods simply applies
the tools of modern genetics to something farmers have done for
centuries: cross-breeding produce and animals to create better
products. Centuries of cross-breeding have turned the pint-sized,
coarse Mexican wild corn into the big, juicy ears popular at
cookouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-powered computers and other tools that allow
geneticists to move genes from one organism to another speed the
process ten-fold or more. They also dramatically enlarge breeding
possibilities by allowing lab technicians to ``cross'' almost any
two species. Scientists have even inserted flounder genes into
tomatoes to prevent freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The initial search for commercially viable foods was frustrating
and costly. The first effort, Calgene's Flavr Savr tomato, flopped,
largely because consumers were unwilling to pay more for it. And
the overwhelming majority of experiments never got to the
commercial stage; Shur grew thousands of lines of potatoes on his
Maine farm for Monsanto to develop a handful of promising
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``As precise as the science sounds, a lot of what gets produced
. . . is not of the right quality. It's junk,'' said Robert
Bernatzky, plant geneticist at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers finally came up with two hit genes, both taken
from bacteria. One caused plants to secrete the natural pesticide
Bt. The other made plants immune to products such as Monsanto's
Round Up herbicide, allowing farmers to spray for weeds without
killing their crop.
</P>
<P>
   These two genes, inserted into corn and soybeans, triggered what
Clive James, head of the nonprofit International Service for the
Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications, calls ``one of the fastest
adoptions of technology I've ever seen.'' An estimated 60 percent
of the soy acres, 50 percent of the cotton, and 35 percent of the
corn are planted in genetically altered seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough encouraged authorities in developing nations,
who see the new crops as a way to feed a world population expected
to top 6 billion this year. Former president Carter, whose
nonprofit foundation helps small farmers in Africa, was especially
pleased at the Round Up-resistant soy and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it nice to have a broad leaf plant . . . that you can
put in a row, and after it comes up, spray the field and kill the
weeds, but not the plants?'' he asked in a 1998 speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Europeans, whose faith in food safety was shaken by the
``mad cow disease'' outbreak in 1997 and other scandals, never went
along with the euphoria. Many perceived the new crops as dangerous
and unnecessary, and the British tabloid press took to calling them
``Frankenfoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue burst into the American conscience in a big way this
spring when the science journal Nature published a Cornell
University study showing that almost half the monarch butterflies
who fed on the pollen from Bt corn died. Monsanto criticized the
study as unrealistic, but researchers at Iowa State University got
similar results using different methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Bt crops kill monarch butterflies is an
unintended consequence,'' Iowa State bioethicist Gary Comstock told
the local newspaper. ``People want to know what the full
consequences to the environment will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, reports have increasingly focused on scientific
misgivings about genetically engineered crops. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --University of Chicago researchers are concerned that
genetically engineered crops could cross-breed with weeds, creating
``super weeds'' that have genes making them immune to Round Up or
other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   --The EPA is hosting workshops around the United States on how
to prevent the Bt crops from creating strains of insects that are
immune to the toxic effects of Bt. Such mutants would then be free
to munch on any crops that count on Bt for protection.
</P>
<P>
   --Surprisingly, researchers have found that key genetically
altered crops do not increase yields. Round Up-resistant soybeans
may reduce chemical use, costs, and difficulties to the farmers,
but Edward Oplinger of the University of Wisconsin at Madison found
that they produced 4 percent smaller yields than conventional
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Industry defenders say the concerns are legitimate, but not
cause for alarm. They represent problems of the early days of an
industry that is refining its products. Potato farmer Shur admits
that the genetically altered potatoes sold now are only modest
improvements, but he hopes that some experimental crops on his land
may represent a bigger breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hopeful that we don't throw the baby out with the
bathwater,'' said Everett Thomas, director of the New York-based
Miner Institute, which field tests genetically altered products.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the 1990s may be remembered as the start of
something terrible. Said Ellen Taggart of the grass-roots group
Rural Vermont, ``We're manipulating the basis for life and creating
a new form of pollution, biological pollution.''

 UNDATED: ... Friday annd Sunday.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all, it would be a bit difficult to defend a strategy that
doesn't include the man who is fresh off his sixth Wimbledon
triumph in seven years, a 20th-century record that enabled Sampras
to tie Australian Roy Emerson's all-time mark of 12 singles
championships in Grand Slam events. You don't sit out a guy who has
spent 270 weeks of his life ranked as the No. 1 player in the
world, a feat equaled only by Ivan Lendl.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that guy is no longer No. 1. One of the great ironies of
the year _ and one of the most emphatic statements about Sampras's
newfound priorities _ is that his Wimbledon watershed also marked
the end of his reign atop the computer rankings. Because of his
indifferent performance in 1999 _ nary a title before his
grass-court triumphs at Queen's Club and the All England Club _ and
because the resurrected Andre Agassi has been on a roll highlighted
by his French Open victory, Sampras has fallen to No. 3, behind
Agassi and Rafter, despite beating his longtime American nemesis in
the Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't seem to bother Sampras in the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm letting the ranking go this year,'' he
says. ``But I'm not willing to play 20 tournaments or 25. So
playing Davis Cup is a huge occasion. I think I realized that it is
going to be tough for me to finish No. 1 this year, and not playing
much this year, especially the first four or five months, gave me
some time to step back and look at what I wanted to do the next
three or four years. I mean, it's hard to do both, to stay No. 1
and play Davis Cup. I've done it before, and it's very taxing, and
I've dug myself a very big hole to finish No. 1 this year. I feel
like the year to really do it was last year, to try to break the
record, and this year if it happens, it happens. I'm not going to
play six straight weeks again for my ranking and really go through
the misery I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   That point was reinforced in Birmingham, via Tampa TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely inspired me,'' says Sampras. ``You look at the
atmosphere. Those are the type of situations I want to be in for
the next three or four years. I mean, that's motivation right
there, versus playing some of those other events. It's not about
ranking; it's about handling the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gullikson believes Sampras's Davis Cup decision lifted
a burden from him by silencing those who questioned his motives,
thus indirectly reviving his individual career as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he's in a very good place,'' says the captain.
``I think it takes some of the pressure off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras maintains otherwise, saying his prodigal return to the
Davis Cup had no bearing on his Wimbledon mastery. Besides, he
points out with some justification, he's gotten a bum rap in terms
of his national commitment _ he's played five years of Cup
competition, starting in 1991, and has helped the Americans to two
titles and two runner-up finishes. And while he'd taken a pass
since 1997, he never said it was forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought my Davis Cup career was going to be over,'' he
says. ``I've always said I that I see myself playing some more
Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that Birmingham expedited his timetable, and
despite his claims to the contrary, something has settled him down
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the stage of his career where he wants to play at the
right times, be out there when he wants to be,'' says Annacone.
``He's falling prey less to chasing No. 1. In the long run, that's
healthier for him. He's got an even more even-balanced
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something for a player who, until late last year,
always was known for his serenity as much as his superiority.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Palos Verdes, Calif., the son of Sam, an
aeronautical engineer, and Georgia Sampras, Pete never was pushed
into tennis. But he was prodigious at it. He began playing at age
7, and he used to watch tapes of Rod Laver, the only man ever to
sweep the Grand Slam events _ the US, Australian, and French opens
and Wimbledon _ in two different years. His most influential early
teacher was Dr. Pete Fisher, a Los Angeles pediatrician and tennis
guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me how to play,'' says Sampras. ``From a baseliner
with a two-handed backhand, he basically changed my game to a
one-handed serve-and-volleyer.''
</P>
<P>
   That association culminated in the first of Sampras's four US
Open crowns in 1990, when he was barely 19, but it wasn't until Tim
Gullikson came along that Sampras became a consistent champion. The
components were in place _ the unparalleled serve, especially the
second; the devastating forehand; the pure athleticism; the
evolving serve-and-volley game; the savvy defensive tactics. Tim
Gullikson gave him something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped him become a better competitor,'' says Tom
Gullikson. ``He was a great ball striker, but every day you're
going to strike the ball differently. Great ball strikers tend to
rely on how they hit the ball. If it's not going well, they expect
to lose. Tim taught him how to win without his best stuff. He
taught him that when the shots aren't falling in, you've got to put
your blue collar on and go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership yielded Sampras's first two Wimbledon titles,
another US Open, and the first of his two Australians. When Tim
took ill at the 1995 Australian Open and was diagnosed with four
inoperable brain tumors, Sampras wept openly on the court in
Melbourne; he now sits on the board of the Tim and Tom Gullikson
Foundation, which assists brain cancer patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing seemed to rattle him for the long term. ``He has
tremendous self-belief, a quiet confidence,'' says Tom Gullikson.
``He's very calm and cool. He doesn't go around bragging about how
great he is.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the things that most impresses Annacone, with whom
Sampras hasn't missed a beat since they teamed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a pretty even-balanced mental approach,'' says
Annacone. ``Pete never does cartwheels down the hall. If he wins,
he doesn't get overly excited. If he loses, he doesn't slit his
wrists. That's why he's able to be so consistent. He's able to look
at things in terms of the long-term picture.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost sight of it for a while, but the Davis Cup helped bring
it back in focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he still wants more (Grand Slam titles),'' says Tom
Gullikson. ``He's an unfinished painting. There are still a few
more strokes to be put on the canvas. Davis Cup can help. It's four
weeks (a year) of being on a team, eating together, hanging out
together.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing because you want to. That's No. 1 now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Courier walks into his neighborhood grocery in Orlando,
Fla., one day in April, and something is different _ ``a big
surprise,'' he says. ``The bag boy looks at me and says, `You're
that Davis Cup guy!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same Courier who has banked four major titles _
matched pairs of French and Australian opens _ stood atop his world
at No. 1, and is a cinch someday for a niche at the International
Tennis Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says, ``but nobody ever took any notice of me in
that store until after Birmingham. The bag boy. I don't think he
knew my name, but that recognition was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for himself. Courier gets enough of that. But for the game
he loves, and that he senses has slipped in the public
consciousness in his country over recent years. ``Birmingham, the
Davis Cup, had a crossover effect to touch people beyond the usual
tennis fans. That bag boy made me feel really good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   An April weekend in Birmingham, England, unexpectedly was the
springboard for the rugged redheaded Courier to alight as an
American sporting hero, via ESPN, surpassing in his own trade even
Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. They had carried their wallets,
disdaining invitations. Courier had lugged the USA. Jingoism still
counted.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the derisively regarded scrubs, Courier and Todd
Martin, was choice. Not lost in lamentation (like everybody else)
over the absence of the elite Sampras and Agassi, Martin and
Courier were underdogs with a rabid bite, gnashing the British
bubble, 3-2. Martin whipped Greg Rusedski in four, and Courier hung
on tenaciously through roller coaster rides of five sets over Tim
Henman and Rusedski. The excruciating closer over Rusedski _ 6-4,
6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 1-6, 8-6 _ kept couchies rapt and wrapped into it
for almost four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Australia awaited the victor, and Courier made sure the US was
on the way to Boston to keep that semifinal date with its most
esteemed and ferocious adversary. This is Bean Summer for Courier,
booked to play a Longwood encore at the US Pro the last week of
next month.
</P>
<P>
   James Spencer Courier, of the Dade City, Fla., Couriers, is a
very rare starboard-wing flapping bird in the Davis Cup aviary that
dates back to 1900 and Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline, Mass. He
returns like a swallow to Capistrano to the business of making
Americans feel good about their team Friday afternoon when he takes
on Australia in the person of Patrick Rafter. The scene is
historically sweet: Longwood again where a trust-funded Harvard lad
named Dwight Davis anteed his $1,000 pot _ a grandiosely crafted
silver basin _ into the international sporting game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis himself, whose impetus started it all, played and won the
opening match of the newly begun team competition in which the US
beat Britain, 3-0, and has spread like cell phones across the
globe, from the original two entries to 129 this year. He played in
one more series, the 3-2 victory over Britain in 1902. Then the
gentleman amateur moved on at 23 to the rest of his life as
philanthropist and civic-minded citizen, continuing to take an
interest in the Cup's ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Courier, 29 Aug. 17, isn't ready for the rest of his life yet,
although it seemed he might be as his output shrank and ranking
expanded in the wrong direction from No. 1 in 1992 to a low of No.
117 nine months ago. He continues to take an interest in the
roaming Cup, too, an undertaking where his heartbeat beats whatever
Blinky, the ATP computer, has to say about him, No. 54 at
Birmingham, No. 41 today and rising.
</P>
<P>
   Having campaigned since 1991, fought to possess the prize at
home, and abroad in such locales as Mexico, The Netherlands,
Russia, India, England, Brazil, Courier has become a good luck
charm par excellence, more highly valued by US captain Tom
Gullikson and his predecessor, Tom Gorman, than a genie.
</P>
<P>
   This is his amazing, high-flying distinction setting Courier
apart from the crowd of Americans before him: A team with Courier
in the starting lineup never has lost. Thirteen engagements, 13
won, including two Cups. He's a two-legged talisman, a rabbit's
foot in sneakers, a forehanding four-leaf clover, an aggressive
amulet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately there isn't a racket of wood to knock on when this
is discussed, and certainly the two Aussies he'll face, Rafter and
the Boy Buzzbomb, 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, are determined to
make 13 a very unlucky number.
</P>
<P>
   No other compatriot has come close to that kind of winning
streak. The last notable was the illustrious Aussie, Rod Laver,
whose five-year presence between 1959 and 1973 covered 11 team
victories and five Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Courier says with a smile, ``we'd better give Brad
Gilbert a lot of credit here for the 3-2 win in my debut. Mexico
City in 1991. Otherwise it was a nightmare. I couldn't handle the
altitude, the way the balls flew, and the rookie pressure. Luis
Herrera and Leonardo Lavalle both beat me. But Gilbert beat Lavalle
to make it 1-1 and Robert (Seguso) and Ken (Flach) were automatics
in the doubles in those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up, 2-1, and there I was, choking in the dressing
room, as Brad struggled against Herrera. He came through, finally,
in five sets. I was a nervous wreck. Lavalle beat me in the last
match, but it didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say maybe Courier was an intangible force in that
one.
</P>
<P>
   He is an intangible force, says Gullikson. ``The team can feel
Jim's energy and competitiveness,'' he says. But a very tangible
one, too. ``He told me we'd beat the Brits and made us believers,''
adds Gullikson. ``Naturally he says we'll beat the Aussies, too.''

FOR A MISSING KOSOVO LEADER, LUSTER IS LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Serbs are gone, NATO is here and
hundreds of thousands of traumatized and homeless refugees have
returned to their native cities and villages. So where, Kosovars
wonder, is their spiritual and political leader, Ibrahim Rugova?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that Rugova, long the unofficial president
of what Albanians call ``Kosova,'' and a professed Mahatma Gandhi
character fighting for Kosovar independence, is in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The longer answer contains its own, serious questions for the
bespectacled, diminutive leader: Why did he not attend funerals for
dead soldiers in the Kosovo Liberation Army? Why did he meet with,
and even share a handshake with, the hated Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, during the bombing?
</P>
<P>
   And most critically, ethnic Albanians want to know why Rugova
isn't here, sharing misery with his fellow Kosovars, giving them
leadership at a time when Kosovo is struggling to recover from
three months of NATO bombing and the Serbs' rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I supported Rugova, but not any more. I'm not thinking about
Rugova now,'' Naser Gjuka, a 40-year-old textiles worker said from
Pec, in western Kosovo. ``He didn't visit us in Albania'' at the
refugee camps there, ``and he even went to Macedonia. Everybody
visited us, and Rugova didn't come,'' Gjuka complained.
</P>
<P>
   That Rugova did not visit Albania, which bore the heaviest
refugee burden, astonished refugees and officials. Macedonia,
meanwhile, was criticized by aid workers and refugees for its poor
treatment of refugees, including keeping them penned within a
barbed-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova reportedly is planning on coming back to Kosovo this
week, but locals aren't holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not up to his duties as a leader,'' said Visar Reka, a
spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``He lost his credibility
a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army has a vested interest in undermining
Rugova's credibility. Now that the Serb military forces are gone,
the battle for power in Kosovo will be mainly between Rugova's
camp, the political party called the Democratic League of Kosovo,
and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla group that sprung up
precisely because the Democratic League of Kosovo was making no
progress toward independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is supposed to remain part of Serbia and Yugoslavia for
at least three years, when a referendum will determine Kosovo's
future. However, there will be earlier elections to form an interim
government for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Either camp faces a huge challenge in running Kosovo, whose
people have little experience of democratic self-rule. The villages
are very clannish societies, with the male head of household making
all decisions for the extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, an intellectual who has been the point man for
sympathetic foreign diplomats and interest groups, has a nostalgic,
emotional appeal to some Kosovars, who believe he met with
Milosevic only under duress, and stays away now because he fears a
personal attack, perhaps even from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But the force, headed by 29-year-old Hashim Thaqi, got a jump on
filling the power vacuum created when Serb-installed mayors fled
Kosovo after the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army acted quickly and efficiently, taking
over such civil functions as aid delivery to refugees and traffic
control.
</P>
<P>
   Much of its heavy presence has been curbed by international
forces who are trying to hold the force to its agreement to disarm
and shed their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the Kosovo Liberation Army runs much of Kosovo
now. In Pec, the former Democratic League mayor, whom Albanians
chose in elections not approved by the Serbs, was shocked to find
out, after he returned to his home, that an official installed by
the Kosovo Liberation Army had replaced him as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I returned with the people,'' and then ``I heard on TV and
radio'' that a new mayor had been named, said Aver Husaj, 40.
``They can't select a mayor without a vote. The people chose me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, meanwhile, hasn't returned to battle for his position in
Kosovo politics. Thaqi threatened to cut Rugova out of the Kosovo
interim government if Rugova had not returned by last week, but ``I
don't think Mr. Thaqi will insist,'' Reka said. ``The door is
open.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's welcome of Rugova as a leader is in greater
question. Rugova, with his quiet manner and ubiquitous ascot scarf,
is still supported here by many Albanians, who are disappointed
with his recent behavior but love the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Rugova wanted to end the struggle with peace, without
fighting. He is just like Gandhi,'' said Arif Basha, 55, of Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love him no matter where he is in the world,'' added Fuat
Gjuka, 36. ``But we didn't like it when he went to Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, Rugova may be too late. ``It's not good that's
he's not with us,'' said Agim Nashi, 32, of Djakovica. ``He needs
to lead us. In the future, I don't know what will happen with
him.''

MANY OPPOSE CANADIAN PLAN TO BURN PLUTONIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ It seemed a high-minded if impetuous offer, the sort of
sweeping international gesture for which Canada has become famous.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1996 disarmament summit in Moscow, Canada's prime minister,
Jean Chretien, volunteered his country's nuclear reactors for the
task of turning ``nuclear swords into plowshares'' by destroying
plutonium from Russian and American nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But as the country prepares for its first ``test burn'' of
weapons-grade plutonium, as early as this month, the government is
facing intense opposition, not only from environmentalists but also
from peace activists, mainstream politicians, transportation
officials, small-town mayors, and even a national association of
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is Canada risking its own environment?'' demanded Alexa
McDonough, who represents a Nova Scotia district in Canada's
Parliament. ``Why should Canada be cleaning up the nuclear mess
made by Americans and Russians?''
</P>
<P>
   At best, scoffers say, Canada's scheme to transform warheads
into electricity is a symbolic exercise that will barely dent
nuclear weapons stockpiles, but might very well turn Canada into a
target for terrorists or agents of renegade regimes seeking to
steal plutonium to make their own nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, harsher critics say, the proposal represents a cynical
ploy by Ottawa to rejuvenate Canada's ailing nuclear power industry
by using weapons plutonium as fuel, thereby justifying the
continued existence of trouble-prone reactors, most of them in
Ontario, that are facing possible closure.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar is surprising given that Canadians are usually quick
to rally around efforts to make the world a safer place, and take
real pride in their country's reputation as a superpower in the
push for peace. It was Canada that created the concept of United
Nations peacekeeping forces, and that more recently led the crusade
for an international ban on land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who is thought to have been the
``almost'' contender for the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize because of his
leadership in the land mine effort, has sought to make pursuit of
peace the defining goal of Canada's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Axworthy's own image is taking a drubbing on the plutonium
issue, as many Canadians are deeply suspicious of a government plan
still veiled in secrecy. Part of the suspicion is grounded in the
fact that the proposal is also championed by the country's nuclear
power industry.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy insists that Canada is determined to test the
feasibility of using weapons plutonium as nuclear fuel in an
experimental burn at the Chalk River reactor in Ontario, as early
as this month. He said Canada is going ahead, at least with the
test phase, because it wants ``to be a prime leader in nuclear
disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that Canada has a moral duty to do whatever it can to
help rid the world of nuclear weapons. It is irrelevant, he says,
that the plutonium is a product of the nuclear arms race between
the United States and the former Soviet Union, a race Canada
resolutely refused to join despite its close military alliance with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a dangerous nuclear world, and we all share
responsibility,'' Axworthy said. ``We have to be very careful that
nuclear materials do not end up in the wrong hands, that they don't
get proliferated. One way . . . is to burn them.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the government in Ottawa is less interested in
promoting world peace than in propping up Canada's tottering
nuclear industry, which is already heavily subsidized. In recent
years, a third of Canada's 21 reactors have been shuttered because
of concerns over safety, cost overruns, or spectacular
mismanagement, including technicians drunk on the job.
</P>
<P>
   For Ontario Hydro _ North America's largest utility and operator
of all but two of Canada's nuclear-powered power plants _ and the
federally owned corporation Atomic Energy Canada Ltd., the
plutonium-to-fuel plan might prove a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   Some nuclear scientists believe that so-called mixed-oxide, or
MOX, fuel bundles, made from weapons plutonium and uranium oxide,
will make an ideal fuel for Canada's unique Candu reactors, which
the country vigorously seeks to sell abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from producing power, the public relations spinoff could
be enormous, with a much-maligned industry suddenly able to boast
of converting weapons of doom into electricity for the baby-room
night lights, coffee machines, and personal computers of
peace-loving Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect, almost as much as the practical issues of using
warheads for fuel, has opponents of the nuclear power industry in a
dither.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a red herring concocted by Canada's nuclear mafia,''
said Steve Shallhorn, the Canadian campaign director for
Greenpeace. ``This is about protecting the nuclear industry, not
containing risks posed by surplus plutonium.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace is joined by opponents that include some disarmament
specialists as well as professional firefighters and alarmed
citizens along potential routes that the plutonium will travel to
reach Ontario's reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Robinson, program associate at the Institute of Peace and
Conflict Studies in Waterloo, Ontario, said: ``This is going down
the wrong path. This is not a serious step toward nuclear
disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean McManus, Canadian director for the International
Association of Fire Fighters, said: ``We fear for the public safety
in the event of an accident involving plutonium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bradley, mayor of Sarnia, Ontario, on the Michigan border
along the most likely trucking route of the plutonium for this
summer's test burn, said: ``Why is Canada taking on this risk?
Didn't the US and Russia create these huge stockpiles? Now they
want other countries to clean the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has divided disarmament experts and peace activists,
and has its proponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a perfect solution, but this is not a perfect
world,'' said Tariq Rauf, an arms control specialist at
California's Monterey Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticisms are valid, the concerns are real, but at the
end of the day we still have warheads. Sanity dictates we should
make them less dangerous,'' Rauf said. ``For all the controversy,
this is still a workable plan for turning nuclear warheads into a
material that could not so easily be converted to weapons. Canada's
plan would reduce the risk of nuclear war in a real way.''
</P>
<P>
   Plutonium, a manmade element produced from uranium, is tricky
stuff. Radiation from plutonium can be safely blocked by thin
barriers; even a paper shield is sufficient for small amounts. But
a microscopic speck, if inhaled, is not only sufficient but almost
certain to cause cancer _ making it a nightmare in the event of a
bad accident, although special protective transport canisters have
been designed to withstand major crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But the true horror of the stuff is that just a few pounds is
sufficient to make a powerful nuclear device, even without
extensive atomic facilities. Indeed, the greatest risk of
transporting plutonium, according to most experts, is that it might
be seized by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   For security reasons, no date has been announced for the Chalk
River test burn. But it is expected to occur in the next few
months, after the first batch of plutonium arrives overland from
the United States nuclear weapons facility in Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The initial test at Chalk River will involve minuscule amounts
of plutonium, just 300 grams encapsulated in mixed-oxide fuel.
Canada's long-range vision, however, is to use 100 tons of weapons
plutonium, 50 each from the United States and Russia, over 20 years
as fuel for Ontario Hydro's Bruce Nuclear Power Station, near Port
Elgin on Lake Huron. The Chalk River research reactor lies 90 miles
northwest of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The plutonium would be converted into mixed oxide fuel bundles
in the United States and Russia before shipment to Canada. Critics
complain that even after burning in nuclear reactors, MOX fuel
still contains a form of plutonium that might be retrieved and
converted back to weapons grade, although with great difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Under treaties, the United States and Russia are to dismantle
40,000 warheads over the next several years, and dispose of tons of
plutonium. The weapons material that might be burned in Canadian
reactors would come from existing stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian proposal has generated little controversy in the
United States, even though the plutonium fuel bundle shipments
would have to be trucked through a number of American states. The
first samples of fuel will come from New Mexico, but long-range
plans call for a fuel fabrication plant in South Carolina to mix
surplus plutonium with depleted uranium oxides.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian plutonium would come from the Bochvar nuclear
laboratories near Moscow, and probably would travel to Canada in
cargo ships, entering the country through Halifax or Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   If the test burn is successful, Canada has pledged to hold
hearings and conduct rigorous environmental and safety reviews.
</P>
<P>
   No final decision will be made until calculation is made on
environment, safety, transportation, and the availability of a user
reactor, Axworthy said.

ROLE OF RIGHTS DEBATED IN US KOSOVO DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a crowning moment in President Clinton's campaign to
convince Americans that it was right for NATO to bomb Yugoslavia to
stop ethnic persecution in that country's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Elie Wiesel, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and a premier
chronicler of the Holocaust, stood with the president in the East
Room of the White House, praising the decision to go to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time the world was not silent,'' Wiesel said as he put
the air attacks launched three weeks earlier on the top shelf of
good things that have happened in the 20th century, alongside the
defeat of Nazism, the collapse of communism, and the rebirth of
Israel. ``This time we respond. This time we intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   How different from the time in 1993, at his speech at the
opening of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, when Wiesel challenged
Clinton to do something about the flames of ethnic hatred then
consuming Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year before NATO began bombing and helped put an end to
the war; tens of thousands of Bosnians died in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Many more people were killed in Bosnia and Rwanda than in
Kosovo. More were driven from their homes as part of Turkey's
efforts to suppress its Kurdish minority. So why did Clinton go to
war over Kosovo, claiming that the abuses of human rights occurring
there could not be ignored or allowed to continue?
</P>
<P>
   For Wiesel, the answer is simple: Guilty conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue the real motivation had little to do with human
rights, and much to do with the geopolitical interests of the
United States and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acted because we did not act in Bosnia, or in Rwanda, for
that matter,'' Wiesel said in a telephone interview last week.
``Our leaders . . . know they could have saved so many lives. When
I speak to them, I can feel that they feel they should have done
this earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the other end of the spectrum of analysis, there's Noam
Chomsky, an MIT linguistics professor widely known for his
critiques of US policy. Chomsky said assertions by Clinton and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain that they were motivated by
moral outrage at ethnic persecutions were ``absolutely absurd,''
but the leaders' declarations that they had to protect the
credibility of NATO were believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask your neighborhood Mafia don what credibility means,''
Chomsky said. ``It means if a shopkeeper doesn't pay off, you don't
just collect, you beat him to pulp as a lesson to others. Serbia
was a good target because it is kind of independent, like Cuba.
It's cantankerous, doesn't do what it's told.''
</P>
<P>
   Between those extremes, a wide variety of former government
officials, diplomats, and academic specialists suggest factors such
as the election of new British and French leaders, and the
appointment of a new secretary of state, shifted the balance in the
United States from tepid disapproval of intervention to lukewarm
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``People weren't going to understand the details of the
conflict,'' said Swanee Hunt, who as US ambassador to Austria
helped persuade Clinton to intervene in Bosnia. Clinton ``had to
come in and say it's the right thing to do, the moral thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the reasons why we should not intervene and bomb may be
true,'' she said, ``but there's this other list, slightly longer,
why we should. So you put on a spin, a hype, to motivate the
system, to get past the paralysis, to move.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bosnia was the issue, officials played down or withheld
information from the public because ``to say `these mass murders
are occurring but we don't think we should intervene' was just
impossible,'' Hunt said. It would have stimulated public opinion
against the policy line.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the need to boost public support for intervention
gave the NATO allies an incentive to overestimate or exaggerate
what they told the public, and sometimes to pass along unconfirmed
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the conflict, the United States and NATO
suggested that hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians were dead
or dying. They promoted the idea that the number of refugees and
displaced persons created by the fighting was unprecedented since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   None of it was true.
</P>
<P>
   According to current estimates, fewer than 10,000 people were
killed in Kosovo. In Bosnia, ethnic warfare and persecutions
claimed 250,000 lives, in Rwanda, the toll topped 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   At peak, some estimates of refugees and displaced persons in and
around Kosovo exceeded the ethnic Albanian population of the
province, but that still fell short of the numbers driven from
their homes by ethnic conflict and persecutions in Bosnia and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And once spin mechanisms are activated, they tend to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of damage done by NATO's attacks have been steadily
revised downward from the descriptions of decimation given by
Western spokesmen during the war.
</P>
<P>
   According to journalists and military sources in the region,
only about 12 percent of Yugoslavia's tanks were destroyed, about a
quarter of its armored personnel carriers, about 12 percent of its
artillery, and no significant number of helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs did lose about half their combat aircraft, according
to these estimates, marking a significant shift in the regional
balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Ra'anan, director of Boston University's Institute for the
Study of Conflict, Ideology and Policy, said the posturing about
motive and distortion of fact has created ``a very murky situation
. . . for friends and adversaries for whom it's terriby important
to have a high degree of clarity about when we would act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it was about human rights is to not explain anything,''
Ra'anan said. ``There are 60,000 to 100,000 dead in Chechnya,'' a
Muslim region of the Caucasus that tried to secede from Russia,
``and no one thought of intervening there. Clinton said Yeltsin was
acting like Abraham Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Chomsky said, the long campaign to suppress Turkey's
Kurdish minority ``illustrates that whatever else the bombing of
Kosovo was about, it was not about humanitarian concerns. In
Turkey, within NATO, under the authority of the Council of Europe,
there are atrocities which are comparable in type'' to those
committed in Kosovo, ``and worse in total numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Western governments do not ``have to bomb to stop it,'' he
said. ``All they had to do was stop supporting and supplying the
Turks. It is a major atrocity, a major example of ethnic cleansing,
and the US is actively involved in supporting it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a discomforting point for Wiesel, who said he believes
``our leaders are moral people,'' but who also believes that the
repression of the Kurdish culture and language ``is a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know enough about American policy,'' he said, ``but it
seems that because Turkey is a member of NATO, Turkey is being
treated a bit with kid gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Ceric, the Muslim religious leader in Sarajevo, said he
has no illusions that humanitarian motives drove the policies of
the Western powers in the region, for ``all such illusions have
been killed here. . . . I believe the leaders could not tolerate
Milosevic being so arrogant'' toward NATO. ``They took it
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes, things should be measured by results, not
motives,'' Ceric said. ``If the intervention had been in 1991 or
1992, we would have saved many lives. But this we cannot change.''

TAKING JOURNALISTS TO THE MAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is becoming increasingly clear that changes must be made in
this space. No, this is not my long-awaited (in some quarters)
resignation, but an announcement that henceforth this will be a
wrestling column.
</P>
<P>
   My aim is to be the first newspaper columnist who actually
wrestles the people she writes about. My ultimate goal is to
challenge Martha Stewart to a match. Soon I will be enrolling at
the Killer Kowalski Institute of Professional Wrestling to learn
the basics _ the leg lock, the monkey flip, the drop kick, the
brain buster, the chicken wing, the neckbreaker, etc. _ to prepare
for the day when I will be fit enough to challenge the woman known
in wrestling circles as Martha, Mistress of All She Purveys.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is the hottest thing around. Every week millions of
viewers watch the The World Wide Wrestling Federation matches on
USA Network. Millions more tune in to World Championship Wrestling
on TNT. Last week both networks announced plans to expand their
wrestling programming this fall. Another network, TNN, will be
getting into the act, broadcasting Extreme Championship Wrestling
starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is permeating the culture. Wrestlers are breaking into
politics. Jesse Ventura is governor of Minnesota. Jerry Lawler, the
professional wrestler who pioneered mixed-media wrestling by nearly
breaking comedian Andy Kaufman's neck, last week announced he'll be
running for mayor of Memphis. Clearly it's only a matter of time
before veteran politicians get into professional wrestling.
Journalists can't be left behind. That's why I'm changing the whole
concept of this column.
</P>
<P>
   People are clamoring for wrestling. They can't get enough.
Recent surveys reveal that wrestling is drawing a new breed of fan:
young, affluent, predominantly male but, increasingly, female. This
is much the same ``dream'' demographic newspapers seek to attract.
So why not a News Wrestling Federation (NWF)?
</P>
<P>
   The NWF could give the public a physical manifestation of the
intellectual debates that are always raging in journalistic
circles. Serious wrestling about serious issues. Well, mostly
serious issues. But real issues nonetheless, as opposed to the
phony, trumped-up feuds that are the heart of professional
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   News can be a pretty cotentious business, so wrestling is a
logical step. Editors could put a lofty spin on it, style it as a
kind of noble, gladiatorial combat, as columnists and other
opinion-makers, so-called, square off in the ring against their
subjects, and occasionally against each other. WNF wrestling would
be informative as well as entertaining, with ringside play-by-play
commentary about the match along with expert analysis of the issues
involved. Kind of like CNN's war coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ``Big Bad'' Maureen Dowd of the New York Times hammering
``Nature Boy'' Bill Clinton in print for his wicked ways, then
meeting him in the ring and punishing him with a power slam and a
flying head butt. NWF matches would give media targets a welcome
opportunity to take revenge. Wrestling and the news being what they
are, there'd be re-matches, grudge matches, hate matches that would
go on for years. Bob ``The Hulk'' Ryan against Antoine ``The Punk''
Walker. Alex ``Butter'' Beam vs. John ``The Terminator'' Silber.
And Martha and me, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   I must work hard at my wrestling studies. The Master, Kowalski,
points out that Martha is in fabulous shape from years of tossing
around compost. In his opinion, she is wasting her time being a
corporate phenomenon when she could be the Queen of the Ring.
Meanwhile I am trying to develop a wrestling persona (good guy? bad
guy?) and designing an appropriate costume. How much span is there
in Spandex? I fear I am about to find out.

LIGHTEN UP ON COMPANY STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 47 and earn an annual salary of $52,000. My company's
401(k) plan is managed by Fidelity, and I have $150,000 in the
plan. Of this, $25,000 is in a stable value fund, $7,000 in
Fidelity Puritan, $15,000 in Fidelity U.S. Equity Index, $17,000 in
Fidelity Blue Chip Stock, $20,000 in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock,
$11,000 in Fidelity Diversified International, $30,000 in Sequoia
fund and $25,000 in my company's stock. Other options available
which I do not use are Clipper and Mutual Qualified Z funds. My
contributions amount to $225 a month, all of it going into my
company's stock where the contributions are matched by my employer.
Is my money properly invested and diversified?
</P>
<P>
   G.F., Stephenville, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. Two things tend to bother me. The major one is the fact that
all of your contributions are going into your company's stock. I
very much like the idea of a person owning a piece of his employer,
but when there's a strong incentive to build a sizable position in
a single stock, such as your employer's matching program
represents, there's also a real danger that over time you will find
that stock dominating the portfolio. For most people, that can
represent a real problem of overconcentrating risk. On the other
hand, employer matching programs are usually so attractive that the
intelligent thing to do is amass the stock and calculate that the
value of the employer match outweighs the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Most such plans have provisions that stock thus acquired must be
held for a certain period of time before it can be sold, I suggest
you monitor these rules and your accumulation of your employer's
stock carefully. At the current level, representing only 16 percent
of the total portfolio, there is no problem. But this portion of
the portfolio is getting all of the contributions, and it will soon
enough get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   My general suggestion for such a situation is to try to hold
your position in your company's stock to 30 to 35 percent of your
total portfolio. I suggest this without reference to the prospects
of your particular company, about which you are fairly certain to
know more than me. (And, of course, if you have an opinion that
makes you especially leery of accumulating the stock, you would
probably want to trim your holdings to the minimum allowed while
still retaining the company matching funds.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the portfolio, I have only one major
argument, which I'll bet you can predict. It's that $25,000 loafing
along in the stable value fund. In my opinion, you're simply too
young to have such a position. Even at times such s now, when the
stock market looks fairly scary to me, a person of your age should
simply decide that with your very long period of accumulation and
growth _ perhaps 13 to 18 years _ you will end up well behind in
the long run if you stick with a fixed-income option such as this.
Besides, you already have a toe in the fixed-income market through
your holding in Fidelity Puritan, which maintains about a third of
its portfolio in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   My preference for this money would be in Mutual Qualified Z
fund, which holds a mid-cap value-oriented portfolio. But if you
are uncomfortable with that move, at a minimum I suggest you sell
the stable value position and combine that money with your holdings
in Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't ask, but if you continue saving at your current level
and if you achieve average annual portfolio growth of 10 percent,
you will amass $587,133 by age 60 and $962,721 by age 65. These
calculations don't include the effect of your employer matches,
which I left out since I wasn't sure from your wording whether it
is a dollar-for-dollar match. If it is dollar-for-dollar, the
accumulations would be $656,372 at age 60 and $1,091,455 at age 65,
using the same assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many years ago you advised me to get into Benham Trust GNMA
fund and I have done so, and am adding a small amount periodically.
I am now 80 years old. However, it now seems to me that as it is
now American Century Benham GNMA it is not doing so well. Would you
advise me to drop this and get into another fund?
</P>
<P>
   E.C., Centerville, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Usually when I recommend a Ginnie Mae fund, I warn investors
that they need to take a long-term view of their investment, that
there will invariable be seasons when the net asset value of the
fund falls, reflecting either increases in interest rates or
sometimes only fears that they will rise. The first half of this
year has been one of those times, with almost all GNMA funds in the
red on a year-to-date basis.
</P>
<P>
   American Century Benham GNMA has in fact done better than most,
posting a year-to-date loss of .06 percent. It is true that 1998
was a sub-par year for the fund, but its 6.32 percent total return
for the year wasn't all that far behind the 7.14 percent total
return for Vanguard GNMA, which is widely regarded as the leader in
the category. That slight underperformance wasn't enough to charge
the rating from Monringstar Mutual Funds, which continues to accord
its top five-star rating to American Century Benham GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   In short, I'd stick with it, taking the view that this is simply
one of those predictable bumps, and in the long run you'll get what
attracted you to the fund in the first place _ a solid yield and a
stable principal value.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are desperate for guidance. We are trying to
save for a new house that we'd like to purchase in about six years.
We have saved $6,000, now divided between Vanguard's Balanced Index
and its LifeStrategy Moderate Growth funds. We are adding $150 to
each fund every month to accumulate our down payment. I am very
concerned about our relatively short time frame given the current
instability of the stock market. Have we made a wise choice? Do you
have other suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   L.W., Franklin, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, in theory these two balanced funds are appropriate,
since your time frame is in the intermediate term, although it's
near the bottom of the five-to-10-year intermediate term time
frame. But I'd be just as nervous as you are, and I'd hedge my
bets. I would do it by swapping the LifeStrategy Moderate Growth
position for Vanguard's Short-Term Bond fund, and then directing
all of your monthly contributions to the bond fund. I suggested
swapping the LifeStrategy fund rather than the very similar
Balanced Index offering solely based on the fact that LifeStrategy
Moderate Growth holds about 65 percent stocks, compared to about 58
percent for Balanced Index.
</P>
<P>
   Further, in about three years, when your goal is only about 36
months away, I'd then swap the Balanced Index holding for a
position in Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund, and at that point I
would switch all of the ongoing contributions to the money market
fund. Finally, about one year beforeb your anticipated purpose, I'd
move all the holdings to the money market fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have read your recommendations about putting a child's
college money in the parents' names as opposed to the child's. What
do you recommend if we have not done this in the past? Is it
possible to change? If so, what procedures must be followed, and is
there a penalty for this change?
</P>
<P>
   C.B., Southlake, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. While you're not allowed to take back funds given to a child,
there are a few strategies that perhaps can be used to effect the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Under the typical uniform gift to minors act, the trustee can
use the funds in such an account for a number of expenses other
than education _ medical bills, pre-college education such as
summer schools, tutoring, and so forth. Therefore one tactic which
is sometimes used by parents who have set themselves up as trustees
under a uniform gift to minors act is to use the funds in the UGMA
account to pay for such expenses _ and then to put an identical
amount of money into an account in their own names but earmarked
for the child's education. Other than that, there's not much you
can do _ the gift was a gift and it can't be taken back.

CLINTON'S PALESTINIAN SHOCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a joint press conference with Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak earlier this month, Bill Clinton was asked whether, having
insisted on the right of Kosovo refugees to return home, he would
now insist on the right of Palestinian refugees to go back to their
homes in Israel. This was his answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can accuse me of dodging Middle East questions. I've
been up to my ears and eyeballs in this peace process since the day
I took office. . . . Whether refugees go home depends in part on
how long they've been away and whether they wish to go home. . . .
I would like it if the Palestinian people felt free, and were free,
to live wherever they like, wherever they want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words sent shock waves through Israel. They are bound
to come up when Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, visits
Washington this week. For in asserting that the Palestinians should
be free to settle ``wherever they want to live,'' Clinton would
seem to have embraced the most radical Palestinian claim of all:
that there is a ``right of return'' entitling any Arab who once
lived, or whose ancestor once lived, in the territory that became
Israel to move back and reclaim the land from the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides insisted that Clinton's remarks did not
represent a change in US policy. Even if that is true, it is now
clear where his personal sympathies lie. The president and his
spokesmen repeatedly condemn the building of Jewish settlements;
but he wants Palestinian Arabs _ and there are now 3 million of
them _ ``to live wherever they like.'' The double standard is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a single point on which all Israelis agree, it is
that a Palestinian ``right of return'' would mark the end of the
Jewish state. They are right; that is why it was a central plank of
the Palestine National Covenant, the PLO charter for the
liquidation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians put on a show of repealing that covenant, or at
least its most noxious provisions, last December. But dismembering
Israel remains high on their agenda. Abu Mazen, second-in-command
to Yasser Arafat, demanded last month that Israel withdraw from the
Galilee, the country's northern region. If that came to pass,
Israel would lose Nazareth, Tiberias, and Safed. Meanwhile, senior
Palestinian officials have been calling for the imposition of UN
General Assembly Resolution 181, a 52-year-old plan to partition
what was then called Palestine into two unequal states, a larger
Arab one and a smaller Jewish one.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews accepted 181, though it would have left them with a
tiny, defenseless state. The Arabs rejected it, intending instead _
once the British pulled out Palestine _ to kill the Jews and take
all the land for themselves. In May 1948, the British left and
Israel proclaimed its independence _ and five Arab armies invaded.
Azzam Pasha, secretary-general of the Arab League, announced their
purpose: ``This will be a war of extermination and a momentous
massacre,'' he exulted, ``which will be spoken of like the
Mongolian massacres and the Crusades.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the war that followed, about 650,000 Arabs left
the country. In a few cases, they were expelled by Jewish fighters,
but the great majority left on their own, or at the encouragement
of Arab leaders. Many intended to sit out the fighting and return
once the Jews were destroyed. ``We will smash the country with our
guns and obliterate every place the Jews seek shelter,'' vowed
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said. ``The Arabs should conduct their
wives and children to safe areas until the fighting dies down.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, The Economist would report that ``of the 62,000
Arabs who formerly lived in Haifa not more than 5,000 or 6,000
remained. . . . There is but little doubt that the most potent of
the factors (in their flight) were the announcements made over the
air by the Higher Arab Executive, urging the Arabs to quit.'' All
the while, many Zionist leaders pleaded with the Arabs to stay;
orders were issued for the protection of Arab property and
forbidding troops from burning or demolishing Arab villages.
</P>
<P>
   And so was born the Palestinian refugee problem, a problem
caused entirely by the Arabs themselves. Had they accepted
Resolution 181 in 1947, there would have been no refugees and an
independent Arab state in Palestine would be marking more than half
a century of independence. But they chose war.
</P>
<P>
   By rights the Palestinian refugees should have faded from the
scene decades ago. The world was awash with refugees in the 1940s
(including 750,000 Jewish refugees from the Arab world). The only
ones still living in camps in the 1990s are the Palestinians. All
the other displaced persons eventually settled somewhere and got on
with their lives. The Palestinians didn't _ because their Arab
brethren wouldn't let them. Except for Jordan, no Arab country
welcomed the Palestinians or offered them citizenship. They wanted
the refugee problem left unsolved, a festering sore that could be
exploited as a weapon against Israel. The Arab world kept the
Palestinians in squalor _ and told them the Jews were the cause of
their misery.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton should have said at his press conference is that
the Kosovo refugees cannot be compared with the Palestinians. The
Kosovars were the victims of ``ethnic cleansing''; the Serbs set
out to drive them off their land. But in Israel 50 years ago, it
was the Jews who were threatened with ethnic cleansing; the massed
armies of the Arab world were bent on their extermination. If the
Kosovo refugees hadn't fled, they would have become corpses. If the
Palestinians hadn't fled _ and 160,00 of them didn't _ they would
have become citizens of Israel, the freest state in the Middle
East.

KERRY MAY BE SECOND-GUESSING HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry sits on the sidelines of the presidential
campaign and sometimes wonders why.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry took himself out of the race in February, when Vice
President Al Gore was the clear favorite and former senator Bill
Bradley a blip on the screen. But now, as Gore struggles and
Bradley rakes in millions in contributions, Kerry has suggested to
friends and associates that he may have made a mistake by taking
himself out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry evidently has been second-guessing himself since at least
April, when he began musing out loud about reversing his position.
The junior senator from Massachusetts has made no moves to get into
the race, but he has continued to grumble to associates about
Gore's clumsiness on the campaign trail and Bradley's lack of
pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with those conversations said Kerry has told
his people everything from ``I can't believe there's only two guys
left'' and ``I can't believe Bradley's got a shot'' to ``Should I
get back in?''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kerry said his comments may have been
misinterpreted. At most, he said, he may have whimsically said,
``God, it would be fun to be a part of that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry described himself as having no regrets about being a
spectator. ``I think I made the right decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But during a reunion of his former Senate staff at his
Georgetown home in May, Kerry told some of the 100 people in
attendance that he was not sure he did the right thing by sitting
it out. One former aide said Kerry commented that Gore's campaign
``was not igniting,'' but described the ruminations as ``belly
scratching'' and ``not serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to thoroughly debate all sides of an issue,'' the
former staffer said. ``He's still debating whether it was smart to
do nine debates in the '96 election'' against Governor William F.
Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kerry has begun to offer some help to the vice
president's campaign. He brought John Marttila and Natalie
Wigotsky, his Boston-based political consultants, to meet with Gore
in Washington to talk strategy, according to one Gore campaign
official.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he has provided Gore with data on children and
education, two issues the senator has concentrated on in the Senate
since his reelection. He is expected to endorse Gore some time
before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In his Feb. 26 announcement, Kerry cited the compressed primary
schedule and the need to raise millions of dollars before a single
vote is cast as reasons he would not run.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart loves the battle. My heart loves these issues. My
heart said go out and fight for these things,'' Kerry said at the
time. ``My head said, the day after I make an announcement, I have
to raise an exorbitant amount of money and do it all in 10
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he made that decision, Kerry said in the interview last
week, none of the factors that went into his thinking have changed.
``The fundamental premise of my decision is exactly the same today
as the day I made it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he were in the race, Kerry said, he and Bradley would
probably be fighting over the same donors for the same money and
support. And the one-on-one dynamic that Bradley is enjoying now
would no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in it, Bradley and I would be fighting for the exact
same money, we would have been dividing up that pie and the divided
pie equation over the next ten months doesn't work,'' Kerry said.
``I don't think anything has changed, as you start walking down
that path.''
</P>
<P>
   Marttila has spoken with Kerry twice since the senator's
February announcement. He said Kerry described himself as content.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me he's been steadfast,'' Marttila said. ``He has stuck
with his decision and he has not looked over his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   But that has not kept Kerry from scrutinizing the presidential
field, something he does daily with his Senate staff. Asked to
evaluate the vice president's candidacy, Kerry said he thinks Gore
is ``doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always a lag between candidate improvement and
campaign cohesion and the public awareness or recognition of those
things,'' he said. ``Obviously, he had a slow start and it was a
little bumpy. Now Kosovo is on track and he's declared and the
field is clear, and the campaign in a sense has begun in earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said that means voters are going to begin to listen to
what Gore is saying and to find out who he is. While he noted that
Bradley has done well raising money, Kerry said the former New
Jersey senator soon will begin receiving greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard much of his message, so I'm not clear on what
he's specifically laid out other than race a little bit, and
children. I'm not clear what he's doing about either of them,''
Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own aspirations, Kerry added: ``I'm really, really
comfortable. I'm doing a lot of good stuff.''

MONEY IS NOT THE CAUSE OF CORRUPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did anybody catch the irony in President Clinton's suggestion
that George W. Bush is ``hostile'' to campaign finance reform
because he might decline federal funding for his presidential race?
</P>
<P>
   This is the same President Clinton who turned the White House
into a glorified bed and breakfast to raise campaign cash, who
eagerly accepted contributions from Chinese bagmen, who hosted gun
runners and other unsavory characters at money-swapping parties
that are still being investigated for possible illegalities ...
</P>
<P>
   There's more, but you get the picture. For this money-grubbing
slimeball of a president to raise questions about any candidate's
commitment to campaign finance reform is the height of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   If his audacity weren't so infuriating, it would be downright
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton apparently wants to reform everybody's campaign
financing but his own _ or maybe his wife's. Do you suppose some of
that Chinese money will find its way into Hillary Rodham Clinton's
Senate campaign in New York?
</P>
<P>
   My personal opinion is that Bush should be commended for
seriously entertaining the notion of financing his campaign
entirely with private donations and refusing to raid the taxpayers'
vault. I have never supported the concept of public funding for
political campaigns, and I never will.
</P>
<P>
   If the founders of this country intended for the people to foot
the bill for office-seekers' office-seeking, they would have
provided for it in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, all this ruckus over the financing of political
campaigns is overhyped and overrated. It's another of these
red-herring solutions that politicians and the media are always
dreaming up when confronted with a difficult problem.
</P>
<P>
   If there are shootings, we scream for gun control instead of
dealing with the shooters. If there is drug addiction, we wage war
on drugs and ignore the addicts. If crooked politicians are being
bought and sold with dollar bills, we ignore the crooks and try to
banish dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any time that a human being abuses an inanimate
object nowadays, we demonize the abused object and ignore the
abuser.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-reform crowd keeps saying that when it comes to
politics, money is the root of all evil. If we could get the money
out of the political system, the reformers argue, we could clean up
the system once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that is not only unrealistic but totally misses the point.
If there is political corruption in this country, it's because too
many politicians are corruptible.
</P>
<P>
   Money is the currency of corruption, not the cause of it.
</P>
<P>
   If the reformers could wave a magic wand tomorrow and ban all
cash contributions to political campaigns, then contributors would
start donating something else _ free lunches, let's say. And then
buyable politicians could be bought with free lunches and unbuyable
politicians could not be.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, most of the proposed solutions to the alleged money
problem are academic because they would violate free speech
provisions of the Constitution. The government cannot tell a
candidate how much money to raise, how much to spend, how many ads
to purchase _ unless the government is paying for the candidate's
campaign, of course, which is why Bush doesn't want the
government's money.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, no candidate relishes government control of
campaigns, and neither should voters. Once the government starts
meddling in the most crucial element of democracy _ the electoral
process _ it's merely a matter of time until democracy no longer
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Voters surely deserve more complete, more accessible reporting
of campaign contributions _ ``instant disclosure'' on the Internet
is one of the more intriguing ideas. But we don't need more
campaign finance laws with more unenforceable rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   If we have a problem with political corruption, we need to get
rid of corruptible politicians. The solution won't be found in
Congress; it will be found in the voting booth.

A WARNING ON THE COMING BUDGET-PRIORITY TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- For the most part, news that the president and
congressional leaders are about to start serious talks about
national priorities for the next decade is reason to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, serious talk leading to serious action on the
basic shape of a force as huge as the $1.5 trillion federal
government has almost always had to be bipartisan and collegial.
And that tends to be for the better.
</P>
<P>
   But not now, and certainly not this week. In fact, a grand
budget deal between President Clinton and the Republican Congress,
giving each side the core of what it wants, would run a large risk
of being the worst imaginable outcome for the country, threatening
one of the main pillars of the current prosperity _ a responsible
fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the first topic that each side wants to bring up if
both indeed start talking this week as planned. The Republicans
want to talk about tax cuts, and the president wants to discuss
changing and expanding Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   One side has priorities that, whatever their merits, reduce
revenues substantially; the other has priorities that, whatever
their merits, increase expenditures substantially. The most common
GOP tax-cut dream is worth at least $800 billion over the next
decade; the net cost of the Clinton Medicare package is $374
billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   They are reconcilable, even if pared back, only if the two sides
decide to use a projected operating budget ``surplus'' that
currently exists only as a projection by each side, based on some
of the most crackpot assumptions in the history of federal
budgeting. The current shorthand in politics and journalism, that
they have $1 trillion to fool around with, is nuts.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe this will happen. I particularly can't believe
that Clinton would place at risk one of his most significant
accomplishments _ a fiscal policy that has directly liberated a
trillion dollars or so for investment by the private sector, and a
lowering of interest rates that has freed up even more.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more than enough deal-making talk to raise a red
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news is alarming. Within the Social Security system,
revenues continue to outpace benefits payments, and will continue
to do so for many years, given a decent economy. And there is
almost a bipartisan agreement to use all of whatever surplus there
is only within the system to pay down federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   That's fantastic. It is no substitute for inevitable change, but
down the road this responsible act of walling off Social Security
surpluses will make change vastly less wrenching for future
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The red flag needs to be raised about blank ink beginning to
show up outside Social Security. To say there is roughly $1
trillion to play with over the next 10 years is madness. Here's
why.
</P>
<P>
   When the last, relatively small steps were taken two years ago
to balance the overall budget, Congress and Clinton also agreed to
increase spending on some agreed on priorities like education and
to cut income taxes primarily for working families with children.
</P>
<P>
   To make the numbers work, however, they reintroduced two
dangerous concepts from the crazy, triple-digit-deficit 1980s _ the
rosy scenario and the magic asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the deal makers severely tightened the spending
caps that regulate spending that is subject to annual
appropriations. They then assumed that these ``savings'' they had
made on paper would continue into the future.
</P>
<P>
   This is a slight variation on the fictions used by Ronald Reagan
and Congress starting in 1981. Back then, budgets were ``balanced''
on the assumption of economic performance that everyone knew would
not occur (the rosy scenario) as well as by a spending category
usually marked with an asterisk (savings to be proposed later).
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the rosy scenario involves spending, and the
magic asterisk is the same. That's because not one dime from the
tighter caps has in fact been saved; all the action since the 1997
deal has been in the other direction _ for the military, for
highways, for airports, for farmers. Some $21 billion in add-ons
last year were called ``emergencies'' to dodge the rules, and
another $20 billion-plus has already been approved this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``surplus'' outside Social Security assumes cutting
overall appropriations below this year's level for the upcoming
fiscal year, making further cuts in non-inflated terms for each of
the next two years, and then keeping the caps at no more than the
inflation rate after 2002.
</P>
<P>
   For the year 2000, there isn't a Republican or a Democrat who
believes congressional majorities exist or should exist to pass
bills specifically establishing these caps in the coming weeks. And
yet the ``surplus'' not only assumes it, it assumes caps all the
way through the year 2009 that are lower in uninflated dollars than
the ceilings for the year 2002 that everyone treats as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has at least proposed adjusting the caps
realistically, adding a higher cigarette tax and other changes that
at least constitute an idea. But he has made his proposals to a
dysfunctional Congress under Republican control. The Republican
direction, which both assumes the ``surplus'' for a decade and
seeks nearly a trillion dollars in tax cuts, makes the 1980s look
responsible by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a deal that tries to accommodate the two political
parties could be so dangerous. The alternative _ doing as little as
possible beyond protecting Social Security _ is minimalist, but
preferable.
</P>
<P>
   And that would leave the question of national priorities for the
next decade to the presidential campaign, in the admittedly
quixotic hope that the candidates might discuss the future
specifically and responsibly.

HOWARD GARDNER: THE MASTER OF UNARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Howard Gardner is like the American Civil Liberties
Union: You may disagree with him, but you want him around.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, a Harvard University psychologist and educator, throws
bombs in a field cluttered with bomb throwers. Most of his
colleagues' projectiles flare and sputter without notice. A few
gain intellectual purchase. But the one Gardner tossed 16 years ago
_ his theory of multiple intelligences _ left a crater that is
still changing the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, Gardner trashed the way we measure smarts. He
identified seven different kinds of intelligence rather than the
narrow spectrum of verbal and logical/mathematical skills measured
in standardized tests. In doing so, he sought to unlock the myriad
abilities of children that went unrecognized by the old gauges.
Teachers and parents frustrated by the one-size-fits-all paradigm
showered him with hosannas. Multiple intelligence curriculums
blossomed in schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the debate over Howard Gardner and his ideas continues
unabated, even as he refines and expands the controversial
definition of intelligence that first put him on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the buzz in very important circles,'' says James O.
Freedman, former president of Dartmouth College. ``He has moved the
debate on his terms. He has preempted the field intellectually. It
is against him that you argue now.''
</P>
<P>
   David Riesman, the dean of American sociologists, calls
Gardner's contribution ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Gardner _ who turned 56 July 11 _ drew near universal
support for opening the door to other ways of thinking about
intelligence, the consensus in his favor stopped there. Some
dismissed his ideas as a warm and fuzzy scheme skewed toward
self-esteem rather than the cold, adamantine general intelligence
quotient. Yale psychologist Robert Sternberg dismissed the theory
of multiple intelligences as ``a theory of talents, not one of
intelligences.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of his supporters liked the idea of Howard Gardner
more than the details of his theory. Riesman, for example, buys
virtually none of what Gardner is selling. ``I don't share that
view at all,'' says Riesman about Gardner's theory. ``I have a very
traditional view of intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner added five intelligences to the traditional pair of
linguistic and logical/mathematic: musical, spatial, interpersonal,
intrapersonal, and bodily-kinesthetic. He has since added
naturalist, and is considering a ninth, existential.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of this list is, and should be, subject to
endless argument. ``Bodily-kinesthetic,'' which identifies physical
and athletic ability, brings sharp challenges. Granted, Wayne
Gretsky is a great athlete, for example, but does that make him
intelligent?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, responds Gardner: ``Gretsky uses his body to solve
problems in ways that are valued.'' Horsefeathers, counters Jeffrey
Arnett, a developmental psychologist doing research this year at
the University of Maryland. ``Why call it intelligence? Is there
really a hockey intelligence?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Kagan, a Harvard psychologist and author who supports
Gardner's fundamental message, cautions that societies focus on
their own subsets of skills to determine success. ``In this
culture, our best jobs go to people with strong verbal and math
skills,'' he says. ``Therefore, we can say that it's too bad that
they are not in your preferred set of skills, but you're going to
have to master them if you want a secure future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner agrees. He also stresses that his theory in no way
should lead to a reduction in academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   But psychologists and educators who believe in the efficacy of
the traditional tests claim nonetheless that Gardner's message
subtly undermines standards. ``People wanted to hear this because
it appeals to a certain American sentimentality that everyone is
intelligent,'' says Arnett. ``It's like in Lake Wobegon, where all
the kids are above average.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner is unfazed by such criticism. ``I reject that there is
any such thing as an unmodified intelligence,'' he says. ``There is
no general intelligence that shines no matter where people are or
what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course no one knows if Gardner's list of intelligences will
look right a century from now. It certainly is not the last word on
the subject. Freedman calls it Gardner's ``first draft at saying,
`Here's how to outline people's capacities.' '' The point is,
Gardner came up with a list in the first place. He confronts
questions that daunt others.
</P>
<P>
   His theories flow from his humaneness. Gardner is a mensch. He
formed his theory as a developmental psychologist studying gifted
children and people with learning disabilities. James Traub, a
journalist who specializes in education issues and a Gardner
critic, is not far off of the mark when he writes, ``Gardner is, at
bottom, a moral philosopher; he wants to change the way we measure
human worth.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also a rumpled, color-blind polymath who can talk
seamlessly about the politics of Bill Clinton, the art of Mark
Rothko, the music of Mozart, the dubbing of Italian movies and the
mores of corporate America in a 15-minute riff. And he writes well.
This breadth leavens his scholarship and makes him a dream of a
dinner partner.
</P>
<P>
   Shirttails out, his hair mussed, Gardner moves at warp speed
among the warrens of academia, cognitive psychology and,
increasingly, corporate America, where he consults on subjects like
leadership and creativity. He continues teaching at Harvard's
Graduate School of Education, where he holds an endowed chair in
cognition and education. He remains co-director of Project Zero, a
research group at the graduate school that plumbs how children and
adults learn. He has more books in the works. (All 17 are in print
and many translated into nine languages, according to Ike Williams,
his literary agent.)
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``The Disciplined Mind,'' Gardner argues for
a curriculum of in-depth learning in a limited set of disciplines
rather than what he calls ``the Vanna White'' curriculum pervasive
today where students dash through thickets of untethered facts
without any coherent sense of learning.
</P>
<P>
   Together with psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of the
University of Chicago and William Damon of Stanford University,
Gardner is also pursuing a long-term project called ``Good Work''
that will examine values, creativity, and leadership in six fields:
journalism, genetics, jazz, drama, law, and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner grew up the son of Jewish immigrants in a comfortable
home in Scranton, Pa. He was a serious piano student as a youngster
and went to Harvard, where he graduated summa cum laude. Williams
tells how Gardner was shocked as an undergraduate to receive a
B-plus on a history test. He was so troubled by the score that he
asked a grader to reread his exam. Gardner had replaced the essay
question with one of his own. He wrote: ``A better question is . .
.'' and went on to answer that one. The reader gave him an A.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's interest in better questions led to his recent forays
into corporate America. During his meetings at places like Fidelity
and Pfizer, he prods executives to reexamine their precepts about
how they do their jobs. These appearances speak as much about the
growing corporate interest in him as it does about his unflagging
curiosity in new fields.
</P>
<P>
   At a daylong affair with Fidelity in Boston earlier this year,
for example, Gardner communed with some 40 executives within the
company's Operations and Technology Group of its Personal
Investments and Brokerage arm.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: Gardner watches ``Twelve O'Clock High,'' the World
War II movie starring Gregory Peck about a troubled bomber
squadron, with a room full of suits. He discusses with them the
lessons from the film about leadership, and he limns the varying
styles of Churchill, Gandhi, and Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner holds that successfull leaders tell stories about
themselves and the institutions they run in ways that employees can
understand. These stories often must compete with preexisting
stories at those organizations. Leadership, he reminds us, occurs
in the human mind, but leaders must also live the stories they
tell.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity liked what it heard. ``We were struck by how practical
it was for him to give historical examples of various kinds of
leadership,'' says William Costello, a Fidelity vice president and
clinical psychologist who organized the event. ``Howard talks to
the heart of what others have said before. He says, `Let me think
of this a bit differently.' That's his contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Her politics aside, Gardner considers Margaret Thatcher, the
former British prime minister, to have been one of the most
successful leaders in our time. He says that, like her
contemporary, former President Reagan, she had a simple message to
tell: ``Britain has lost its way, and I know a new and better
way.'' She told a compelling story to the British people that
worked.
</P>
<P>
   His two heros are Mahatama Gandhi and Jean Monnet, father of the
European Union, because both tried to enlarge the sense of ``we.''
Both remained flexible on the means but ironclad in the pursuit of
goals. Both walked the walk.
</P>
<P>
   But, Gardner cautions, a leader's story must not be so inclusive
that it alienates his or her core support. This is tricky. It was
no accident, he argues, that Gandhi was assassinated by a fellow
Hindu rather than a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner concludes about leadership: ``So long as human beings
have any desire to change their situation, we will cherish those
individuals who can point us in a new direction and show us how to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The man points rather well himself.

 UNDATED: ... something. Repulsive.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fontana, 47, came to fame writing and directing ``St.
Elsewhere.'' He is partners with director Barry Levinson in ``Oz,''
as he has been in other productions, including the gritty,
critically acclaimed ``Homicide'' (recently canceled by NBC) and
the new ``The Hoop Life'' on Showtime. Levinson, says Fontana, may
not be much of a presence on the ``Oz'' set but ``he's always there
when I need him.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of strong personalities at work on ``Oz,'' a lot
of actors whom you might expect to fight for space. But, Walker
says, ``we're like a family and we're all here to work. Nobody's
really got time for the ego thing. I'm not saying there aren't
egos, but everyone puts it on the back shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some muscling going on on set,'' says Winters, ``but
when you trust the people you are working with you can be as bad as
you want. There's poking, there's posturing, but for a show that is
chockful of reality and violence and a lot of sex, I think this
show . . . has so much love in the cast. It's a lovefest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little ego,'' agrees Lee Tergesen, who plays
convict/lawyer Tobias Beecher, ``which is great and sort of
uncommon. We all have a great respect for one another and part of
that is the material: If you're going to get naked in the showers,
it is just a very vulnerable feeling even if it's about a bunch of
tough guys.'' It is, he says, with a slight laugh, like a workplace
drama: ``You feel threatened and you have to position yourself in a
certain way. Everybody is fighting for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good friend of mine who is in prison right now,''
says Dean Winters, who plays convicted killer Ryan O'Reily. ``It's
one of the few prisons that actually shows `Oz.' He has written me
that it's pretty much on the money as far as the stereotypes go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of each episode, the cast is introduced in a
montage, and you also see a tattoo of ``Oz'' being inked onto a
man's shoulder. That's Fontana's shoulder. ``I said I wanted to do
a thing with prison art,'' he says, ``and when I got closer to
doing it nobody was stupid enough to want the tattoo _ especially
if it was only going to be eight episodes _ so I said `(Expletive)
it, I have a number of tattoos. It'll be way cool.' '' Fontana says
three others connected with the show have since gotten their own
``Oz'' tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the series, Fontana spent parts of two years
visiting prisons, mostly maximum-security facilities. ``I talked to
a lot of inmates, I talked to a lot of COs (corrections officers),
talked to a lot of former inmates. I didn't want to exploit them. I
wasn't allowed to bring in a lot of writing utensils or tape
recorders which, actually, ended up being great. What I would do is
talk to people and when I got outside, whatever I remembered was
what I was supposed to remember. I took it as a metaphysical
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wanted, Fontata continues, was less of prisoners' life
stories and more ``the feel of the place, the loneliness, the fear,
those elements such as no one ever smiling because smiling equals
vulnerability and if your goal is to survive this experience
vulnerability is the thing you push furthest away.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the research I did, what was intrinsic to the experience
was one could never relax, one must always be aware of everyone and
everything around them in order to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the show have a political agenda?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' says Walker. ``I just think that it throws
(prison life) out to the people watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's success with critics, and its importance to the
network (along with ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex and the City,'' it's
a centerpiece of HBO's original programming) comes as America's
fixation with building new prisons and incarcerating ever-larger
numbers of people continues unabated, despite the debates about
that policy's wisdom. ``I never like to get too political,'' says
Fontana, ``because I feel the work should say it, not me. But I
find that you build these prisons and _ given the fact that some of
these people are getting out _ they're not going to be better,
they're going to be worse, we're just delaying the problem. But I
don't have the answers, and I never pretend to on any of the shows
I do. What I have is a lot of questions. And if people watching the
show, the next time they read something about prisons, don't just
go `Oh those (expletive) guys are such low-lifes!' but say `I
wonder if that's close to' '' the situation in ``Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Of ``Oz,'' how much is realistic? How much is exaggerated? How
much is fantasy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my job is to approximate the three in an entertaining
way,'' says Fontana. ``Approximate reality in an entertaining way
and hopefully find the truth buried in there. I want it to feel
real.'' What he asks of an audience ``is to sit there for 58
minutes and have their heads punched in.'' The reality of prison
life might break down into 99 percent tedium and 1 percent
heightened anxiety and/or potential violence. What Fontana has done
is emphasize and dramatize that one percent. Most of prison life,
says Walker, ``is about order and coping with order, and we all
have different ways of doing that, but when it gets ignited, that's
where `Oz' comes in and strings the heightened points together.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the prisoners on ``Oz'' are a more clever, more articulate
lot than you might expect to find behind real-life bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the dramatic license,'' says Simmons. ``The
average guys doing hard time in maximum security _ well, you know,
most of those guys are in there partly because of their lack of
options, and that includes growing up without any of the
advantages, including, in a lot of cases, smarts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very multi-layered show,'' says Walker. ``No matter
what your class, culture, color, or level of intelligence. If you
just want pure escapism, you can get that out of `Oz.' If you need
to be pushed cerebrally, you can get that.''

HOMETOWN HERO BAUER TOUTS MORALITY ON LOW BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, Ky. _ Even voters who know who Gary Bauer is may wonder
why he is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   But here in his hometown, no one is surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer has none of the outward characteristics of a winning
national candidate. He has never held public office. His poll
numbers could hardly be worse. He is short on money, having raised
just $3.4 million to the $36.3 million raised by the Republican
front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush. And, at 5 feet 6
inches tall, he doesn't exactly command a room.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bauer's candidacy makes perfect sense to people in Newport,
the place once known as ``Sin City,'' where gangsters and gamblers
used to flock to a rollicking nightlife on the Ohio River banks. To
explain Bauer, and his overwhelmingly uphill run for president,
people here turn the clock back to 1961. They summon up memories of
his first long-shot crusade to help save Sin City from itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded field of conservative contenders, Bauer has a
singular claim to the moral core of the far right. Decades before
earning a measure of renown as a policy adviser to Ronald Reagan
and as head of the conservative Family Research Council, he was a
kid growing up near the infamous prostitution and gambling strips,
where businessmen from Cincinnati dropped in after work, and name
entertainers with mob ties came to sing.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bauer graduated from high school in 1964, the
Mafia's grip on the city had been largely broken, the glittering
strip joints closed _ an astonishingly swift turnaround in a place
known for nothing but crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, then a bookish teenager with a crewcut, was part of the
grass-roots movement that changed Newport. He recalls being
humiliated by its sleazy reputation, which landed it on the cover
of national magazines. His own father was an alcoholic, bringing
the embarrassment home. So when a group of local businessmen began
to lobby for change, passing out leaflets and going door to door,
Bauer, then a high school sophomore, joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city got cleaned up on the same moral grounds that Gary
Bauer is running his campaign on,'' said Leroy Hoffman, 79, who was
a Newport police officer at the peak of the illegal boom. ``Then
again, I don't know if that's the most popular thing these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bauer's early activism almost provides the template for
his current campaign. He has crafted his presidential platform
almost entirely around what he sees as the nation's moral decline.
Bauer, 53, rails against homosexual marriage and abortion, the
American Civil Liberties Union and a liberal culture that says ``if
it feels good, do it.'' He blames Hollywood for the school
shootings in Littleton, Colo. He also targets elites, Capitol Hill
and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have forgotten that our liberty comes from God
and not from any man,'' he said in April in a speech announcing his
candidacy. ``When I grew up in Newport, Kentucky, with all the
problems that it had _ the crime, the gambling, the open
prostitution, the tough corners that were dangerous to walk down at
night _ in spite of all those things in Newport High School, we
could still pray every morning if we wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that is a deeply personal message for Bauer, it is also a
mantra for other conservative Republican candidates, several of
whom deliver a virtually identical message. In a 13-person field
for the GOP nomination, Bauer at times seems indistinguishable on
substance from Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, businessman Alan
Keyes and even commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, except on some
comparatively peripheral issues of foreign policy and defense.
</P>
<P>
   The result so far is that Bauer is running low in the polls, his
name recognizable to only about 20 percent of voters asked. But he
has gotten donations from more than 55,000 individuals, most of the
money in $40 or $50 chunks, putting him in third place _ tied with
Elizabeth Dole _ in total money raised so far by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he also had a higher percentage of female
donors than the other GOP candidates. But even some of his own
supporters still seem less than ardent. Campaigning at a New
Hampshire barbecue over the Fourth of July weekend, Bauer was
greeted by just 20 Republicans, four of whom said they planned to
vote for someone else in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he were to differentiate himself from the other
conservatives, Bush would still appear to be an insurmountable
obstacle. Bauer has imagined his ideal scenario _ a primary race
pitting a right-wing conservative such as himself against Bush. But
he also sounds as though he hasn't fully thought through the notion
he might actually become president. Asked what makes him think he
could win, Bauer seemed taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, gosh. Well,'' he said, ``none of us know whether we can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also said he ``is not delusional,'' admitting he hardly
seems the most presidential of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, would someone quit a high-paying job _ Bauer earned
$160,000 a year at the Family Research Council _ to spend long
hours on the road, to subject his family to scrutiny and to endure
waves of criticism?
</P>
<P>
   Some do it because a long-shot campaign can prepare the ground
for a future race, or call attention to a cause or issue. But for
Bauer, the will to campaign feels like a subconscious tug. His own
daughter says she has not allowed herself to envision a Bauer White
House. What she does know is ``if he has his heart in something he
is not going to back down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Newport, he hit upon something they cared about, and
something he cared about,'' said Elyse Bauer, 21. ``He is shaped by
his background. There's no question about it. He doesn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The demise of Sin City began when the national media became
fascinated with its underbelly, drawing attention to the
Cleveland-based Mafia syndicate that ran the town with impunity.
Time magazine claimed in 1961 that a Newport brothel could process
a new male customer every seven minutes, calling the city ``one of
the nation's most blatant sin centers.'' A local history of the
town estimates that by the end of the 1950s, payoffs to the mob
totalled $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, local ministers began to preach against crime in the
late 1950s, even raising money to fund lawsuits against local law
enforcement officials who refused to arrest criminals. In 1961, a
group of businessmen mobilized to, among other things, get a
reformer elected sheriff. Bauer, horrified by what he read in the
press, was among those who signed up to help campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He went door to door, passing out leaflets, facing the wrath of
neighbors whose livelihoods depended on the underworld. At home,
Bauer's crusade was equally tough. His father _ an unskilled
laborer and an alcoholic, as Bauer puts it, prone to
``psychological abuse'' _ opposed his son's activism at first. In
the end, he relented when he saw how dirty the antireform movement
would play, after opponents slashed the tires on the family car.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's election was the turning point. Mob leaders lured
the reform candidate into a bar one night, gave him a drink that
knocked him unconscious, then photographed him with a half-naked
strip dancer named April Flowers. The setup failed. It ``appeared
so palpably contrived . . . that public sympathy immediately
swung'' to the reform candidate, according to a bicentennial book
about Newport.
</P>
<P>
   But it drew unprecedented attention to Newport. Within a year,
US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy successfully shut down most
of the illegal activity, after launching a massive investigation
and persuading Congress to pass strict anti-Mafia laws.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next rarely makes it into Bauer's campaign speech.
Newport quickly fell into poverty. Clothing stores and restaurants
once supported by the nightlife were forced to close. The town
spiraled into a depression and only now, 30 years later, is
starting to emerge. But to friends in Newport, that is a key part
of what pushes Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It set the tone for what we believe is right and wrong,'' said
Shirley Turner, who went to high school with Bauer and whose
husband is a close friend of Bauer. ``It told us, even though wrong
is prosperous, it's wrong. The fact that the city was prosperous
masked the fact that it was illegal. Any of us who grew up during
that time, it left an impression on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer today speaks of the political ramifications of his
involvement in Newport. That was where, he says, he made his first
Republican contacts, and where he ``set off on the path'' to
Georgetown Law School after graduating from Georgetown College in
Kentucky in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   And like Newport _ where one of the main attractions is a theme
restaurant called The Syndicate, filled with gambling mementos of
the old days _ Bauer is not shy about using the Sin City saga as
part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it will resonate with a public largely focused on the
top two candidates, Bush and Vice President Al Gore, remains to be
seen. But Bauer is not even close to giving up. Settled into a
spacious office in nothern Virginia, he has prepared his wife and
three children for a long summer on the campaign trail with a
strategy centered on telling people who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know me, you're not going to be for me,'' he
said. ``It's going to take a lot to break through, particularly in
this competition. But we're going to keep methodically building
this grass-roots organization. And then hope we have a
breakthrough.''

JOHN TRAVOLTA'S DECENT IN `CIVIL ACTION'

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``A Civil Action'' _ Local interest should make
this adaptation of Jonathan Harr's book about corporate coverup a
big renter. John Travolta is decent in the main role, but he
doesn't give the dogged lawyer enough dimension. Robert Duvall is
an understated marvel as the attorney pitted against the star. It's
no contest. Also, they should have shot more scenes in the Route
128-Woburn area to give it more authenticity. Also on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' _ Fernanda Montenegro gave the best
performance of any of the 1998 Oscar-nominated actresses as Dora, a
cynical clerk who gradually comes to appreciate life through the
intercession of a young boy. Walter Salles's film could have become
a maudlin mess if it were not for Montenegro's low-key brilliance.
If justice and good judgment prevailed, she would have an Academy
Award on her mantelpiece.

EUROPEAN WORRIES ABOUT ENGINEERED FOOD SPREAD TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A dramatic increase in reliance on genetic
engineering may be helping produce bumper crops, but it also is
raising concern that labeling laws are weak and that too little is
known about potential effects on humans and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   As of last year, growers in the United States, Argentina,
Canada, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France and South Africa dedicated
69.5 million acres to genetically modified crops, a 16-fold
increase over just two years, according to the International
Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, an
industry institute to promote new technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, which represents three-fourths of the
world's agricultural acreage, altered corn accounted for 40 percent
of the total crop planted this year, up from 26.5 percent the year
before. This year, for the first time, canola farmers planted
300,000 acres of engineered plants. Acreage devoted to a wide range
of engineered crops is expanding.
</P>
<P>
   In opposition, consumer groups are citing a startling Cornell
University lab experiment last May in which pollen from a corn
plant altered to eradicate corn borers killed Monarch butterfly
larvae.
</P>
<P>
   If the butterfly might succumb, they reason, what might happen
to humans who consume a lifelong diet of such crops? And what might
happen to beneficial insects and wildlife in the environment?
</P>
<P>
   The questions are pitting consumers against the agricultural
industry and the U.S. government, which insist that food from
genetically modified crops _ primarily corn, soy beans, cotton and
potatoes _ is no different and requires no special tests or labels.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition is swelling in Europe, where the term ``Frankenfood''
has entered the lexicon. Some major supermarket and fast-food
chains have promised to rid themselves of the products, and Italy,
Greece, France, Luxembourg and Denmark are blocking authorization
of new genetic crops in fields and markets of European Union
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance may be spreading across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. consumers, too, are demanding mandatory labeling and
mandatory testing for environmental and human health effects,''
said biologist Michael Hansen, research associate at Consumers
Union's Consumer Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry, led by Monsanto, Novartis, Dow
Chemical Co., DuPont, AgrEvo and Zeneca, calls rising criticism in
Europe ``hysteria and hype'' from the food scare over ``mad cow''
disease in Britain and dioxin in feed, poultry, beef and butter in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The corporations and some universities say the U.S. government
is watching over the food supply, the safest in the world. There's
no reason to do special tests on food or label genetically
engineered ingredients because the crops are virtually unchanged
from conventionally bred crops, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tomato is a tomato is a tomato,'' said Brian Sansoni, senior
manager of public policy communications for the Grocery
Manufacturers of America, some of whose largest corporate members
are biotech companies. ``A tomato that is produced conventionally
or a tomato that is developed through biotechnology, the product is
the same. Both products are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering has come into practice over the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Most commonly, bacteria, viruses, and genes from tobacco or
petunia plants are inserted into soy, corn, cotton and canola so
that plants can survive field applications of weed killers. Or a
gene from Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, a bacteria found in soil,
is inserted into corn, cotton and potatoes to produce a protein
toxic to pests that feed on them.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, many major food companies said they accepted
genetically engineered ingredients for their food products. But
consumers can't go into stores or call industry trade groups to
secure a list of engineered brands, complains GeneWatch, a bulletin
of the Council for Responsible Genetics, a Cambridge, Mass.,
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to know what they're buying in a
transaction,'' said Philip Bereano, a professor of technical
communication at the University of Washington who writes for
GeneWatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a right to spend their dollars in accordance with
their preferences, even if their preferences were irrational,''
Bereano said.
</P>
<P>
   The major food companies have lobbied successfully against
labels before the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates
food additives, and the Environmental Protection Agency, which
regulates pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Val Giddings, vice president for food and agriculture at the
Biotechnology Industry Organization, said, ``We've worked for a
long time to come up with a labeling policy that we know will
convey useful information about nutrition and health.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering and providing a list of genetically altered foods
would be impractical, Sansoni said, because it would be too long.
In addition, he said, ``The products are mixed in with products
that contain ingredients that are not genetically enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA doesn't test bio-engineered foods before they go to the
public, deeming them not materially different from other foods. If
the foods later pose a risk to public health, the FDA has the
authority to remove them from the marketplace. FDA representatives
say they would require labeling only if genes from plants that
could cause allergies were engineered into a crop.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to be assured of not consuming food that has been
genetically engineered is to buy produce that is certified as
organic, Bereano said.

SEX TAKEN SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A strap slips, a shoulder dips, the evening gown slides away _
and instantly the short preview has you hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, part of it is that ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is the last movie by
legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, creator of such masterpieces
as ``Clockwork Orange,'' ``Full Metal Jacket,'' and ``2001: A Space
Odyssey,'' and is already rumored to be his chef-d'oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be honest. The preview's promise is more elemental
than that, a direct-current jolt of desire that runs from the eyes
to the libido and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is as basic as the falling gown: ``Eyes Wide Shut''
is said to be a serious film about sexual relations. That alone
makes it an alluring oasis in a Hollywood wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, serious sex has been missing from the big screen.
Either pornography has hijacked it for movies that are merely
bouncing bodies, or the centripetal forces of market and culture
have conspired to spin out mass-market motion-picture products that
are unceasingly sophomoric or the cinematic equivalent of cafeteria
chow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer and fewer movies dealing with adult
relations,'' laments Vivian Sobchack, a professor of film and
television at UCLA. ``If we are dealing with bodies now, the bodies
are being blown away, wasted, or involved in various kinds of
bathroom functions. It is a real infantilization of American
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Kubrick's final work, which premiers Friday, is the
repository for so many hopes. As the last work of an iconic
filmmaker, and a picture that stars two of Hollywood's most popular
actors, it simply can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is not part of the `Austin Powers,' `StarWars,'
`Big Daddy' core audience _ which is everybody over 30 _ is waiting
for this film because it is the only thing out this summer that
looks at all engaging and mature,'' says Thomas Doherty, chairman
of Brandeis University's film studies program.
</P>
<P>
   Serious film aficionados hope that with his last picture,
Kubrick, who died just after its completion, may bequeath not just
a much-talked-about final work, but a new appreciation for serious
treatment of sexuality in cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is high time we recaptured the adult movie category . . .
and actually have a movie that is by, for, and about adults
concerns,'' said Ray Carney, a professor of film at Boston
University. ``I can think of no other art that is so insistently
juvenile in subject and audience appeal than film.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so. Sexually mature films enjoyed a brief
efflorescence in the late 1960s and early 1970s, just after actual
movie censorship ended and before cultural and commercial pressures
imposed themselves like a sodden superego over Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   That era produced six frank adult-themed movies that are still
talked about today: ``The Graduate'' (R, 1967); ``Midnight Cowboy''
(initally X, 1969); ``Bob &AMP; Carol &AMP; Ted &AMP; Alice'' (R, 1969); ``The
Last Picture Show'' (R, 1971); ``Carnal Knowledge'' (R, 1971); and
``Last Tango in Paris'' (X, 1973), an Italian-French coproduction,
but financed by United Artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came along very quickly after the end of censorship,''
says Gregory Black, professor of communication studies at the
University of Missouri at Kansas City and the author of two books
about censorship and film. ``Filmmakers and audiences were both
experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century, and thousands of movies, later, those
pictures still stand out as unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a frank, sophisticated approach to sexuality in the
cinema,'' said Rick Jewell, associate dean of the University of
Southern California's School of Cinema-Television. ``It has never
been quite the same since.''
</P>
<P>
   How much has the sexual climate changed?
</P>
<P>
   Well, ``Midnight Cowboy,'' the story of a street-stupid would-be
gigolo who ends up caring for a scrofulous street friend, won
Oscars for best picture, director, and screenplay for 1969, despite
its X rating, which was changed to R in 1971. ``Last Tango,''
featured on the cover of both Time and Newsweek, hailed by The New
Yorker's Pauline Kael, was nominated for two.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost inconceivable that that could happen today. These
days, says Jewell, most major studios demand in their contract that
directors bring their movies in at no more than an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You literally can't make an NC-17,'' he said. ``You have to
keep cutting until you get to R.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is fear of backlash in a country that has steadily
backed away from the sexual revolution. Mankind, Mark Twain once
joked, ``has imagined a heaven and has left entirely out of it the
supremest of all his delights _ sexual intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Today ``sex and violence'' have become such a singular term of
denunciation that few seem to question why the erotic should be
condemned along with the destructive.
</P>
<P>
   But the change is as much market as moral. The pig in the python
of audience demographics is teenagers, who have both time and money
to be regular moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do something of a serious nature, exploring sexual
liaisons or relationships and you get an NC-17, that is much too
controversial,'' said Black. ``NC-17 is just death at the box
office. The mall theaters don't like to play it and the public
won't go see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Henry &AMP; June,'' Philip Kaufman's 1990 film about the
lovers' triangle among writers Henry Miller, his wife, June, and
Anais Nin. This was the film whose depiction of lesbian sex led the
Motion Picture Association of America to abandon the X rating and
create the NC-17 category.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was that the new rating would stand apart from the X,
which pornographers had appropriated as a lurid advertisement for
their product.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. Critically well-received, the film
made it into less than 150 theaters, and was a commercial flop. (In
its latest incarnation, ``Lolita,'' tame visually but controversial
for the adult-child relationship, spent years as a celluloid
zombie, wandering America in search of release.)
</P>
<P>
   Experiences like that have made R-ratings the golden mean, a
mark that promises enough spice to lure adults to the theater, but
not enough heat to make them leave their teenagers at home.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the regular news of procrustean cuts as a director reworks
his film to meet objections from the MPAA's ratings board,
Hollywood's voluntary system of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as a neutral objective measure just to inform
people, but it has become a shaping device that dictates the
content of the work,'' said Carney, who blames the search for an R
for the ``blandification of cinematic art.''
</P>
<P>
   Franker foreign films like Jean-Jacques Annaud's ``The Lover''
or Louis Malle's ``Damage'' are almost inevitably recut for the
American market.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some exceptions _ ``sex, lies, &AMP; videotape,''
say, or the occasional Woody Allen film _ what the major Hollywood
studios produce for sexual fare is mostly silly teen movies like
``Risky Business'' or ``American Pie'' or cloying cute romances
like ``About Last Night'' and ``Reality Bites.'' Or we get noir
mysteries like ``Body Heat'' or thrillers like ``Fatal
Attraction,'' ``Basic Instinct,'' or ``Jade.'' Sex plays a role,
certainly, but it's a formulaic supporting part.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``9 1/2 Weeks,'' Adrian Lyne's high-gloss charade about
sexual control, turns out to be a movie about . . . obsession.
Indeed, obsession has become Hollywood's way of marketing any
vaguely erotic film, as though sex itself _ a topic that sweeps
like a second hand across the average person's mind, psychological
studies show _ wasn't itself a worthy subject of cinematic
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   That pitch says to the cautious middle-class, `You can see this
film without worrying that it might speak to you, that it might
touch a chord, that it might reveal something of yourself'; it is
about someone different, someone sexually obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's film is hardly immune from those pressures, of course.
He, too, reportedly was under a studio obligation to deliver an
R-rated product, which has led to digital obscuring of body parts
in one group scene of the film. And yes, the marketing pitches the
movie as a ``thriller of jealousy and sexual obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least at first blush, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' seems to promise
an exploration of common sexual temptations. The story of a
Manhattan doctor and his wife, beautiful people grown restless in
their marriage and ready to explore their sexual fantasies, part of
its appeal lies in that shadowed realm where passion lures reason
in search of stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   When you have sex, D.H. Lawrence said, you go to the dark gods.
There Cruise and Kidman seem to have gone _ and you want to follow,
vicariously, into the chthonian realm, to see, to experience, to
learn how they have changed upon their return.
</P>
<P>
   Could the film help reestablish the erotic film as a serious
Hollywood product? Drama, after all, has taken the first tentative
steps, with David Hare's ``Blue Room'' _ which also starred Kidman
_ and Patrick Marber's ``Closer,'' both treating sexual themes on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get your hopes up. ``The country is too conservative and
the demographics that drive the industry are too young,'' avers
Black.
</P>
<P>
   USC's Jewell is a bit more optimistic. If ``Eyes Wide Shut''
meets with both critical and box office success, it might start a
trend, he says. But even then the impetus would have to come from
the adventurous actors or directors whose past success has given
them power to defy convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a limited number of people who can get
financing for anything they want to do,'' said Jewell. ``These kind
of films are only going to get made if people who have the kind of
power that Stanley Kubrick and Tom Cruise do agree to make them.''

LOVE LESSONS 
Twelve Real-Life Love Stories 
By Lois Smith Brady 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, $20, 236 pp. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For seven years, Lois Smith Brady has written the Vows column in
the Style section of The Sunday New York Times. Her slice-of-life
stories about brides and grooms have attracted a faithful, mostly
female readership _ even as the marriage rate falls and the divorce
rate soars. Early on in the life of the column, Brady writes in her
book ``Love Lessons: Twelve Real-Life Love Stories,'' she started
to realize that ``people do not really care about cake frosting and
petticoats. What truly captures their interest _ and what has held
mine for all these years _ are the love stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady's book, comprising 11 expanded Vows columns, along with
one chapter about her own parents' love story, is a bit like a
wedding cake. It's attractive, very sweet, and irresistible. But
after a few bites you need to put it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the sugar is diluted with Brady's warmth and wisdom,
which are what make ``Love Lessons'' worth reading. In the
emotional introduction, she shares details about her awkward
adolescence and her oft-bruised heart. Perhaps her love of love
stories is due to the fact that she has been living one with her
husband of more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   She imparts bits of wisdom from her aisle-hopping career: ``I
learned that true love has some universal qualities and telltale
signs. For one thing, most couples I've interviewed said they felt
incredibly lucky, even giddy, after meeting. . . . Whenever anyone
asks me about love now, I always say wait for that feeling, wait,
wait, wait.''
</P>
<P>
   And I liked this analogy: ``One woman I interviewed compared the
experience of falling in love to finding a gilded ballroom on the
other side of your small, dingy studio apartment. It's something
you never imagined existed, something magical, a little scary when
you think about it, and bigger than you ever dreamed.''
</P>
<P>
   As different as the couples in ``Love Lessons'' are, most hail
from New York City, or live there now, so many of the stories have
a decidedly Manhattan feel. Their ages and situations speak to the
variety of life: an older couple, newly widowed people, a man and
woman who meet briefly while traveling overseas, people who rush to
the altar and those who wait for years and years, the disabled, the
daredevils, people who fall in love, then out, then back in, such
as Brady's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the couples, however, border on storybook caricature.
There's the quintessential rumpled bachelor who falls for the very
wealthy single mom, the two perfectly sweet earthy-crunchies who
walk down the aisle barefoot and exchange silver pendants instead
of rings, the couple who meet in a version of ``You've Got Mail.''
But these people do live. Their names, and even their photos (a
nice touch) are published.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Harlequin Romance effect probably is a product of
Brady's dramatic writing style, which at times makes everyone seem
a bit too perfect, or a bit too easy to analyze. And just as pastry
chefs sometimes load a cake with too many frosted flowers, Brady
too often weighs down her sentences with needless similes. ``When
my parents visited them, they would all sit out on the porch,
surrounded by weeping willow trees, and talk about literature while
the trees shook in the wind, rustling like wedding dresses.'' Not
being a ``Vows'' follower, I kept wondering, does she always write
this way? And if she does, does it come naturally or does she go
back and fill in the metaphors later?
</P>
<P>
   But despite this tendency to over-adorn, Brady is
conversational, quite fuuny, and clearly respects her subjects. If
she's ever cynical, she doesn't show it. Her warm feelings extend
to ex-partners, as well. As she so wonderfully puts it, ``Love is
not a eraser,'' suggesting that new relationships don't have to
wipe out former ones.
</P>
<P>
   Brady wrote an interesting New York Times column in May. Called
``Vows: An Update,'' it was headlined, ``The Seven-Year Itch: Where
are They Now?'' and looked up some of the first couples she'd
written about. Not surprisingly, half of them had divorced. Of
course the cynic in me couldn't help wondering how many of the
perfect pairings in ``Love Lessons'' would last, but perhaps that's
not really the point. For if you ever wanted (needed?) proof
positive that hope _ and love _ springs eternal, this book is it.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
! ``American Pie'' An entry in the bonehead-movie-of-the-summer
stakes, this high-school romp is gross, tasteless, and stupidly
sentimental in its desperate attempt to be this year's ``There's
Something About Mary.'' It's also humor-impaired, peopled by horny
boys who want to shed the yoke of loserdom and go for the winner's
circle. (R) (Jim Sullivan) 
 
!!! ``Arlington Road'' This manipulative but effective
conspiracy-theory film smartly taps into fears of another Oklahoma
City or another World Trade Center bombing. It pits Jeff Bridges's
anxious high-school teacher against neighbors (Tim Robbins and Joan
Cusack, both compellingly cast against type) he's convinced are
right-wing terrorists. (R) 
 
!!! ``Edge of Seventeen'' This poignant, touching film perfectly
and painfully captures the awkwardness of adolescence as a gay
high-school senior (winningly played by Chris Stafford) bumbles and
fumbles his way through the minefield of young romance in 1980s
Ohio. (Unrated) (Renee Graham) 
 
!! 1/2 ``Windhorse'' The most impressive thing about this
pro-Tibetan, anti-Chinese film, shot in Nepal and (clandestinely)
in Tibet, is that it got made at all. Apart from novelty value,
striking settings, and movingly heartfelt performances, the film is
undermined by simplistic construction. (Unrated)

   Today's genetically-modified foods are altered for pest
resistance, but tomorrow's will be engineered for disease
prevention and nutrient content.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists envision potatoes that will carry vaccines and
broccoli that will be packed with antioxidant vitamins. These
so-called ``functional foods'' will blur the line between
pharmaceuticals and food, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Val Giddings, vice president of food and agriculture at the
Biotechnology Industry Council, said he believes that one day
people will go to the doctor and get a prescription of ``so many
grams of this strain of broccoli and this variety of corn.''
</P>
<P>
   Life science companies like Monsanto and Dupont already have a
number of products in the pipeline. The first designer foods to hit
the market will probably be bananas with delayed ripening
qualities, tomatoes with a higher antioxidant content, higher-
protein rice (using genes transferred from pea plants), and
strawberries with increased levels of ellagic acid, a natural
cancer-fighting agent.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a
margarine called Benecol, which is supposed to lower cholesterol
levels. Iowa-based Pioneer Hi-Bred International and Dupont have a
joint venture, called Optimum Quality Grains, that has produced
LoSatSoy oil made from beans that have half the saturated fat as
others.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also working on making the soybean taste less
``beany,'' said Optimum president and CEO Carrol Bolen, so it can
be used by people who want the health benefits of soy but don't
like the taste.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolen, who is also a vice president at Pioneer, said the
next five years are critical. ``It will tell us a lot more about
whether agriculture biotechnology can really deliver,'' he said.
``We believe the opportunity is real. We are investing very heavily
in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Monsanto is working on a high-solids potato that
doesn't soak up as much oil during frying, as well as canola that
is rich in beta-catotene to combat vitamin A deficiency, a problem
in many developing countries, said spokeman Jay Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot more research is needed to determine how to maximize
different nutrients, said Jeffrey Blumberg, a professor of
nutrition at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg said scientists have only focused on phytochemicals, or
plant compounds, for the last 10 years and have just started to see
results in the last five. Beyond 52 known vitamins, minerals, amino
acids, sugars, and fatty acids essential to life, scientists are
just beginning to document a wide range of other substances in
foods that may be important for warding off disease and maintaining
good health.
</P>
<P>
   For example, nutrients such as flavonoids are antioxidants found
naturally in tea and in many fruits and vegetables such as broccoli
and onions. Blumberg said that such nutrients can either be
enhanced in foods that already have them or be added to those that
don't normally produce them, ``so if you don't like the tomato''
you could eat an engineered food with a similar profile, Blumberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is easier said than done. ``If I want to reengineer a
tea to contain more flavonoid, which one of the more than 400 do I
pick? I am not suggesting there are adverse effects, but we don't
know enough about which ones provide the best benefit,'' Blumberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once modified fruits and vegetables come out of the pipeline,
labeling will become an issue. James Maryanski, biotechnology
coordinator for foods at the FDA, said that the agency has not yet
established specific guidelines on how to label such foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not engaged in the process at the moment,'' Maryanski
said, because these foods are not yet commercially available. ``We
are evaluating them on a case by case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a new high oleic soybean oil, which has more
``good'' monounsaturated fat than regular soybean oil, will be
labeled as such, Maryanski said.

INVENTOR'S DEVICE MAY CUT AUTO EMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no bigger than a beer mug, but the simple device developed
in Daniel Cohn's lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
has the potential to make significant reductions in the already
drastically-improved emissions from ordinary cars.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, who has been working on the concept since 1993, last month
won an innovation award from Discover magazine for the patented
device, which cleans up emissions by producing pure hydrogen that
is added to the engine's fuel mixture. This allows the engine to
burn cooler and leaner (that is, with more air in the mix).
</P>
<P>
   The device is quite simple: Fuel enters a chamber, mixes with
air, and then is zapped with electricity. That creates a plasma _
an electrically-charged gas _ which then causes carbon from the
fuel to join with oxygen from the air. This leaves a mixture of
carbon monoxide and hydrogen, both of which can be burned up by the
engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well known that hydrogen improves the environmental
qualities'' of a conventional engine, said Cohn, who is director of
MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion center. The hard part has always
been producing the hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first tests of the device connected to a
conventional engine are just beginning at the US Department of
Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, calculations based on lab
tests of the device by itself show that it should reduce nitrogen
oxide emissions _ a major component of smog _ by 90 percent. ``A
number of major car companies have talked to us,'' he said, ``both
US and foreign.'' But he said it would not be appropriate to name
the companies at this early stage of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle of what he's talking about is sound and
attractive,'' said Daniel Sperling, director of the Center for
Advanced Automotive Research at the University of California at
Davis. But, he said, there are some unanswered questions, such as:
how cheaply can it be manufactured, and what kind of maintenance
issues might it encounter?
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger question, Sperling said, is how much need
there is for such a device in the first place. Since new cars _ and
especially the newer cars coming in the next few years _ are
already vastly cleaner than their predecessors, ``the demand for a
device of this kind is not nearly as great as 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The progress _ which Sperling attributes in large part to strict
regulations such as California's air-quality rules _ has been far
greater than virtually anyone expected. ``The new cars, for all
practical purposes, are zero-emitting,'' he said. ``It's
extraordinary what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn agrees that the new cars are much cleaner, but points out
that the major companies are still spending hundreds of millions of
dollars in a quest for even cleaner cars. Also, some trucks and
buses _ where much greater improvements are needed because their
larger engines produce more emissions _ run on conventional
spark-ignition engines, and thus could use the new device.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering cleaner emissions during ordinary operation,
said Cohn, with his device the engine can be set to run on
virtually pure hydrogen during startup _ the period when the
greatest emission of pollutants usually occurs, because the car's
catalytic converter has not yet warmed up to its operating
temperature. Those startup emissions would be drastically reduced
by such a system, he said. Already, Volvo has been working on a
different technique for providing pure hydrogen to the engine
during this startup period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This device could greatly reduce air pollution from cars,
trucks, and buses, using present internal combustion technology,
without a major increase in costs and without any inconvenience to
the driver,'' Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just one of the potential benefits of the device,
Cohn said in an interview. Dubbed the ``microplasmatron,'' it could
also allow a variety of unconventional or unrefined fuels _
including natural gas, diesel, and even ordinary vegetable oil _ to
be used in car engines. That's because it is essentially an
on-board refinery that could allow crude, unprocessed fuels to be
converted to pure, clean-burning hydrogen as they enter the engine.
</P>
<P>
   By enabling the use of unconventional plant-derived fuels, such
as oils derived from agricultural waste products, in ordinary
engines, the device could theoretically help to curb global
warming, Cohn said. That's because the carbon in those fuels is
actually drawn from the air as the plants grow and is then given
back off as the fuels burn. Unlike fossil fuels, they therefore
have no net effect on the amount of carbon dioxide _ a major
contributor to global warming _ in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Hwang, automotive technology analyst for the Union of
Concerned Scientists, said that while he had not heard of Cohn's
device specifically, it would be ``terrific if it's cost effective,
as long as it doesn't reduce fuel economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sperling is skeptical of the device's significance for
passenger cars, he says if it can be adapted to diesel engines as
well _ which Cohn says may be possible _ there could be huge
demand. ``That's the only application I can think of where it might
play an important role,'' said Sperling. ``Diesel engines are so
dirty, and it is so expensive to reduce their emissions. . . .
Diesel manufacturers are under huge pressure, and they really don't
know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn said such applications are more speculative, because very
litle research has been done on the effects of adding hydrogen to
diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some indication it will have a beneficial effect,''
he said last week as he was on his way to a conference in Maine on
improving the efficiency and emissions of diesel engines, ``but
whether it's significant or not, we don't know at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The research so far, done with just $300,000 of Department of
Energy funding _ a pittance by automotive research standards _ was
done in collaboration with Leslie Bromberg and Alexander
Rabinovich, research engineers at the MIT lab, and Charles Titus of
T&AMP;R Associates, a Pennsylvania-based consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   The team at MIT has now received additional funding from the
Department of Energy to do more advanced research on establishing
the feasibility of the microplasmatron for widespread use, Cohn
said.

LABELING RULES LIMIT FOODMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All Ben &AMP; Jerry's wanted to do was tell customers what was not
in their ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The all-natural food company had helped lead an unsuccessful
fight against a synthetic hormone injected into cows to boost their
milk output in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had it won approval, but the US Food and Drug
Administration ruled that companies didn't have to tell customers
if their cows received bovine growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ben &AMP; Jerry's wanted their labels to declare that their ice
cream, at least, was growth hormone-free. ``The use of
bio-engineered growth hormones in dairy cows is inconsistent with
everything we stand for,'' declared chief executive Perry Odak.
</P>
<P>
   But it was against the law. Several states interpreted FDA
approval of the new drug as banning even implied criticisms of
bovine growth hormone. If Ben &AMP; Jerry's said they didn't use it,
these states reasoned, the company was suggesting there was
something wrong with companies that do.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's finally sued Illinois to win the right to label
their ice cream, but the Vermont company's battle underscores how
difficult it has been to tell consumers about the rapid changes in
their food.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 60 percent of the foods in the grocery store may already
contain vegetables grown from genetically modified seeds or milk
from cows injected with growth hormone, but virtually none of it is
labelled. That's because the FDA has concluded that bovine growth
hormone and genetically altered seeds are little more than
additives that don't affect either the safety or nutritiousness of
the food. Only if the additive poses some identifiable threat, such
as allergic reactions, does the FDA require a label.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Clinton Administration was so confident about
the new foods that the Department of Agriculture tried to include
them in the definition of `organic foods,' the holy grail of food
purity. Objections from organic food supporters finally derailed
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, federal policy is increasingly under assault from critics
who say the FDA ignores the uncertainty created by genetic changes,
and robs consumers of the right to know what's in their food.
</P>
<P>
   Activists have submitted 500,000 signatures to the agency
demanding labelling of food biotechnology products, and a group
called the Alliance for Bio-Ethics has sued to require it.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Druker, executive director of the Iowa-based Alliance,
said the FDA ignored its own scientists in concluding that
biotechnology products generally required no label. For instance,
in a 1991 critique of FDA policy on food biotechnology, Louis
Pribyl of the FDA's microbiology group wrote, ``There is a profound
difference between the types of unexpected effects from traditional
breeding and genetic engineering which is just glanced over in this
document.''
</P>
<P>
   But Druker said the FDA sided with the major producers of food
biotechnology products, concluding food biotechnology carried no
unique risks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Druker notes, the FDA official in charge of policy
development at the time, Michael Taylor, joined Monsanto, maker of
bovine growth hormone and other biotechnology products.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials concede there were disagreements about agency
policy on food biotechnology, but they say that's normal in
scientific debate and that senior officials were in agreement. They
also point out that a 1994 US General Accounting Office report
found no conflict of interest by three employees, including Taylor,
who had a role in approving bovine growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs the Clinton Administration is softening
on requiring labels as a way to quell a growing backlash against
food biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   As Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said recently, ``Labelling
can be a sensible way of providing information, but we have to make
sure that the labeling is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's has placed a `responsible' label on its products,
duly noting that the FDA has found ``no significant difference''
between milk produced with and without bovine growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   But company officials suspect they may yet be proved right: the
United Nation's food safety body refused to endorse bovine growth
hormone two weeks ago, declaring ``there is no consensus on (bovine
growth hormone) safety in the international scientific community.''

THERE'S GROWING PRESSURE IN THE SEED BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN AND KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTERFIELD, Mo. _ The seed business used to be an unglamorous,
low-tech field, where farmers methodically cross-bred their
tomatoes year after year in hopes of eventually getting firmer
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the genetic revolution swept agriculture,
offering the hope of ``programming'' tomatoes to be firmer all at
once, and inspiring research meccas like Monsanto Co.'s $150
million facility outside St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The 210-acre complex, billed as the largest biotechnology
research center in the world, has set the standard for what
companies will do to create the crops of  &UR; tomorrow &LR; : 100 room-sized
incubators, 26 greenhouses in the main building, and 2,400
employees engaged in a vast array of projects from growing
genetically engineered blue cotton to low-cholesterol oils.
</P>
<P>
   Though Monsanto spends $300 million and takes 10 years to
develop a biotechnology product, Wall Street loves the vision,
sending stock prices up 500 percent from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monsanto's success has put tremendous pressure on other
chemical companies' management'' to follow suit, said Juan
Enriquez, researcher at the David Rockefeller Center at Harvard
University. For instance, rival Novartis recently opened its own
research center in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But biotechnology has made the seed business a rough place,
where small companies are gobbled up and big companies sue one
another over rights to the best ideas. In April, a Delaware jury
ordered Monsanto to pay $65 million to Rhone-Poulenc Agro of France
for violating its patent for gentically altered corn.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, too, have gotten a rude awakening, as seed firms demand
higher fees for the new technology and, in many cases, a written
agreement that they will not save seeds from this year's harvest to
put toward next year.
</P>
<P>
   And the companies are not joking about what they call ``seed
piracy.'' Monsanto has hired private detectives to investigate
farmers suspected of stealing seeds, suing a number of them when
DNA analysis revealed unauthorized growing of Monsanto products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers here are calling it a reign of terror,'' Saskatchewan,
Canada, farmer Percy Schmeiser told The Washington Post. Monsanto
sued Schmeiser for theft of canola seeds, though he said that the
seeds drifted in from another farm.
</P>
<P>
   But Monsanto spokesman Jay Byrne said tough actions against seed
pirates are a matter of fairness. ``If you can gain $100,000
advantage over your neighbor with this . . . the farmers want to
make sure everyone is playing by the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Monsanto and other companies hope to genetically
program products so that they don't produce fertile seeds. But
organizations that work with developing countries, where farmers
traditionally save seeds, have pressed Monsanto to drop the idea of
these ``terminator seeds,'' while New Hampshire legislators
approved a study this year on whether to ban them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rough-and-tumble competition, Monsanto officials say
they want to be open, educating the public about food
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not hiding anything,'' said Byrne, leading a reporter
through 8-foot-tall stalks of corn.
</P>
<P>
   But openness has limits. Monsanto denied reporters access to
their New England research facilities, Cereon Genomics in Cambridge
and NatureMark potatoes in Island Falls, Maine. Byrne said the
company had concerns for safety, but others said the real issue was
probably trade secrets.

THE FUTURE OF FOOD IS NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an agriculture company introduced a genetically modified
tomato with a longer shelf life in 1994, it was the start of a new
revolution in food. Scientists and food producers promised that
other enhanced foods _ packed with richer flavor, extra vitamins,
and even medicines _ would soon follow.
</P>
<P>
   In a scenario out of science fiction, they predicted a day in
the near future when a banana, for example, could be spliced with a
hepatitis B viral gene for use as a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Flavr Savr'' tomato, though, was a commercial flop, and
the promised revolution seemed to go undergound. Today in the US,
you don't hear too much about genetically altered foods and you
certainly can't find any obvious signs of them on grocery shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But look again. Because nearly 60 percent of all processed foods
_ everything from pickles to peanut butter _ contain corn or
soybeans that have been grown with genetically engineered seeds,
Americans are already dining regularly on DNA-altered cuisine,
probably without knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   The deception, if it can be called that, is intentional. Efforts
to label foods with geneticially altered components have largely
failed out of a concern that illogical fears about
scientifically-produced foods would unfairly harm a new and
promising industry. Yet the speed with which that industry has
taken off with no special regulatory oversight has even some
scientists worried about what the future may bring as more and more
gene-tinkered foods come to market.
</P>
<P>
   What's a consumer to do?
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers have long feared that people could fall ill from
life-threatening allergic reactions to foreign material in foods,
and although this is a remote possibility, most scientists say it
is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have been crossbreeding plants for centuries to produce
ones with desired traits. A trait _ whether it's of a plant or
animal _ is the expression of a gene, which contains the molecular
instructions that give organisms their characteristics, such as a
rounded leaf or brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike traditional plant breeding, which can only
incorporate genes from close relatives, genetic engineering can
make use of any gene regardless of its source, which means it is
theoretically possible to do what A/F Protein Inc., a Waltham-based
company, is experimenting with now. Scientists there are inserting
an ``anti-freeze'' flounder gene into an Atlantic salmon so that
the salmon could be bred in colder waters.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's most important crops are already being
grown from seeds engineered with a built-in immunity to insects,
viruses, or herbicides. About a third of the 80 million acres of
corn planted in the nation, 55 percent of the 72 million acres of
soybeans, and more than half of the 13 million acres of cotton are
grown with genetically engineered seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists point out that genetically modified foods are not
harmful, because DNA _ in any food _ is destroyed during digestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to suppose that DNA in genetically modified
plants would behave differently,'' said officials from the Royal
Society, the independent scientific academy of the United Kingdom,
in a report about genetically-modified foods released last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hefle, assistant professor and co-director of the Food
Allergy Research and Resource Program at the University of Nebraska
in Lincoln, said consumers should not worry about the use of
genetically engineered, or transgenic, ingredients in food because
there has been no discernable increase in allergies or other
problems since oils, flour, and syrups from genetically engineered
foods _ such as corn and soy _ started being consumed a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would eat any products on the shelf,'' said Hefle.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics of genetically modified foods point to Pioneer
Hi-Bred International Inc., a seed company, now owned by Dupont
Co., that in 1996 developed a transgenic soybean using a gene from
a Brazil nut to increase the protein content of its animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the product was never intended for human consumption,
Pioneer wanted to make sure the allergen from the Brazil nut was
not transferred to the soybean, so it asked Steve Taylor, a nut
allergy specialist at the University of Nebraska, to test the
product.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and his colleagues found that people did, in fact, have
allergies to the protein and published those results in a 1996
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine; Pioneer pulled the
soybean from production. ``It was never close to a disaster,'' said
Carrol Bolen, vice president at Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that it was fortunate that the company acted
to police itself; no federal agency prevented Pioneer from
producing the modified soybean.
</P>
<P>
   But the product in question was animal _ not human _ feed. The
US Food and Drug Administration does, in fact, require companies to
demonstrate through scientific data that potential allergens are
not contained in any bio-engineered foods; if they are, the FDA
requires a label saying so.
</P>
<P>
   But most American consumers are pragmatic about food, caring
about taste and cost _ not about the food process, said Thomas
Hoban, a professor of sociology and food science at North Carolina
State University, who has been following consumer attitudes about
genetically engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   Hoban said that studies indicate that about 75 percent of
American consumers are not concerned about genetically engineered
foods, mainly because they trust that the food supply is generally
safe.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not true in the case of bovine growth hormone. In
1993, when the FDA approved genetically engineered bovine
somatotropin (BST), a protein-hormone involved in milk production,
people were up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers use the hormone so cows produce more milk. The
National Institutes of Health has said BST is not a human health
hazard because milk already contains the hormone naturally and it
is a protein digested in the intestines.
</P>
<P>
   However, some critics, such as Jason Boehk, co-founder of
Cambridge-based Protect Organic, have requested that food with
genetically-engineered ingredients be labeled because they believe
people should have the choice of avoiding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using genes to manipulate food can have unintended
consequences. What happens if there is a problem? Without labeling,
there is just no way to know how to trace it back to the
genetically-engineered ingredient,'' Boehk said.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is the use of a bacterial protein from Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt) in crops such as corn, soybeans, and potatoes.
The Bt gene is inserted into the seeds of many crops to produce a
protein that acts as a pesticide. When the plant is eaten by an
insect, the bug dies.
</P>
<P>
   Because the seed contains a pesticide, the Environmental
Protection Agency has evaluated it for safety and it's come up
clean. And studies have shown that Bt is not toxic to mammals, even
at the highest dose tested, and that the proteins rapidly degrade
in the stomach acid.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is that ``marker genes'' are routinely inserted
into plants to make them resistant to antibiotics, which helps
scientists identify the plants that have been altered. Critics
suggest that bacteria in people's or animals' intestines may be
able to pick up those genes from digested food and perhaps
accelerate the evolution of antibiotic-resistant microbes.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists say the marker gene product is broken down in the
digestive tract and thus cannot function in the human body.
Supporters of the technology emphasize that processes are safe and
the regulatory system works. In 1992, the FDA issued a statement
that foods grown from genetically-engineered seeds would be
regulated the same way as other foods but that there was no need to
label them because the end product is the same.
</P>
<P>
   James Maryanski, biotechnology coordinator for foods for the
FDA, said if a food proved to be unsafe, it would be pulled off the
market and action would be taken against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee that we know everything about the
products,'' Maryanski said. But he added that food companies do go
through extensive internal and government reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Laura Ticciati, executive director of Iowa-based
Mothers of Natural Law, is worried about the long-term safety of
genetically-modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 90 to 95 percent of food in the next five to 10 years will
become genetically-modified, there needs to be some serious
long-term safety testing done. We thought DDT was safe 20 years
ago,'' said Ticciati. ``In the meantime, food should be labeled so
every American has the right to decide if they want to put
themselves in the experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Entis, chief executive of the Waltham company that's
inserting flounder genes into salmon, said he knows that the major
hurdle will be convincing consumers that genetically modified fish
are safe. ``It does come down to consumer acceptance, which I think
will be there,'' Entis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolen of Pioneer acknowledged that there are still unknowns
in the evolving industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is developing at such a rapid pace, it is hard
to visualize what we may be able to do down the road.'' said Bolen.

TINKERING WITH THE DNA ON YOUR DINNER PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAND FALLS, Maine _ They look like all the other potatoes that
blanket the farms in northern Maine: knee-high green plants with
white flowers, stretching out in neat rows across the rust-colored
soil.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Shur's potatoes are in the vanguard of one of the
fastest and most controversial transformations of American
agriculture since the rise of pesticides after World War II.
Depending on whom you believe, they offer either the best hope ever
to feed the world or the danger of a new era of biological
pollution, threatening the health of anyone who ingests them.
</P>
<P>
   They may well spark a trade war with Europe, too.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ordinary potatoes, Shur's crops contain something extra,
extra genes borrowed from bacteria and viruses in an effort to
build a better potato, one more resistant to bugs, disease, even
droughts. Created in a specially constructed laboratory behind
Shur's storehouse, these potatoes even secrete a substance to kill
beetles that munch on their leaves.
</P>
<P>
   When Monsanto Co. approached him five years ago, ``I said, `This
is unbelievable.' The new technology is just mind boggling,'' said
Shur, 60, who built the lab for Monsanto to do potato experiments
on his land. ``I thought it was the future, and I still think it's
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Just five years after US approval of the first genetically
modified food _ a tomato _ that future is rushing to supermarket
shelves, though not all consumers realize it. Fifty-six genetically
modified farm products are on the market, most developed by a few
corporations such as Monsanto and DuPont, and hundreds more are
under development.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some ice cream and cookies contain soybeans injected
with a gene from petunias to help make them resistant to
herbicides. Certain brands of vegetable oils and baking powder
contain corn treated with a bacteria gene to resist pests. Potato
chips and French fries contain Monsanto's beetle-resistant
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the 15 percent of the US milk supply that comes from cows
injected with Monsanto's synthetic hormone to increase output, and
you have the makings of a revolution in the food supply. By some
estimates, up to 60 percent of the foods in the grocery store
contain an ingredient made by the booming food biotechnology
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even though US regulators insist that these new foods are
as safe and wholesome as conventional products, a growing number of
people fear that the manipulation of food's genetic structure has
opened a Pandora's box.
</P>
<P>
   European nations, especially Great Britain, have balked at the
new foods, fearing that all the gene crossing will produce
unpredictable results, such as foods that are toxic to people or
dangerous to the environment. A recent Cornell University study,
for example, shows that pollen from a genetically modified product
called Bt corn is toxic to monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to
God and God alone,'' Prince Charles, perhaps the most famous critic
of genetically modified food, declared last year.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of genetically modified foods, including former
president Jimmy Carter, a soybean grower, believe the Europeans are
caught up in hysteria that blinds them to the advantages of the new
products, such as lower production costs and fewer pesticides
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans have an absolute fear, unfounded by any
scientific basis, of accepting these products,'' said Stuart
Eizenstat, President Clinton's nominee for deputy treasury
secretary, at his confirmation hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat predicted that within five years, nearly 100 percent
of American agricultural exports will be either genetically
modified or mingled with genetically modified products. He said
efforts to block those exports are ``the single greatest trade
threat that we face systemically with the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say the US government is such a booster of the new
technology that it can't be trusted. President Clinton's former
trade advisor, Mickey Kantor, sits on Monsanto's board of
directors, while two key Food and Drug Administration officials
hold senior positions at Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US Food and Drug Administration . . . has a policy to
facilitate the biotech industry,'' said Steven Druker of the
Iowa-based Alliance for Bio-Integrity. All the while, he argues,
the agency has gone out of its way to keep consumers in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1992 FDA policy, genetically modified foods generally
don't even have to be labeled, and farmers don't have to segregate
them from conventional products. As a result, consumers cannot
easily avoid genetically altered foods, or know for sure that
they're present.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say they rigorously review new products,
requiring field tests and long lists of safety checks before
anything wins approval. ``We believe our science and the science at
large confirms that we provide complete public protection,'' said
Stephen Johnson of the Environmental Protection Agency, which
regulates plants engineered to secrete their own pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson acknowledges that the new industry has grown
much faster than his agency expected, making some concerns more
pressing. The EPA worries that the popularity of plants, such as
Shur's potatoes, that secrete Bt to kill pests could inadvertently
create insects immune to the toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, academic analysts are increasingly concerned that the
boom has overwhelmed government's ability to regulate or even
understand it. The number of field tests went from 58 in 1990 to
1,082 last year, while the number of requests for patents on genes
has skyrocketed even faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are doing anywhere near as good a job as we
could'' at regulating the food biotechnology industry, said Juan
Enriquez, a researcher at Harvard University's David Rockefeller
Center. ``It's hard to have an educated debate because it is
happening so quickly . . . that it is overwhelming even
scientists.''

NEW GENERATION, SAME OLD STORIES FOR TEEN GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was 16, there was ``16.''
</P>
<P>
   The glossy magazine was packed with information for adolescent
girls on how to get rid of pimples, why the newest rock star was
the coolest thing on wheels, how to avoid geekdom by buying hip
clothes and, especially, how to get a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   And now, 30 years later, with the Age of Aquarius allegedly in
full swing, we have a proliferation of magazines for teen-age
girls: Teen People, Latin Girl, Jump and, now, the newly launched
CosmoGirl, the little sister of Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? CosmoGirl's pages are filled with advice on: how to
get rid of pimples, why the newest rock star is the coolest thing
on wheels, how to avoid geekdom by buying hip clothes and, once
again, how to get a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Cosmo with Training Wheels.'' It's equally glossy,
with blaring colors and even louder headlines promising remarkable
life reversals. (``Turn Your Crush Into Your Boyfriend!'') And
perhaps it will do for the next generation of women what ``Cosmo''
did for mine: nudge it down the slippery slope of self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in my 20s, Cosmopolitan was Goddess among my gullible
friends. It dictated our fashion, our hairstyles, our social mores
_ making us feel miserably inadequate in the process. (``Jeez, why
doesn't my butt look that good?'') Eventually we wised up, one by
one, and started buying Ms. instead.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've had a firsthand look at the impact on young
girls of a society obsessed with physical perfection _ first as a
counselor in a psychiatric hospital that specialized in teen-age
girls with eating disorders (the walls of their rooms were covered
with photos of size-2 models!) and then as the mother of a teen-age
girl. She never went through a major geek stage, but frequently was
knocked sideways by the messages in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, I found her wailing in front of the mirror: ``I
hate my nose! It's so big!''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it's not. It was time to dump the YM's
cluttering her room. (I wish we'd been on line then, so I could
have fed her a healthy antidote of ChickClick and Riotgrrl; the
most counter-Cosmo media around is on the Net.)
</P>
<P>
   You hardly can blame Hearst Magazines _ the publisher of 37
international editions of Cosmopolitan _ for running a product up
the flagpole. Apparently the national economy depends on the
allowance money spent by girls between the ages of 12 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 15 million of 'em, spending _ or getting their
parents to spend _ an incredible $96 a week average. That's some
kind of allowance. And ad money waiting to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   In response, magazines have popped up right and left to compete
with the super-successful triumvirate of Seventeen, Teen and YM.
Some are narrower in their focus: by ethnicity (Honey, Latin Girl
and Latina), by interest (a magazine for young New Age
spiritualists called New Moon), even by body type (Girl, founded by
Mode, the magazine for plus-size women.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite some of these magazines' attempts to hire models who
look like real people, those with huge circulations _ of which
CosmoGirl surely will be one _ still project a rail-thin, Calista
Flockhart vision of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling of all, Helen Gurley Brown's Cosmo-girl
philosophy lurks beneath the cheery cover of its junior version.
</P>
<P>
   Check the subject matter. ``Horoscope Booklet! 365 Days of Love
and Life Tips!'' ``Back to School Fashion Blitz: The 10 Items You
Can't Start School Without!'' And there is even a page each month
of stickers: this month, Ben Affleck. (And to think in my youth I
spent all those hours cutting out Peter Tork photos by hand!)
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would be absurd to expect stories about ``What you can
do to save the rain forest'' or ``How to love your body just the
way it is.'' And to CosmoGirl's credit, there is a section called
Inner Girl that includes advice and self-help. But aside from a
piece on how to improve your grades, the advice deals mostly with
dating, eschewing a larger world view.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see a piece on ``what to do if your parents are on
welfare and you can't afford any of the stuff we're hawking.''
</P>
<P>
   These magazines have been hammered in recent years _
specifically by psychologist Mary Pipher, who wrote 1994's
``Reviving Ophelia'' _ for turning teen girls into early slaves to
consumerism. One particularly egregious example in CosmoGirl is an
article on ``How to Turn Your Parents' No's to Yes's.'' The
problem: ``I want those jeans! So what if they're $100? All my
friends have them! I need them!''
</P>
<P>
   The writer suggests that teens ``change your voice to
`pleasant,''' and notes that if you ``make your mom feel like her
opinion counts, she'll be flattered and happy. Happy people buy
more stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 17 articles in CosmoGirl are about fashion and
beauty products _ each marked with brand names and values, things
you can buy. There's something troubling about a magazine with a
target audience starting at 12 years of age expending dozens of
pages on makeup looks. (Almost amusing is the painstaking,
step-by-step guide to applying makeup in order to affect the
``nature girl'' look.)
</P>
<P>
   I guess it's all part and parcel of ``Girl Power,'' the
adolescent stab at feminism launched when the Spice Girls began
their dubious tenure as role models. It's been troubling since the
get-go. The mantra seems to be: Be strong, be yourself, but get a
guy and buy, buy, buy. What ``power'' is there in slavery to that
ideal?

Yahoo's own policies onto Geocities. The policy says that Yahoo
would own anything people publish on their own sites _ including
original content, graphics, text and video posted on personal Web
pages _ and could use it for whatever Yahoo wanted to,
royalty-free. Web authors have tried to fight this. A look at the

ROLLER HOCKEY: THE BEST NEW SPECTATOR SPORT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Four nights after Game Six, that three-overtime
showdown that clinched the Stanley Cup for the Dallas Stars,
another Dallas hockey team had reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stallions, the new roller hockey team, beat the
Anaheim Bullfrogs at Reunion Arena. It was the Stallions' first
victory of the season, finally changing that first number in its
embarrassing 0-7-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   What? You say you've never heard of the Stallions?
</P>
<P>
   Join the club. There hasn't been much of a spotlight on the
in-line skating brand of hockey, even though it's one of the fast
growing sports in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, more people are involved in non-ice hockey than ice
hockey. There are more little- and rec-league roller teams than
ever. The latest report from Roller Hockey International says there
are 6 million registered roller hockey players in the United
States, compared with ice hockey's 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to learn and it's cheaper to get involved with
than ice hockey,'' said Charles Billera of Slapshots, home to many
of Arlington's recreational league roller hockey players. ``Plus
there's no checking in (amateur) roller hockey, so (players) learn
the skills of handling the stick and shooting and don't have to
worry if someone's going to take (their) head off.''
</P>
<P>
   In RHI, the major leagues of roller hockey, you'll see the same
hard checking and solid body contact found in ice hockey, though
there is usually less fighting. Not to say that doesn't happen. At
a recent Stallions vs. Chicago Bluesmen game, Dallas' Yanick Evola
ended up in the penalty box for a fight over a ref's call.
</P>
<P>
   Because hockey moves a little faster on in-line wheels, there
are typically double the shots-on-goal and points in an ice hockey
game. It's more about offense. Players take more risks when
shooting, sometimes going for the occasional luck shot from what
would be a three-point zone in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The puck isn't hard rubber but plastic, and it has eight small,
dome-shaped runners to help it glide easily across the plastic
Sport Court surface. Almost as much as it stays flat, the puck
rolls on its side or flies through the air. With the same relative
frequency as in a baseball game, it ventures into the stands where
fans await, and occasionally fight, over it. And you don't even
need a glove to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between Stallions and Stars games: tickets
are cheaper ($7-$25) and parking is much more accessible. Reunion
Arena closes off its upper level and only sells tickets for the
lower and floor levels.
</P>
<P>
   USA Hockey InLine, the roller division of USA Hockey, boasts
more than 82,000 registered players, coaches and volunteers,
usually participating through venues such as Slapshots (in
Arlington and Richardson, Texas), the Arlington Skatium and North
Richland Hills' Mountasia. This year, the Fort Worth Brahmas began
a Surge Blacktop summer tour in which players make weekly stops
throughout the Metroplex and offer free skills clinics for youths.
</P>
<P>
   Still, RHI has struggled since its inception in 1993. By 1994,
the league boasted 24 teams, but that number quickly declined. In
1998, the league took a hiatus to restructure and evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought it wouldn't return. But USA Hockey InLine and RHI
joined forces and announced more programs and expanded Web sites.
Now professional roller hockey is back.
</P>
<P>
   The Stallions team is one of four new RHI members. Joining
Dallas in the Western Conference are the Bullfrogs, the San Jose
Rhinos and the Las Vegas Coyotes. The Eastern Conference consists
of new teams Chicago Bluesman and Minnesota Blue Ox, plus the
Buffalo Wings and St. Louis Vipers.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds are small, but growing. The Stallions typically garner
upwards of 800 fans at Reunion, mostly those who play in
recreational leagues or parents of children in little leagues.
</P>
<P>
   George and Linda Aponte of nearby Plano have made six of the
seven home games. Their sons, Matt, 11, and Leo, 12, play for the
Slapshots All-Stars in Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing for the kids is getting to see the game up
close,'' Linda said. ``And also that they get a chance to catch the
puck.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Stallions-Bluesmen game, despite the fact that the
Stallions were ahead the entire game, coach Alan May kept that
concerned coach look on his face. But the players, most of whom are
on summer downtime from Western Professional and Central Hockey
league teams, looked like they were actually having fun _ of
course, they were winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost look at them as guys who would play for free in a rec
league somewhere,'' George Aponte said.
</P>
<P>
   They practically are playing for free. All RHI players receive
the same compensation from the league: $300 per player per victory,
$200 per loss. Compare that with the Western Professional Hockey
League's salary cap of $10,000 per week and the National Hockey
League's pay, which averages $3 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   The future of major league roller hockey is uncertain. The
crowds at Reunion are growing, and even though they don't come
close to those in California _ San Jose and Anaheim each typically
see 4,000 patrons per game _ they're not as dismal as the crowds in
Minnesota, which number around 300. (Poor Minnesota must have given
up on any version of professional hockey.)
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of the Stanley Cup, things look bright. ``We'll
reap the benefits of everything in the fall,'' says Billera. ``It's
too early to gauge the effects of the Stars, but it can only get
better.''

HOME OF THE FUTURE BORROWS FUNCTIONS FROM PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New homes designed by internationally recognized architects
include features common to thousand-year-old dwellings where work,
storehouses, relatives, employees, servants and guests were all
sheltered under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   The connection and evolution between new technological marvels
and their medieval antecedents is the subject of an exhibit at New
York's Museum of Modern Art, ``The Un-Private House,'' through Oct.
5.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Riley, chief curator of MoMA's architecture and design
department, selected 26 homes recently built or under construction
to illustrate his hypothesis that the changing demographics of the
family, the proliferation of a variety of media and new concepts of
work and leisure are responsible for the architectural response
that borrows function from the past while exploiting new materials
and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Riley sees homes of the future as a fluid membrane within which
to stage our lives. Houses will need to be adaptable; spaces will
need to be transitory. Barrier walls will need to be translucent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private house today has become a permeable structure,
receiving and transmitting images, sounds, text and data,'' Riley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron's house for a California
couple, to be completed in 2000, will have numerous screens on
which to display their extensive collection of electronic art. In
another instance, the owners of a Manhattan apartment, two Wall
Street traders, have seven display screens scattered throughout
their home. The screens constantly display information about the
international currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   Gisue and Mojgan Hariri's Digital House has interior and
exterior glass walls composed of liquid crystal display (LCD)
blocks that can assist and enhance daily living. A Julia Child-like
character pops up over the kitchen counter and dispenses food
preparation information, while virtual guests appear for a virtual
visit in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Architects Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio play with the
duality of virtual and real. In their Long Island weekend house, a
camera is positioned to capture the best view of the landscape.
This image is played back and competes with the actual view. ``The
view may be recorded and deferred ... day played back at night,
fair weather played back in foul,'' say the designers.
</P>
<P>
   While some architects exploit communication devices, others are
shifting the boundaries between public and private, work and
leisure. This is exemplified in Rem Koolhaas' House in Bordeaux. A
moving platform in the center of the house can be raised or lowered
among the three floors. This arrangement not only gives mobility to
the owner, who uses a wheelchair, but it also creates different
spatial arrangements with each move.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic public/private intercourse can be seen in
Shigeru Ban's Curtain Wall House. Located in a densely populated
Toyko neighborhood, it has glass walls and dramatic 2-story fabric
curtains that can be closed to obtain privacy or opened to create a
stage as public as any outdoor amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   A new domestic architecture has been developed in response to
the radical transformation of the nuclear family: more couples
without children, same-sex couples, people living alone and
families with children from previous marriages. Many couples
without children have adopted loft living. Families with children
from previous marriages have constructed separate spaces adjacent
to the main house to afford the children as well as the parents a
sense of autonomy and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The social conditions and structures that drove the development
of the private house _ the need for privacy, the separation of
living and work, the family, domesticity _ have all changed
drastically, perhaps more so in the past 50 years than in the
preceding four centuries, Riley says.
</P>
<P>
   The houses he chose to document these changes form the first of
five thematic exhibitions made possible by the Lily Auchincloss
Fund for Contemporary Architecture. The architects who designed
them are not only reconfiguring the domestic landscape, Riley says,
they are also ``laying the groundwork for the 21st century.''

TALKING TACKY TO SOME FOLK WHO DESERVE IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE ELY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although I readily admit I occasionally have experienced some
pretty high-level indignation with an individual or two in my line
of work, never can I recall feeling pure, total outrage with a
great band of folk in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let the record reflect: I am purely, totally outraged.
</P>
<P>
   I am outraged at most of the sentiment reported out of the Unity
convention in Seattle about Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumed
leader in the race for the Republican presidential nomination in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   First came reports that many of the participants were quite
unhappy because Bush, though he was to be in Seattle last week, was
not planning an appearance at the meeting of the group called
Unity: Journalists of Color Inc., a coalition of four associations
of minority journalists _ blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and
Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign decided the candidate's Seattle schedule was
too full for an appearance at the convention _ which reportedly
drew about 6,000, and many of the conventioneers decided that was a
snub by him and didn't like it worth a damn.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, it should be noted, did any who were quoted after Bush did
a hurried walk-through like that worth a damn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you might say that as far as the Unity convention was
concerned, Bush was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't have anything to do with Bush or his candidacy.
Nor does my outrage have anything to do with the fact those quoted
as being angry and/or disappointed with Bush are members of the
minority groups represented at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   My outrage is because those quoted consider themselves
journalists, and in most instances the kind of journalists whose
jobs call for them to handle any assignment, political or
otherwise, fairly and objectively.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that members of groups with ``journalists'' in the
name can and do influence the news angers me, frightens me, makes
me want to bash my head against a wall because of the oppression of
having my trade turn on me.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spoke in scorn because Bush wasn't coming and then
spoke in contempt as they viewed the brevity of his visit an insult
happened to insult me and, I fervently hope, about a jillion others
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Seattle-based magazine photographer and a member
of the Hispanic journalists association most decidedly was not
speaking from his Hispanic standpoint when he claimed
disappointment on hearing the original report Bush would not
appear. What he reportedly said of the Texas governor was: ``He
should take advantage of this and bring his word to the people who
will cover his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, good grief.
</P>
<P>
   I consider it outright horrifying that someone who calls himself
a journalist even thought that, much less said it. That is a
thought that should not even occur to someone in the news end of
this business. Indeed, it's really pushing the proverbial envelope
for writers of editorials or columns to suggest such a thing _
except, perhaps, in disassociating themselves from any who do think
it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I disassociate myself from such as the Chicago television
anchorman and member of the black journalists group who actually
had the atrocious gall to contend: ``This is a community that can
make or break most candidates. He Bush should be here. He should
not overlook us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, woe is me.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of overlooking, I am in agony that the leaders of these
four groups and this convention not only overlooked an idiotic
statement such as that, they contributed to the appalling notion
Bush should have heeded their bidding not because they represent
minorities but because they call themselves journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if they truly are journalists, then they shame us all with
this professional heresy. No wonder the public is coming to have
little faith in and virtually no regard for this trade.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in it. I've spent my entire adult life working on
newspapers, and now I'm wondering. I cherish the people's right to
know and absolutely believe it is an almost sacred obligation to
strive to ensure the reporting of as many facts of worth as can be
gathered honestly.
</P>
<P>
   No genuine journalist or group of journalists ever would think
otherwise. And, for the record, let it be noted a colleague at the
convention stressed there were many _ maybe, in his words, an
``unscientific half'' _ who had no strong feelings one way or the
other about Bush's presence and maybe didn't even join in the later
standing ovations for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, while I certainly think others have the right to
belong to organizations and go to meetings and conventions, I'm
rather of the school that maintains journalists really shouldn't
meet in largish groups _ except maybe to drink or talk tacky about
others in the so-called media, be it their own branch or another.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure not remotely interested in drinking with any who claim
they as journalists can influence the news, can make or break
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   I am, however, fully prepared _ indeed enormously motivated _ to
talk tacky about them. Which I just did _ because I think they were
tacky.
</P>
<P>
   They demeaned the news business _ something I cherish and honor
and stand ready to defend. I just wish I didn't have to defend it
from some who are in it. &QL;

<P>
   MANAGED-CARE (Washington) _ As the Senate begins debate on
legislation to provide a ``bill of rights'' for patients,
Republicans warn that Democratic plans to regulate managed care

`GRANNY D': PATRIOT OF THE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, we examined the roots of American patriotism. Today,
I hold up a sprightly 89-year-old woman from New Hampshire as
walking proof that patriotism, idealism and citizen activism still
live, despite the widespread cynicism that invades our political
processes.
</P>
<P>
   My nominee for Patriot of the Year is Doris Haddock, known
affectionately to 11 great grandchildren as ``Granny D.'' She is
walking across America, from Los Angeles to the nation's capital,
in an effort to awaken Americans to the insidious dangers of big
campaign contributions which, she is convinced, are corrupting our
electoral system and threaten to destroy the very soul of our
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I talked with this slightly built woman in Fort Worth,
which she calls the ``halfway point'' in her journey. Thinking of
her New England roots, I could not help comparing her mission with
that of Paul Revere. Asked why she treks across American on a
mission some have called a fool's errand, she says: ``Let me tell
you about impossible causes. There are none on this Earth if they
are good causes.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey by foot, from one end of our country to the other,
has not been without hardship. Mrs. Haddock suffered dehydration
crossing the Mojave Desert in Arizona and had to be hospitalized
for four days.
</P>
<P>
   She has emphysema, acquired before she quit smoking some 20
years ago. Arthritis requires her to wear a steel-ribbed corset as
she walks. A hearing aid helps her to identify the sounds of
traffic. ``Aside from emphysema, arthritis and poor hearing,'' she
jokes, ``I'm in great shape!''
</P>
<P>
   Followed by a van staffed by volunteers, the determined reformer
wears a broad straw hat and sensible shoes while walking a measured
10 miles daily, starting before sun-up to avoid the midday heat.
She has walked Mondays through Saturdays, beginning New Year's Day
in the Rose Bowl, and calculates that she'll reach Washington,
D.C., on her 90th birthday Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, she will deliver to House Speaker Dennis Hastert and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott a truckload of petitions she has
gathered along the way. The messages, signed by many thousands of
private citizens, demand that congressional leaders schedule votes
on bills to tighten election laws. She wants to stem the growing
tide of outrageously big campaign contributions from corporate
interests with legislative axes to grind, which increasingly
dominate American political life.
</P>
<P>
   This remarkable woman's coast-to-coast pilgrimage began on a
shoestring and a mountain of faith. It has been abetted by friends
and volunteers who carefully measure each day's 10-mile journey and
line up speaking appearances and hospitable lodging for each
night's rest.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, for example, she stayed at the home of attorney
Harold Hammet, who first became acquainted with Mrs. Haddock's
family four decades ago when he was a student at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Widowed a few years back, her children and grandchildren grown,
Granny D depends for most of her livelihood on Social Security.
Last year, when her best friend died, the hopeful reformer says:
``I looked at my life and my lifelong beliefs and said to myself,
`How can I turn my pain into something beautiful or at least useful
in the world? What work can I do as a memorial to those I miss?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a July Fourth speech to a Unitarian church in Dallas, Mrs.
Haddock explained, ``I do this for my great-grandchildren and all
the many boys and girls who may someday want to run for office.''
And for the hundreds of people she knows ``who love this country
and are deeply worried.'' Reflecting upon the almost 1,800 miles of
her journey thus far, she added: ``I do it for the truck drivers,
the engineers of the trains who blow their horns for me, and the
schoolchildren who yell, `Go, Granny, go!' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, Mayor Kenneth Barr and the Fort Worth City
Council officially proclaimed July 6 Doris ``Granny D'' Haddock
day. She shared her honor with newly crowned World Bantamweight
Boxing Champion Paulie Ayala, who hugged her joyfully.
</P>
<P>
   Her self-appointed mission to shame Congress into reforming
campaign practices is not Mrs. Haddock's first Quixotic venture.
Her daughter, Betty Lawrenz, remembers with a chuckle when her
mother encouraged the churches of their city to sponsor dances for
teen-agers, to assure a wholesome environment. One church broke the
ice, and others soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1960, Mrs. Haddock and her husband, along with
their local Episcopal priest, traveled to Alaska to protect a
village of native Alaskans from being uprooted by the government
for an underground nuclear bomb test. They prevailed, and the
eviction order was never carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her life, the determined lady says, she has refused
to ask whether a cause is achievable. She asks, instead, if it's
right. If it passes that test, she asks what she can do as one
person to help it come about.
</P>
<P>
   It was this reasoning, and this faith, that began her
coast-to-coast journey last New Year's Day. At first largely
ignored, she now has the attention of national TV networks.
Considering her track record, I wouldn't bet against her.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism takes many forms, as varied as the shapes of
snowflakes under a microscope. From Nathan Hale's regret that he
had but one life to give for his country, to poet Ernest Crosby's
belief that it's even more heroic to live for one's country, our
democracy has been sustained by the faith of patriots who, like
Mrs. Haddock, see a need and give themselves to it.

TALKING TACKY TO SOME FOLK WHO DESERVE IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Sub to include (at) symbol in e-mail address) 
 
By JANE ELY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although I readily admit I occasionally have experienced some
pretty high-level indignation with an individual or two in my line
of work, never can I recall feeling pure, total outrage with a
great band of folk in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let the record reflect: I am purely, totally outraged.
</P>
<P>
   I am outraged at most of the sentiment reported out of the Unity
convention in Seattle about Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumed
leader in the race for the Republican presidential nomination in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   First came reports that many of the participants were quite
unhappy because Bush, though he was to be in Seattle last week, was
not planning an appearance at the meeting of the group called
Unity: Journalists of Color Inc., a coalition of four associations
of minority journalists _ blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and
Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign decided the candidate's Seattle schedule was
too full for an appearance at the convention _ which reportedly
drew about 6,000, and many of the conventioneers decided that was a
snub by him and didn't like it worth a damn.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, it should be noted, did any who were quoted after Bush did
a hurried walk-through like that worth a damn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you might say that as far as the Unity convention was
concerned, Bush was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't have anything to do with Bush or his candidacy.
Nor does my outrage have anything to do with the fact those quoted
as being angry and/or disappointed with Bush are members of the
minority groups represented at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   My outrage is because those quoted consider themselves
journalists, and in most instances the kind of journalists whose
jobs call for them to handle any assignment, political or
otherwise, fairly and objectively.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that members of groups with ``journalists'' in the
name can and do influence the news angers me, frightens me, makes
me want to bash my head against a wall because of the oppression of
having my trade turn on me.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spoke in scorn because Bush wasn't coming and then
spoke in contempt as they viewed the brevity of his visit an insult
happened to insult me and, I fervently hope, about a jillion others
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Seattle-based magazine photographer and a member
of the Hispanic journalists association most decidedly was not
speaking from his Hispanic standpoint when he claimed
disappointment on hearing the original report Bush would not
appear. What he reportedly said of the Texas governor was: ``He
should take advantage of this and bring his word to the people who
will cover his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, good grief.
</P>
<P>
   I consider it outright horrifying that someone who calls himself
a journalist even thought that, much less said it. That is a
thought that should not even occur to someone in the news end of
this business. Indeed, it's really pushing the proverbial envelope
for writers of editorials or columns to suggest such a thing _
except, perhaps, in disassociating themselves from any who do think
it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I disassociate myself from such as the Chicago television
anchorman and member of the black journalists group who actually
had the atrocious gall to contend: ``This is a community that can
make or break most candidates. He Bush should be here. He should
not overlook us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, woe is me.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of overlooking, I am in agony that the leaders of these
four groups and this convention not only overlooked an idiotic
statement such as that, they contributed to the appalling notion
Bush should have heeded their bidding not because they represent
minorities but because they call themselves journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if they truly are journalists, then they shame us all with
this professional heresy. No wonder the public is coming to have
little faith in and virtually no regard for this trade.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in it. I've spent my entire adult life working on
newspapers, and now I'm wondering. I cherish the people's right to
know and absolutely believe it is an almost sacred obligation to
strive to ensure the reporting of as many facts of worth as can be
gathered honestly.
</P>
<P>
   No genuine journalist or group of journalists ever would think
otherwise. And, for the record, let it be noted a colleague at the
convention stressed there were many _ maybe, in his words, an
``unscientific half'' _ who had no strong feelings one way or the
other about Bush's presence and maybe didn't even join in the later
standing ovations for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, while I certainly think others have the right to
belong to organizations and go to meetings and conventions, I'm
rather of the school that maintains journalists really shouldn't
meet in largish groups _ except maybe to drink or talk tacky about
others in the so-called media, be it their own branch or another.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure not remotely interested in drinking with any who claim
they as journalists can influence the news, can make or break
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   I am, however, fully prepared _ indeed enormously motivated _ to
talk tacky about them. Which I just did _ because I think they were
tacky.
</P>
<P>
   They demeaned the news business _ something I cherish and honor
and stand ready to defend. I just wish I didn't have to defend it
from some who are in it. &QL;

BUSH COULD CHIP IN A LITTLE FOR SECURITY TAB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although he spends much of his time away from
home now, George W. Bush didn't stop being governor of Texas when
he started running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was a good idea for him to give up his state
salary _ about $316 a day _ when he is campaigning out of state.
That will keep Texas taxpayers from having to pay that amount to
both him and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who becomes acting governor and
draws the governor's higher pay when Bush is away.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a good idea, from a public relations standpoint, for
Bush to announce that decision a few hours after the publication of
a newspaper report that questioned another campaign-related public
expense _ how much it was costing Texas taxpayers for Bush's
state-paid bodyguards to tour the country with the presidential
race's champion fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin American-Statesman, which carried the story, didn't
get an answer to that question because the Department of Public
Safety, for whom the governor's security guards work, doesn't
discuss security arrangements or costs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Secret Service agents, whose salaries and travel
costs are shared by all the nation's taxpayers, will take over
Bush's security. But, for now, the governor will continue to be
accompanied on each trip by an undisclosed number of plainclothes
DPS officers.
</P>
<P>
   Officers traveling with the governor fly on planes furnished by
the Bush campaign, which also pays for their hotel rooms. But some
officers fly on commercial planes, for which the taxpayers
eventually are billed. And the state also pays their salaries,
including overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign says it doesn't plan to cover those extra
expenses, even though Bush has raised more than $36 million for his
campaign, almost twice as much as the other candidates for the
Republican presidential nomination combined.
</P>
<P>
   It is the DPS' job to protect the governor, Bush campaign
staffers say, and they are correct. Bush is entitled to the extra
protection. Security obviously can't end when the governor leaves
the state Capitol _ or even the state. Security is an
around-the-clock job, more demanding than ever now that Bush is a
national figure.
</P>
<P>
   A governor is entitled to some sort of private life, the pursuit
of happiness away from the office, and security must be there also.
</P>
<P>
   Some activities, of course, pose more extensive or specialized
security demands than others. One of these days, Texas may even
have a governor who aspires to be a world champion skydiver. Well,
it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   DPS troopers have accompanied Texas governors _ at taxpayer
expense _ to social and political events around the country for
years. This governor's extracurricular pursuit just happens to be a
very public race for high national office.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Hillary Rodham Clinton is prompting similar
questions about taxpayer-paid security costs for her exploratory
travels around New York state, where she is considering running for
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his campaign staffers may be betting that most Texas
taxpayers don't mind the extra expense of protecting the governor.
If so, they probably are, once again, correct.
</P>
<P>
   Most people recognize security as a necessity for high-profile
officeholders and candidates, and most Texas voters expected Bush
to run for president when they overwhelmingly re-elected him last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a front-burner issue. But, nevertheless, most of the
governor's Texas supporters wouldn't object if Bush were to
voluntarily decide to spare a few thousand dollars a month to
partially repay the taxpayers for his security costs.
</P>
<P>
   With his fund-raising operation raking in campaign dollars at a
record pace, he should be able to afford the extra expense.
</P>
<P>
   And, like his decision to cut his salary, it would be a positive
political gesture. He may want to think about that _ if he has the
time.

   CHINA-TAIWAN (Beijing) _ Taiwan declared Monday that it will no

are two parts of the same country, provoking an immediate and

that has been a basic condition of all its talks with China, Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui has chosen to take a step away from the

Manhattan office. But a lot is going on with the country's raucous
press these days, much of it unsettling, and Russians who have been
fitting the pieces together do not find such a sale strange at all.

the rights of patients and regulate the companies that provide
health insurance for most Americans. The legislation, dubbed the
Patients' Bill of Rights, is the first of several politically
potent health care issues _ ranging from overhaul of Medicare to
holding down the cost of prescription drugs _ to come to the fore
in Congress this session. It would regulate health maintenance
organizations and has broad implications for doctors, employers and

   DOOMED-STADIUMS (Seattle) _ These are dark and difficult days
for many of America's domed stadiums, which were once hailed as
climate-controlled, multi-purpose technological marvels but, after
barely a generation, are increasingly considered obsolete by fans
and owners alike. In several cases, in places that might be
described as a bit climatically challenged, owners have been able
to entice or strongarm their cities into adopting the vastly more
expensive, have-it-all philosophy embodied in outdoor stadiums with
retractable roofs and bolstered by the go-go economy of the '90s.
These splashy convertible models are already in use Toronto and
Phoenix; Seattle is set this week to open Safeco Field, with a
retractable steel-rail canopy; and Houston and Milwaukee will open
retractable-roof stadiums next year. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

   The gym, Fitness First for Women and Seniors, is one of a
growing number of fitness centers that are beginning to replace
stretching mats with more elaborate equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drake bought the Stretch Zone stretching station, made by
Keiser Corp., about a year ago. The semicircular frame can be used
to perform 17 different stretches and can accommodate up to eight
people at once. Ms. Drake says the machine provides support and
structure for those who would normally have trouble stretching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my clients are 95 years old,'' Ms. Drake said. ``They
have trouble getting down onto the floor and getting up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Groves, a spokeswoman for Keiser, based in Fresno,
Calif., said that sales were initially slow for the Stretch Zone
when it was introduced about two and a half years ago, but have
picked up in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Groves speculates that this new demand is due in part to the
release of the American College of Sports Medicine's 1998 exercise
guidelines which, for the first time ever, recommended that people
who exercise regularly should stretch at least twice a week to
preserve flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The sports medicine report definitely increased awareness of the
importance of stretching, Ms. Groves said. More than 250 fitness
centers have bought a Stretch Zone or the smaller Stretch Corner
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Precor U.S.A. also has succeeded with its Stretch Trainer, a
machine with a seat designed to tilt backward as the user leans
forward. A combination of body weight and gravity help control the
intensity of the stretch and by switching hand and leg positions,
the user can stretch nearly every muscle in the body without
getting out of the seat. Since its introduction in late 1997, more
than 4,500 of the $399 units have been sold to home users. About
3,000 of the larger, more substantial gym models have been sold
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Stretch Zone and Stretch Trainer are among the various
stretching apparatus that are being marketed to consumers and gyms.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Miller, owner of the Gym Source, an exercise equipment
supplier in New York, speculates that manufacturers are attempting
to create a new category of fitness machines because sales of
cardiovascular and strength training equipment have been flat in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that the trend will last,'' Miller said,
``because stretching with apparatus is less natural than stretching
without. Machines isolate one part of the body at a time which is
less effective than incorporating additional muscles into the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller suggests that smaller stretching devices like the Pro
Stretch, a small half moon shaped piece of plastic engineered to
stretch the ankle and foot, have the most staying power because
this area is difficult to stretch otherwise. It sells for about
$30.
</P>
<P>
   Others also question the necessity of using an expensive device
to increase flexibility. In a study, not yet published, Dr. Barry
Bates, a professor of biomechanics and human performance at the
University of Oregon at Eugene, had 40 subjects ages 20 to 60
perform regular stretching routines for eight weeks. Half of the
subjects used a device similar to the Precor Stretch Trainer and
half stretched without using any equipment. At the end of the
study, Bates found virtually identical flexibility gains among both
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Bates added that those who used machines liked them and got
more incentive to stretch. They reported that the machines made
stretching physically and psychologically easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is merit to the fact that some people may be more
inclined to stretch if they have a thing that helps them do it,''
Bates said. ``Having something to interact with can make a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates also said he believed there might be some advantage to
having a piece of equipment to help control body positioning and
the extent of the stretch. ``This may help prevent overstretching
and injury,'' he added.  &QL;

`A SHORT HISTORY OF RUDENESS:' MINDING MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a man with an indeterminate face, growing a mustache can be
a solution: the face may not look much like him, but the mustache
will. The subtitle of Mark Caldwell's book gives a better idea of
it than the title does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudeness'' is announced but only cursorily treated in
Caldwell's sociocultural dissertation. This is a pity since, apart
from ritual warnings that Americans are lapsing into terminal
boorishness, the subject has been little explored since the
mid-19th century, when a procession of British writers came over to
tell us about it. Paradoxical, to a degree, since the only person
capable of greater offense than a bad-mannered American is a
well-mannered Brit.
</P>
<P>
   Rudeness might have been more interesting to read about than the
subtitle's ``Manners, Morals and Misbehavior.'' (Rudeness is not
the same as misbehavior, being at once more elusive and quite
unmistakable. We may not be sure how the dart was shot; we know it
hit us.)
</P>
<P>
   These broader subjects are regularly treated in books and
magazines and in the slow sections of newspapers. Caldwell ranges
wide, writing about class, workplace etiquette, the mobility of
Americans, children, sexual mores, Internet manners and much else,
but a good deal of his material and thinking inevitably seem
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   There are picturesque details and asides, though many seem to
fit better in a general social history than a particular history of
manners. Early in the century, the profitable and much-read weekly
scandal sheet Town Topics regularly singed New York's upper crust
by printing accounts of its members' indiscretions. Their
identities were withheld, though they weren't hard for insiders to
guess; and you didn't have to be an insider to notice the
systematic placement of innocuous items _ complete with names _
just after the anonymous ones.
</P>
<P>
   According to Caldwell, William d'Alton Mann, the proprietor, was
moved by genuine indignation over his wastrel socialite
acquaintances. Indignation was allayed if they invested in
``Topics.'' Since no favor ever goes unpunished, the flattering
pieces that ensued signaled to the world that their subjects
obviously had something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Another section concerns the etiquette among factory workers
turned up by a 1920s study of a telephone factory. Management
thought to increase productivity by giving bonuses for output above
the bogey, or fixed quota. In fact, suspicious that this would lead
to raising the quota, the workers used an elaborate protocol to
keep their output a little below it. This included craps games,
gossip and resting and was enforced by a ``bing'' (a painful
arm-poke) to anybody who worked too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The binged one was allowed a bing in return (in those days the
notion of punishment did not exclude the notion of dignity), but
the lesson was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Caldwell's subjects are tired and tiring. We don't
really need pages and pages about the growth of expenditure on
weddings and funerals, or American mobility, or the changes in
dating mores over the decades. The author soil-sifts where others
have broken ground: much of his diligent research seems to have
been in primary-sourced and fresher books, and in newspapers and
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural-studies field draws a lot from such material, as
well as from advertising and television programs. It is in keeping
with the academic trend to seek authenticity, as Marie Antoinette
sought it in milkmaid and shepherdess games, in what it deems
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand _ junk food in, junk food out _ it doesn't do
much for the reader. Anyway, the point of junk-food studies is not
to sling the evidence but to use it for interesting ideas. Only
some of Caldwell's ideas are interesting; many are decidedly fuzzy
or wander off in different directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   After writing of the lavish growth in American spending on
weddings and funerals _ consumerism replacing ritual, he nicely
calls it _ he argues that it is a kind of democratizing. You don't
need to be well born or educated to achieve status; all you need is
money. Ingenious up to a point, but what do you get in a
Depression: a bread line armed with ``Brides'' magazines?
</P>
<P>
   He writes of Internet flaming and asks, reasonably, how real
this ``virtual'' viciousness is. He makes an interesting comparison
with the ritualized melodrama of grand opera and the verbal
slanging in 1930s film comedies. Yet here as elsewhere he misses an
obvious distinction. On Internet chat rooms (voyeurism reversed:
the user is Godiva looking for Peeping Toms), we are not just
spectators but actors, even if virtual.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter on children notes that the nurturing and expansive
approaches of Dr. Spock and Robert Coles have been eroded by
harsher institutional attitudes; the move, for example, to
criminalize youthful misbehavior. Without exactly condoning this,
he suggests that society fails to allow for parents stressed out by
their children's misconduct. He does his point no favor by citing
``the hysterical eruption of public hatred'' against Susan Smith,
who strapped her two children into her car and drowned them.
</P>
<P>
   He is not always so wrong-footed. Rebutting conservative
doomsayers, he points out that manners and morals are not the same
thing. Diogenes, for instance, was rude and right. He argues
usefully that manners are a frail and uncertain instrument for
solving profound social questions. Language codes _ here he goes
against a part of the left _ are counterproductive when too
rigorously relied upon to fight the battles of gender and race.
</P>
<P>
   A vein of good sense runs through the book, but its fatty layer
of potted research and sluggish thinking make it hard to get to. At
the end, inconclusively concluding that he cannot judge whether
civility or rudeness is winning out, Caldwell writes that the
incidences are ``so protean as to vex the analyst, frustrate the
historian and elude the scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   He might try a writer. Together, these 274 pages lack a 10th of
the candlepower of a single phrase on the same subject by the
English novelist Elizabeth Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   Manners, she wrote, are ``the exercise of the imagination on
behalf of others.''

 THE SHUTTLE UNDERTAKES A MISSION FOR X-RAY ASTRONOMY  (The Science
Times)  By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first woman ever to command a space shuttle or
any other spacecraft, Col. Eileen M. Collins of the Air Force, is
to take that step soon while hauling into orbit one of the largest
and most costly science payloads of all time and then guiding her
winged spaceship back to Earth for a tricky night landing.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, Colonel Collins and four crew mates on the shuttle
Columbia are to carry into space the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra, a $2.7-billion giant, is to open a large new window
on cosmic extremes of violence and power, including exploding stars
and baffling objects at the heart of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   As a pioneering woman, Colonel Collins is familiar with the
public-affairs rigors of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and has had the opportunity to meet President and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, telling the first lady in detail about her
forthcoming mission.
</P>
<P>
   In the cool, laconic style of astronauts, Colonel Collins, the
first woman in NASA's 40-year history to command a space flight,
plays down the attention and danger and says that all the technical
and the political pressures have put her under no unusual stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You focus on your job and do the best you can,'' she told
reporters last week. ``I don't really think about whether I'm
comfortable in this role or not.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, her flight is challenging and important.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra observatory and its rocket engine, weighing more
than 20 tons and measuring 57 feet in length, are the largest and
heaviest shuttle payload ever to fly.
</P>
<P>
   As such, they pose a potential hazard for Colonel Collins if
Columbia has to make an emergency return to Earth shortly after
blastoff. The shuttle glides to a landing, and the presence of the
huge observatory would make the orbiter unusually speedy and tail
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   If the observatory is put into orbit successfully, Colonel
Collins on return to Earth will still face night-landing risks. The
landing is scheduled for July 24 at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida, close to midnight, the 12th night landing in shuttle
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much different'' from a daylight touchdown because the
pilot has fewer visual cues, Colonel Collins, 42, said. She added
that she and her backup pilot, using a laptop computer, would
practice landings even while in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But mission dangers, she said, pale in comparison to the
benefits of the new observatory, which NASA has envisioned for
decades. ``We're very excited about this flight,'' she said. ``This
is a dream come true for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The observatory, named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, a
Nobel-winning astrophysicist who worked at the University of
Chicago, is meant to chart new worlds of X-rays emitted by cosmic
objects like quasars, exploding stars and possibly black holes _
stars so dense that light cannot escape their gravitational grip.
</P>
<P>
   Black holes are suspected of lying at the heart of many galaxies
and helping hold the dense aggregations of stars together.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that, as the giant holes devour everything in
sight, matter rushes inward and bursts of X-rays fly outward.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered that nearly all cosmic objects _
stars, galaxies, supernovae, gas clouds _ give off X-rays. But the
exact causes are often unclear, in part because telescopic
snapshots are usually so fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The eye and optical telescopes are blind to X-rays, which have
wavelengths too short for humans to see or for ordinary optics to
focus. Moreover, the Earth's thick atmosphere blocks X-rays from
ever reaching the ground.
</P>
<P>
   So cosmic X-rays, usually generated by the tremendous heat and
energy of cataclysmic events, can be viewed only by special
instruments in space.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials say the Chandra observatory is up to 100 times
more sensitive than any other X-ray telescope lofted into space
since such studies began 34 years ago, making significant progress
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be much, much, much better than science
fiction,'' Harvey D. Tananbaum, head of the Chandra X-ray Center in
Cambridge, Mass., which will run the observatory, told reporters
last week at the NASA pre-mission briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Ledbetter, head of payload development at NASA
headquarters, added, ``We can make Superman jealous with our X-ray
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The last big American X-ray telescope, the High Energy Astronomy
Observatory-2, known as Einstein, operated 350 miles above Earth
from 1978 to 1981. By contrast, Chandra is to speed through space
in a highly elliptical orbit that takes the observatory up to
one-third of the way to the Moon, as high as 86,992 miles. The
distant orbit, far above the Earth's radiation belts, which can fog
sensitive detectors seeking very faint X-rays, will allow much
longer exposures and thus greatly improve the telescope's
performance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like a time machine, Chandra should be able to peer back 10
billion years ago, when the universe was very young. It has taken
that long for powerful bursts of X-rays from quasars, moving at the
speed of light, to reach the Earth's neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers believe the heart of such ``quasi-stellar'' objects
hold black holes so powerful that their radiations outshine their
galactic hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists around the globe filed 800 proposals to use Chandra _
four times as many as could be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited,'' said Kimberly Weaver, an astrophysicist
at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who is one
of the scientists set to use the X-ray observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Some distant galaxies fire jets of X-rays in opposite directions
from revolving disks. Among other things, Dr. Weaver plans to study
such jets with Chandra, hoping to track them in closer to galactic
cores, possibly tying their origin to black holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chandra will help us a lot,'' she told reporters. ``I think of
jets as a marker that helps us understand what's going on inside.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Astronomers, astronauts and NASA officials are doubly excited
about Chandra because the giant observatory has been a long time
coming.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Congress slowed the work because it was skeptical that
the observatory's tricky mirrors could be made readily. Then, some
of the project's computer software was found to have failings.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, NASA delayed its launching after discovering
that some of its circuit boards were possibly flawed. Most
recently, in April, the agency again postponed the flight after an
unmanned rocket using the same kind of attached booster rocket
meant to push the observatory into its final orbit malfunctioned,
forcing new inspections and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials say that the great observatory is now ready to
open a new chapter in scientific discovery, and that its deployment
should go smoothly since Colonel Collins and her astronaut
crewmates have had extra time to prepare for ferrying it into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   As Ledbetter of NASA headquarters said last week, ``Everybody's
done a marvelous job in overcoming the difficulties.''

SEXUALITY RESEARCH ON WOMEN IS LACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A host of pharmaceutical companies are working to do for women
what Viagra does for men. To do this effectively, they need far
more scientific data on female sexual response than is presently
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inadvertently, Viagra has done a world of good in the field of
research into female sexual function,'' said Dr. Cindy M. Meston,
professor of clinical psychology at the University of Texas at
Austin, who has one of the few labs in the United States that
measures physical changes in sexual arousal in women. ``After years
of very few opportunities for funding, I am now deluged by offers
from pharmaceutical companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about what facilitates or inhibits feminine
sexual arousal, Dr. Meston said. ``The nerves that innervate the
female genitalia have not been intensely studied,'' she said. ``All
we know is that we don't know much.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Dr. Meston's preliminary research findings is that sexual
arousal in women is aided by exercise. She also investigates ways
to counter the dampening effects of antidepressants on orgasm in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinicians don't know what to do about delayed and abolished
orgasms associated with antidepressants, because we don't know
what's really causing these side effects in the first place,'' Dr.
Meston said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory A. Broderick, professor of urology at the Mayo
Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., is concerned with a different
research area in female sexuality _ damage to nerves during
hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For men,'' Broderick said, ``we spare the nerves important for
erection when we do radical prostatectomy, but there hasn't been an
equal amount of attention given to the concept of nerve-sparing
hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at standard medical textbooks, there's no
discussion of how to preserve sexual sensation when operating
either through the abdomen or through the vagina,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why the dearth of research-based information on these neural
pathways? Dr. Sandra Leiblum, professor of psychiatry at the Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, N.J., said she suspected
it was because ``most male researchers are more interested in male
genitalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julia R. Heiman, the director of reproductive and sexual
medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle, said she hoped
the federal government would also support additional research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vivian W. Pinn, the director of the Office of Research on
Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health, said that her
agency was aware of the lack of research on women's sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is so little scientific data, interventions to
treat women's sexual problems have lagged behind those developed
for men,'' Pinn said. ``We've brought breast cancer and menopause
out of the closet. It's time to address the issues of sound
research initiatives to better define women's sexual functions and
dysfunctions.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: STRENGTH TRAINING FOR YOUNGER MUSCLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., column has changed from what was on earlier sked.)  
(kd) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am not what anyone would call a typical sedentary middle-aged
American. At 58, I still do at least one and usually two or three
forms of physical activity every day. My regular year-round
activities include fitness walking, singles tennis and lap
swimming, as well as ice skating in winter and bike riding the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   So I was a bit taken aback when an exercise physiologist asked
if I did any form of strength training. Don't my regular activities
keep me as strong as I'm likely to get? Don't swimming and tennis
give my arms and shoulders enough of a workout to keep upper body
muscles strong? And don't my other activities do the same for my
legs and hips?
</P>
<P>
   But when I tried to do a few bicep curls with a two-pound hand
weight or lift myself up on a chinning bar, I learned otherwise.
Could I save myself if I were hanging from a cliff? Might I have
had an easier time biking the hills of southern Spain last fall if
my leg muscles had been stronger at the start?
</P>
<P>
   The exercise physiologist explained that to get strong and stay
strong, muscles need to be worked regularly against resistance
until they fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Lest this sound forbidding, let me assure you that it is neither
difficult nor particularly time-consuming to build and maintain
muscle strength that can make an enormous difference in your
lasting health and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to leave your house, join a gym or buy costly
exercise equipment. Whether you are a man, woman or child, by
devoting just 20 minutes two or three times a week to strength
training, the rewards you can reap will more than make up for the
time and effort. And it's never too late to start. Even people in
their 80s and 90s can gain muscle strength that will help reduce
their risk of injury and illness and improve their outlooks on
life.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have shunned the idea of muscle-building exercise
because they harbor misconceptions about what it is, whom it is for
and what it does to the body. Strength training is not the same as
body-building, a ``sport'' that is more like a beauty contest of
overdeveloped musculature.
</P>
<P>
   Strength training can add tone and definition to the shape of
your limbs and any other body part you work on, but it won't make
you inflexibly muscle-bound or turn you into a Charles Atlas of
bulging muscles. Nor will you be lifting heavy weights that make
you grunt and groan. Rather, strength training involves using small
weights or working against resistance such that you are able to
repeat the movement 10 to 15 times before your muscles get too
tired to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Women are often inhibited by the fear that lifting weights will
cause them to look too masculine. This can happen only if women
take high doses of testosterone or, occasionally, if a woman with
an inherited predisposition to develop big muscles does
high-intensity workouts. For the vast majority of women, strength
training offers an opportunity to reduce flab and improve
appearance without detracting one iota from femininity.
</P>
<P>
   Even children can do strength training without harm. Dr. Steven
Fleck, an exercise physiologist in Colorado Springs and a
consultant to the Georgia Tech Sports Medicine &AMP; Performance
Newsletter, says any child old enough to participate in organized
sports is old enough to do age-appropriate resistance training if
the correct techniques are used. Such training not only can improve
children's fitness levels but also their self-esteem and their
athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
   WHY GET STRONGER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aerobic exercise, like running, brisk walking, cycling or lap
swimming, can improve your overall level of fitness and the
functioning of your heart and lungs, but it won't necessarily make
the muscles throughout your body significantly stronger or ward off
the loss of muscle with age.
</P>
<P>
   Strength training can prevent much of the muscle deterioration
that otherwise inevitably occurs as people get older. As you age,
the cells of the body's muscles, more than 600 of them, gradually
decrease in size and number.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas D. Fahey, director of exercise physiologist at
California State University in Chico, noted in an article in
Healthline that between the ages of 40 and 60, the average person
loses up to 20 percent of muscle mass unless something is done to
prevent or slow that loss.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he wrote, there is a gradual loss of connections
between nerves and the muscle cells they control, making it more
difficult for the nervous system to activate the muscles. ``These
changes rob you of the strength you need to climb stairs, run for a
bus or prevent falls,'' Dr. Fahey said.
</P>
<P>
   A study of nursing home residents aged 72 to 98 showed that 10
weeks of progressive strength training for the muscles in the thigh
and lower leg increased their strength by an average of 113 percent
and improved the participants' walking speed and ability to climb
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The training also is likely to increase bone density, thereby
reducing the risk of fracture. Any increase in bone density after
menopause is a big plus, since most women lose bone throughout the
second half of life.
</P>
<P>
   Increased muscle strength is a guaranteed energy enhancer. But
perhaps the biggest selling point for increasing your body's ratio
of muscle to fat is that muscle tissue is metabolically far more
active than fat tissue. This means you will burn more calories even
at rest.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, muscle tissue is more compact than the same weight
of fat. So by replacing fat with muscle, you can lose inches and
sizes without having to lose any weight at all. Just think of the
difference in appearance of a 250-pound football player and a
250-pound sedentary desk executive.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO
</P>
<P>
   Beginning strength trainers should definitely get professional
guidance. There are a number of excellent, well-illustrated books
that can help, but a few sessions with a trainer are better for
teaching correct form and correcting mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Check with your local exercise center. Many offer classes in
strength training or have trainers available. To do the exercises,
you can use hand and ankle weights in graduated sizes, elastic
resistance bands, resistance machines found in most gyms, cans of
soup or even your own body.
</P>
<P>
   You should start out with a weight that you can lift or push
against 10 to 15 times before your muscles fatigue. Then, as you
get stronger, the weight is gradually increased to produce further
strengthening. Training more than three times a week may be
counterproductive. As with most good things in life, you have to
continue working at strength training to maintain the gains.

MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO: BRAIN'S PATH FROM SIGHT TO ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (The Science Times)  
(DW) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   As anyone who has endured a sales meeting knows, to achieve a
goal, it is best to have a plan. What is good for the Avon lady is
good for the brain as well, even if the goal is as modest as
getting an arm to reach for an object. The brain must get from
Point A, where it receives a visual image, to Point B, where it
signals arm muscles to act.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have now
mapped part of this process, one step in the path from image to
action. Their work holds promise that people who are paralyzed will
someday be able to put limb-related brain activity to use.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem logical to assume that when the brain wants to
move an arm toward an object, it plans the movement from the arm's
frame of reference _ from where the arm is in relation to the
object, like a ringing telephone. The telephone might be above and
to the left of the arm at first, for example, and the brain would
make use of these coordinates, which are constantly changing as the
limb moves.
</P>
<P>
   But to their surprise, the researchers found that this was not
the case. It is the frame of reference of the eye that the brain
uses in developing what the researchers call a ``reach plan.'' So
the object might be above and to the left of the arm, but if it is
below and to the right in the field of view, that is what counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and others had thought that as soon as you got to a place
in the brain where action was being planned for limb movements, it
would be in limb coordinates,'' said Dr. Richard A. Andersen, an
author of a paper that describes the work in the current issue of
the journal Science. Although the brain eventually does transform
the information into limb-related coordinates to signal the
muscles, ``The plan to make a movement occurs before the visual
stimulus is recomputed,'' said Andersen, who directs the laboratory
where the work was undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers trained monkeys to push a grid of buttons on a
board and measured the electrical activity in neurons in the part
of the brain, the posterior parietal cortex, in which plans for
reaching are thought to be formulated. Tiny electrodes were
implanted in the neurons of the monkeys to measure their activity.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists set up two conditions for the monkeys: one where
they gazed at the same button while reaching for the other buttons,
and one where they reached for the same button over and over while
shifting their gaze to the other buttons. They found that when the
monkeys' gaze was fixed, the arm movements had no effect on neural
activity. But when it was the gaze that moved, the neurons fired at
a faster rate.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers figured out what was happening, Andersen
said, they realized that it made sense. For one thing, by using
visual coordinates, the brain avoids having to do a lot of
computation. Viewing a cluttered desk, for example, the brain uses
visual coordinates from the image to plan how to reach one object.
If the brain used limb coordinates instead, it would have to first
convert the visual coordinates into the coordinates of the arm
relative to all of the objects to determine how to get around them.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen said the knowledge might be used to help people with
paralyzed limbs, who are still capable of thinking about moving a
limb but cannot do so.
</P>
<P>
   Much research in this field is being done with the motor cortex,
in the frontal lobe of the brain, where the transformation into
limb coordinates for signaling the muscles appears to occur. But
using the parietal reach area might offer some advantages, Andersen
said. Since the motor cortex is more concerned with the biodynamics
of the limb, there is some evidence that it degenerates from the
disuse that comes from paralysis. The parietal region, however,
appears to be unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, Andersen said, would be to implant an array of
wires in the parietal lobe that would record the impulses as the
brain plans a movement and use them to move a prosthetic device, or
perhaps a computer cursor. To that end, the researchers have
implanted an experimental array in one of their monkeys that is
rigged to move an animated arm on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The trick for the researchers is to train the monkey to only
think about moving its arm.  &QL;

THE MAN WHO VANISHED INTO HIS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By MARCIA SHERMAN, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just over a year ago, Terry Dibert got up from his
desk in the school district headquarters in Bedford, Pa., and
vanished into his past.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like an opening line to a thriller. But for Dibert,
who left his computer running and his jacket on the back of his
chair, it was literally true.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later and 800 miles away, Dibert, the district's
business manager, reappeared near dawn in the midst of a natural
disaster. Police officers from Daytona Beach, Fla., found him early
on July 6, wandering on Interstate 95 through the blinding smoke
from wildfires that had shut the highway and forced the evacuation
of much of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Dibert told the police he was a 23-year-old sergeant trying to
rejoin his Army unit at Fort Bragg. He was worried about being
separated from his wife, who was pregnant with their first child.
</P>
<P>
   What he said was accurate, but 11 years out of date, as the
police discovered when they called Fort Bragg and found that
Dibert's unit had been gone for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For neurologists, amnesia is a fascinating if generally familiar
subject. The most common form is retrograde amnesia, in which some
or all recollections seem to have been misplaced, leaving the
patient stranded in the present. There is also anterograde amnesia,
in which old memories remain intact but new ones can no longer be
formed. Some traumas wipe out the events that led up to them. And
some patients lose only stored images and not words.
</P>
<P>
   But Dibert's case was different, more like ``a bad Twilight Zone
episode,'' as he put it in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistaking the present for the past is not typical of most
cases of memory disorder,'' said Dr. Scott Small, a
neurobehaviorist at New York Presbyterian Medical Center in
Manhattan. ``Most amnesiacs can register the present. What makes
this case so curious is its resemblance to a fugue state, and those
are generally psychogenic in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a neurologist encountering Dibert would have
diagnosed his time traveling as the product of emotional stress
rather than a brain disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Daytona Beach was full of people under emotional
stress last summer. So the police took him to the logical place: a
psychiatric hospital. Still convinced it was 1987, Dibert
eventually mentioned family living in Bedford, Pa., and on July 8,
his frantic wife, Julie, received a call from a nurse who had
tracked her down.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Dibert arrived at the hospital, her husband recognized
her but had trouble recalling her name. He asked how ``Bunky'' was
doing, using the nickname they had invented for the child she was
expecting 11 years before. ``It was kind of fun for a while, but
also scary,'' Mrs. Dibert said.
</P>
<P>
   She was told that her husband was suffering from stress, and she
couldn't disagree. He had been complaining of pressure at his job,
and she had seen him taking aspirin for uncharacteristically
frequent headaches.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Dibert was transferred from the Florida
hospital to his local hospital in Altoona, where he was unable to
recognize his children, that the diagnosis began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   The clinical picture did not make sense to Dibert's psychiatric
team in Altoona. He had no previous history of mental illness, and
normal people, no matter how stressed, do not suddenly just lose
their bearing in time. The Altoona doctors, wondering whether he
might have injured his head during his wanderings, ordered a CAT
scan.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Michael-Gerard Moncman first came to examine Dibert, he
found a patient who had returned to reality enough to be frightened
and confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty much in the present,'' Moncman said. ``By that
time, he was aware of gaps in his memory. He could tell me very
clearly about his job doing parts inventory at Fort Bragg, but the
last four to six weeks were simply gone.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dibert describes the time as an ``uncomfortable'' mix of past
and present. The more people talked to him about his life since
1987, the more he could remember, but with an effort. ``Things
would be said that didn't click at first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brain scan revealed that Dibert had a large cyst pushing
apart the nerve tissue surrounding it and pressing on a nerve
tract, called the fornix, known to play a role in memory retrieval
and storage. In one area, called the columns of the fornix, tissue
had split apart under pressure. There was also brain swelling,
explaining the headaches. ``There were some parts of the brain that
were literally bent around this thing,'' Moncman said.
</P>
<P>
   Brain cysts are not unusual. Some never produce symptoms; others
cause problems as they grow and push on adjacent structures.
Headaches, seizures, weakness, sensory disturbances, or dementia
may result.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon who eventually drained Dibert's cyst, Dr. L. Dade
Lunsford, the chairman of the neurologic surgery department at
Pittsburgh University, said the cyst had probably been there since
birth, growing as spinal fluid seeped in from the base of the brain
and never escaped.
</P>
<P>
   As brain cysts go, Dibert's was not particularly large. But it
was in one of the deepest and oldest parts of the brain, where
memory, primitive drives and emotions are generated. Fear,
aggression, sexuality, eating and drinking all originate from this
area, called the limbic system.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to think of the self as something so mechanistic
that a touch in the right spot can turn the past on or off. But in
Dibert's case, Lunsford said, his cyst was ``perfectly placed'' to
do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most strangely placed cyst with the strangest
effects is just a cyst _ a sac of fluid that can be drained
surgically. On July 16, about a week after nurses in Florida found
his family, Dibert traveled to Pittsburgh, where Lunsford made a
tiny hole in his skull. Guided by a three-dimensional image,
Lunsford drained 10 to 12 cubic centimeters of spinal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   It was not certain that the surgery would guarantee a happy
ending. The nerve tissue that had been bent around the cyst did not
simply spring back into place. Scans showed that a large space
remained where the cyst had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerves don't like to be stretched,'' Moncman said. ``The
situation for this gentleman was that we tried to restore as much
normal anatomy as we could. But it's up to his brain to restore
normal function.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just pat the brain on the head and say `OK, you're
done.' You've got to stand back and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The scans, of course, gave no clue as to what happened in the
period leading up to June 30, when Dibert suddenly traveled into
his past. Lunsford speculated that up to that point, Dibert's brain
had been able to compensate for the increased pressure exerted by
the growing cyst. Perhaps a short-term increase in pressure cut off
the flow of memory information along the fornix, or perhaps the
compensating mechanisms protecting him until then simply broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   For Dibert, recovering from the brain surgery was the easy part.
He was most worried about was how the episode would affect his
three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They handled it better than most adults did,'' he said. ``They
got out the photo albums and went through them, saying `Hey,
remember this? It was at my birthday party.'''
</P>
<P>
   During his initial post-operative checkups with Lunsford, the
surgeon noted a ``quizzical'' look in his patient, as if he still
could not understand or believe what had happened to him. But his
exam last spring, was essentially normal. ``I haven't heard from
him since,'' Lunsford said. ``And in my business, that's a good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibert, who returned to work in the fall, said last week that he
felt fine. His missing memories gradually filled in, except for a
gap of about 10 days starting ``three or four'' days before his
disappearance, he said. For a while, he and his wife worked to jar
loose the missing recollections. Eventually they gave up. In
Lunsford's opinion, there were probably no memories being made
during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said Dibert, ``and it's probably
best that way.''

AN `ANGEL' RETURNS, BEARING GRAM PARSONS' LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gram Parsons was never meant to grow old. He felt too deeply, he
dove too far into his psyche, fears and guilt. He lived too hard,
hanging around the Rolling Stones at the height of their dark
power, doing drugs as if they were going out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons was a rich Southern kid, a trust-fund pretty boy who
briefly attended Harvard, moved first to New York and then Los
Angeles and wrote a bunch of songs that cut as close to the bone as
any penned by Steve Earle or Hank Williams. He was with the Byrds
when they recorded what was almost certainly their best album,
``Sweetheart of the Rodeo,'' and he cut at least one unassailable
masterpiece, ``Grievous Angel.'' And he cut a swath through Los
Angeles, a floppy-haired lady-killer in a white suit emblazoned
with marijuana leaves and a red cross on the back. But by the time
``Angel'' was released, Parsons was long dead, having overdosed on
a combo platter of cocaine, morphine and speed in a cheap hotel
room at age 26 in September 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons left this world largely unknown to most rock or country
fans, but he had become a hero to a coterie of musicians, including
Emmylou Harris and the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards. More
important, Gram Parsons practically invented what would come to be
known as alternative-country: Wilco, Son Volt, Whiskeytown, Golden
Smog _ and the Eagles and the Stones' ``Wild Horses,'' too _
probably wouldn't have existed without Parsons' trailblazing work.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, some of the debt will be repaid with the release of
``Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons,'' a
13-song valentine that shows just how far his shadow reached. Alone
and in pairs, the Pretenders, Cowboy Junkies, Beck, Evan Dando, the
Mavericks, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello and several more step
forward to interpret such classic Parsons songs as ``She,'' ``Ooh
Las Vegas,'' ``Sin City,'' ``$1,000 Wedding'' and ``Sleepless
Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching over the entire project is Emmylou Harris, who credits
Parsons with teaching her how to sing harmony and appreciate rock
'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took me to a place I never would have gotten to on my
own,'' Harris says.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' pedal-to-the-metal life inspired imitation in his
admirers _ even after his overdose. In fact, there was a final,
perfectly macabre touch to his death: Honoring a request Parsons
had made at the funeral of guitarist Clarence White, a couple of
Parsons' friends took his body off the baggage ramp at the Van Nuys
Airport when it was being transported for burial. They packed his
body in their car and took it to the Joshua Tree National Forest,
where they burned it. The spot (and the hotel room where he died)
have seen pilgrimages by musicians and music lovers for years.
</P>
<P>
   Such adulation is attributable to his reputation for greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he put out was totally heart and soul,'' Harris
says. ``He brought rock attitude and the poetry of his generation
to country. His stuff was totally washed in the blood. It really
cut to the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   All songwriters aspire to this, but few hit the mark as
consistently _ and in so little time _ as Parsons. His character
portraits, such as ``She,'' are always strong, but it's when
Parsons turns the light back on himself that his real artistry
shines. On ``Ooh Las Vegas'' (covered on ``Return'' by Cowboy
Junkies) he goes to the big city and is seduced and overwhelmed. On
``Juanita'' (which Harris and Crow perform as a duet) he wakes up
dazed and ashamed in a drug-littered hotel room, hoping to have his
mind eased by a young woman with a ``conscience so clean.'' But it
is ``Sin City'' (covered by Harris and Beck) that is Parsons'
essence: He portrays Los Angeles as a sort of sunny, modern-day
Sodom, and himself as a lost soul unable to resist its deadly
charms.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of fatalism, endless regret and guilt, that
cuts through to the heart of bands such as Wilco and Whiskeytown.
This echoes Parsons, who always sounded unsettled, on the run from
nameless demons, lost in a world too mean and fast for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people more interested in his honky-tonk side and
people more interested in his ballads,'' says Peter Blackstock,
editor of No Depression, the monthly magazine that focuses on the
alt-country scene. ``But in either case, there's a direct emotional
honesty people connect with. I think it's too emotionally direct
for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he also knew the importance of holding something
back, revealing ``just enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The restraint and economy of motion inherent in country
singing _ he taught me that,'' Harris says. ``And he taught me how
to rock. I was a folk purist, and I thought drummers killed music.
With Gram, I understood how you could have great lyrics and the
power of rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the songs on the tribute CD _ or ``Rodeo,'' or
``Grievous Angel'' _ is to hear an enormously talented but troubled
man who finally could not outrun his demons. The poignancy of
Parsons' work is the music itself, but it's also realizing that he
really was the man in his songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people compare Gram to Robert Johnson and Hank
Williams,'' Blackstock says. ``As much as they did, you have to
wonder what they could have done in another 30 years. It's
genuinely sad to think of what never was heard.''

SOLOIST MARTIN FROST MAKES THE GEEKY CLARINET COOL
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BC-COOL-MUSICIANS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swedish clarinetist Martin Frost is a renowned touring soloist
in Europe and Japan, where he makes his living playing with
orchestras and in recitals.
</P>
<P>
   But in America, Frost is almost unknown.
</P>
<P>
   When Frost performs with the Mimir Chamber Music Festival at
Texas Christian University this week, it will be his second visit
to the United States. His first performance in this country came
during the same festival last year.
</P>
<P>
   So why has he been so slow to catch on here?
</P>
<P>
   ``The great clarinetists in America are in the orchestras,''
Frost said during a telephone interview from his home in Stockholm.
``In the U.S., if the conductor wants to program the Mozart
Clarinet Concerto, he uses a clarinetist from the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Much the same can be said for other instrumentalists, except for
the piano, violin and cello. Numerous pianists and violinists
crisscross the continent as guest artists. Within the past two
decades, guitarists have made inroads into the recital and concert
scene, often developing a relatively large following along the way.
A few cellists have achieved widespread recognition as well.
</P>
<P>
   But for 50 years, the violin and the piano have dominated the
orchestral solo slots and the solo recital scene. Few solo spots
are available for other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, 28, began playing the violin at 6. He later switched to
clarinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 14 or 15, I started to think of being a professional
musician,'' Frost said. ``I started thinking of being a soloist a
little later. I didn't realize how difficult it was.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the situation is a self-perpetuating cycle,
based on the characteristics of the violin and piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violin and piano have great flexibility,'' says Fort Worth
Symphony music director John Giordano. ``The violin has an enormous
range. And the keyboard, of course, is the foundation of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano, who began his career as a saxophone soloist, says
there are reasons that the violin and piano continue to dominate.
Indeed, as long-standing chairman of the Cliburn Competition jury,
he is closely associated with the ongoing prominence of the piano
on the concert scene.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is much good repertoire for other instruments,
the piano and violin possess an infinite literature of
masterpieces, Giordano says.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based manager Thomas Parker, whose 28 clients include
1997 Cliburn gold medalist Jon Nakamatsu, manages one concert
clarinetist, Jon Manasse. And although Parker recognizes the
continuing predominance of piano and violin, he says there has been
some change in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago, you couldn't give Jean-Pierre Rampal
away,'' he says, referring to the world-renowned flutist. ``Then he
had some breakthroughs, and that opened things up for all wind
instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker believes that the major orchestras are not a promising
area for the independent wind soloist because the principals'
contracts often specify that they be given first refusal when a
concerto for a wind instrument is programmed. The opportunity for a
solo performance is greater with a smaller orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   And Parker sees a mixed outlook for the solo recital scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recitals work on a trickle-down basis,'' he says. ``People
will go hear someone who has been on television or on an orchestra
concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Most solo performances for lesser-known soloists, such as
clarinetist Manasse, are on smaller college guest-artist recital
series, Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of Frost's engagements are as a traditional
recitalist or soloist with orchestras. The other 5 percent _ new
and ``avant-garde'' works that require dramatic motion and
choreography from the clarinetist _ are what have made him famous
in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   His breakthrough came with his performances of German composer
Karlheinz Stockhausen's ``Der Kleine Harlekin'' (''The Little
Harlequin''), Opus 42 1/2. An even more prominent break came when
Frost appeared in the title role _ a nonspeaking, nonsinging part
for clarinet soloist _ in German composer Wilfried Hiller's ``The
Pied Piper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on stage, acting for several hours a day for six
weeks,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   He won considerable recognition in Europe for the role, and
developed his interest and skills as an actor. He has since
commissioned and appeared in a number of works for solo clarinet
that require choreography and special lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Fort Worth, Frost performed choreographed works by
contemporary Swedish composers, including Niklas Sivelov's ``Twist
and Shout,'' Fredrik Hogberg's ``Plast Musik'' (''Plastic Music'')
and Anders Hillborg's ``Peacock Music.'' This year, in his second
bid to move onto the American soloist scene, he'll perform the
American premiere of Hillborg's Concerto for Clarinet and Tape,
along with standard chamber works including clarinet. Performances
are Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.

   Even though the piano, violin and cello _ and in recent years,
the guitar _ get all the good breaks and solo engagements, every
generation produces a few stars who manage to find or make a niche
for other instruments. Here are some artists who have made a spot
for themselves in spite of the odds.
</P>
<P>
   PERCUSSION: British percussionist Evelyn Glennie, who is
profoundly deaf, has established herself as one of the most
captivating performers and great musical geniuses of our time.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLA: Russian Yuri Bashmet has moved boldly into the vacant
slot for a solo violist. Vlinist Pinchas Zukerman occasionally
shows off by picking up the viola.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE BASS: Canny marketing as well as crossover hits _ and
superb playing _ have allowed Gary Karr and Edgar Meyer, each in
his own way, to become well-known on the largest and lowest-pitched
member of the string family.
</P>
<P>
   FLUTE: The dual reign of Jean-Pierre Rampal and the incredibly
personable James Galway (who began his career as an orchestral
musician) continues, with Paula Robison, Eugenia Zukerman (Pinchas
Zukerman's ex-wife) and Ransom Wilson providing a notable tier of
heirs apparent.
</P>
<P>
   TRUMPET: Wynton Marsalis continues his reign as all-around
musical genius, while Swedish trumpeter Hakan Hardenberger has
become prominent as a traditional concert artist.
</P>
<P>
   CLARINET: American Richard Stolzman holds the niche as the one
well-known audience favorite in America.
</P>
<P>
   OBOE: Swiss oboist Heinz Holliger started out as an orchestral
player and built his solo career around a combination of early and
modern solo music.
</P>
<P>
   OTHERS: Surprisingly, the horn slot remains vacant and waiting
for a new star since the retirement of Barry Tuckwell, while the
bassoon, harp, trombone and tuba still await the right combination
of personality and artistry to capture the public imagination.

CHINA PREPARES FOR HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China is closer to becoming only the third nation
in history to launch humans into space, a feat that could come as
early as next year, say international space experts.
</P>
<P>
   After years of saying it would ``one day'' or ``soon'' put
people into space, and initiating and postponing efforts to do so,
the Chinese government has finally embarked on a serious program to
make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think evidence of a manned space program in China is very
real and that they are serious,'' said Charles Vick, a space issues
expert with the Federation of American Scientists, a Washington
policy group.
</P>
<P>
   According to specialists following Chinese space developments,
Chinese officials had hoped to put two astronauts into space by
October to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Communist takeover
of China. However, they said, delays in developing a new rocket for
lifting heavy payloads, and problems with other equipment, make
such a crewed flight unlikely until at least next year.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight in the program, an unmanned test of the new
rocket and spacecraft, still could come in October as part of
celebrations marking the founding of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming there is no major failure during the first unmanned
flight of the system, I would expect a Chinese manned flight a year
to 15 months afterwards,'' said Phillip S. Clark, a British space
consultant who closely follows the Chinese program. ``Only the
United States and Russia have the capability to send people into
space and China seems ready to become only the third nation to join
this exclusive club.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Cline, the official in charge of external affairs at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the space
agency had no detailed knowledge of China's plans. ``For many
years, they have set as a goal building a manned spacecraft, and
earlier said they wanted to make a manned flight this year,'' Ms.
Cline said. However, she said, the agency has heard that this
flight has been delayed for unknown reasons and that there will be
an unmanned mission instead this year.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed interest in human spaceflight by China flared last month
when pictures said to show the Chinese spacecraft and rocket
suddenly appeared on the Internet from an anonymous source. The
pictures depict a spacecraft based on the Russian Soyuz design atop
a large rocket with four booster motors attached to the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, in an article to appear next month in the British
magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, describes the rocket as the
Chang Zheng 2F, an upgraded version of one of China's largest
satellite launchers, the Long March CZ-3E. The new version is
capable of placing a 10 metric-ton payload into low Earth orbit, he
said, while the Chinese manned spacecraft weighs about 8.4 metric
tons.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft itself resembles the Russian Soyuz, which is
built in three sections _ a propulsion section, an orbital section
and a return module _ but it is larger and carries two pairs of
solar-power panels instead of one set as the Russian craft does,
Clark said. The central orbital module, instead of being spheroidal
like the Soyuz, is more cylindrical, he said. The Chinese version
is designed to make docking with other craft and transferring crew
members easy.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed color photographs were supposedly taken by a
construction worker at the Jiuquan launching site near the Gobi
desert. They show a completed rocket and spacecraft being rolled
out of an assembly building to a gantry and firing pad.
</P>
<P>
   The new building looks a lot like NASA's giant Vehicle Assembly
Building at Cape Canaveral, Fla., where Apollo moon rockets, and
now space shuttles, are put together for missions. The rocket is on
a mechanical crawler with tank-like treads that slowly move it to a
launching pad, as American shuttles are transported. Until now, all
Chinese space rockets were assembled from components on the pad
before launchings and not transported there ready to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Initial discussion about the pictures focused on whether they
were real or clever fakes. Some spacecraft experts questioned
whether the pictures were of small-scale models or images put
together with computer-aided drawing and photo manipulation
software. After carefully examining details in the pictures and
calculating the size and positions of elements in the images, most
experts now believe they are authentic, for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much detail there to be faked,'' Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clark and other experts said the image of the large
assembly and integration building where the rockets are prepared
may have been enhanced in some way. The pictures are supposed to be
from a promotional brochure created for the construction company
that put up the building, and the firm may have been trying to
emphasize its work in the images, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Some also question the relatively close proximity of the
assembly building to the launching pad, compared with the
arrangement at Cape Canaveral, as evidence of possible photo
manipulation. But Vick noted that the launching arrangement for the
new European Ariane 5 rocket also has the service building and
launching pad similarly close together.
</P>
<P>
   China launched its first satellite in 1970 and has maintained an
active space program, including entering the business of launching
commercial satellites for clients in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials began discussing sending humans into space in
the late 1970s and reports of astronaut training began emerging in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The push toward the current manned flight effort, dubbed Project
921, began in March 1995, when China made a deal with Russia to
acquire space technology, including information on life-support
systems, docking mechanisms for spacecraft and spacesuits. In
October 1996, two Chinese astronauts and more than a dozen trainers
and support people arrived at the Russian cosmonaut training center
outside Moscow and stayed for about a year, experts said. At about
the same time, Beijing announced plans to fly a manned spacecraft
for the nation's anniversary celebration, but has said little about
the program since.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and scientists questioned about the program in China
give conflicting answers, with many declining to comment on
possible dates for manned flights until the government announces
them. But one thing Chinese scientists and outside experts agree on
is that most of the technology being developed is Chinese, even
though some is an adaptation of Russian ideas and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan Johnson-Freese, an instructor at the Asia Pacific
Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, and author of the book,
``The Chinese Space Program: A Mystery Within a Maze'' (Krieger
Publishing, 1998), said the Chinese always have multiple agendas.
China wants to prove that it is a technically sophisticated nation
and a great power that doesn't need outside help, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent investigations by Congress and the Pentagon that accuse
China of stealing secrets, and benefiting from U.S. companies
illegally transferring rocket and satellite information to China,
have embarrassed the Chinese and given them something to prove, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no economic payback for a manned space program,'' Dr.
Johnson-Freese said. ``The manned space club is very exclusive.
It's all for the prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   China is willing to spend part of its limited funds to develop
technology that is distinctly its own for sending humans into
space, she said. ``This way, China can say: `This is not U.S.
technology. This is not Russian Technology. This is very much
Chinese technology,' '' she said. ``It's saying, `We don't need to
steal your secrets and expertise _ We have our own.' ''

KILLINGS SHATTER A TOLERANT TOWN

<P>
   REDDING, Calif. _ The Jewish and gay communities in this
Northern California city are facing new realities in the wake of
the arrest of two men the authorities say prime suspects in the
July 1 slaying of a gay couple in Shasta County and the June 18
firebombing of three Sacramento-area synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   The Shasta County sheriff's office said investigators also are
exploring whether the men might be linked to the June 20 slaying of
James ``Mark'' Amos, a 66-year-old man found in his bed dead of
gunshot wounds about 3 miles from the home shared by the slain gay
couple, Gary Matson and Winfield Scott Mowder.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29, the
suspects in the killings, were arrested last week but have not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Allegedly tied to radical white power organizations and vocal in
their Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the Williams brothers are
an aberration among the population of some 150,000 people living in
and around this largely white and Christian town just south of
Mount Shasta, according to local Jewish and gay residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have a lot of problems here,'' said Shorty
Papineaux, an antiques dealer and regular at the Rainbow Lounge,
one of two gay bars in Redding.
</P>
<P>
   The Congregation Beth Emanuel, the only synagogue between Chico
and Ashland, Ore., serves some 200 members in a brown building of
about 3,200 square feet on 2 1/2 acres or so of grass and weeds
just west of town.
</P>
<P>
   In April, after swastikas appeared at Foothill High School in
Redding and anti-Semitic brochures were distributed in the area,
the FBI evaluated synagogue security. Some of the bureau's
suggestions, such as better lighting, were followed, but others,
such as fences, were not _ in part because of the expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong community value of tolerance, that's
overwhelmingly what Redding is all about,'' said Mike Cogan, a
Redding lawyer and member of the Beth Emanuel synagogue. ``I think
we're all pretty clear about what's good and what's bad, and (the
killings are) really bad. ... We don't want this in our town.''
</P>
<P>
   Matson, 50, a lifelong resident of the Redding area, helped
establish an arboretum as well as the museum and farmers market in
Redding. Mowder, 40, his companion of 16 years, worked in the plant
department in a local hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Williams brothers had been involved in a
landscaping business.

NO ROAD RISK TIED TO THOSE WHO QUIT SMOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)  ( The Science Times)  By ANAHAD S. O'CONNOR  
 &HT;    (DW) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last few years, there has been much debate over whether
people who quit smoking are more likely to get into traffic
accidents. Now, scientists writing in the journal Nature say they
have found no connection.
</P>
<P>
   People suffering from nicotine withdrawal can experience
physical agitation, visual hallucinations and anxiety, and it has
long been suggested that they become more accident-prone. To test
the theory, Jackie Knowles, a scientist with the Safety and
Environment Resource Center, conducted a study of the rate of
accidents occurring on ``No Smoking Day'' in Britain over a 10-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles theorized that if automobile accidents were truly
related to nicotine withdrawal, the number of accidents occurring
on that day would increase. Using data from a national accident
reporting system in Britain, Knowles compared the average number of
road accidents over 10 years occurring on the Wednesday before the
day, on the Wednesday after and on the day itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Wednesday before showed an average of 583 road accidents; on
the Wednesday after, the figure was 628.
</P>
<P>
   On No Smoking Day, the figure was 620, showing no unusual
deviation in the rate. Ultimately, Knowles concluded that there was
no relation between nicotine withdrawal and the average number of
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   A VITAMIN BOOST FOR THE TINIEST BABIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who studied infants with low birth weights have
found that doses of vitamin A can significantly lower their risk of
chronic lung disease and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Newborns, weighing less than two and a half pounds have low
concentrations of vitamin A in plasma and body tissue at birth.
They are unable to digest a sufficient amount of vitamin A during
the first few weeks of feeding and thus suffer from poor absorption
of the vitamin into the small intestine.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they are more susceptible to infection and have
fewer alveoli, or air cells, in their lungs. Those conditions can
lead to chronic lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors wondered if these ailments could be eliminated by large
dosages of vitamin A administered on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development Neonatal Research Network used two groups of infants
with low birth weights. The first group, 405 infants, received the
recommended daily allowance of vitamin A (5,000 international
units) administered three times a week for four weeks. The 402
infants in the control group received the traditional treatment
given to tiny infants. The average birth weight was 1.7 pounds in
the vitamin A group and 1.69 pounds in the control group.
</P>
<P>
   After 36 weeks, it was found that chronic lung disease occurred
in fewer infants in the group receiving vitamin A than in the other
group. In the control group, 62 percent of the infants died or
developed chronic lung disease, while 55 percent of the infants in
the vitamin A group died or developed the disease. The study found
that, in addition to reducing the risk of chronic lung disease, the
vitamin A supplement for infants with extremely low birth weights
reduced the risk of infections, hemorrhages in the brain and
certain heart conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that infants with very low weights
should receive vitamin A injections regularly. They added that
vitamin A was not only effective in reducing the risk of chronic
lung disease and other infections, but was also inexpensive. No
side effects were detected.

MARIO AND SPIKE: A TALE OF ETHNIC SENSITIVITIES
</HEADLINE>
  (Critic's Notebook)  
(kd) 
 By   WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If art truly imitated life or the other way around,
the conjunction of Mario Puzo's death, a record-breaking heat spell
and the new Spike Lee movie should have caused a combustion this
month on the sidewalks of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Puzo, the poet of the Mafia (a word that sensitivity forbade him
to use), gave us, in collusion with Francis Ford Coppola, a show of
ethnic violence that offended some champions of the
Italian-American character. And Italian-American violence figures
in both Lee's new, furious ``Summer of Sam'' and his steamy and
more accomplished ``Do the Right Thing,'' in which tensions between
the Italian-Americans and the blacks of Bedford-Stuyvesant erupt in
murderous emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Lee's work has been subjected to close inspection for
the signals it has transmitted about ethnic tensions and identity,
in the decades of Puzo's prodigious success as novelist and movie
maker, ``The Godfather'' and its two sequels managed to defy even
the mildest rebuke. Criticism among Italian-Americans was pretty
well stilled by the collaborative skills of the
Puzo-Coppola-Brando-Pacino-De Niro team and their work's subsequent
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   That may be taken as a rebuff to the sensitivity squadron. By
the local rules of tolerance, fairness and other exhibitions of
public virtue, the Corleone family's record of ruthlessness
demanded protest, but the storytelling was so evocative, and the
characters were so pungent, that niceties like civil rules of
behavior came to seem prissy. ``The Godfather'' represented popular
entertainment at a high level of professionalism that approached
art and elicited respect on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the ``Godfather'' series was a largely
made-by-Italian-Americans production that radiated old-country
warmth and color even while the slaughter was under way. The
feelings of both Puzo and Coppola for the folk quality of their
tale came through honestly enough to distance their work from the
mafioso genre on which it drew. And anyway they were proudly,
creatively Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Baker reflected in The New York Times: ``Puzo escapes an
insensitivity indictment under the rule that any member of a group
thought to need sensitivity is, nevertheless, permitted to be
insensitive, but only to his own group. If a Puzo show referred to
a black character as `a spade,' as Raymond Chandler, the Anglo
master of crime fiction, did in the pre-sensitivity era, well _
`The sensitivity boys are going to take you for a little ride,
Mario.''' In fairness, Baker might have mentioned what an enjoyable
ride audiences had.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing,'' the 1989 work that explored,
or some will say exploited, racial violence on a burning hot day in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, could not so readily avoid charges of
insensitivity. Here the conflict, between blacks and
Italian-Americans, was based on a 1986 incident that wound up with
the killing of a young black man, Michael Griffith, who was trying
to run away from a white gang.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's approach to his story was ambitious. The characters were
borrowed from both black and Italian-American stereotypes that went
beyond the stereotypical. The movie was respectfully received, yet
left an intriguing disquiet about his message.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, by contrast, Lee's ``Mo' Better Blues,'' his
parodic movie featuring two white jazz club owners who exploit
black music talent, opened under charges of anti-Semitism. If the
vaudeville accents of this detestable pair were not sufficient to
make Lee's point, his own off-the-cuff comments about Jews' running
Hollywood would have done the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League expressed its disappointment that in
this movie Lee ``employed the same kind of tactics that he
supposedly deplored.'' Such is the common response of an advocacy
group, be it Jewish or Italian-American or black, for whom the
merit of a movie lies essentially in its good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Mo' Better Blues,'' however, was not only bad
intention but also bad movie making. Lee allowed his animus to
conquer his skills. His latest work, ``Summer of Sam,'' a
phantasmagoria of Italo-America, is not likely to win friends in
Italian-American neighborhoods and cannot match his achievement in
``Do the Right Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Lee may never compete with Puzo as a literary talent,
``Do the Right Thing'' shared a generosity of spirit with ``The
Godfather'' that cut across ethnic and racial lines. The lesson
here is that whether the subject be blacks or Italian-Americans or
Jews, if the movie maker wants to get away with taking on
incendiary group feelings, the best protection is to make a good
original movie.

WHEN THE STATE USES PEOPLE AS GUINEA  
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(md) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientific experiments in which human subjects are abused are
not new; examples are as old as arrogance and cruelty. In the 13th
century, according to historians, a Mongol commander laying siege
to a port city experimented with heaving his diseased, dead
soldiers over the walls of the besieged town. The result was
victory for the command and the spread of black plague to its first
seaport; the commander's action may indeed have been the key event
in the great bubonic pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   But something different has been produced in this century,
according to John Moreno, director of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Virginia, and the author of a book
titled ``Undue Risk,'' to be published this fall by W. H. Freeman
and Co. Modern times have seen the growth of systematic,
state-sponsored programs of unethical experimentation, and they
have occurred in nations as diverse as the United States, Nazi
Germany, China, Japan, Iraq and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's book traces the history of secret, state-sponsored
experiments in the fields of atomic, chemical and biological
warfare studies from World War II to the present, including the
possibility that governments are now experimenting with what he
calls ``genetic warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, who has a Ph.D. in philosophy, was drawn into the
subject when he was telephoned by Dr. Ruth Faden of Johns Hopkins
University and the leader of the President's Advisory Committee on
Human Radiation Experiments, and was asked to become a member.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's task was to reconstruct the story of radiation
experiments on humans carried out in the United States from 1944 to
1974. The investigation, believed to be the most thorough
historical search of its kind ever done, took almost two years, and
plumbed millions of pages of documents, but when it was over in
1995, Moreno found his curiosity had only been piqued. What, he
asked himself, about the other new technologies in modern warfare,
chemical and biological weapons? What experiments had been done
with those? He decided to find out.
</P>
<P>
   What made his and the radiation investigations possible was
President Clinton's decision to declassify the military records of
the secret experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The resultant book is a parade of horribles, but it reveals many
common features in unethical experiments from nation to nation,
experiment to experiment. And while it chronicles familiar cases,
it also describes a few unfamiliar cases, ones that may point to
the abuses of the future.
</P>
<P>
   And it finishes with a discussion of the positive consequences
of unethical experiments _ that ethical standards are being raised.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found that from 1944 to 1974, there were thousands
of experiments in the United States using radiation _ including
everything from injecting plutonium into the bodies of unsuspecting
hospital patients, to marching soldiers onto the sites of atom bomb
tests just after the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq in the 1980s, Moreno reports, prisoners and captured
Kurds were tied to stakes and bombarded with chemical and
bacteriological weapons to assess the weapons' effects. The number
of victims is not known, but may be in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Among the less familiar tales is that of the South African
program called Operation Coast, which was unearthed by that
nation's Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Coast was a series of experiments in the 1980s in
which biological and chemical weapons were tested _ in one case on
troops from Mozambique _ for use against anti-Apartheid activists.
Moreno writes that the commission found evidence that among the
secret medical experiments was an effort to develop infertility
drugs that would affect blacks but not whites.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno says it was unclear whether such drugs were actually
tried on humans, but the case raises the possibility of adding a
fourth horseman to the atomic, biological and chemical weapons _
``genetic warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Several classes of weapons could result,'' Moreno writes,
``among them microbes genetically engineered to target certain
human populations based on a virus' ability to `recognize' the DNA
variations in specific subgroups.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that the possibility is credible partly because ``people
from particular ethnic groups or certain geographic origins have
long been noted to be associated with sensitivities to particular
foods and drugs.'' For example, he writes, since ancient Greek
times it has been known that people of African and Middle Eastern
origin often get sick after eating fava beans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno writes that the Defense Department already has begun
studies to design defenses against ``genetic'' attack.
</P>
<P>
   Human experiments of some kind will always be necessary in
government and military programs, Moreno writes, but what is
necessary for the future is to guard against abuse of humans.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, one of the things which surprised him most in
doing his research, is that he found the best model for careful,
ethical human experimentation in a United States Army chemical and
biological warfare program.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered a group of medics called ``91 Bravo'' at Fort
Detrick, in Maryland, called the Medical Research Volunteers
(Mervs) whose job as soldiers is simply to serve as subjects in
medical experiments. They give blood, take experimental vaccines
and ingest suspect bacteria, and when they become sick they are
treated on the spot. They receive special training in
experimentation, detailed briefings on each experiment, and have
the option of participating in some trials and not others.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to civilian research on humans, the experiments on
``91 Bravo'' must be reviewed by multiple boards and officials
before proceeding. And the medics themselves sometimes join on the
review committees.
</P>
<P>
   Unethical experimentation will always be with us, Moreno writes,
but if secrecy is limited and good model experimental programs can
be developed, the abuses may be limited.  &QL;

HOW BEES STAY THE COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Australia)   (The Science Times)   
(DW) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flying a plane in crosswinds can be tricky. The pilot has to
compensate for the wind's speed and direction, changing the plane's
heading accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   If it's tough for a plane, imagine what it must be like when a
tiny bumblebee is buffeted by a crosswind. Remarkably, though, bees
are able to stay on course. New research published in Nature
suggests that they don't spend a lot of time assessing wind speed
or figuring out how much they need to turn into it. Rather, they
appear to rely on an optical navigation aid _ images of the ground
flowing across their retinas.
</P>
<P>
   Using radar, the researchers, from the University of Greenwich
in England, tracked bumblebee flights of up to 2,000 feet in
measured windy conditions. The bees adjusted their flying height
depending upon their speed (which, of course, was affected by wind
cpeed). Because the size of the ground area in the bees' view
changes with height, the results suggest that the bees are trying
to keep ground images whizzing by at a constant speed.
</P>
<P>
   The direction in which these images cross the field of view is
important as well. The researchers suggest that the bumblebees,
like some other species of bees, use a ``sun compass'' for
navigation, keeping the direction of the flowing images at a
particular angle relative to the sun. If a bee is blown off course,
it is a simple matter to get back on course by turning until the
image flow is at the intended angle in relation to the sun. As
support for this idea, the researchers note that bees flying over
water tend to drift with the wind, because the featureless water
surface gives no clues to movement as its image moves across the
retina.
THE SECRET LIFE OF ROCKS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sedimentary rocks hold many secrets, not the least of which is
their age. Igneous and metamorphic rocks can be dated through
radioactive decay of isotopes, but sedimentary rocks are formed
through the compaction of eroded grains of other kinds of rocks,
and precise dating is difficult. Scientists often have to rely on
fossils found in the rocks to determine when sedimentation
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a team of Australian researchers has developed a method to
date some kinds of sedimentary rocks, and while the technique does
not involve fossils, it does make use of the decay of organic
matter in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   When sediments settle out of water and begin to compact,
elements and compounds from decaying organic matter in the water
form minerals on the sediments. Among them is xenotime, a crystal
that encrusts grains of zircon in the sediments. Since xenotime
contains a uranium isotope that decays at a known rate into lead,
analyzing the amount of lead and uranium in a sample gives a
measure of how long ago the xenotime was formed, and thus the
sedimentation began.
</P>
<P>
   Using their technique, which they described in a recent issue of
the journal Science, the scientists have measured ancient sandstone
in western Australia and determined it to be 1.704 billion years
old, give or take 7 million years. Previously, the uncertainty in
age had been on the order of about a billion years.
TOO HOT FOR A PLANET  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't taken by the paparazzi, but a photograph released last
year caused a hubbub just the same. Astronomers said the photo,
from the Hubble Space Telescope, was probably the first of a planet
beyond the solar system. In it, a dim object was shown accompanying
a double star system 450 light-years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But after further analysis, it appears that the object is not an
extraordinary planet, but more likely a star, and a very ordinary
one at that. According to a report in the magazine Science News,
spectral analysis of the object shows that it does not contain
water vapor, indicating that it is of high temperature _ almost
certainly too high to be a planet. Rather than being 450
light-years away, it is more probably far in the background.  &QL;

WOMEN WITH SOARING CAREERS SHARE COMMON ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA, N.Y. _ Two women who grew up in Elmira, in the back yard
of the National Soaring Museum, will take their dreams to new
heights with NASA's next space flight of the shuttle Columbia,
scheduled for launch on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Elmira native Eileen Collins, 42, will become NASA's first
female mission commander on the five-day Columbia flight that will
carry the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, an advanced telescope that is
the heaviest payload ever deployed from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Heidi DeBlock, 37, a physician who works in the surgical
intensive care unit at Albany Medical Center, is a NASA visiting
scientist who will perform blood pressure tests on the shuttle crew
at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida when the Columbia is
scheduled to land on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about this mission, especially since Eileen
is making history as the first woman commander,'' DeBlock said.
``It's great to see a woman in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   The dual connection to Elmira, a town of 35,000 people near the
Pennsylvania border, is a natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elmira is an aeronautical kind of town,'' said DeBlock, whose
late father, a World War II pilot, was active in the local soaring
club and taught DeBlock to fly a glider.
</P>
<P>
   As girls, DeBlock and Collins were inspired by watching gliders
soar on updrafts along ridges bracketing the Chemung River Valley
in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains west of Elmira in Big
Flats, home of the National Soaring Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space shuttle is basically the world's largest glider,''
said Jaye Fish, development director at the National Soaring
Museum. Fish said Collins has donated NASA memorabilia to the
museum, where she helped establish the Eileen Collins Aviation
Camp.
</P>
<P>
   DeBlock, of Niskayuna, N.Y., a mother of three girls, recently
reapplied to become an astronaut after making it to the cut of 300
out of about 3,000 applicants two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be an astronaut,'' DeBlock said. ``My
dad fostered a love of the stars and flying in me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Elmira childhoods and NASA careers of Collins, an Air Force
lieutenant colonel and mother of a 3-year-old daughter, and DeBlock
have been lately examined in an article researched and written by
eight sixth-graders at Farnsworth Middle School in Guilderland, a
suburb of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Their account, ``Ever Upwards,'' will be published in Space
Launch News, a newsletter that will be distributed at the July 20
Columbia shuttle launch in Cape Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra mission, which has faced delays, will carry an
observatory to an orbit more than one-third of the way to the moon.
The telescope will allow scientists to peer deep into outer space
and to gather unprecedented X-ray images of exploding stars, black
holes and other phenomena as they study the structure and evolution
of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   DeBlock and Collins recalled for the Farnsworth students
memories of sitting on their front porches on warm summer nights in
different neighborhoods of Elmira, staring at the stars and
dreaming of exploring outer space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a child, I've dreamed about space,'' Collins told
the sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Collins worked in a pizza parlor, saved her money and took
flying lessons. But she was rejected three times before finally
being accepted at the Air Force Test Pilot Academy. ``If you get
knocked down, just get up and try again,'' Collins told the
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Elmira, DeBlock didn't know Collins and they've
never met. Both graduated from the same public high school, Elmira
Free Academy, in the city of 35,000. DeBlock's older sister knew
Collins from the Class of '74, though.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elmira today is known as the place where New York
City's subway cars are built, in 1930 it made headlines as the site
of the first nationally sanctioned soaring contest and bills itself
as ``the soaring capital of America.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 200 members in the local soaring club,
including one of the largest junior programs in the nation, Fish
said. Youths can fly solo in a glider at age 14.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a ride in a glider is part of the weeklong summer
aviation camp program named for Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eileen's shuttle flight as commander has been delayed many
times, so we've been on the edge of our seats here for about a
year,'' said Fish, who noted that Collins and her family are
frequent visitors to the museum.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeBlock's work begins July 22, when a team of NASA scientists at
the Kennedy Space Center complete several practice runs of a blood
pressure protocol before the scheduled July 24 landing.
</P>
<P>
   DeBlock has conducted cardiovascular research on astronauts
since 1990. She published results of a three-year study in the
American Journal of Cardiology, analyzing how weightlessness in the
zero gravity atmosphere of space alters the working of the heart,
particularly the onset of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).
</P>
<P>
   DeBlock concluded that short-duration orbits of less than three
weeks and space walks up to six hours were safe, but a lingering
concern for astronauts of any duration in orbit is the shock to the
system during re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to understand why astronauts' blood pressure
falls so much when they fly back into Earth's gravitational
force,'' DeBlock said, noting blood pressure can drop from a level
of 120 in space's zero gravity to 60 upon re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, nearly 30 percent of astronauts suffer ill effects
from the blood-pressure drop upon landing, ranging from dizziness
to fainting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a dangerous situation,'' DeBlock said. Astronauts
participating in the study will be monitored after they are given
blood pressure medication.
</P>
<P>
   One day, if her dreams come true, DeBlock may be on the
receiving end of the post-flight medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my chances are this time in reapplying to be
an astronaut,'' DeBlock said. ``But I'm not ready to give up yet.''

</P>
<P>
   A. A keloid is a scar that does not know when to stop forming,
becoming large, shiny, smooth, and often pink and dome-shaped,
according to The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. It is not
known why some people get overgrown scars after injuries, surgery
or acne, but keloids are more common among people of black and
Asian descent, so a genetic factor is suspected.
</P>
<P>
   In normal scarring, after the inflammation that follows an
injury subsides, scar tissue begins to form, along with tiny new
blood vessels. Cells in the skin around the injury, called
fibroblasts, produce collagen, a fibrous connective tissue. As more
and more of the fibers link up, the scar becomes harder.
</P>
<P>
   In a keloid, the process continues long after the wound is
covered over, and the scar can become quite large. Keloids are not
dangerous but can be disfiguring, tender and sometimes itchy.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of a keloid by surgery or the use of lasers, followed by
corticosteroid injections at the site, is sometimes but not always
successful, and the removal treatment can cause even worse
scarring.
</P>
<P>
   Someone with a tendency to form keloids may want to avoid
plastic surgery, though doctors can sometimes use hidden incisions
in facial surgery or avoid making cuts in the periphery of the
face, where keloids are more likely to form.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and low temperature readings are likely again Tuesday
over much of the Middle Atlantic Seaboard, as a stationary front
drapes over the region. Moist air from the South is being lifted up
and over the front from the Carolinas to New England. As a result,
low clouds and showers will form east of the Appalachians, bringing
some much needed rain to many locations. In addition, the low
clouds will also be very thick, which will tend to keep readings
between ten and fifteen degrees below normal.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf Coast will experience showers and thunderstorms Tuesday
as a weak, decaying front settles southward. Combined with onshore
flow, numerous storms are likely from the Florida Panhandle to east
Texas. The ce.tral Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes will
remain under a ridge of high pressure, allowing for a cool morning
followed by a sunny and mild afternoon. The western Plains will
become rather hot as winds from the southwest increase.
</P>
<P>
   Additional showers and thunderstorms are likely in the Southwest
Tuesday as moisture continues to be replenished in the atmosphere
over normally arid regions. Clouds will also be abundant from the
northern Arizona mountains to the Sierra Nevada, as the moisture is
forced to rise up and over the higher terrain. Farther west, the
Central Valley will be very hot once again, with some locations
reaching record maximums as air descends under a strong ridge of
high pressure. The Northwest will continue to be dry, with readings
reaching seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Harmless Storm
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Beatriz churned off the west coast of Mexico on
Monday. Like most of the storms that form in that part of the
world's tropical oceans, it will pass harmlessly into the central
Pacific. A small area near the west coast of Mexico has the highest
birthrate of tropical storms of any place on earth. But the
prevailing winds typically steer storms away from populated regions
into a vast expanse of cooler water that cause the storms to
dissipate. By Wednesday, another disturbance is expected to
strengthen near western Mexico which will be named Tropical Storm
Calvin.

DELAYS ARE CLOGGING MANY EUROPEAN AIRPORTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland, Ireland, Austria, The
Netherlands, Norway)   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ On a recent afternoon, the Lufthansa flight from Cologne,
ordinarily as predictable as the tides, lumbered into Fiumicino
airport outside Rome an hour and a half late. Bedraggled passengers
bumped into others from the Crossair flight from Basel, usually a
reflection of Swiss punctuality, which was 50 minutes late. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, flight delays are about as abundant at European
airports as foreign tourists, but this year, they have reached
crisis proportions. In the first three months of 1999, delays of
more than 15 minutes rose 28.3 percent over the same period in
1998; in May, total delays in the system, calculated on the number
and percentage of landings and takeoffs delayed, soared by 217
percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karl-Heinz Neumeister, secretary general of the Association of
European Airlines, said that this summer promised to be the worst
on record. Pierre Jeanniot, director of the International Air
Transport Association, warned that unless European governments
tackled the crisis, ``any prospects of growth in European air
transport will be strangled at birth.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American travelers who have had to face crowded European
airports recently know what they're talking about. David Henderson,
spokesman for the Association of European Airlines in Brussels,
said major headaches were caused earlier this year when France and
Switzerland began a two-month readjustment of the air corridors
that cross their border, causing bedlam at regional airports like
the one in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually the changes will help,'' he said. ``But they caused
chaos.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Kosovo crisis, by limiting civilian air space over
many European countries, has caused about 30 percent of this year's
flight delays, according to Atilla Parla, spokesman for
Eurocontrol, the centralized European air traffic control agency in
Brussels, covering 28 countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the main problem, experts say, is the structure of European
air traffic control systems, which are fragmented by national
boundaries as if, as Jeanniot said, ``they were part of some tiny
medieval fiefdom.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Lambert, a European Union spokeswoman for transportation,
said that in a single aviation market, ``for historic reasons in 15
states you have more than 20 systems at air traffic control
centers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While individual national systems are linked by Eurocontrol,
technological standards often differ by country. Parla of
Eurocontrol said that the agency was virtually powerless to force
member states to live up to commitments to boost the efficiency of
air traffic control systems or to increase airport capacity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neil Kinnock, the senior European Union transport official,
addressing the crisis in flight delays, warned recently that
``expectations for the near future are dismal, and even greater
difficulties can be anticipated in the medium term.'' He called on
European governments to surrender greater authority to Eurocontrol.
</P>
<P>
   Without singling out culprits, Kinnock said that only a few
European regions, responsible for about 3 percent of total air
traffic, now caused 45 percent of the delays. Jeanniot was more
specific, saying that the crisis was due to a severe lack of air
traffic control capacity in Switzerland, parts of France and
Italy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Neumeister of the Association of European Airlines
said that northern France, southern Germany, the whole of
Switzerland and northern Italy formed, in an arc from the English
Channel to the Adriatic, a kind of ``solid barrier against
efficient operation and good timekeeping.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But national prerogatives are strong and the wheels of European
Union decision-making grind slowly, so no one expects a quick fix.
NATO officials have provided a measure of relief by reopening some
corridors closed by the war in Kosovo, including air space over
Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, according to Eurocontrol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who would like to avoid some of the worst airports can
find some guidance in a list published last month by the
Association of European Airlines. The group ranked 27 airports
according to delayed flights in the first three months of the year.
Leading the offender list was the new Malpensa airport at Milan,
where 56.3 percent of departures were delayed more than 15 minutes,
with an average delay of more than 45 minutes. Malpensa was
followed by Geneva, Munich, Oslo and Rome.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, two of the worst offenders _ Malpensa and
Oslo-Gardermoen _ are recently opened airports still suffering
teething problems. Since formally opening last October, Malpensa
has been notorious for delays, lost baggage and poor transportation
links. Munich and Rome have felt the effects of Kosovo, and Geneva
was disrupted by the changes earlier this year to French-Swiss air
corridors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the European airports with the best departure records were
Dublin, Athens, Vienna, Duesseldorf and the London airports at
Heathrow and Gatwick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Malpensa also led the list in delayed arrivals, with 52.8
percent of flights late, and an average delay of almost 45 minutes.
Madrid, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Istanbul and Lisbon followed.
Among the most punctual for arrivals were Dublin, Vienna,
Copenhagen, Duesseldorf and Amsterdam. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Generally, European officials discount mushrooming European air
traffic, which increases about 7 percent annually, as a cause of
the crisis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky is big,'' Henderson said. ``It's simply the way it's
managed.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the beginning _ before, that is, the chest X-ray,
the CAT scan, the transesophageal echocardiogram, the
prostate-specific antigen, the thallium stress test and the
gadolinium-enhanced MRI _ was the physical examination. For most of
the last two centuries, it was medicine's most elegant diagnostic
tool, the best way for a doctor to probe what was going on in a
patient's interior.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests, X-rays and scans now often outdistance a doctor's
hands, eyes and ears. They can locate and define problems a
physical examination can only hint at, sometimes before even the
patient knows there is something wrong. Compared with the precision
of most common tests, many of the maneuvers a doctor performs at
the bedside (``Open your mouth ... breathe in ... breathe out ...
and again ... '') are inexact or even useless.
</P>
<P>
   In some situations, though, the physical may still be
lifesaving. It can be an inexpensive way to identify which patients
need expensive tests. And it forces doctors to touch their
patients, creating a physical bond between them that many feel is
essential to the art of healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time that we have an opportunity to literally
touch our patients,'' said Dr. Salvatore Mangione, a pulmonary
specialist at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia, who has written a
textbook on the physical examination. ``To relinquish it would be a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But now medical educators worry that a generation of young
doctors dazzled by LED displays and computer printouts is turning
away from the hands-on skills that, once forgotten, may never be
retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, studies have confirmed that the concerns are
well founded. Many American doctors are no longer very skillful at
what is called ``physical diagnosis,'' or the art of interpreting
abnormalities in the physical examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have available technology as an alternative,''Mangione
said, ``you're going to rust at the bedside. We now have an entire
generation or generations of teachers and physicians that may be
not very comfortable with that bedside part.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 50 years, studies have questioned the need for
healthy adults to undergo the ritual of a complete yearly physical
examination. Most of these investigations have concluded that the
tappings and probings, which may take the better part of an hour to
complete, are unnecessary. A comprehensive review published in the
Annals of Internal Medicine 10 years ago concluded that after a
single heart and skin examination, healthy adults under age 60 who
felt well and had no unusual health risks had no need for a doctor
to lay hand or stethoscope upon them save for periodic measurements
of blood pressure and weight, and periodic breast and pelvic
examinations in women.
</P>
<P>
   For children, periodic physical examinations are still
considered important. But for adults, most health policy
organizations, including the Department of Health and Human
Services' influential Preventive Services Task Force, agree that a
complete yearly physical examination is obsolete. In its place,
doctors are encouraged to substitute an entity called the
``periodic health examination'' that, for healthy people between
ages 25 and 64, consists mostly of reminders about health risks
like smoking and driving without seat belts, and screening tests,
tailored to the patient's age and life style, like mammograms, PAP
smears and blood tests for sexually transmitted disease. This is
what many patients experience in their yearly visit to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But abolishing the yearly physical may have unexpectedly serious
repercussions, other doctors say. ``I believe in it,'' said Dr.
Michael A. LaCombe, the director of cardiology at Maine General
Medical Center in Augusta and a nationally known medical educator.
``There's a lot of soft stuff involved in a yearly physical that
can never be put into a database or measured with outcomes. There's
an intimacy with a patient, a closeness that evolves into
disclosure that doesn't occur on a questionnaire or with a
perfunctory 15 minute appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, LaCombe said, when doctors no longer routinely
examine healthy patients, they lose their innate sense of what is
normal in the human body, and become increasingly unable to
distinguish what is abnormal when a patient gets sick.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies confirm that this may well be happening. A 1992
study at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., one of the
most prestigious places to study internal medicine in the country,
showed that residents there were only about 50 percent accurate in
identifying the heart murmurs and other physical examination
abnormalities that appear when a patient has a damaged heart valve.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 200 medical students and residents at Philadelphia-area
hospitals were asked to listen to tape recordings of the
characteristic sounds heard through the stethoscope in patients
with a variety of lung diseases. They too scored about 50 percent
overall.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper published in the Archives of Internal Medicine last
month, three experienced Seattle doctors were asked to figure out
if a few dozen patients had pneumonia without looking at the
patients' chest X-rays. Even the best missed a third of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Even the simple determination of blood pressure is turning into
a lost art. A study from Milwaukee presented at a meeting of the
American Society of Hypertension in New York last month found that
a year after a special course in how to take blood pressure, 95 of
100 medical students were doing it incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   Educators are startled and unhappy at these trends, particularly
since the physical examination can also be a technique for
effectively controlling health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical diagnosis can be an enormously powerful and
inexpensive way of sorting out those who need expensive tests from
those who don't,'' said Dr. Robert H. Fletcher, a professor of
ambulatory care and preventive medicine at Harvard Medical School.
``And yet the skills are tending to be de-emphasized, to atrophy in
young physicians because they jump right away to expensive
technology. So when it comes down to being on their own and having
to decide something without the technology, they've lost a lot of
their ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of studies in the last 20 years have tried to figure
out exactly which elements of the physical examination are valuable
and which are relics best supplanted by X-rays and blood tests. A
1992 article in The Journal of the American Medical Association
concluded, for example, that for a patient suspected of having
fluid in the abdomen, one method of tapping on the abdomen would
detect the fluid about 77 percent of the time and was still worth
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for the venerable ``puddle sign,'' on the other hand,
which requires a patient to balance on all fours in bed for several
minutes, while the doctor taps on the belly from underneath, was
uncomfortable for the patient, would find fluid only 45 percent of
the time and should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some techniques are still a part of what we teach because
nobody ever questioned their validity before,'' said Mangione,
whose textbook of physical diagnosis, unlike most standard texts,
provides editorial commentary on which rituals of the physical
examination should be retained and which, like the puddle sign, can
be retired.
</P>
<P>
   In the examination of the heart, for instance, Mangione's book
suggests, the doctor should still listen for the sounds of a normal
heartbeat. However, listening for a sound called a pericardial
knock, which is sometimes heard in serious infections, is no longer
worthwhile because these conditions have become so rare. Listening
for a sound called a ``tumor plop,'' which can be a sign of a tumor
in the heart, is far less accurate than an ultrasound test.
</P>
<P>
   But even worthwhile maneuvers often now get short shrift from
time-pressured doctors, for whom scribbling out an X-ray slip is
far faster than waiting for clothing to be removed so that a
stethoscope can be judiciously applied to the chest or abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am definitely doing fewer physicals,'' said Dr. Anke Jacobs,
an internist at the Manhattan Veterans Administration Hospital and
four years out of medical school. ``The thoroughness I had when I
started is gone. It would take too long. Doing a good examination
takes time. Once when I wanted to do one I had to wait for 10
minutes just for the nurse to find a gown for the patient to put on
_ and I have only a half hour with each patient, and all the
paperwork for the labs to fill out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New York internist added: ``It's all for the patients'
psychologic benefit now. They like their lungs and hearts listened
to, but the important decisions are based on lab tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Some medical educators worry that this attitude quickly
percolates down to medical students, who learn the basics of
physical diagnosis in their second year of school. Students meet in
small groups with a preceptor, practice some parts of the
examination on one another, and become familiar with others by
examining willing patients on hospital wards. Examinations of the
breasts and genitalia are generally taught separately in
specialized clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Students invariably start out loving physical diagnosis,
Mangione said, which probes the patient for hints of disease the
way Sherlock Holmes looked for clues. ``But by the time they finish
their second year and start working in the hospital, they get very
rapidly disillusioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most hospital stays are so short now that patients often spend
most of their time there moving from one test to another.
``Patients are in and out and have so much being done to them while
they're in, that when you lead this great team out to examine the
patient and show them how you do it, half the time the patient is
down in the MRI room,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of the world where technology is less accessible,
skillful physical examinations remain important. ``In Europe they
pay more attention to physical findings,'' said Dr. Jacqueline
Achkar, who received her medical training in Germany and Britain,
and now teaches physical diagnosis to students at New York
University Medical School. ``Here students talk less to the patient
and spend more time in front of the computer. That is what they're
focused on. I say, did you feel the liver, and they tell me what
the blood tests showed. I say, `Was the patient yellow?' and they
say, `I don't know, I have to go back and check.'''
</P>
<P>
   LaCombe, the director of cardiology at Maine General, had a
similar observation. ``Most physicians would admit that few
physicians under 50 know how to do a physical exam,'' he said.
Teaching the subject is now generally considered one of the
thankless chores of medical education in this country, he added,
usually an unpaid labor relegated to junior medical school faculty
members who themselves are uncertain of the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like `Fahrenheit 451,''' LaCombe said, referring to Ray
Bradbury's science fiction novel about a totalitarian society where
books are burned, but a small cadre of rebels keeps their contents
alive by memorizing them. ``There has got to be a place where we
can keep this thing alive until it gets into vogue again.''

MORE CHILDREN CONTRACTING `ADULT' DIABETES
</HEADLINE>

By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Amid the routine of childhood sniffles and
earaches, pediatrician John Menchaca began to notice something
unusual several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rough, dark skin was emerging on the back of some of his
patients' necks. The skin change puzzled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents would say, `It looks dirty, and I kept scrubbing
and scrubbing it, and it was still there,' '' said Menchaca, a Fort
Worth physician for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Menchaca now views the skin change as a ``blessing in
disguise.'' When it appears, doctors are learning, the child runs a
greater risk of developing diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Adult-onset diabetes, also known as Type 2 diabetes, is commonly
associated with those older than 45. But more and more it is
showing up in children too young to drive, and medical
professionals blame America's losing battle against obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fatter today than we have ever been in the history of
this country,'' said Paul Villas, executive director of the
University of Texas System Texas-Mexico Border Health Coordination
Office in Edinburg, Texas. Villas has been leading efforts to
screen children living along the border for signs of Type 2.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, $44 billion is spent to treat kidney damage,
amputations and other complications related to diabetes, most of it
Type 2.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the disease in childhood will be more costly and
more debilitating, said Dr. William Archer, commissioner of the
Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 15 years ago, we didn't even know'' that Type 2 existed
in children, Archer said. ``We are going to have, I believe, an
epidemic of problems with blindness, kidney failure and
amputations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, officials from the Texas state health department
and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation organized a workshop in the
state capital Austin on children's Type 2. Soon after, several
studies were presented at the American Diabetes Association's
annual meeting that looked into the emerging problem and its
primary cause.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Texas Health Science Center recently
completed a pilot study assessing weight problems in three
elementary schools in the Fort Worth district. The three schools
were chosen to reflect a cross section of backgrounds; the
percentage of overweight students ranged from 9 percent to 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Menchaca and Ximena Urrutia-Rojas, assistant
professor at the UNT Health Science Center, sat down with school
officials to discuss screening at more schools.
</P>
<P>
   But screening, while helpful, is just one part of the solution,
said Jackie Thompson, director of health services for the school
district. The next step, she said, will be to brainstorm with local
public health officials about ways to help overweight students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just what the (school district) can do to screen the
students,'' she said. ``It's what's going to happen after we screen
the students.''
</P>
<P>
   For Menchaca, who helped with the school obesity study,
prevention of Type 2 has become a crusade. As a diabetic, he is
particularly concerned about Hispanic children, who, with other
minorities, are considered at more genetic risk.
</P>
<P>
   First, Menchaca screened his patients for weight problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then he sent letters to parents of at-risk children. And he paid
for a bilingual dietitian to teach an after-hours nutrition class
in his office waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   One of those letters landed in the mailbox of Lala Reyes of Fort
Worth. She immediately enrolled herself and her 11-year-old
daughter, Kathy, in the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy soon became one of the prize pupils, dropping her dress
size from 18 to 14 in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clothes, they look so big on her,'' Lala Reyes said
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, physicians were taught that children develop only
Type 1 diabetes. That occurs when the pancreas stops producing
insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2, responsible for more than 90 percent of all diabetes
cases, involves a reduction in insulin. The long-term consequences
are the same if the disease is not controlled through diet,
medication and, sometimes, insulin shots.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and newly
diagnosed blindness in adults age 20 to 74. People with the disease
at least double their risk of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Research is still trying to catch up with what physicians are
seeing in the office.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear, for example, exactly how many children might
have Type 2 diabetes or how fast the numbers are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   One 1996 study, conducted in the Cincinnati area, sifted through
12 years of children's medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1992, only 2 percent to 4 percent of all new cases of
diabetes in children were Type 2. By 1994, the percentage had
jumped to 16 percent, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The average age of diagnosis was 14, according to the study, and
all but 8 percent of the children were overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Those expanding waistlines alarm medical professionals the most.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, 5 percent of children ages 6 to 11 fell into
the heaviest weight category, according to the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 1994, nearly 14
percent of children did.
</P>
<P>
   Potential culprits abound: supersize meal combos, video games,
limited physical education requirements, unsafe communities that
discourage exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is in the school lunch program?'' said Dr. C.W. Spellman,
director of the diabetes clinics at the UNT Health Science Center.
``What about people who supply all the vending machines in schools?
Why isn't bottled water half the price of Classic Coke? Why are
good things priced as a disincentive?''
</P>
<P>
   Lower-income families are often at a disadvantage, because
eating healthfully doesn't necessarily come cheap, said Dr. Robert
Trevino, a researcher based in San Antonio who has tracked Type 2
in children since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hot dogs and the sugar flakes in the morning,'' he
said. ``And that's all they have in the refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   And when approached, parents aren't always receptive to frank
discussions about weight.
</P>
<P>
   Menchaca's office fielded some irate calls after his letters
went out. And school district officials didn't want the names of
the three participating elementary schools to be made public,
fearing embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   More screening must be done before it's known how common weight
problems are among Fort Worth students, Urrutia-Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
   A more intensive screening effort last year in the Rio Grande
Valley area found that 17 to 27 percent of fourth-, fifth- and
sixth-graders had the skin discoloration, known as acanthosis
nigricans. Ninety-percent of those children were overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are right at the edge of the table of falling into
the diabetes pool,'' Villas said.
</P>
<P>
   During its recent session, the Texas Legislature approved
$471,000 for further screening along the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the after-hours classes in Menchaca's office, dietitian
Araceli Vazquez is trying to change eating habits. At the beginning
of the class, she had asked all the children to write down what
they ate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a three-day diary, they are eating pizza with cheese and
sausage and hot dogs and chocolate milk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating between English and Spanish, she leads the parents
and children through basic nutritional concepts with a light hand.
She compliments one girl's choice of 2-percent milk over whole. She
explains why corn tortillas are healthier that lard-heavy flour.
</P>
<P>
   Change can begin in small ways, Lala Reyes said. Preparing a
dinner recently, she stripped the skin off a whole chicken before
chopping it up. As it cooked in garlic and a little olive oil, she
ground carrots through the juicer for a sweet beverage. Kathy
played with the green peppers, using them to make a face on the
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Menchaca wants to make sure that Kathy and other children don't
become tomorrow's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you tell a parent that their kid is going to be sick
10, 15, 20 years down the road? It's so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   FOR YOUR INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   Acanthosis nigricans
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? The darkened skin can look thickened,
rough or even velvety.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE DOES IT APPEAR? It's often found on the neck or in the
folds of the skin, such as the elbows, the knees, the knuckles or
the armpits.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES IT MEAN? The skin change signals high insulin levels
in the body, which can be a warning sign of diabetes.

TWO MONTHS LATER, THE WB FINALLY AIRS TOO-HOT-TO-HANDLE `BUFFY'
FINALE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Funny how things work out.
</P>
<P>
   Not funny ha-ha.
</P>
<P>
   Funny peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   Funny in a queasy sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Students are gunned down at a high school, and a television
series based on good vs. evil profits from the bloodstains.
</P>
<P>
   A niche hit from a niche network finally gets star treatment,
front and center.
</P>
<P>
   Postponing the second part of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's''
two-episode season finale, in which the mayor morphs into a giant
serpent to feed on the Sunnydale Class of '99, was, considering
this spring's tragedy in Colorado, necessary censorship.
</P>
<P>
   But what timing. It set up the drama for a ratings massacre
against summer reruns, while also positioning the WB as The Network
That Cares.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's hour-long episode, titled ``Graduation Day, Part
Two'' and airing at 7 p.m. CDT, brings to a close a season-long
story line, and ties up a number of loose ends dangling from the
first installment, which aired 86 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just enough time for the Internet to buzz, the media and
industry to contemplate, pontificate and salivate, for ``Buffy'' to
get its first shot at what we call anticipated television.
</P>
<P>
   Is Faith dead? Will Angel die? Will the mayor kill them all?
</P>
<P>
   What was all the fuss about anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are here, played out in the series' complex but
customary way of juggling romance, horror and sarcastic one-liners,
and the violence that's at the core of the show's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of fighting, lots of blood, lots of death in this otherwise
well-crafted episode written by the show's executive producer and
visionary, Joss Whedon. He has set up a rather clever, dramatic
exit for David Boreanaz (Angel, who gets his own series next fall)
and made it clear that the series and its characters are at a
crucial crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   The last time we saw Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), she was
finishing off Faith, trying not to kill her but merely to subdue
her in order to save Angel's life. (He needs to drink the blood of
a slayer in order to survive a poisonous arrow; how she eventually
does this merely caps what has turned out to be television's most
touching, fatalistic love affair.) That's where ``Graduation Day,
Part Two'' starts, and it only accelerates from there.
</P>
<P>
   There's a grand plan to stop the mayor/demon (recurring guest
star Harry Groener in a hilariously scary spoof of a performance),
with most of the school taking part. Students fight back with
arrows, flame throwers, harpoons, axes. The fight scenes are
well-choreographed, the dialogue witty.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of $1 million, the episode is one of the more
elaborate of the series, what with things blowing up and the number
of people taking part in the climactic scene. Perhaps this explains
why the serpent, at least on the review tape sent to this office,
looked a bit cheesy. Did they run out of money?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Graduation Day, Part Two'' should have been
temporarily shelved will be debated for weeks to come. The fuss
will die down, of course, and we'll patiently await a new batch of
episodes and a new direction, considering that the core characters
are now out of high school. (I hope I'm not giving too much away by
saying that Sunnydale High is blown to pieces, which is
apocalyptic, considering that Buffy had something to do with the
destruction of her last place of learning as well.)
</P>
<P>
   What shouldn't be debated is whether ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' deserves an Emmy nomination as best drama series along
with the likes of ``The Practice,'' ``Law &AMP; Order'' and the new TV
darling, ``The Sopranos,'' and whether its star, Gellar, should be
competing with Camryn Manheim for best actress.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen. ``Buffy'' is too much of a niche show, too
young-skewing, too cartoonish, too supernatural, too WB.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow critics say they like it, but the series isn't even
listed on its Television Critics Association Awards ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how that can happen, with a series that's the best-written
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Not funny ha-ha.
</P>
<P>
   Funny in a sad sort of way.

`BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER': THE DELAYED SEASON FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<P>
   When last we saw Buffy and her friends, Angel (Buffy's true
love, a good vampire) was on his deathbed, drenched with sweat,
after being struck by a poisoned arrow; Willow and Oz (Buffy's good
pals) were in bed together for the first time, and the mayor of
Sunnydale was eating spiders in preparation for his transformation
into a demon, scheduled for graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   That was in May, and the season finale of WB's ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' would have been broadcast the following week, but
the network reconsidered. So soon after the student massacre in
Littleton, Colo., the thinking went, maybe it wouldn't be
completely tasteful to show an episode whose climax consists of a
high school conflagration brought on by students.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two months later, here is Sunnydale High's class of 1999 in
blood-red caps and gowns, ready to prevent the mayor's
transformation. They are motivated not just by civic pride _ to
save their town from being destroyed _ but by the knowledge that
the demon's first act will be to eat them and their graduation
guests. Just to be safe, Buffy persuades her mom to skip the
commencement ceremony and get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a senior with a
particularly demanding after-school job (saving the world from
evil), has other things to worry about. In the middle of this, she
has to find a way to save the life of Angel (David Boreanaz), even
if he is leaving town to star in his own spinoff this fall. And
certain adults continue to behave with typical idiocy. ``This is a
time of celebration,'' the principal announces at the beginning of
graduation, ``so sit still and be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy,'' unbeknown to the vast majority of viewers over 25, is
one of the sharpest, cleverest shows on television, but you
couldn't necessarily tell it from this episode. That's because the
finale turns into an action movie, though that probably won't
disappoint regular viewers of the series; this episode may not
serve up as much witty repartee as the average episode, but there
are enough emotional-wrap-up moments to more than make up for it.
And there is the occasional verbal delight.
</P>
<P>
   Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter): ``I personally don't think it's
possible to come up with a crazier plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Oz (Seth Green): ``We attack the mayor with hummus.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordelia: ``I stand corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was probably a smart move to delay the finale
until now. It's not only the sight of scores of students wielding
swords, baseball bats and bows with flaming arrows; it's that under
the circumstances of the plot and the show's fantasy premise,
they're absolutely justified in resorting to violence. But the
members of the Trenchcoat Mafia may have thought they were battling
demons, too.

<P>
   Earlier this year, AIDS became the leading killer in Africa, a
mere 18 years after the infection was first recognized. But if
political and religious leaders had responded with effective public
health programs much earlier, they might have prevented hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders simply denied the scientific evidence that HIV was
being transmitted in their countries. Others mistakenly believed
they had more pressing health problems to address.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the epidemic in Africa becomes an even greater
catastrophe, Dr. Peter Piot, assistant secretary general of the
United Nations and head of its AIDS programs, says he sees signs of
momentum among African leaders to fight the disease. The momentum
promises to slow the relentless transmission of HIV, conveyed on
the continent primarily through heterosexual sex, Piot said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa; his
successor, Thabo Mbeki, and Dr. Negasso Gidada, the president of
Ethiopia, are among the leaders of countries with high infection
rates to speak out on AIDS for the first time recently in their own
countries and to put more money into prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And, in May, at their annual meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
African finance ministers for the first time called AIDS a major
threat to economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. General Assembly recently called for a 25 percent
reduction in new HIV infections among young people over the next
five years in the countries most affected by AIDS. And the Clinton
administration, appalled by the staggering dimensions of the
African AIDS epidemic, is planning an initiative to help, Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale efforts clearly are needed. In sub-Saharan Africa,
HIV has infected 34 million people and killed 11.5 million since
1981, dwarfing malaria and tuberculosis. Last year, AIDS accounted
for 1.8 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, nearly double the 1
million deaths from malaria and about nine times the 209,000 deaths
from tuberculosis, according to Piot's agency, which has
headquarters in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Based on meetings with leaders of 10 African countries this
year, Piot says he has noted a striking change in attitudes toward
AIDS: at earlier meetings, he initiated discussions about AIDS; at
the recent sessions, African leaders admitted their problems and
asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a big change,'' Piot, a 50-year-old Belgian and a
pioneer in AIDS research in Africa, said in a brief visit to New
York. In years past, Piot said, even meeting with an African head
of state was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled an incident about 15 years ago when he and another
AIDS expert waited nearly a day in the office of the Kenyan
minister of health while officials debated whether to expel the two
because they had talked to reporters about AIDS in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Zaire refused to give me a visa to report on AIDS, and
the government of Kenya confiscated issues of The International
Herald Tribune, which carried my articles, because of its
displeasure with my coverage of AIDS there.
</P>
<P>
   African political leaders remained silent even when AIDS was
killing members of their own families.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the press secretary to Kenneth D. Kaunda, then the
president of Zambia, denied my request for an interview about AIDS.
The press secretary threatened to expel me for reporting on what he
called an American disease. A year later, Kaunda lost a son to
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Kaunda was one of the first to speak out. In describing
his family's loss at an international AIDS meeting in Montreal,
Kaunda said that if scientists failed to cure AIDS, the epidemic
would become ``a soft nuclear bomb on human life.'' But in the
years of Kaunda's silence, hundreds of thousands of Africans became
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even now realism has not fully set in. Piot still encounters
government officials who ``ask why I use the word epidemic,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It takes an average of nine years for HIV to progress to AIDS,
and the virus spread widely and silently for a decade before being
discovered. Yet even with the undetected early spread, there was
time to initiate programs to prevent subsequent infections, as was
done effectively among gay men in the United States and other
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, HIV rates soared during Nelson Mandela's
administration, a fact that he later acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the silence that is letting this disease sweep through
the country,'' Mandela said on World AIDS Day in December. ``It is
time to break the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Piot applauded Mandela and Mbeki, his successor, for calling
national attention to AIDS, but said, ``It took a long time, and a
lot of deaths could have been prevented if they had spoken out
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, AIDS continues to thin the ranks of Africa's small middle
class, killing at least one teacher a day in Malawi and the Ivory
Coast. It is devastating already weak economies across Africa and
forcing children to drop out of school to till the farms and care
for sick parents.
</P>
<P>
   Piot challenged African finance ministers at their annual
meeting in Addis Ababa in May to learn more about how AIDS was
devastating their economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my speech, there was dead silence,'' Piot said. ``I
thought, another of those moments of supreme denial.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, he added, ``One after the other, the finance ministers
spoke, often making personal references to AIDS in the family or a
colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, many joined him for a drink. ``The problem was how
to stop the discussions,'' Piot said. ``That was a great moment for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Gidada, the president of Ethiopia, and His
Holiness Abune Paulos, the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox
Church, shook hands as they met publicly for the first time with
HIV-infected Ethiopians, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may have been a small thing, but it was highly symbolic
in Africa,'' he added. Yet it was a gesture that political leaders
elsewhere had made in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, which acted early, showed that educational programs
could change sexual behavior after AIDS had struck in vast numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal and Brazil also thwarted the assault of AIDS, Piot said,
taking ``vigorous action'' on sex education, AIDS prevention and
condom promotion to keep the infection rate below 2 percent. ``It
is a major political challenge to invest in AIDS prevention when
there is not a huge problem,'' Piot said, ``yet that is exactly
what Senegal has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Through programs that political and religious leaders
encouraged, the Senegalese postponed having first sexual
intercourse, used condoms more often and had sex with fewer
partners and less sex with prostitutes, surveys there showed.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, stands in stark
contrast, with an infection rate of about 9 percent and rising. A
new regime appears to be willing to tackle the AIDS problem in
Nigeria, which the previous regime denied, Piot said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Piot's team has a budget of $60 million a year, only enough to
act as a catalyst for others to undertake prevention efforts. His
AIDS team, for example, calls on African leaders to urge drastic
efforts to fight the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures show that international aid paid for $150
million of the $165 million spent on AIDS prevention in Africa in
1997. Uganda accounted for much of the $15 million that the African
countries spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scandal that African countries have not spent more,''
Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the World Bank and other international agencies make
money available for projects in Africa, much of it goes unspent
because of bureaucratic complexities and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said his agency was trying to identify untapped funds to
direct toward prevention efforts, while recognizing that those
nations ``cannot afford everything for AIDS, certainly not lifetime
anti-retroviral drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken in combination, those drugs can cost $15,000 a year for a
single patient, require adherence to rigid schedules, and often
demand sophisticated monitoring tests unavailable in developing
countries. That means few Africans can benefit from the drug
cocktails, which are prolonging lives and often restoring health
among HIV-positive people in developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   To reach a largely captive audience, and one in its sexual
prime, Piot is encouraging governments to spend more of their
military budgets, which usually receive high priority, on AIDS
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, the infection rate is about 10 percent in the general
population and up to 30 percent in the military. ``There are
African countries where it is said that more than 50 percent of all
the military are HIV infected,'' Piot said, ``and that is a problem
of national security.''
</P>
<P>
   It also means that many spouses and children are infected. So
Piot's team aims to encourage teachers' unions, school systems and
youth groups to join prevention programs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In some West African countries, for example, Scouting groups
have created an AIDS badge for those who do good deeds for people
with HIV, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   His agency has also teamed on AIDS efforts with Caritas, a
Catholic health agency based in the Vatican that is responsible for
health care in many African countries, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vatican does not approve of the use of condoms,
Piot said that he had seen many Catholic priests, nuns and
organizations promote condom use in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, Piot's agency issued the first country-by-country
analysis of HIV It showed that one in four adults was infected with
HIV in certain parts of Africa and that AIDS was hitting so
fiercely that it compared to the greatest epidemics of history. The
report was a crucial factor in changing political attitudes, Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said he was criticized for the report by many Western
epidemiologists and health workers, who called the figures
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the criticism had to do with turf battles, from
scientists who believe their disease is more important than someone
else's,'' Piot said, ``and it's the type of nonsensical competition
that exists in all countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, the criticism has come full circle. In 1992, a team
headed by the late Dr. Jonathan M. Mann at the Harvard School of
Public Health, published estimates of HIV infections in sub-Saharan
Africa ranging from 20.8 million to 33.6 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization criticized Mann's estimates as
excessive. Now, academic scientists are criticizing the figures of
Piot's team. ``When we look at the figures today, they are worse
than the scenarios Jonathan had published,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Larger budgets are needed. But pumping money into a country
where AIDS is a low priority will not end the epidemic. ``If a
country does not recognize that it has an AIDS problem, then it is
not willing to take on the tough questions,'' Piot said. ``Outside
support for something that can only be solved from the inside will
not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only win,'' he added, ``if there is a mass movement.''

 &HT;    Seeking solutions to suburban sprawl
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to its sensational coverage of the U.S. women's
World Cup victory, Newsweek ($3.50) devotes a sizable chunk of this
issue to Atlanta. In a seven-page report, the magazine examines the
problems of suburban sprawl and traffic congestion. According to
the latest statistics, Atlanta has the longest daily round-trip
commute in the country: 36.5 miles, compared with 29.5 and 20.5 for
Dallas and Los Angeles, respectively. Julie Haley, a 39-year-old
mother of two, moved to a neighborhood of horse farms and trees in
Alpharetta five years ago to escape some of the problems of
overdevelopment. Now, she says, many of the trees have been
bulldozed, ``there's a million shopping centers'' and her kids have
developed asthma, which she blames on auto pollution. One answer,
Newsweek says, may lie with Gov. Roy Barnes' Georgia Regional
Transportation Authority and plans for more mass transit. Others,
such as Republican state Sen. Don Balfour of Gwinnett County,
envisions another solution to hour-and-a-half commutes: more
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Newsweek, the futuristic home of Atlanta architects Mack
Scogin and Merrill Elam is featured in a review of ``The Un-Private
House'' exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The
couple's house was designed with a glass wall separating the
bedroom from a second-floor outdoor lap pool.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kudos for Kubrick: The orchestrated hype for ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' has reached fever pitch in the past few weeks, with Tom
Cruise or Nicole Kidman or both on the covers of Time, Rolling
Stone, Harper's Bazaar and Us magazines. The August issue of Vanity
Fair ($3.95) takes a more subtle approach with Michael Herr's
account of his 19-year friendship with ``Eyes Wide Shut'' director
Stanley Kubrick. In his first magazine article in 20 years, Herr,
the author of the critically acclaimed book ``Dispatches,'' says
Kubrick, contrary to popular belief, was not a recluse. He simply
didn't like leaving his British estate. Kubrick spent hours on the
phone, discussing everything from Jung to Kafka. Despite leaving
America to live in England, he still liked many things about this
country: ``Seinfeld,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``The Simpsons,'' to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Manly tribute: On the anniversary of Ernest Hemingway's 100th
birthday, P.O.V. ($2.99) pays tribute to Papa as the man who best
represented a macho century. Author Budd Schulberg writes of his
early rivalry with Hemingway (``You could call the man a lot of
things _ but you couldn't call him a coward''), and P.O.V. writer
Bert Sugar recalls the author's advice over a drink in 1956
(``Never delay kissing a pretty girl or opening a bottle of
whiskey'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More about Papa: Book ($4.95), a new magazine devoted to
things literary, also allots a large chunk of the July/August issue
to Hemingway. Included are interviews with Hemingway's son Patrick,
who edited the posthumous fictional memoir, ``True at First
Light,'' and Michael Reynolds, whose fifth and final volume on
Hemingway's life has just been published. And, in an interesting
essay, Atlanta teacher Paul Evans says his students are discovering
Hemingway's fiction is as fresh to them as it was to young people
of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Medical news: Emory University Hospital and Crawford Long
Hospital are listed among the 50 best health care facilities in
U.S. News &AMP; World Report's ($3.50) annual survey. Topping the honor
roll of facilities are Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Mayo Clinic,
Massachusetts General Hospital, Cleveland Clinic and Duke
University Medical Center. ... Time ($3.50) offers some encouraging
news for those concerned about cholesterol and heart disease: Many
of the foods once considered deadly are not so bad at all,
researchers say. Eggs, for example, are OK if eaten in moderation.
Salt is not taboo unless you already have high blood pressure; tea
is better for you than coffee; and onions and garlic can protect
your heart. (Just make sure your mate eats some, too.)

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Stories about Republican President-designate George W. Bush
invariably note that he has spent most of his life doing exactly
what his father, former President George H.W. Bush, once did. This
is not quite right. W. has spent most of his life doing exactly
what his father did, but doing it worse.
</P>
<P>
   He is a chip off the old block, chipped.
</P>
<P>
   Poppy Bush starred at Andover. W. lazed his way through the prep
school. The father motored through Yale in two and a half years,
earning a Phi Beta Kappa key along the way. The son squeaked
through old Eli.
</P>
<P>
   Poppy, like his own father Sen. Prescott Bush before him,
captained the Yale baseball team and joined the secret society
Skull &AMP; Bones. W. wasn't good enough to play ball for Yale. And
though he joined Skull &AMP; Bones, he whiled away his nights with a
much less refined group, the hard-drinking frat brothers of DKE.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush enlisted in the Navy in 1942, became the
service's youngest fighter pilot, flew 58 missions in the South
Pacific, was shot down over enemy waters, and won the Distinguished
Flying Cross. The son also became a fighter pilot -- for the Texas
Air National Guard (and the subject of recent press speculation
about how he got in). He spent the Vietnam War flying ``missions''
over the Texas scrub.
</P>
<P>
   W. followed his father's path into the oil business. Both
abandoned New England for West Texas to strike it rich. Both relied
on rich friends for a head start, but whereas the old man scored in
his oilfields, the son struggled. George H.W. ran for Congress and
won. George W. ran for Congress and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Come middle age, the father threw himself into public service:
U.N. ambassador, China ambassador, CIA director. The son threw
himself into baseball, as an executive for the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to forget the heroic life of President Bush. This
was one of his unfortunate talents: He could make the extraordinary
seem mundane.
</P>
<P>
   There are competing theories about what the son's pale imitation
of a resume signifies. The first, popular among Governor Bush's
fans, is that he's a late bloomer. It took him till his mid-40s to
settle down, but now that he has he is making up for his lost years
and surpassing the father he has so long trailed. After all, he has
won a statewide race in Texas twice. Poppy lost both his statewide
campaigns in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Junior has already vanquished former Texas Gov. Ann Richards,
the woman who ridiculed his father in 1988. Now he will topple Al
Gore, half the team that battered Dad in 1992. The other, less
charitable, theory surmises that just as W. has tried to equal his
father and fallen short, so he'll find some way to choke in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   It's far too early to take sides on this question or to draw
grand psychological conclusions about how the father will shadow
the son's presidential campaign. But there is another way to look
at W.'s knockoff resume: as a documentary of a generational change
in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess, author of America's
Political Dynasties, notes that American political dynasties come
in all sizes and flavors. In some, a family from humble origins
uses political success to make itself rich and snooty. In some, a
dynasty is stolidly consistent across generations. The Tafts of
Ohio, for instance, have been steady Republican burghers for more
than a century.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes started as a noblesse oblige dynasty. Prescott Bush
began his (forgettable) service as a senator only after a long
career as a gentleman banker. He viewed his political activity as
an obligation, and he instilled that sentiment in his son George.
Poppy was dutiful in pursuit of office, compiling the requisite
experience almost mechanically, adding line after line to his
resume until America had no choice but to elect him president.
Politics was always a duty, never a pleasure. Remember the horror
of hearing George Bush ingratiating himself with voters by calling
them ``my main man'' and the like?
</P>
<P>
   But what began as noblesse oblige has morphed into something
different during this generation. The Bushes are a microcosm of the
transformation of Republican politics from Northeastern elitism to
Western populism. The son's failure to match his father reflects
this small-D democratization. Bush the elder came of age when New
England Republicans led the party, and patrician manners were boons
to a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era when a politician's ability to communicate trumps
anything else and the balance of Republican power has shifted west,
the preppy, Anglican ethos that defined the old man is suspect.
(George W. Bush spent his 1978 congressional campaign excusing his
father's membership in the Trilateral Commission.) In today's
politics, the son's checkered resume signifies success. By choosing
DKE over Skull &AMP; Bones, drinking over studying, baseball over the
United Nations, George W. compiled a record that suits our populist
age.
</P>
<P>
   W. has bartered the high-status accomplishments of his father
for something more precious: regular guyness. He is warm and
impulsive where his father was distant and calculating. Every story
about the son applauds his democratic instincts, his ease with all
kinds of people, his ebullience and physicality, his informality.
His passionate Methodism contrasts with his ancestors' chilly
Episcopalianism.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore dynasty, oddly, has followed the opposite path. Al Gore
Jr. has outdone his senator father in the calculus of political
achievement, but the veep is stiff and awkward and dutiful in a way
that his impulsive, backslappy dad never was. George W. Bush jokes
that his father's idea of a perfect son is Al Gore Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This may be America's choice in 2000: the George W. Bush who
isn't George H.W. Bush, or the Al Gore who is.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years after one of the low points in the history
of CBS News, its decision not to broadcast an exclusive ``60
Minutes'' interview with a tobacco industry whistle-blower, a
furious battle of egos and spin is unfolding over a film drama
about the episode being prepared for release this fall.
</P>
<P>
   At issue, to some extent, are the characterizations of media
titans like Mike Wallace and CBS News' performance under fire.
Wallace angrily says that the film distorts his role in the
decision not to run the interview. The film's director, Michael
Mann, says it is an accurate look at Wallace's actions and, more
important, the plight of a man, Jeffrey Wigand, caught between a
tobacco giant determined to smear him and a media giant unwilling
to tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   Also in play are the dynamics of television news, in which the
reporting attributed to stars like Wallace has often been done by
others, and the famously thin skins of people in the news media,
who often seem the least able to accept the scrutiny they routinely
give to others.
</P>
<P>
   But the overriding issue, perhaps, is an increasingly familiar
one: the treatment of real events and real people in dramatized
films.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Wigand's story is being brought to the screen by
Mann, a master of atmospherics best known for creating the
television series ``Miami Vice'' and directing the film ``The Last
of the Mohicans,'' and the screenwriter Eric Roth, who won an Oscar
for ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann accumulated reams of documentation, from legal depositions
to news reports to ``60 Minutes'' transcripts, for the film, which
centers on Wigand's decision to go public with damning information
about his former employer, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., and
CBS's initial decision not to broadcast the report. The director
says the film accurately conveys the larger truths of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little in this film that's not substantiated,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To tell that story, however, the film makes use of numerous
dramatic devices that differ markedly from the facts of the case,
including putting words in the mouth of Wallace that he never said
and giving his producer, Lowell Bergman, credit for things he did
not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the realm of drama, you change everything,'' Mann said.
``You change everything to have it mean exactly the same thing it
meant before. You do all the typical things. You collapse time, you
combine characters, you overlay dramatic events. Nobody ever said
in `All The President's Men,' `Follow the money.' The only guy who
said that is Bill Goldman, the screenwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   The new film, ``The Insider,'' revolves around the relationship
between Wigand and Bergman, who, as Wallace's longtime producer,
had done much of the reporting for many of Wallace's most important
pieces. The film tells of the decision by Wigand, vice president
for research and development at Brown &AMP; Williamson until 1993, to
go public with revelations about his years with the company,
including evidence that its chief executive, Thomas E. Sandefur
Jr., who died in 1966, had lied to Congress about what the company
knew about tobacco's addictive properties.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman obtained an exclusive interview for Wallace with Wigand,
and Bergman and Wallace were preparing a ``60 Minutes'' segment
around it when CBS lawyers said that the interview would have to be
shelved. The lawyers said that because Wigand had signed an
agreement with Brown &AMP; Williamson not to reveal company
information, broadcasting the report would open CBS up to a claim
of ``tortious interference'' that could lead to a
multibillion-dollar judgment.
</P>
<P>
   At the time no news organization had successfully been sued over
such a claim, and most First Amendment lawyers found it a baffling
basis on which to kill a report. The decision came at a time when
ABC had agreed to a $16 million settlement with Philip Morris over
an investigative report and when CBS was in the middle of
negotiations that led to its sale to Westinghouse, leading to
widespread speculation that the legal decision reflected a desire
to ward off any conceivable trouble while the sale was pending.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who has since left CBS, said that the film was not
primarily about ``60 Minutes'' or Wallace. This view was echoed by
Mann and Marie Brenner, who wrote the article in Vanity Fair on
which the movie was based. They said the film was essentially about
Wigand and the plight of an individual trying to take on huge
corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike should understand that what's important here are the
issues and not whether his image is exactly what he wants it to
be,'' said Bergman, who said he sold the story to Mann but did not
write the screenplay or determine the nuances of how his character
or Wallace's were portrayed. ``I know Mike is frustrated. But Mike
is going to have to argue with the public record, and I can't help
him with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley
and does free-lance reporting, including some assignments on
contract with The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the film was completed, Wallace began mounting an
aggressive public effort to dispel any notion that he ever
acquiesced to management's decision to kill the interview. In the
finished film, as in the early drafts, he is portrayed as
reluctantly going along with the decision of CBS lawyers and then
changing course and fighting to have it shown. Don Hewitt,
executive producer of ``60 Minutes,'' is portrayed as acquiescing
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said the network did the right thing in the end by
eventually broadcasting its information, albeit after much of that
information had already come out. And he said he saw no reason to
lose sleep over the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told Mike, `It's a movie, OK?''' Hewitt said. ``I went
to see `Gone with the Wind,' but did I really believe there was a
guy named Rhett Butler who said, `Frankly, my dear, I don't give a
damn'? No. Movies need heroes and villains, and real life doesn't
usually have heroes and villains. Real life has a lot of shades of
gray, and movies have black and white even when they're in color.''

HARVARD'S $200,000 QUESTION: `WHY ARE LAW STUDENTS UNHAPPY?'

   &UR; By EVE GERBER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School has undertaken a process of long-term
strategic planning ``so as to maximize achievement of its core
mission,'' according to Dean Robert Clark's semigrammatical but
completely businesslike manifesto in the school's alumni bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this process, HLS has hired the nation's pre-eminent
consulting firm--McKinsey &AMP; Co.--to explain why law students are
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a difficult or mysterious question. It has been
explored in books such as Richard D. Kahlenberg's ``Broken
Contract'' and John Jay Osborn's ``The Paper Chase'' and ``One L,''
a first-year-law-student memoir by future novelist Scott Turow.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints don't change much. Most law students are there
for lack of a better idea rather than any special enthusiasm for
the subject matter. They are heading for a profession that is
widely despised and filled with lawyers who wish they weren't.
These days, top law students can anticipate being regarded as
sharks even as other career options--investment banking, Internet
startups--pass them by in glamour, prestige, and financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they are paying $40,000 a year to sit in large
lecture halls and be hazed at random by a distant professor with a
seating chart. The curriculum mostly consists of long appellate
opinions from which they are supposed to derive legal principles on
the needle-in-a-haystack principle. These two pillars of legal
education--the so-called ``Socratic method'' and the ``case
method''--were both pioneered at Harvard and survive there less
changed than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   No one forces these students to go to law school or to choose
Harvard in particular. Indeed, they compete fiercely to get in. But
this just puts them in an even sourer mood when U.S. News &AMP; World
Report's annual rankings list Harvard Law School not merely No. 2
behind Yale but, for the past two years, tied for that honor with
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns the HLS administration is not so much that Harvard
law students are depressed, it's that publicized studies show that
they're depressed. A 1994 National Jurist survey assessing
``overall student satisfaction'' ranked Harvard Law at the bottom
of the pack--154th out of 165. HLS came in dead last when Princeton
Review asked 11,000 law students at 140 schools to quantify their
``quality of life.'' Now we have something the modern university
administrator can deal with.
</P>
<P>
   This is not psychiatry: This is management.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to be ashamed of in seeing a psychiatrist, um,
management consultant. Nevertheless, HLS did not announce that it
was seeking help. In fact, an alumni survey went out on the dean's
own letterhead and included a return envelope addressed to the
suspiciously inconspicuous ``Research International.'' I received
one in April. It was 14 pages long and contained 104 questions
about my experience at the school, from which I graduated in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a four-member McKinsey ``engagement team'' set up
shop in a vacant law school office. Team McKinsey surveyed current
students and organized student focus groups on demographic themes:
married students, gay students, Latino students, Harvard Law Review
members, and so on. Not wishing to be left out, the law school
faculty voted unanimously to expand the scope of McKinsey's work to
include faculty governance issues. Faculty and staff were
interviewed individually, as befits their rank.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it makes as much sense for Harvard Law School to hire
a management consultant as it does for General Motors to do
so--though how much sense that is exactly is an open question.
Systematic data on students' concerns might be just what is needed
by a law school administration that has ignored mounds of anecdotal
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But turning to McKinsey was a bit odd since the company draws
heavily on HLS for recruits. Three out of the four McKinseyites on
the HLS project are HLS graduates. The godfather of the McKinsey
method (yes, another method), former managing partner Marvin Bower,
is a Harvard-trained lawyer, whose innovation was to infuse
consulting with law-firm professionalism. In light of this
connection, McKinsey is giving Harvard a steep discount.
</P>
<P>
   The study will only cost HLS a couple of hundred thousand
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The connection should also mean that McKinsey enjoys a head
start in understanding the problem at Harvard Law School. But it
does raise a logical conundrum: If they had such a lousy education,
how good could they be as consultants? Conversely, if they are as
good as McKinsey's mystique implies, how bad could their
professional training have been?
</P>
<P>
   But coming up with the right answer to a question like, ``Why
Are Harvard Law Students Unhappy?'' should not tax the analytical
skills even of Harvard law graduates. And, furthermore, the study's
conclusions are more or less irrelevant to the study's actual
purposes, both of which are achieved by the study itself.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is cuddling the alumni. ``NOT a Donation
Request--We Need Your Advice,'' read the outside of the survey
envelope sent to alumni. True enough, there was no solicitation
inside. But the survey is nevertheless a marketing device, intended
in small part to gather information as part of planning the next
big fund-raising campaign and, in large part, to create the feeling
of ownership among an alienated alumni group.
</P>
<P>
   The other purpose is cuddling the students. And here the
McKinsey study has already paid off. Students seem to feel that the
mere involvement of a management consulting firm is an indication
that the administration cares more than they previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Though some faculty members feel McKinsey's involvement shames
the academy, most think it's a healthy development for Harvard. The
students and professors of Harvard Law School would recognize this
as the placebo effect--if they had gone to medical school as their
mothers really wanted.

 NEW YORK: in color.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Wallace has been incensed about the film since he saw an
early script, which began with a scene in which Bergman, played by
Al Pacino, lines up an interview with the Lebanese Shiite Muslim
leader Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah for Wallace, played by
Christopher Plummer. In the scene, the blindfolded Bergman, having
set up the interview at great peril, picks up his cell phone and
assures Wallace that he can get him a hotel with a Jacuzzi and room
service.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace whipped off a series of letters to Mann protesting the
characterization and other issues in the script. Mann agreed to
change some elements, including the Jacuzzi line, which he said
Bergman also objected to.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace, determined that the screenplay show him and Bergman
to be, as he wrote in one letter, ``two peas in a pod, shoulder to
shoulder throughout the entire exercise,'' remained unsatisfied.
His letters ranged from thanking Mann for addressing his concerns
to railing about the unfairness of being depicted as a ``soulless
and cowardly laggard who lost his moral compass until Lowell set me
back on the straight path.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Wallace said: ``If this is
entertainment, why does he use my name and have words come out of
my mouth that I never would have said? There was never any doubt in
anyone's mind at CBS on where I stood on this. And to be portrayed
as having lost my moral compass, caved in. To whom? For what? This
is important to me, or I wouldn't go on like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wallace is depicted in the movie as a volatile and complicated
character, and the precise nature of his behavior could probably be
viewed in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   To Hewitt and many associates inside and outside CBS, Wallace
never acquiesced in the decision, and pushed to broadcast the
report, which eventually got on the air. In the first segment,
which ran on Nov. 12, 1995, he concludes by speaking of the pride
that people at ``60 Minutes'' took in their work and how dismayed
they were that ``the management at CBS had seen fit to give in to
perceived threats of legal action against us by a tobacco industry
giant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bergman and Ms. Brenner said Wallace could and should have
used his enormous clout earlier to fight for the report. Bergman
and Mann said that his comments in publications like The New York
Times, The New York Post and Newsday defending CBS's decision once
it became public indicate that on this one, Wallace's knees
temporarily buckled, however much he wanted to think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview with Charlie Rose on Nov. 13, 1995,
Wallace seemed to reflect the film's view that for a time he
reluctantly went along with the decision and then changed course.
It soon became apparent ``we were simply dead wrong, that we were
caving in,'' he told Rose. ``And I quickly backed off that, if you
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brenner said the film accurately reflected not so much a
lapse on Wallace's part but a profoundly disordered time at ``60
Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a Joseph Conrad novel, men under tremendous
pressure, trying to deal with the larger chill put upon them by big
tobacco,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mann said of Wallace and, to a lesser extent, Hewitt: ``Only
in their imagination are they pilloried as villains. The film shows
them as passengers in a train wreck not of their making, and
everyone reacts in a different way and often without elegance. But
that's what happens in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's anger is particularly directed at Bergman and reflects
one of the enduring tensions in broadcast news: on-air
personalities get nearly all the credit for reporting that is often
done largely by anonymous producers. In that sense both Hewitt and
Wallace see the film as Bergman's revenge, a case of the
underling's grabbing his share of glory. That perception is
reinforced by the long association between Bergman and Mann, whose
film gives Bergman an unqualifiedly heroic aura.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the movie deals that Bergman had secured in this
case and in other instances undercut his credibility as a selfless
journalistic hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowell always had an inclination to blow his part up a little
more than it actually was,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   At 81 Wallace has a reputation as a major figure in broadcast
journalism that will hardly depend on how he is dramatized by Mann.
Still, the squabbling reflects two acknowledged truths about life
in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the negative images tend to last the longest,
whether they are disseminated in movie dramas or hard-hitting
news-magazine programs. ``Fame has a 15-minute half-life,'' the
Wallace character muses in the movie, adding, ``Infamy lasts a
little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The second is that few people are more sensitive to how they are
depicted than those who are usually on the other side of the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have thin skins,'' said Bergman. ``We have no skin.''

OLAZABAL HOPING FRACTURED HAND WON'T KEEP HIM OUT OF RYDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Nick Price had the perfect cure for Jose
Maria Olazabal's broken right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try kicking the wall next time,'' the practicing non-physician
yelled to the unsuspecting patient Monday as they crossed paths
during their warmup rounds at Carnoustie Golf Club for Thursday's
start of the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Olazabal apparently believes in home remedies. Doffing his
cap and bowing in Price's direction, he countered, ``No, I'll use
my head. It's the only part of my body that can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers were getting a kick out of the situation, and Olazabal
certainly was going along with the fun. But he wasn't in such good
humor in his North Carolina hotel room when he threw his infamous
private tantrum last month, punching a wall and breaking his hand
to celebrate the 75 he'd shot that morning in the first round of
the US Open at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   He was fresh off his second Masters triumph _ which capped a
heroic comeback from crippling foot problems that almost had ended
his career and knocked him into decline for several years. So you'd
think he'd have learned to take better care of his extremities.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't as if this was a rash act of self-destruction.
Olazabal claims he went to lunch right after his round, chewing on
the fact that he'd yielded four shots to par on his last four
holes. Then he went to the practice range. Then the putting green.
Some five hours after the crime, he reached his hotel room and
discovered he'll never be a champion boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did pretty well holding my emotions on the golf
course and on the driving range and on the putting green,'' he
said. ``I was just on my own in the room and I could express myself
freely at that time. That's why it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   If the wall didn't make enough of an impact, the consequences
did. Olazabal couldn't hit a ball for three weeks, thus
jeopardizing his European Ryder Cup chances. Though he's back ahead
of schedule, he doesn't believe the hand will be right for two to
three more weeks. That means his expectations of being a viable
contender in this tournament he cherishes are about the size of a
thumbnail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the proper preparation for the tournament,'' he
said. ``I'm still not 100 percent fit. It's going to affect my
chances. I'm going to make clear that I'm here to try the best I
can. It is the British Open. I love this tournament in a very
special way and I will do whatever is needed to play in this
tournament. So for me, it's just nice to be here, even though I
know that my chances are not all that great.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. Monday Olazabal played a practice round with
fellow Spaniards Sergio Garcia, Miguel Angel Jiminez, and Miguel
Angel Martin. Two fingers on his right hand were in a splint
because he can't put pressure on the pinkie. That left him
virtually helpless during the inevitable encounters with
Carnoustie's hellacious heather rough. And when they start keeping
score, that will be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot grip the club properly,'' said Olazabal. ``It is
affecting my swing nore than anything else. It is not that it hurts
when I strike the ball. It's just I cannot grip the club
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems a rather exorbitant price to pay for four measly shots,
especially given Olazabal's previous medical ordeal that wasn't of
his own making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a little thing for you; it might not be a little
thing for me,'' he said. ``I live the game with a lot of passion,
and it hurt a lot (to falter at the end of the round), and that's
the reason why it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still could find an encouraging sign in his rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the time, it would have happened somewhere on
the golf course, throw clubs or whatever,'' said Olazabal. ``So
that's why I think I'm getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But it would seem healthier to make a public spectacle
of himself rather than a private wreck.

JUDGE AGREES TO SEPARATE TRIAL FOR CISNEROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Monday agreed to a separate
conspiracy trial for former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros,
clearing the way for prosecutors to eventually drop charges against
two aides indicted with him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin granted the motion after
prosecutors with Independent Counsel David Barrett's office said
they would drop the case against the two aides, John Rosales and
Sylvia Arce-Garcia, if they remain out of trouble with the law for
six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that this ordeal has come to an end for me,''
said Rosales, who continues to work at the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ecstatic,'' said Jeff Gans, a lawyer for Rosales. Gans
said the decision by prosecutors would allow ``John to get back to
his normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Arce-Garcia still works for Cisneros, who is president and chief
operating officer of the Spanish-language network Univision in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sylvia Arce pleaded not guilty as a statement that she should
not have been charged. Now she will be getting the same result,
even if it is taken a little while to get there,'' said her lawyer,
Abbe Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that the government has seen its way clear to
end this case against Sylvia,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosales and Arce-Garcia were named in the 21-count indictment on
Dec. 11, 1997, charging them, Cisneros and Linda Jones of Lubbock,
Texas, with conspiracy to defraud the government.
</P>
<P>
   Rosales also was charged with two counts of lying to the FBI and
Internal Revenue Service agents about payments Cisneros made to
Jones, with whom he had an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, Cisneros and Jones, pleaded not guilty to the
charges, which are third-degree felonies punishable by up to five
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, 52, was San Antonio mayor from 1981 to 1989 and
housing secretary from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he announced he was involved romantically with Jones, a
political fund-raiser known then by her married name, Linda Medlar.
</P>
<P>
   After a separation, Cisneros reconciled with his wife but
continued to pay Jones, who was divorced and unemployed after the
affair. Barrett claims Cisneros tried to hide the extent of those
payments _ which amount to $250,000 _ when he was under
consideration by President Clinton to head HUD.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin has ordered a Sept. 7 trial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pre-trial hearing to determine whether taped telephone
conversations can be used against Cisneros will resume Thursday.
The tapes are considered crucial to Barrett's case against
Cisneros, and Jones is the government's leading witness.
</P>
<P>
   She has pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents, money
laundering and bank fraud for purchasing a home with Cisneros'
payments that were funneled through a sister and brother-in-law.
Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year prison sentence at a prison medical
center in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she attempted suicide, became addicted to
prescription medicine and suffered from bouts of depression after
her extramarital affair with Cisneros became public. She has agreed
to testify against Cisneros in exchange for a reduction in her
sentence.

REVOLUTION TALKING TO ADDO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did the Revolution revert to form in a 5-2 loss to Los Angeles
in their final game before the All-Star break? Or have they
reinvented themselves as a playoff contender over the first 17
games of the season?
</P>
<P>
   The answers will be provided in the second half of the season,
starting with a July 25 game against D.C. United at Foxboro
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, help could be on the way for the Revolution
defense. Central defender Joseph Addo, captain of Ghana's national
team, is negotiating with the Revolution and could play for them in
an exhibition against Dutch power Ajax July 21. Addo, who attended
James Madison University and has been playing for Ethnikos in
Greece, would provide a physical presence with the experience and
skill to provide the variety the team is lacking. His technical
ability could also bolster the Revolution's possession game.
</P>
<P>
   Addo, 27, was on the verge of being signed by D.C. United in
1997 but failed to come to terms. He was with Sparta Rotterdam
(Holland), FSV Frankfurt (Germany), and Belenenses (Portugal)
before moving to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Los Angeles was the Revolution's worst since Walter
Zenga rejoined the team as coach last August. Zenga has rescued the
Revolution as their goalkeeper in several games this season but was
helpless against the Galaxy's late surge.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution lacked midfield possession, especially with Jair
out with a bruised heel, and struggled to contain the Galaxy. They
failed to capitalize on the continued hot streak of Joe-Max Moore,
who scored twice and has 10 goals this season, one less than his
best MLS total, set in 1996. Moore departed Monday for US national
team training camp and will likely be away for the exhibition
against Derby County in Denver today and the Confederations Cup in
Mexico starting July 24.
</P>
<P>
   When Zenga was hired by the Revolution, he pledged to attempt to
prevent such one-sided losses, especially before a home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all indications, the team was on track to do that, until
(Sunday),'' general manager Brian O'Donovan said Monday. ``But we
can't panic with 15 games left. We will take what we have and
figure out what adjustments we need to make. You can't start from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some aberrational qualities did exist in the L.A.
game. We had done well in the first half, and the score was 2-2.
Then, a major mistakes leads to 3-2 with 17 minutes left. As a
coach, you have to go for the tie or win by playing more
offensively, and suddenly we were even more exposed at the back.
So, it was not a pounding 5-2 but it was 5-2 nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens in sports. You are pressing forward and trying to
get some offense after having gifted the other team a goal with
little time remaining. And you either tie it up or win, or you
lose, 4-2 or 5-2. But this team has shown enough resilience and we
have enough talent on the field to do well in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Revolution had 10 points at the halfway point
in the season and were in a stretch in which they would win only
twice in 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga and assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi have brought
cohesion to the Revolution this season. But the team still has some
vulnerabilities that fighting spirit and togetherness might not be
able to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be auditioning some players starting Saturday,''
O'Donovan said. ``The idea was to have a nice wing midfield player,
but we also need to look at shoring up our defense, given what
happened the last few games. Walter prided this team on solid
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Two South American players _ Argentina-born Ariel Graziani of
Ecuador and Henry Zambrano of Colombia _ became available to the
MLS after their teams were eliminated from Copa America. Graziani
is a candidate for the Revolution and Zambrano will likely join the
MetroStars.

RUMOR WEB SITE IS CREATING A STIR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Do you want to get the lowdown on what it's like to
work for a competitor? Or do you want to know what's really going
on at your own company?
</P>
<P>
   Check out the Web site VaultReports.com for tales, mostly
unsubstantiated, of withdrawn job offers, nasty bosses and cheap
expense account practices.
</P>
<P>
   These are the stories people talk about all the time at work but
usually in hushed tones around the watercooler, said Mark Oldman,
one of the founders of VaultReports.com. Now they're available for
everyone to see on what Oldman likes to think of as an electronic
watercooler. They're not typically the things you find in a shiny
recruiting brochure.
</P>
<P>
   Comments about pay _ who's earning what _ and comparisons of
prestige are the most common topics of discussion, Oldman said.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a job seeker's market that people wonder if they
really have a good deal, he said. They jump on the site to find out
what others are earning and the perks they're getting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the postings, which can feature raw language, contain
startling information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yow,'' said Cheryl Matherly, director of career services at
Rice University, as she perused the Abbott Laboratories message
board. ``Oh, my. Oh, my gosh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They recruit with us,'' said Matherly, reading the chapter
headings out loud: ``Crappy pay'' and ``New Abbott management slow
to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the information doesn't fit what Matherly knows about
the company, but she worries what effect it will have on the
company's ability to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth really shapes the impressions of students,
especially at a small school such as Rice, she said. Matherly said
she has seen small companies without much prestige hire one student
as an intern _ and the student had such a great experience that the
company's reputation on campus soared.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Seff, director of career services for the University of
Houston's business school, said she believes students take the
information with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   It's a really skewed view, and readers don't know if the writer
is just angry, Seff said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter won't allow its employees access to
the Web site, which is kind of like the Catholic church banning a
book: Suddenly it hits the best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the electronic watercooler, Morgan Stanley seems
to have become the most-talked-about company on VaultReports.com's
message board.
</P>
<P>
   Oldman speculates that Morgan Stanley blocked access to the site
because it didn't want its employees gossiping about the legal
brouhaha at the venerable investment banking firm. The firm paid an
informant $10,000 to keep tabs on a former employee, and now
Manhattan's district attorney is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   But Wesley McDade, spokesman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
said the firm restricted access to VaultReports.com before news of
the payout hit the street.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has blocked access to hundreds of Web sites that create
an atmosphere of hostility or intimidation because of their racial
references or sexual explicitness, McDade said. VaultReports.com
allows employees to trade offensive messages without identifying
themselves, he said, and the investment banking firm didn't want to
make other employees feel uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise through the message board uncovered a few messages
directed at individuals that indeed are sexually explicit.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of Dilbert, the cartoon character whose experience
with idiot bosses speaks to every worker, also has stirred up
trouble. Several companies, which are listed on the site's
``pointy-haired boss index,'' have banned Dilbert's site.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with those companies, the site also lists each
company's high and low stock prices for the day, along with charts
detailing their 52-week highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco was one of the companies that the Web site recently
listed as having denied employees access to the site. But a call to
the company's Chicago headquarters straightened out that nasty
rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' said Jim Fair, spokesman for the company. ``We love
Dilbert.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fair said, he was sitting in front of his computer
terminal at BP Amoco's headquarters in Chicago looking at
www.Dilbert.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We publish Dilbert cartoons in our corporate publications; we
send them out to all employees,'' said Fair. ``Dilbert's part of
the team.''
</P>

   BECKET, Mass. _ A door flew open with a crash in the midst of a
panel discussion on Saturday afternoon in Blake's Barn at the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. Fresh, sweet wind gusted in from the
green woods and over the audience and panelists, who included the
choreographer Trisha Brown, the jazz composer and trumpet player
Dave Douglas and the painter Terry Winters. It proved to be one of
those defining moments in life and art, for ``Five-Part Weather
Invention,'' a new collaborative work by Ms. Brown, Douglas and
Winters, is just as fresh and sweet and is filled with surprising
gaiety.
</P>
<P>
   One of two festival-commissioned pieces by choreographers named
Brown that were presented last week at the Pillow, ``Five-Part
Weather Invention'' is a wonderfully playful romp that feels as if
it might have provided exuberant release for the three
collaborators as well as its audience. The elements in the piece,
seen on Saturday night, are simple enough. Winters contributed a
large backdrop painted like slats and scrawled across in black,
with a color at the top whose hues reappear in his costumes.
Douglas' vivid and richly changeable score, performed live by his
Charms of the Night Sky ensemble, helps create a sense of five
flowing sections, moving among styles and genres in a way that
sounds both giddy and profoundly serious. At one point the
musicians even erupt in a fit of coughing.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers spill out across the stage with a similar
changeability: full of purpose at one point, falling limply to the
ground at another, feinting and piling in close and wheeling out to
form more regimented ranks. Every part of the body is used in
``Five-Part Weather Invention.'' The one constant in this happy
scrawl of a dance are slippery feet that bound and chatter, hot and
cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five-Part Weather Invention'' was danced to blithe perfection
by Stacy Matthew Spence, Todd Stone, Keith Thompson, Kathleen
Fisher, Brandi Norton and Abigail Yager. The musicians were Douglas
(trumpet), Greg Cohen (double bass), Guy Klucevsek (accordion) and
Mark Feldman (violin). Jennifer Tipton designed the glistening
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Trisha Brown Company also performed ``Canto/Pianto,'' a
series of highly stylized, formalistic dances drawn from the recent
production of Monteverdi's ``Orfeo,'' which Ms. Brown directed, and
the signature ``Set and Reset,'' which looked intriguingly
sweet-tempered on the rustic bare stage of the Ted Shawn Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other featured choreographer was Ronald K. Brown,
who is not related to Ms. Brown, whose Evidence troupe performed on
Sunday afternoon at the Doris Duke Studio Theater. Brown and his
coolly impassioned, hard-dancing performers are all over the map
this summer, reaping the rewards of richly deserved popularity. And
the Pillow audience clearly connected with the three dances on this
program, giving Brown's new ``Water'' a roaring, cheering standing
ovation. Largely white, the audience was clearly on the wavelength
of this proudly black modern-dance choreographer and his
Afro-modern dance vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water'' looks, however, as if it needs to settle into itself a
little more. The overall look of the seven bodies _ battling often,
rising unbeaten yet poised for danger _ creates an unsettled,
discordant mood. So does the poetry of Cheryl Boyce-Taylor, which
serves, with Fahali Igbo's musical score, as accompaniment. Ms.
Boyce-Taylor threads through the piece like a strong but vulnerable
earth mother or worldly goddess, speaking of children endangered by
too little love and respect from family and authority figures.
</P>
<P>
   But the movement, the themes Brown suggests and the themes Ms.
Boyce-Taylor articulates never quite seem to come together in this
strangely distanced piece. Love and hatred are closely twined here.
Dancers in bloodstained white clothes battle then hover anxiously
around the vanquished. Changing to fresh white costumes with a
faintly angelic air, the dancers kneel for benediction, form and
reform in orderly ranks and seem to receive baptism at one point.
</P>
<P>
   But we know these men and women far less well than the roving
men in Brown's teasing, much simpler ``Better Days.'' On the other
hand, the characters in ``Ebony Magazine: To a Village,'' a company
premiere that completed the program, are almost too familiar: lost
souls who seek validation in superficial fashion and material
acquisitions but whom Brown brings home by the end to a sterner and
more enduring sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water'' was performed by Brown, Taurus Broadhurst, Arcell
Cabuag, Telly Fowler, Diedre N. Dawkins, Celise L. Hicks and
Angelica Patterson. The company also included Pofina Williams. The
program's lighting was by Melody Beal, with costumes by Wunmi
Olaiya, who also composed the music for ``Ebony Magazine.''

 &HT;    GORE CALLS FOR PHOTO LICENSES FOR HANDGUNS
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. With GORE-CRIME-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore took aim at the politically
powerful gun lobby and Republican presidential front-runner George
W. Bush on Monday with an anti-crime initiative that would require
photo licenses for all handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun lobby is sure to have a fit,'' he said. ``But to me,
it is worth it, and I am sure the decent people of America will
agree _ because too many illegal guns are flooding our communities
and too many precious lives are being lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal, unveiled at the Boston Police Department, is
not as sweeping as the handgun controls promoted by former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's only rival for the 2000
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wants to require registration for every one of the 65
million handguns in the United States. In an op-ed article for The
Washington Post last Friday, he chided the Clinton administration
for not advancing such an idea.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's idea of requiring photo licenses for new handgun owners,
while falling short of outright registration, contrasts sharply
with anything proposed so far by Bush or any of his rivals. The
Republican presidential contest has only one strong gun control
advocate, Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too easy for a child to get a gun, and there are too
many political leaders who take their marching orders from the gun
lobby,'' Gore said in his fourth major policy speech since becoming
a candidate for president. ``Let's create a family lobby that is
greater and more powerful than the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore did not mention Bush by name, he implicitly
criticized the Texas governor, who, during his tenure, has signed
into law measures that prohibit cities in his state from suing gun
manufacturers and that expand opportunities for private citizens to
carry concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association Executive Director Wayne La Pierre,
reacting to Gore's proposal, said, ``What's next? Tattooing a
number on the arms of all law-abiding citizens? It's sure not going
to be the rapists. It's sure not going to be the robbers. It's sure
not going to be the drug dealers and the criminals. ``
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said Gore ``would have voted against this in a minute''
when he represented Tennessee in the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Brady, president of Handgun Control Inc., the leading gun
control proponent, said Gore's proposal, coupled with Bradley's
support for handgun registration, means the Democratic presidential
nomination ``will be running on a strong gun safety platform'' next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for Republican presidential hopefuls to let the
American people know where they stand on this critical issue,''
added Brady, the wife of Jim Brady, the former White House press
secretary severely wounded in the assassination attempt on
President Reagan. ``Any presidential candidate who ignores these
concerns fails the test of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech outlined other anti-crime steps, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A constitutional amendment to protect the rights of victims.
</P>
<P>
   _ More federal money for the nation's court system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring criminals to stay off drugs to get out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tougher penalties for people who commit crimes in front of
children.
</P>
<P>
   _ A crackdown on criminal exploitation of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making it a federal crime to stalk children on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ An end to racial profiling by police.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharing computerized crime-mapping technology with local
police departments.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore also urged Congress to pass administration measures aimed
at hate crimes, another seeming criticism of Bush, who opposed a
similar measure in the Texas legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a killer on the rampage picks Jews, blacks and
Asian-Americans as his victims, I do not understand how some can
still argue that hate crimes are no different from all other
crimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are different. They are often among the most vicious and
violent crimes, and more serious still is the fact that their very
purpose is to dehumanize and stigmatize, not only to wound the
victim but also to distort the American conscience,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also criticized the Republican-controlled
Senate for failing to confirm 72 nominees to federal judgeships. He
said the Senate ``continues to hold our system of justice hostage''
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But the gun control provisions were by far the most
controversial. In addition to photo licenses for handguns, he
called for banning the so-called ``Saturday night special''
handguns and a policy of ``zero tolerance'' toward guns and drugs
in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children cannot reach for their dreams if they are ducking
for cover,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has sought to distance himself from President
Clinton in recent weeks, he did not do so Monday. Instead he
credited administration's policies for the current 25-year low in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be just the beginning,'' he said.

IT TOOK A LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. women's soccer team is basking in
well-deserved glory after its thrilling capture of the World Cup.
It is hard to take our eyes off our newest sports heroes _ so
talented, so collegial, so hard-working, so darned decent.
</P>
<P>
   Let's send these wonderful female athletes to Congress. They
could teach its quarreling partisan inhabitants a lot about working
together _ sharing the action and the credit for the greater good
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, that's a fantasy. Congress is a closed world that plays by
cynical rules. Good sportsmanship does not figure much in the way
its particular game is played.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the team's athletic triumph, something of lasting
significance may have happened after all in the creaky, stratified
culture of law and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The unmistakable crowd appeal of the women's achievement should
be a timely save for the obscure law passed more than a quarter
century ago that made it all possible. Maybe now its foes will give
up trying to do it in. They certainly should.
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 measure, called Title XI, guaranteed equal sporting
opportunities for men and women in public educational institutions
receiving federal funds. It persuaded _ or forced _ colleges and
secondary schools to grudgingly give female athletes similar access
to training and scholarships traditionally offered only to men.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Title IX babies,'' Women's World Cup president Marla
Messing said of the U.S. team. ``They are reaping the benefits of
the legislation that has enabled them to play soccer their whole
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us crow a bit here. Opponents said the law wouldn't work.
They insisted that women didn't want to be jocks, that it was a
waste of good money, that nobody would turn out to see chicks play,
that it was just feminist bellowing.
</P>
<P>
   Not very far-sighted, those guys. To say nothing of missing a
fairness gene somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their latest champion is none other than House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who has repeatedly tried _ unsuccessfully _
to undermine enforcement of the law on the grounds that it hurts
men's secondary sports by siphoning off money they would otherwise
have been given.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, college football sponsors tried to talk
Congress into exempting their game from Title IX guidelines but
were denounced as big-bucks bullies and got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that Title IX allowed sexually
harassed students to sue for monetary damages over the objections
of President George Bush's administration. That accelerated the
pressure for compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert fashions himself a defender of the weaker sports for men
that don't attract the big publicity and money of football,
basketball or baseball. He deplores the declining interest in, and
funding for, college gymnastics and fencing, but as a former
wrestling coach, he really cares about that sport.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 speech shortly after Republicans seized control of
both houses of Congress, Hastert pleaded for a weakening of Title
IX to rescue minor male-oriented sports ``that have fallen victim
to an intrusive federal bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In March of this year he starred at a news conference announcing
formation of a pro-wrestling lobby to ``eliminate the use of quotas
as a way to develop equal opportunity in sports.'' Title IX doesn't
mention quotas. But when politicians use the word, it means they
want to protect the privileges to which their favored establishment
has become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said he was demanding Title IX changes to assure
``fairness'' for men in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness? Fairness? The salaries of the women's winning soccer
team run $25,000 to $40,000 a year, plus their unexpected victory
bonus of about $35,000 apiece. No $5 million contracts for them, as
is common for male stars in major sports. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also demanded that Congress' chief investigating agency,
the General Accounting Office (GAO), review sports available to
male and female athletes at 725 schools in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
   The recently released study noted that in the past 10 years
participation in men's gymnastics was down 56 percent and in men's
wrestling down 33 percent while women's soccer was up 154 percent
and women's golf up 80 percent. Overall, women's participation
increased 16 percent while male participation declined 12 percent,
although the figures varied from sport to sport.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hastert thought the study would show that male sports
need protection from Title IX, he was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO study carefully drew no conclusion about the reasons for
the shifts in participation. It noted that women still lag
proportionately far behind men, with women representing only 39
percent of all sports participants and men making up 61 percent.
And it suggested that some of the male sports that had suffered did
so because of an inherent lack of interest and economic support
having nothing to do with competition from women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some schools have helped justify their decisions to cut men's
sports by blaming Title IX,'' NCAA President Cedric Dempsey
said.``That certainly is not the intent of the law and it is almost
never the only factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Hastert is likely to lose on the issue. This is an
era in which both parties are eager to appeal to female voters. It
does not seem like a winning move to pick on the law credited with
opening up opportunities _ previously been available only to men _
to women so they could learn the skills of leadership and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they hadn't been doing so before, women will be watching
after the World Cup victory.

SCHLUMBERGER DRILLING UNIT TO BE MERGED WITH TRANSOCEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Schlumberger Ltd. has agreed to spin off its offshore drilling
unit, Sedco Forex Offshore, and merge it with Transocean Offshore
Inc. to create the world's largest offshore oil drilling company.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said that the spin off was being spurred by the
high cost and greater technological demands of offshore oil
exploration, where drilling is taking place in ever deeper waters.
The new company would have a market capitalization of $6.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most major new finds have been in deep water, most recently off
the coast of West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep water is one of the last frontiers of the oil business,''
said Dan Pickering, an analyst of oil service companies for Simmons
&AMP; Co. International.
</P>
<P>
   He said that drilling in deep water was continuing at high
levels despite low crude oil prices last year. Both oil companies
and firms that supply them with exploration and production
equipment underwent major consolidation to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus demand for deep-water rigs is expected to increase quickly
if crude oil prices continue to move upward beyond levels hoped for
by most major oil companies. The recovery has been due to cutbacks
by major oil producing countries and strong world demand.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering added, however, that the spin off by Schlumberger
``was not driven by any type of financial distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, rigs that can drill in water from 5,000 to
8,000 feet deep can cost from $250 million to $450 million each and
are becoming more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Talbert, the chairman and chief executive of
Transocean Offshore, which is based in Houston, said that the
merger with the Schlumberger unit ``is advantageous due to the
rising capital costs for new rig construction, the increasing size
and needs of our customers, the expanding geographic diversity of
offshore drilling and the technical challenges posed by the new
deepwater drilling activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Euan Baird, the chairman and chief executive of Schlumberger,
which is based in Paris, said that the company will concentrate on
technology and methods of getting more oil out of the ground and
bringing down the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Schlumberger stockholders would receive
about one newly issued Transocean Sedco Forex share for every five
Schlumberger shares they hold.
</P>
<P>
   The 109 million shares that are to be issued are valued at $3.2
billion, using the closing prices of Transocean stock on July 9.
The companies valued Transocean Sedco Forex shares at about $29
each. The market capitalization of the merged company will be about
$6.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Transocean will also assume about $430 million in Forex Offshore
debt. The merged company, which will employ 7,500 people, will have
75 offshore rigs, the most in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert will become president and chief executive officer of the
merged company. Victor Grijalva, the vice chairman of Schlumberger,
will become chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors will be made up of five members
designated by Schlumberger and five by Transocean Offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the spinoff, Schlumberger, which has 60,000 employees
and operations in over 100 countries, with revenue last year of
$11.8 billion, is still the largest oil service company in terms of
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Sedco Forex Offshore had income of $390 million on revenue of
$1.1 billion last year. Transocean Offshore had sales of $1.09
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said that the agreement was structured in a way that
will give Schlumberger a big voice in the running of the merged
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making sure the business in run correctly for their
shareholders,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   Transocean stock gained 93.75 cents Monday to trade at $29.9375,
while Schlumberger rose 62.5 cents to trade at $64.9375, both in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Diamond Offshore was up
$1.25 at $31.6253.

INDIA SUSPENDS MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By CELIA DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ India announced Monday that it has suspended
a six-week military campaign against Pakistan-based fighters who
had occupied Himalayan peaks in the Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir. It said it would withhold firing on them as long as they
complete their withdrawal from Indian territory by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both India and Pakistan said military commanders
met Sunday and agreed to the terms and timetable for the pullout of
the fighters, who Pakistan insists are Islamic militants and who
India just as steadfastly maintains are mostly Pakistani soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Rashid Qureshi, spokesman for Pakistan's military, said
the disengagement would be finished in 4 or 5 days _ Friday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal began at first light on Saturday and is now in
full swing, Indian officials said. ``The Indian army is not
impeding by fire the retreat of Pakistani forces,'' said Raminder
Singh Jassal, a spokesman for India's External Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction of hostilities between the world's two newest
declared nuclear powers _ a conflict that has left hundreds of
soldiers and civilians dead _ follows a hastily called July 4
meeting in Washington between President Clinton and Pakistan's
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. After the meeting, Sharif pledged
that he would seek the withdrawal of forces fighting in the
mountains _ forces Pakistan has consistently said it does not
control.
</P>
<P>
   The incursion into Indian territory, which American diplomats
say was backed by Pakistan, has raised questions about why Pakistan
embarked on such a mission only months after making a peace
overture to India, and about the future of relations between them
now that Pakistan has pulled back from a conflict that had
threatened to turn into a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, which has a Muslim majority, lies between predominantly
Hindu India and overwhelmingly-Muslim Pakistan and has caused two
of the three wars that India and Pakistan have fought since they
were created from the British Indian empire in 1947. Both countries
want Kashmir for their own.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials _ who had taken a great deal of political heat
when the idea of safe passage for the infiltrators was floated
early in the conflict _ insisted that they have not agreed to a
cease-fire. Over the last 24 hours, intermittent artillery shelling
across the so-called Line of Control that separates Indian- and
Pakistan-held portions of Kashmir killed 7 Indians and 12 Pakistani
soldiers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But while insisting that Indian forces will not withdraw from
the Kargil sector of Kashmir, they also said Indian soldiers would
not fire on retreating soldiers. ``As long as the enemy behaves, we
behave,'' said Col. Bikram Singh, a spokesman for the Indian army.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians portrayed the Pakistani decision to support a
withdrawal as a concession to their inevitable military defeat
since the Indian army was on a steady march to evict all the
intruders _ an assertion Pakistani military officials say is false.
</P>
<P>
   Indian army officials say that they had already almost
completely cleared the Dras and Batalik areas in the Kargil sector
of Kashmir. They said that it appeared Pakistani forces had
completed their withdrawal from the Kaskar area Monday, and would
finish their pullout from the Mushkoe Valley by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pakistanis say India was actually losing the battle for
control of the peaks and agreed to a diplomatic solution to bring
the conflict to an early end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are depicting as military victories are actually
military defeats,'' Qureshi said.
</P>
<P>
   The two months of fighting have been costly in lives. India says
that 398 of its men have been killed, and 691 Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistanis, of course, have a different set of numbers. They
say 187 of their men have died in the shelling across the
cease-fire line. And while they estimated Sunday that 700 Indian
soldiers had been killed, Monday that tally rose to 1,700.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has left a great reservoir of bitterness in India. At
Pakistan's invitation, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee went to
Lahore, Pakistan, in February to meet with Sharif and in a
much-heralded agreement the two men had promised to try to settle
their nations' differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian officials said Monday that they are willing to resume
negotiations with Pakistan so long as the sanctity of the Line of
Control is restored. President Clinton has stressed his keen wish
that the nations go back to the bargaining table as soon as the
hostilities are over.

   SEATTLE _ Seattle is about to say hello to Safeco Field, a
brick-facade palace with cedar-lined dugouts, an exquisite turf of
Kentucky bluegrass and ryegrass, and a retractable steel-rail
canopy to insure that the game will go on, rain or shine. At $517
million, the ball park, which opens on Thursday, is the most
expensive in Major League Baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   But the big welcome to (mostly) outdoor baseball here heralds an
inglorious farewell to the hulking concrete mushroom next door
known as the Kingdome, where the Mariners played indoors, on
artificial turf, for 22{ seasons. The dome is scheduled to be
imploded next year, to make way for an open-air football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, baseball's Astros are ditching the Astrodome, which
was hailed as the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened in
1965. The building, the country's first air-conditioned stadium, is
being abandoned next spring for a new downtown ball park that, like
Seattle's, has a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   With football's Oilers having already left town for Nashville,
the Astrodome's future is uncertain. Its major tenants now include
the two-and-a-half-week Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show, an
offshore-oil technology conference and assorted auto shows known as
``dirt events,'' like the demolition derby and ``Monster Truck
Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   These are dark and difficult days for many of America's domed
stadiums, which were once hailed as technological marvels but,
after barely a generation, are increasingly considered obsolete by
fans and owners alike.
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, in places that might be described as
climatically challenged, owners have been able to entice or
strongarm their cities into adopting the vastly more expensive,
have-it-all philosophy embodied in outdoor stadiums with
retractable roofs and bolstered by the go-go economy of the '90s.
These splashy convertible models are already in use in Toronto and
Phoenix, and, in addition to Seattle and Houston, Milwaukee will
open one next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many other cities have already chosen gleaming new outdoor
ballparks that hark back, in design and ambience, to the era of
such venerable stadiums as Fenway Park in Boston, where the
All-Star Game will be played on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Minnesota Twins lobbying strongly for an outdoor
ballpark to get themselves out of the Metrodome, it is very likely
that just one Major League Baseball team will be left playing
inside a fixed-roof dome within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Even that team, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, seems to be doing
everything it possibly can to distract fans from the fact that they
are stuck indoors watching a ball game. The stadium's name, the
Thunderdome, was changed to Tropicana Field. The huge Diamondvision
screen broadcasts live shots at night games of the sun setting over
the nearby Gulf Coast. Palm trees are placed throughout, and in a
section of the upper deck known as the beach, fans can order
tropical drinks at a tiki bar or listen to island music.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is somewhat less bleak for domes as venues for
professional football. Seven of the National Football League's 31
teams still play indoors.
</P>
<P>
   But not a single one has won a Super Bowl, a fact that is a
source of endless speculation for fans (some say it is injuries
from the artificial turf; others contend that the domed teams
collapse when they have to face a team outdoors in January's
playoffs), and nearly all new and proposed football stadiums, like
the one here in Seattle, are of the open-air, real-grass variety.
</P>
<P>
   And, for baseball at least, the verdict is clearly in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There simply aren't any domes out there for baseball that
people are excited about,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics
professor at Smith College who has written several books about the
sports industry. ``For football, there are at least some fans who
like the fact that they don't get snowed on or get cold, and they
never have to worry about the football hitting the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   But for baseball games, domes just aren't a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important, said Zimbalist, is that owners so
far have been able to persuade cities and states to foot a hefty
part of the bill for the fancier retractable models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few years ago,'' Zimbalist said, ``a stadium would cost
maybe $125 million. Now they're spending that just on the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that cities will soon shun the
convertibles, not necessarily for reasons of esthetics, but of
cost. Seattle's new baseball Xanadu is a cautionary example: It is
already roughly $100 million over budget, and the Mariners and
local leaders are engaged in a bitter battle over who will pay,
putting something of a damper on Thursday's big opening, at which
the Mariners will play the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   But fans seem excited, and the new parks do hold out a
best-of-all-worlds scenario: Most of the time, they promise outdoor
baseball under blue or night skies, but if the rain or cold or heat
or humidity or even the mosquitoes come, the roof can slide in over
everyone's head in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Kingdome is a fixture of the skyline, few
people seem to lament its passing. This is partly because it was
never considered an object of beauty. Sports Illustrated once
described it as having ``all the ambience of a port-a-john,'' and
Bob Wood, author of ``Dodger Dogs to Fenway Franks'' (McGraw-Hill,
1988), a book about baseball stadiums, called it ``a festering
pimple on one of America's loveliest urban faces.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has had its share of misfortunes. Heavy acoustic tiles
once fell from the ceiling, nearly striking Cal Ripken Jr., the
Baltimore Orioles' modern-day iron man who holds the record for
most consecutive games played.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, feelings about the Astrodome seem to be a bit more
complicated. After all, its opening was an event noted around the
world and literally hailed by city leaders as one of the great
human achievements of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparkling like a rare jewel on a one-time Houston swamp, the
Astrodome is the Taj Mahal of all stadia from Rome's Colosseum on
down to this day,'' exulted the 262-page book that celebrated the
Astrodome's 1965 opening. Or this, from the opening-day program:
``The searing Texas sun will still beat down, the angry Gulf winds
will still howl, and the tropical rains will still fall, but not on
the spectators in the Astrodome,'' it read. ``They will sit in
almost regal splendor.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The problem these days, of course, is that few people consider
the air-conditioned, artificial-carpeted ambience of a fixed-dome
stadium to be splendid at all. They clearly prefer to watch a game
outdoors _ unless, of course, it is too hot, or too cold, or too
wet, which is where the retractable roofs come in.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome is one of five Major League ball parks closed or
closing this year, and it is by far the youngest. With the
Astrodome, the others are Detroit's Tiger Stadium, which opened in
1912, County Stadium in Milwaukee (1953) and Candlestick Park in
San Francisco (1960).
</P>
<P>
   With Safeco's cost cresting above the half-billion dollar mark
(the Kingdome cost $67 million, far less even adjusting for
inflation), it is not clear whether municipalities will continue to
finance convertible stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many cities are not clamoring for them to begin with because
their climates do not create a need for them; others have resisted
any calls for new stadiums as primarily a ploy by owners for yet
more lucrative luxury boxes. In New York, nearly every indoor,
outdoor and both-ways version of new ball parks for the Yankees and
the Mets has been discussed, including the possibility of a $1
billion, retractable-roof stadium on Manhattan's West Side, but the
issue is far from resolved.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Minnesota Twins now want to move outdoors,
their domed home, known as the Metrodome, was seen as a big factor
in the 1987 World Series. The team lost all three games on the
road, outdoors, to the St. Louis Cardinals, but won all four games
in the dome, with deafening support from the home crowd, to win the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the main, fans here in Seattle seem excited about the concept
of outdoor baseball on real grass, although one nagging issue has
come up.
</P>
<P>
   What will it mean for the team's star slugger, Ken Griffey Jr.,
who hit more home runs than anyone else in the Kingdome (198),
including, fittingly, the last one in the dome's history, in the
Mariners' last game there on June 27?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, widely seen as the current player with the best chance
of breaking Hank Aaron's all-time homer record of 755, might not do
as well in an outdoor park with damp air and other weather factors.
Also, the distance down the line to right field, which he favors,
is 326 feet, 14 feet longer than at the Kingdome; on the other
hand, the new fence is shorter in some places.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners actually conducted a series of wind-tunnel tests
and other measurements to try to calculate the new stadium's impact
on their star's homer production. ``But I don't think anyone will
definitely know until we get out here and play ball,'' said Rebecca
Hale, a team spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this, though,'' she said Monday at the stadium.
``We've got a nice breeze going on right now. And it's blowing
out.''

WANT ADS FOUND WANTING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trick to writing a classified ad is to get as much
information as possible in the shortest possible space.
Unfortunately, there are times when brevity succeeds at the expense
of meaning, as these ads, brought to my attention courtesy of Diana
Sysinger, demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner Special _ Turkey, $2.35; Chicken or Beef $2.25; Children
$2.00.
</P>
<P>
   The ad does not say whether the children come with potatoes and
a vegetable, but at these prices, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   For sale: an antique desk suitable for lady with thick legs and
large drawers.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while for this item to sell as not too many ladies
like to admit they have thick legs and wear large drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Now is your chance to get your ears pierced and get an extra
pair to take home, too.
</P>
<P>
   I admit to being behind the curve on the latest fashion news,
but when did replaceable ears come into vogue? If it were up to me,
I'd get the extra ears pierced instead of my own. It sounds a lot
less painful.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted: Unmarried girls to pick fresh fruit and produce at
night.
</P>
<P>
   I'm surprised a sleazy ad like this ever made it into the paper.
I bet if the unmarried girls are good at producing at night, no one
will care if the fresh fruit gets picked or not.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your topcoat is made of, this miracle spray will
make it really repellent.
</P>
<P>
   This may, indeed, be a ``miracle'' spray, but it sounds to me
like you could throw your topcoat at a skunk and achieve the same
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of cleaning yourself? Let me do it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's very kind of you to offer, but some things a person
just feels more comfortable doing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dog for sale: Eats anything and is fond of children.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like this dog has been given too many leftovers from the
$2.00 dinner special.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you've seen everything in Paris, visit the Pere
Lachasis Cemetery. It boasts such immortals as Moliere, Jean de la
Fontain and Chopin.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know; if I were immortal, I don't think I'd waste my
time hanging around a cemetery, but you've got to admit it sounds
like pretty interesting company.
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of aunts! Zap does the job in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives can be a nuisance, sure, but unless Zap is nontoxic,
this seems like a pretty harsh way to treat one's aunts.
</P>
<P>
   We build bodies that last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Whose lifetime? Mine or yours? The nice thing about a body is
that it lasts exactly a lifetime whether you do any painful
exercises or not.
</P>
<P>
   Man wanted to work in dynamite factory. Must be willing to
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Only once and at a very high rate of speed. Return ticket
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Man to take care of cow that does not smoke or drink.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize that tobacco and alcohol dependency was a big
problem with cows, but now that I think of it, they do have a lot
of free time on their hands (hooves?). Instead of standing around
all day smoking and drinking, cows might consider doing some
volunteer work or perhaps enroll in a personal enrichment course at
the local community college.
</P>
<P>
   3-year-old teacher needed for preschool. Experience preferred.
</P>
<P>
   That seems a little young to be teaching preschool, if you ask
me, but I guess it's hard getting help these days. Either way, it's
going to be difficult finding a 3-year-old who's got experience in
anything, unless you count soiling diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted: Preparer of food. Must be dependable, like the food
business, and be willing to get hands dirty.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't sound like a place where I'd care to eat, even if
the children dinner special is only two bucks.

ISRAEL SUSPENDS FUNDS FOR WEST BANK FACTORY CONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Taking a step to curb building in Jewish
settlements, a minister in the new government of Prime Minister
Ehud Barak announced Monday that he had suspended financing for
construction of new Israeli factories in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by Industry and Trade Minister Ran
Cohen, a member of the leftist Meretz Party. It was the first
concrete move by Barak's government to reduce support for
settlements granted by the administration of Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a modest one, a far cry from the sweeping building
freeze ordered by the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
after he took office in 1992, but it was an early indicator of a
change in priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the start of the season in which state money is no
longer burned and wasted in unnecessary places,'' Cohen said in a
radio interview, asserting that spending on settlements had been at
the expense of job creation for 100,000 unemployed people in Israel
proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here and found that huge parts of the budget of the
Industry and Trade Ministry are going to settlements, and not into
the state of Israel to develop places of work,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that under his predecessor, Natan Sharansky, the
leader of a Russian immigrant party who supports the settlers, the
ministry had approved investments of $240 million in settlement
factories, of which $73 million were subsidies granted by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky also began construction of four new Israeli industrial
zones in the West Bank during his three years in office, a ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen announced that he had suspended approval of investments
totaling $90 million for new factories in settlements, including
$22 million in ministry subsidies. The freeze will remain in force
until the government reviews aid to the settlements, Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines of Barak's government call for a review of
assistance to the settlements, equalizing allocations to those
given to communities inside Israel proper. Barak said after a
meeting with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, on Sunday that
his government would reassess settlement decisions by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have pressed Barak to halt settlement activity,
arguing that it prejudices the outcome of planned talks on a
permanent peace agreement.

SALE OF RUSSIAN NEWSPAPER HAS POLITICAL CIRCLES BUZZING 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Someone not familiar with the average Russian's bent
for intrigue might find it strange that one of Moscow's most
influential newspapers was sold last week to an offshore investment
fund run by two Iranians from a nearly empty Manhattan office.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot is going on with the country's raucous press these
days, much of it unsettling, and Russians who have been fitting the
pieces together do not find such a sale strange at all. They
suspect that the Iranians are a front for one local power broker or
another. An election campaign is beginning, and everyone with
power, from business moguls to the government, is angling to
influence the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Influence has been a synonym for money in some years, but the
consensus this year is that the press _ or, perhaps, the faction
that has the most control over it _ will play a crucial role in
choosing who will lead Russia. The nation will choose a lower house
of parliament this winter and a successor to President Boris
Yeltsin next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, analysts say, dates to early 1996, when a deeply
unpopular Yeltsin appeared destined to lose his re-election
campaign until Russia's information outlets rallied behind him _
and helped pull off a spectacular comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``For everybody involved in this election, 1996 proved that
control of the media _ the support of the media _ is crucial in
Russia,'' said Floriana Fossato, a correspondent and expert on the
Russian press for Radio Free Europe in Moscow, ``in fact,
particularly in Russia. That's why we're seeing this action now.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference this time, of course, is that the press is
not about to unite behind Yeltsin or his favored candidate. The
solidarity of 1996 sprang from fears that a Communist victory would
end capitalist reforms and lead to the closing of opposition
newspapers and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Today Yeltsin is even more unpopular, but his likeliest
successors, by and large, are democrats, if not always
unreconstructed capitalists. Few worry these days about either a
communist victory or a serious crackdown on newspapers or radio and
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   That is not quite the same as saying that the Russian press is
free. Moscow has at least 15 dailies of note, and a scad of
weeklies and bi-weeklies. They flaunt a range of opinion that makes
American newspapers look pinched, and rarely a day goes by without
the flaying of some hapless public official or business power.
</P>
<P>
   But most remain tools of their owners. Moscow is a William
Randolph Hearst kind of town, where press moguls are not squeamish
about ordering up stories to suit their views. Newspapers and
television stations tend to be viewed first as instruments of
power, only later as public servants.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, feuds among oligarchs and officials have been
played out in the press. The most spectacular example occurred this
spring, when an inquiry by Russia's prosecutor general into
high-level corruption was sidetracked by a videotape broadcast on
state-controlled television that showed a man strongly resembling
the prosecutor in bed with two prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the information moguls have that sort of power, it
was not at all surprising that someone decided to snap up
Kommersant, a business-oriented daily said to be millions of
dollars in the red. It does not circulate widely outside Moscow,
but its reputation for independence and accuracy has given it
influence there well beyond its circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's buyers, two 30ish unknowns, paid perhaps $20
million for an 85 percent stake. Although they vigorously deny it,
as does the publisher, few in Moscow believe that Kommersant's new
owners are anything more than fronts for someone seeking an
extended reach in anticipation of a new government. It is unclear,
though, why the buyer would want to be secretive about it.
</P>
<P>
   The denials have not gained credibility with the disclosure that
the remaining 15 percent stake in Kommersant was bought by Boris
Berezovsky, the most flamboyant, contentious and openly ambitious
of Russia's business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that these events are directly connected with
the elections _ the parliamentary elections this winter, and the
presidential elections after that,'' said Misha Berger, editor of
the respected daily Segodnya. ``Kommersant is the act of a group of
private investors or politicians in Russia. Maybe it was a contest
between Berezovsky and Chubais.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Anatoly Chubais, once Yeltsin's chief
economic adviser, now the chairman of the nation's electricity
monopoly and an enemy of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, who remains a backstage adviser to Yeltsin, was widely
reported to be seeking control of Kommersant with the help of a
Moscow bank.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a small book to describe all the political
jockeying among the information barons. But any report would begin
with Berezovsky, an arch-capitalist and onetime Yeltsin ally whose
relations with the Kremlin are said now to be strained.
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone, Berezovsky has been beefing up his information
holdings. He is already the principal force at the Moscow newspaper
Nezavisimaya Gazeta and at Russian Public Television, a nationwide
network that is 51 percent state-owned. And this spring he bought
control of TV6, a popular Moscow station hard hit by last year's
fiscal collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He said at a news conference a month ago that his media holdings
would work to promote liberal economic reforms and to restrain the
Communist Party. Some analysts believe he plans a campaign to try
to end Communist control of the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky's purchase angered Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Through
city entities, the mayor controls a small stake in TV6, a chunk of
a Moscow newspaper, a major publishing house and two thirds of
Center TV, another channel whose content might best be termed
all-Luzhkov, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, an early major contender for president and a political
enemy of Berezovsky, complained that TV6 would not cover him fairly
if Berezovsky owned it.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer scope of ambition, however, neither man is likely to
match the Russian government, which experts say has been
conspicuously busy fine-tuning its huge information machine for the
coming elections.

<P>
   Late last month, the country's second state-controlled
television network, RTR, abruptly canceled one of its
longest-running and most popular programs, ``Top Secret,'' which
specialized in political muckraking, sometimes aimed at the
government itself.
</P>
<P>
   Network officials said the program had descended into
``kompromat,'' roughly translated as mudslinging. The program's
executives responded that it was RTR that had aired the videotape
presumably of the nation's chief prosecutor two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Igor Shabdurasulov, general director of the
largest state-owned television network, ORT, told a convention of
Russian journalists his views on the campaign. ``We will determine
for ourselves which political parties and movements correspond to
our political understanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The government owns 100 of Russia's 550 television stations and
18 percent of the 12,000 registered newspapers and magazines, said
Kim Iskyan, an analyst with MFK Renaissance, a major investment
bank in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the overwhelming majority of broadcasters and print media
outlets controlled by groups that have political power as their
ultimate aim (including the government itself), the media has come
to be a means to the end of power, rather an end in and of
itself,'' Iskyan wrote in a newly issued analysis of the Russian
information business.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yeltsin signed a decree combining all press
functions, from issuing broadcast licenses to overseeing
communications satellites to forming media policy, into a single
Cabinet agency, headed by a state television official, Mikhail
Lesin, who is known as one of Yeltsin's top image-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin rejected expressions of concern
that the government was forming a propaganda ministry, but allowed
that the agency would ``consolidate all the state's capabilities in
_ pardon the old-fashioned word _ `ideological work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitri
Yakushkin, said the ministry was an old idea that Stepashin had
decided to carry out and that its functions would be mainly
technical.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists here note, though, that the new ministry will have
potentially sweeping powers to revoke broadcast licenses and even
to pressure newspapers. But some said the consolidation move could
be a two-edged sword because control of broadcasting, in
particular, had fallen to regional officials, many of whom have
little concept of press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists here say they hope Stepashin is simply guilty of
infelicitous phrasing stemming from his years of internal security
work. Journalists say they take heart from the fact that Yeltsin
has repeatedly insisted that the press be unfettered even as it
attacked him. At the same time, they are unnerved by his mercurial
personality, and by nagging reports that he is reluctant to cede
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have to exaggerate the meaning of these
events, but we can't ignore them either,'' said Berger, the editor.
``During the last year Yeltsin has been an even stronger advocate
of freedom of the press. But maybe something changed. We hope it
didn't.''

WHEN IT COMES TO HARASSMENT, THE CUSTOMER'S NOT ALWAYS RIGHT

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We have some customers who bother the
waitresses. I don't know if it is harassment or not, but their
comments are often off-color and offensive. We told our manager
about this, and he said that the customers are just being friendly
and we should be nice to them. Does this sound right? M.A.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: This sounds right if your manager's priorities are to
increase stress, dissatisfaction and the likelihood of getting
sued. As waitresses, you should give your manager a tip: let him
know that this type of treatment has to stop.
</P>
<P>
   This is an era of increased emphasis on customer service. The
old adage indicating that the customer is always right is ringing
through the halls of many companies. The problem is that the
customer is not always right.
</P>
<P>
   There are customers who engage in all sorts of unacceptable
behaviors, including harassment, rage, theft, abuse and bullying.
There is no need for any employee to tolerate this type of
nonsense, and employers are obligated to take action when advised
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Give your manager specific examples of the behaviors that are
upsetting you, let him know that you want him to take action to
stop it, and then indicate that you hope you will not have to go
outside the company in order to seek resolution of this problem. If
he still thinks the customer is always right, then it is time for
you to exert some of your rights.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Question: The woman in the cubicle next to mine is eavesdropping on
my conversations and phone calls, and I do not like this. I told
her that she should pay more attention to her own business, but she
is still listening in. How can I deal with her? D.C. &QL; 
Answer: If your inquisitive neighbor is a real eavesdropper, she
runs a real risk of being dropped by the company. After all, the
more time she spends eavesdropping, the less time she spends
working. Sooner or later, her performance is going to drop too.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, what can you be talking about that is so
interesting to her? Is she really all that interested in your
business calls, or have your personal calls and conversations
piqued her interest? It is possible that if you spend more time on
work-related discussions, and less time on personal discussions,
she will lose interest in you and find another target. She may even
consider targeting her own work.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you find her hovering over your cubicle, tell her
on the spot that this behavior is distracting and disturbing and
you want it to stop. If the problem continues, you should mention
it to your manager.
</P>
<P>
   An additional interesting point is that workplace privacy is
actually becoming extinct, as increasing numbers of employers are
monitoring workplace behaviors, phone calls, e-mail and Internet
activity. In fact, your neighbor probably does not realize that
while she is eavesdropping on you, management may be eavesdropping
on her.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Question: I work in my family business, and, along with several
family members, I am in a managerial position. We recently had a
discussion about aligning an important part of our business with a
company that I do not like. Several people in our industry have
told me about negative experiences with that company, and I
mentioned this in our last meeting. As usual, my comments were
ignored, and as the youngest family member in the business, I was
treated as ``the baby.'' What steps should I take? L.S. &QL; 
Answer: Whatever steps you take, they should not be ``baby steps.''
The larger issue in this situation is that your comments are
frequently being ignored, in spite of the fact that you are in
management. In essence, it is time for your associates to grow up,
and for them to recognize that you have already done so.
</P>
<P>
   If you are absolutely convinced that you are about to enter a
business relationship that is doomed to create problems, this is
the time for you to take some adult steps. Tell the family member
who runs the business that you have not pushed to have your way in
the past, but you cannot ignore the present critical situation.
</P>
<P>
   Give this person the facts behind your concerns about the
prospective partner, and present some alternative companies that
have been proved to be superior. If you are sent to your room or to
your office, you should approach other members of management with
the same strategy. At the very least, this decision needs more
discussion. If management continues to believe that you should be
seen and not heard, it may be best for your career for you to be
seen and heard elsewhere.

<P>
   NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario _ Out in the fields, under an easy
summer rain, a dozen men in blue slickers stooped over long rows of
newly grafted cherry trees, staking each one so it stood straight.
</P>
<P>
   Dye from the wet stakes had turned Fernando Portugal's hands the
same green as an American dollar bill. Rain dripped from his
plastic hood as he recalled how he had scraped together 300
American dollars, more money then he had ever seen, to pay a
smuggler to help him enter the United States illegally in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For two years after that, he dashed from one farm to another all
the way from California to Washington state, trying to keep one
step ahead of immigration authorities and two steps from starvation
and despair. Finally, hounded by fear and fatigue, he returned to
Mexico with little more money in his pockets than the $300 he had
originally spent to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal paid to come north again this year, but this time the
border he crossed was Canada's. The person who brought him in was
Jim Garrett, a Canadian farmer who had agreed to pay about half his
air fare through a government program that imports thousands of
seasonal laborers a year.
</P>
<P>
   The field labor is just as hard as it was in California, and the
hours are just as long. But here Portugal has a work contract and a
legal visa for the agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, makes all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we live in the padron's house, and we all can feel secure
knowing that we have our papers,'' he said, referring to the dumpy
white stucco cottage that the farm owner provides for Portugal and
six other Mexican men who work at Mori Nurseries in
Niagara-on-the-Lake. ``Here, we don't have to fear anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, thousands of Mexicans have flown to Canada to take
part in a program that predates the North American Free Trade
Agreement by 20 years. The Canadian government saw it as a way to
provide foreign aid and get something concrete in return. For
Mexico, it was a safety valve to ward off the kind of social unrest
caused when too many people chase too few jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers across Ontario say there are simply not enough Canadians
who will reliably work the fields at competitive wages. ``On
beautiful sunny days, I can get plenty of Canadians to work,'' said
Peter Vanderkooij, a farmer in Keswick. ``But when it rains, forget
it. Canadians are getting soft, just like local Dutchmen, just like
local Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal and more than 6,000 other Mexican men and women will
come to Canada this year and stay for up to eight months, getting
paid $4.75 an hour, which is slightly more than the minimum wage
here and far more than a civil service manager in Mexico makes.
They get free housing and free medical care, and they contribute to
a pension that will be sent to them when they retire in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a season, after paying back half the air fare and the $100
for the work visa, a worker can take back $6,000, which can buy
plenty of security in Mexico, where they must all return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built a concrete house with the money I earned here,'' said
Lorenzo Marquez, 54, from Cuautla, in the state of Morelos, who has
worked on Garrett's farm for six years. Cecilio Fuentes, 40, has
come back for seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the contract, we can live almost as if we were in
Mexico,'' he said. ``We have everything that we want, except that
we must be separated from our families.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To groups like the Canadian Farmworkers Union, the government
program is just one more form of exploitation. The Rev. John Jose
Duarte, a Roman Catholic priest in Leamington, Ontario, got
involved with some of the workers after they began attending Mass
at his church, St. Michael's. He says that farm laborers have been
exposed to pesticides and dangerous working conditions, but that
things have gotten better recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The improvements came from within the community,'' Duarte
said, ``because people have taken ownership of these guys and
decided it wasn't right for them to be treated this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The program also transports farm workers from Jamaica and other
Caribbean nations to Canada, which this year brought the total of
foreign workers in the program to around 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally a laborer wanders off the farm and gets into
trouble, and every year dozens of them do not return home as they
are supposed to, becoming illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The workers' days are long, especially during harvest. The old
farmhouses where they are put up are only minimally acceptable. For
the most part, though, the program appears to be that rare species
of government program that works pretty much as it was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Vanderkooij, who has used Mexican
laborers to cut lettuce and tend onions on the drained marshes of
his farm, Cooksby Produce, for 16 years. Vanderkooij himself is an
immigrant, who came from the Netherlands in 1947, and he thinks
hiring the Mexicans will help them get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has the right to do whatever they can achieve,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, of Mori Nurseries, controls 500 acres of fruit trees
and vineyards with the help of more than 100 Canadians and about 80
foreign laborers. He recently tried to hire some local people to
work in his peach orchards. ``Four young people came in for the
jobs,'' he said. ``Two quit before lunch, and the other two
finished out the day but they never came back.''
</P>
<P>
   When the local hires did not work out, Garrett requested several
additional Mexican workers. Three women arrived on June 23. Only
one of them, Maria Teresa Reyes Carillo, had ever been to Canada
before.
</P>
<P>
   All that Celia Duran, 32, knew about Canada came from a
photograph of Niagara Falls, but she did not know that the field
she was tilling was only a few miles from the falls, and just
across the Niagara River from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a contract and we don't have to hide,'' she said,
repeating a sentiment as common as the flatness of the Canadian
fields. ``We don't suffer the way the illegals do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gisela Ocelot Vasquez, 23, left her home in the mountains
in the southern Mexican state of Puebla, her parents urged her to
be careful because she would be going ``far, very far,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first time on a plane, my first time out of Mexico,
my first time out of our village,'' she said. At home, electricity
and potable water had just arrived his year and the nearest
telephone was in another village about three hours away. Canada
seemed very far indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared, but what could I do?'' she said. ``We have all
decided to come for the same thing. We came to get ahead.''

   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democrats kicking off this week's debate on
a ``bill of rights'' for patients vowed Monday that they would use
any Republican-led defeat of the legislation as a political weapon
in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats seek, among other things, to give patients
expanded power to sue managed care providers for denial of service.
But the Republicans say such power would lead to a barrage of
lawsuits that would drive up the cost of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle said that if the
Democratic proposals are not approved, the Democrats would use the
defeat as ammunition in their drive to regain the Senate in the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we control the Senate, which will happen, as you know,
in 2001, we fully expect to ensure that we have a good debate about
these amendments and put the Senate on record,'' said Daschle,
D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle acknowledged that Republicans have a parliamentary
advantage that could allow them to disregard the Democratic bill
and simply vote on the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they have three Republican senators who will
support their bill _ Sens. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., and Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. But they say they still need
two more votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent managed care providers from denying coverage to
patients, the Senate Democrats say Congress needs to hand patients
a bigger legal stick.
</P>
<P>
   They want to change the law to allow a patient to sue managed
care providers in state courts for pain and suffering and punitive
damages _ whatever is allowable under the state's law _ if a
patient was harmed because a treatment was wrongfully denied.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law now bars patients with employer-provided health
insurance from suing the managed care provider for any damages
beyond the cost of the wrongfully denied treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also want to guarantee that a patient's own physician,
rather than an accountant or consultant hired to cut costs, will
get the last word in determining which treatments are medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, business groups and Republican Senate leaders argue
that expanding a patient's right to sue would lead to lawsuits that
would jack up health care costs. This in turn would cause more
people to be uninsured because businesses won't be able to afford
to provide health insurance, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republicans support a scaled-down approach to help
patients fight back if they think they've been wrongfully denied
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Monday, both parties held dueling press
conferences and rallies on Capitol Hill in an effort to more
sharply draw the battle lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., called the Democratic proposals
``fatally flawed,'' saying they would increase health insurance
premiums by about $30 a month and add 1.8 million people to the
list of the uninsured. More than 40 million Americans now lack
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles, the assistant majority leader, instead promoted GOP tax
provisions aimed at making it easier for Americans to buy health
insurance. They include a provision that would allow the
self-employed to deduct 100 percent of health insurance costs, up
from 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, dismissed the claim of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., that the Democratic proposals would cost $2 a
month, or the price of a McDonald's Big Mac. Gramm said the cost of
the Democratic proposals ``would buy the McDonald's franchise in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy told a cheering rally of more than 200 people,
including doctors, nurses, and medical researchers, that
Republicans are merely pushing a ``profit protection program'' for
insurers and ``a bill of wrongs'' for patients.

GOLDMAN-SACHS GROUP AGREES TO BUY ELECTRONIC TRADING COMPANY FOR
$531 MILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Britain, Germany, France)   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman Sachs Group Inc. signaled its support Monday
for new ways of trading securities when it announced that it would
buy Hull Group Inc., a leading electronic trading company, for $531
million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's purchase of Hull, its first major acquisition since
becoming a public company two months ago, is a calculated bet that
people and institutions will increasingly buy and sell securities
electronically rather than in private deals or on traditional
exchange floors. Hull, which is based in Chicago and will operate
as a subsidiary of Goldman, is one of the largest electronic
traders and specializes in derivatives trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this as a way of getting ahead of the technology
curve, positioning the firm to take advantage of electronic trading
platforms worldwide,'' said Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's chief
executive. ``This will help us move toward better trading
technology on all sides of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other large securities firms, Goldman has invested in new
electronic securities exchanges, known as electronic communications
networks, or ECN's, that match buyers and sellers of stocks outside
traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.
Such exchanges help fill buy and sell orders for less money and at
all hours. They have succeeded in taking some business away from
the established exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Goldman is one of the key minority investors in the
trading network Archipelago and also has a stake in Optimark
Technologies. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Goldman recently teamed up
with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities to develop their own
electronic stock trading system.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hull purchase is by far Goldman's largest investment in
a new trading medium. It will make Goldman one of the world's
largest electronic market makers for derivatives, especially stock
and index options.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had $103.1 million in revenue and $40.6 million in pretax
profits last year. The company derives more than half of its
revenue in Europe, where electronic trading of securities is a step
ahead of the United States, said M. Blair Hull, Hull's founder and
chief executive. It has a substantial market presence on Britain's
FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presence in Europe will give Goldman a head start in being
an effective participant in those markets,'' said Hull, who will
continue to serve as Hull's top executive after the sale to
Goldman. ``We will also look for synergies in many other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull had earlier filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to sell its shares through an initial public offering,
which would have valued the company at $410 million to $474
million. Goldman said it would pay $531 million for Hull in cash
and stock, but it did not provide a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, told reporters
in a conference call Monday that the acquisition would probably not
affect Goldman's earnings this year but should add to its bottom
line after that.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Goldman rose $1.125, to $68.375.

AUSSIES KEEP THEIR HOPES UP

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was short, but sweet; small, but
significant.
</P>
<P>
   So much has gone wrong for the Australian Davis Cup team the
last two weeks, but there was a glimmer of hope Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Woodforde jumped two steps back and slapped a return that
headed straight to practice partner Andrew Ilie on the other side
of the net. It looked as if Ilie had an easy opportunity to put the
shot away and tie the score, 15-15, in a practice doubles match
against Woodforde and Sandan Stolle.
</P>
<P>
   But with the reflexes of a cheetah, Stolle flailed his racket
and redirected the ball down the right side of the court, inbounds
but out of reach, making it 30-love.
</P>
<P>
   Stolle and Woodforde, who as of Monday were the Aussies' Davis
Cup doubles team, walked away from the net and smiled at each other
as Ilie shouted curse words in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this will work out, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Woodbridge, who together with Woodforde has been an almost
guaranteed win in doubles competition, announced he was withdrawing
from this weekend's Davis Cup quarterfinal at Longwood Cricket
Club, citing a lingering right arm injury and lack of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Australian captain John Newcombe announced Stolle will join
Patrick Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt, and Woodforde as the Australian
Davis Cup Team, take two. But the way things have unfolded for the
Australians, there may be a few more takes to go before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed by 50 percent,'' Newcombe said. ``I think the
favoritism has shifted to (the USA). I think it was a 50-50 call
before, but now they have to be feeling good about their chances.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd have asked Newcombe in March, he would've told you the
tie, or five-match competition, would have taken place in
Australia. But the International Tennis Federation overruled
Australia's right to choose the site and staged the event at
Longwood _ site of the first-ever Davis Cup 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site, I guess, was a given,'' Newcombe said. ``We can't be
concerned about that. That's history.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd have asked Newcombe three weeks ago, he would have told
you his Australians would meet a US team consisting of Jim Courier,
Tim Martin, and Alex O'Brien. That changed when the world's No. 3
singles player, Pete Sampras, decided to join in the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's been No. 1 in the world six years in a row,''
Newcombe said, ``I'd rather he wasn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd have asked Newcombe two weeks ago, he would have told
you his four-man squad would be Rafter (the No. 2 singles player in
the world), Mark Philippoussis (one of Australia's top singles
players), and ``the Woodies'' (Australia's leading Davis Cup
doubles team which hasn't lost a Davis Cup match in 5 1/2 years).
</P>
<P>
   That changed 12 days ago, when Philippoussis injured his knee
playing Sampras at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   And if you'd have asked Newcombe Friday, he would have told you
his four-man squad was still evenly matched with the Americans,
since 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt gives the team a young, aggressive
talent to replace Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lleyton gets his teeth into a match, he's very hard for
anyone to beat,'' Newcombe said.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed Saturday, when Newcombe learned that he had
lost Woodbridge as well as Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a tremendous loss,'' Newcombe said. ``Two very good,
competitive players.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he could only muster a cynical smile while pondering
what else could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maybe not as good as before, but we're lucky we have two
good backups to put in our open spots,'' Newcombe said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe said Monday his doubles team, which competes Saturday,
would be Woodforde and Stolle, winners of the '98 US Open doubles
competition. But that can't be set in stone just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe is considering teams of Rafter and Woodforde (who won
together against Croatia in '96) and Rafter and Stolle (who went
5-0 together at the World Team Cup in May).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decision will hinge upon how rigorous Rafter's
singles match is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Todd's withdrawal is a bit of a blow, as we haven't lost
a Davis Cup doubles match in five years,'' Newcombe said. ``I feel
very confident that Pat or Sandon will get the job done with
Mark.''

formula that has long kept the peace with China, declaring that it
will no longer adhere to the line that the Chinese mainland and
Taiwan are two parts of the same country. Beijing's response is

has been a basic condition of all its talks with Beijing, Taiwan's

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Fencing Master,'' a new intellectual thriller by the
Spanish novelist Arturo Perez-Reverte, the title character, Don
Jaime Astarloa, undertakes his most daunting assignment. A
gentleman of the old school, he is approached by a seductive woman
who wants him to teach her his masterly fencing secret, a sword
thrust that is impossible to parry.
</P>
<P>
   Don Jaime is soon drawn into intricate plots and counterplots in
this 19th-century adventure, in which fencing is characterized as
both an art and a mathematical science. As the novelist explained
during a recent visit to New York, for him fencing is also a moral
code.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through an interpreter, Perez-Reverte said: ``The book
deals with being an honorable person in a dishonest world. The
fencing master does not sell himself. That's his tragedy, and that
is also his strength and his glory.'' He added, ``Perhaps I'm also
referring to the problem of contemporary man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, which takes place in Madrid, that unstoppable
thrust is described in vivid detail, but Perez-Reverte made it
clear that it was a fiction. ``It doesn't exist,'' he said. ``I
constructed a theoretically perfect thrust, but I eliminated a few
intermediate movements so that nobody could execute it. It has the
appearance of being perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Fencing is typical of the intriguing and often esoteric
backgrounds Perez-Reverte chooses for his novels. In ``The Flanders
Panel,'' the book that established the author's reputation, an art
restorer discovers a murder mystery in a medieval painting of a
chess game. ``The Club Dumas'' moves into the world of antiquarian
books and a manual for summoning the Devil. ``The Seville
Communion'' explores the internet along with the Vatican, as a
hacker breaks into the pope's private computer. Led by the dashing
Father Lorenzo Quart, the mystery shifts from Rome to Seville,
where there is a battle over a Baroque church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fencing Master'' is actually one of Perez-Reverte's
earliest works, first published in 1988 in Spain, and now here
after his other best sellers. In his dozen years as a novelist,
Perez-Reverte, who is 47, has had a streak of uncommon good
fortune. His books have been translated from Spanish and published
in 24 other countries. Several have been filmed, the latest, ``The
Club Dumas,'' by Roman Polanski. The movie, retitled ``The Ninth
Gate,'' stars Johnny Depp and is scheduled to be released late this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As orchestrated by the author's various heroes (usually
reluctant), these books are tantalizing exercises in gamesmanship
as well as provocative mysteries. They are filled with literary and
cinematic references.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Club Dumas,'' there is a list of works by Alexandre
Dumas, including a travel book titled ``The Fencing Master.'' In
``The Seville Communion,'' a comic subplot involves a trio of
bumbling gangsters who are, he said, the equivalent of the
sergeants in John Ford westerns. Their leader prides himself on his
past friendship with Hemingway and Graham Greene, among others, and
has relics (Hemingway's cigarette lighter) to prove his
relationships. Perez-Reverte added that his favorite film was
directed not by Ford but by Jean Negulesco: ``The Mask of
Dimitrios,'' a Hollywood adaptation of an Eric Ambler mystery. One
of the pleasures of writing fiction, he said, is ``intertextuality
_ to wink and refer to books and movies that I've loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he chose his subjects, he said: ``We all have ghosts,
remorse, dreams, things we love and hate. One day something in life
_ a word, a phrase, something in a book, a beautiful woman _
clicks, and part of that world takes on a special meaning. And you
realize you have a story to tell.''

   ``The Fencing Master'' is about a world that he knows
intimately. His interest in fencing began in his youth in
Cartagena. He was brought up to be a gentleman, and his mentor was
his grandfather: ``He would say that he hated sports in which you
wore shorts and that fencing was the only sport that a gentleman
could engage in. From the age of 7 to 12, my brothers and I had
classes in fencing. It was part of my upbringing, my finishing
school. It did not mark my life, but it did leave a certain
impression in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When he decided to write the novel, he used his grandfather as a
role model. Physically, the handsome, dignified Don Jaime bears a
resemblance to him. The two also share attitudes, ``that pride
which is a defense mechanism against solitude, a kind of
intellectual solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fencing Master'' is dedicated to the author's 15
year-old-daughter, Carlota, and to ``the Knight of the Yellow
Doublet,'' the title of a swashbuckling play written by his
grandfather and performed on family occasions.
</P>
<P>
   With a library of 8,000 volumes, his grandfather was a reader
and book collector, and he passed those preoccupations (as well as
his collection) on to his grandson. Following the family tradition,
Perez-Reverte has increased the library to include the complete
works of Melville, Jack London, Conrad and Patrick O'Brian as well
as classics of Greek and Latin literature. The books are in his
home in the mountains outside Madrid, and it is there that he does
all his writing.
</P>
<P>
   He is a latecomer to fiction, writing his first novel at 34
after a career as a journalist and television personality, covering
wars from the Middle East to Central America. By his own
description, as a war correspondent he was an ``honest mercenary,''
recording facts of battle while not expressing his own opinion.
Increasingly he grew cynical about the limits of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   As a novelist, he is, in his words, ``a sniper.'' ``I use all
genres,'' he said. ``Mystery, history, police. Television and Ken
Follett best sellers are as useful to me as narrative tools as
Conrad's onomatopeia or the sense of time in Thomas Mann.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Fencing Master,'' Don Jaime says that ``in fencing it's
simplicity that requires inspiration'' and the more complex moves
are ``just techniques.'' The author acknowledged this as a lesson
to the writer, too: ``For me, writing seeks efficiency. I detest it
when novels are written about the impossibility of writing a novel.
I believe that novels should be at the same time entertaining and
profound.'' For profundity, he points to Thomas Pynchon. ``V'' is,
he said, the ``best American novel I've read in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing his own writing process, he said it was like ``laying
a minefield,'' in which he places his ``tricks, traps and false
leads.'' Behind them is an artful structure and a wealth of
information, some of it drawn from books pertinent to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing and reading are his principal interests; he designed his
own 15-foot sailboat with a library for several hundred books. He
is also obsessed by the idea of sunken galleons and has planted
references to them in his novels. His next book will deal more
directly with that subject. It is, he said, about a contemporary
sailor and 18th-century map making and problems of latitude and
longitude. In preparation, he has gathered books ``about sailing,
submarine archeology, the history of navigation in the 18th
century, nautical photography and astronomy, old maps from Havana,
Cadiz and Cartagena and a book called `The Problems of Crimes in
Closed Rooms.'''
</P>
<P>
   As he discussed these diverse resources, he sounded as if he
were a youth exploring his grandfather's library. ``The true magic
of literature is to get the reader to take on the role of a
child,'' he said, ``and to live his own adventure through the book.
He should take off for the pirate's island. That's how I see
literature _ and how I live it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he described a dream: ``One day I'll stop writing, and the
only thing I'll do is sail and read. Just imagine a marvelous day:
a beautiful bay, a wind speed of 50 knots and Catherine Zeta-Jones
seated on the ship by my side.'' For him, only one thing is missing
from that seemingly perfect picture. ``If in addition, I know that
in that bay there is a galleon laden with treasure sunk two
centuries earlier, everything suddenly takes on a much more intense
meaning.''

FEDS SMASH SOUTH TEXAS SMUGGLING OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities have broken up a 15-year smuggling operation
that specialized in sneaking thousands of undocumented immigrants
past the Border Patrol's main checkpoint for traffic leaving the
Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year undercover operation, known as ``Operation Snake
Pit,'' resulted in a dozen guilty pleas authorities announced
Monday. Among those who pleaded guilty were seven members of a
family in Raymondville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the U.S. Justice Department and the smugglers
agreed to the destruction of two apartment complexes, a motel and a
house _ all in Raymondville _ used as a staging ground for sneaking
people further north.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to bulldoze four places,'' said Rick Aguirre,
head of the U.S. Border Patrol's anti-smuggling operations for the
Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They smuggled a lot of people; this family was the nucleus,''
Aguirre, said of the operation that was headed by Olga Contreras,
60, and aided by her husband and five children.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol and the FBI joined forces to take on the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities took notice of the Contreras in January 1997
when more than 350 undocumented immigrants were found, packed like
sardines, into a Raymondville apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants were squeezed into rooms with space heaters and
mattresses. Some had been there for as long as a week.
</P>
<P>
   Raymondville, which has a population of 9,200, is about 28 miles
south of a Border Patrol checkpoint on U.S. 77 and is considered a
``choke point'' for railway, foot and vehicle traffic headed out of
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty pleas, entered at federal court in Brownsville,
headed off a slew of charges stemming from a February indictment
including harboring aliens, welfare fraud, money laundering and the
possession and sale of counterfeit Social Security cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock Courts Motel and Lounge, Los Milagros Apartments and
the other properties are scheduled to be destroyed by the Texas
National Guard in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all looking forward to the opportunity to clean that
area up,'' Don Calvert, a federal prosecutor, said of the
buildings. ``I do not know of any case where it has been done
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulldozers will roll after sentencing in which the
defendants face up to 30 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Contreras own several pieces of property in Raymondville,
including a grocery story which was used to provide food and
supplies to the would-be immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Contreras organization has been smuggling and harboring
aliens in the Raymondville area for the past 10 to 15 years,''
according to a statement released by the FBI. ``It is believed the
family and their associates are responsible for harboring thousands
of aliens during that time period.''

STOCK OFFERING BY INSURANCE COMPANY BOOSTS SOUTH AFRICA'S ECONOMY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A single South African company sold
shares to the public for the first time Monday, and the response
was so big that economists predicted that it could add 1 percent to
the country's faltering economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The company, commonly known as Old Mutual, is the country's
largest insurer _ 7 percent of the population has policies with it
_ and it is one of the five biggest companies in South Africa. Its
chief businesses are life insurance, pension plans, mutual funds,
banking and real estate. But because 20 years of apartheid
sanctions forced local companies to invest only locally, it has
stakes in everything from coal to hotels to clothing chains to oat
cereals.
</P>
<P>
   After mining, insurance is South Africa's biggest economic
powerhouse. For decades, South Africans have held most of their
savings in insurance policies rather than in banks or stocks. The
reason, economists said, is a combination of favorable tax
treatment for insurance and ignorance about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As a mutual insurer _ Old Mutual's formal name is the South
African Mutual Life Assurance Society _ it was owned by
policyholders. Today's conversion to stock and the public sale gave
it a market value of about $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   About $2 billion of Monday's sale will go directly to the 1
million Old Mutual policyholders who asked the company to sell
their new shares for them. The spending of that windfall, several
economists estimated, could boost the gross domestic product by
between 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent. Another 2.2 million
policyholders held their shares, in effect creating an enormous new
pool of shareholder wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The issue single-handedly tripled the record for volume on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange; it reached 1 billion shares, up from
304 million. Old Mutual shares trading on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange closed at 13.10 rand or about $2.13, compared with the
11.25-rand price initially set.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's primary listing was in London, where the
shares closed at 137.5 pence or about $2.15, compared with the
initial price of 120 pence. Buying there was strong; about a third
of the company is now owned by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been wonderful for us, and I hope all our new
shareholders are as happy as I am,'' Gerritt van Niekerk, the
company's managing director, said after the sale Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company will use the cash raised to pay for overseas
acquisitions, especially in asset management and private banking,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting government permission to list in London took months of
negotiations, and promises that the business would still be
regulated here.
</P>
<P>
   Because exchange control regulations _ originally instituted to
stop the flight of nervous capital that began after the 1976 Soweto
riots _ had prevented Old Mutual from buying overseas except
through complicated asset swaps, the London listing allows a major
player in South Africa's insulated economy to diversify globally.
Other big South African companies, including Anglo-American PLC,
the conglomerate built on gold mining, and South African Breweries,
the world's fourth-largest brewer, now have their primary listings
in London.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in a year that a local insurance giant
has converted from policyholder to stockholder ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the South African National Life Assurance Co.,
better known as Sanlam, did so, although the overall effect was
smaller, for several reasons: Sanlam is half the size of Old
Mutual; it made it harder for policyholders to sell their new
shares, and they sold into a falling market.
</P>
<P>
   Major changes have swept South African companies in the last few
years _ faced with global competition, banks and insurance
companies have merged, mining conglomerates have rearranged
themselves to concentrate on core businesses, brokerage houses have
sought foreign partners and companies like the national airline and
telephone company have imported foreign chief executive officers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have touted demutualization as a ``black
empowerment'' exercise because many holders of small policies are
black and became shareholders for the first time today.
</P>
<P>
   Demutualization has also had a hidden side effect that delights
the government: South Africa has a serious problem with tax cheats,
and the government has been perusing lists of Sanlam and Old Mutual
policyholders and seizing the share rights of all those in arrears.
Last month, the South African Revenue Service estimated that about
$85 million of Monday's windfall would go into its coffers.

BRITISH PROPOSAL AIMS TO BREAK NORTHERN IRELAND STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With only days left before a make-or-break decision on
a new government for Ulster, Britain Monday proposed a measure
aimed at obtaining Protestant support by requiring the Irish
Republican Army to follow an enforceable disarmament timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of when and how the largely Catholic IRA will disarm
has been the main sticking point in carrying out the Northern
Ireland peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The complex measure contained what Prime Minister Tony Blair
called a ``fail-safe mechanism'' with procedures for banishing Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political arm, from the new all-party government if
there were a delay in dismantling the guerrilla arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant politicians have been demanding such assurances
before they will agree to allow the new government in the
conflicted British province to begin operations by naming its
cabinet this week. David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists,
indicated he was still not satisfied and met Monday night with
Blair at 10 Downing St. to press the argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still continuing problems, but also there is still
continuing consultation,'' Trimble said on emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Blair spoke by phone during the day about the continuing
stalemate with President Clinton and with Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern of Ireland, whose government is a co-sponsor of the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians tried to nail down the necessary compromises
in London, uniformed members of the Protestant Orange Order were
observing the most important day in their annual marching calendar,
to celebrate long-ago Protestant victories. The marches have often
caused conflict with Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 20 flute-and-snare-drum parades across Ulster,
including one that attracted 30,000 people to a park ringed with
barbed wire in downtown Belfast across the Lagan River from a large
Catholic neighborhood. The parades went off without major
disruption under the strictest security by police and British
troops yet seen in the annual Protestant marching season.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-foot steel and concrete barrier was erected to block a
bridge to the Lower Ormeau Road community, a Catholic area where
Protestant marches have led to past conflicts. Orange leaders
marched up to it and handed a letter of protest to a Royal Ulster
Constabulary officer.
</P>
<P>
   July 12 is the date on which Orangemen commemorate the victory
of the Protestant King William over the Roman Catholic James II in
the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. In past years, the parades have
led to widespread violence, but this year security was tightened
and the Order urged troublemakers to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday's march at Drumcree church near Portadown, a
flashpoint for violence the last five years, ended peaceably as did
the one Monday in Belfast. In both cases, Orange grandmasters
delivered letters protesting the government-appointed Parades
Commission's decisions to forbid them to pass directly through
Catholic residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, whose party is the largest in the province, is the
first minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, and he must
decide by Thursday whether to put into action the next critical
step of the accord _ the creation of the 10-member Cabinet. Two of
the seats belong to Sinn Fein, and the Ulster Unionists are
demanding legislative guarantees that if the IRA does not comply
with the disarmament timetable, the Sinn Fein ministers will be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to satisfy that demand produced the last-minute
modifications on disarmament to Monday's House of Commons measure,
which is the vehicle by which authority is to be turned over to the
new Assembly in Belfast from the British Parliament here.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now enters a virtual wind tunnel of legislative action
to meet deadlines set by Blair. It must go through readings and
debate and be passed in the Commons on Tuesday, clear the House of
Lords on Wednesday, obtain Royal Assent on Thursday and be enacted
by the Commons on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is officially the day that powers are to be ``devolved''
to Belfast. It is the same way that authority was shifted to the
new legislatures in Scotland and Wales on July 1 under Blair's
program to grant regions of Britain the right to govern their own
local affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of truth will come Wednesday night when Trimble meets
with his 110-member executive committee in Belfast to decide
whether to take the risk of entering government with Sinn Fein
under the terms Blair has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble refuses to name the new ministers on Thursday, the
whole peace agreement will come under review, though details of how
that would happen have been left deliberately vague. ``I have no
plan B,'' Blair has repeatedly said since setting a series of final
dates for the transfer of power to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of negotiations more than two years ago that
produced a peace settlement in April, 1998, Blair has established
deadlines and then let several of them pass inconclusively in the
interests of keeping the fragile proposition standing. This time he
has appeared more frustrated with the lack of progress and less
inclined to consider another postponement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have taken it as far as we possibly can if we
really can't make progress now,'' he said Sunday. ``I have spent
days and weeks in negotiations, and this issue is not going to
change. It is a question of whether people are prepared to take the
gun out of the politics of Northern Ireland and whether, on the
other side, people are prepared to share power. There are just so
many ways you can dress that proposition up.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Monday's bill, the Cabinet _ along with the
whole assembly and the newly created North-South entities that link
the Belfast and Dublin governments _ would be suspended if the head
of the independent international disarmament commission, Gen. John
de Chastelain of Canada, ruled that the IRA were in default.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no commitment is made to de Chastelain, we will know where
we are,'' said a spokesman for Blair, explaining the assurances
being extended to Trimble. ``People will know where responsibility
lies. We will press the rewind button and be back where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Ulster Unionists were seeking a guarantee that if the
IRA does not meet disarmament goals, Sinn Fein would be expelled
and the government would continue. The language of the bill calls
only for a vote of the parties in the assembly at that point on how
to proceed. Trimble said he would have amendments to the bill on
Tuesday before it begins its hasty passage through the Commons.

DID ROBIN HOOD FROLIC IN THE FOREST GAILY?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Stephen Knight &LR; , professor of English Literature at Cardiff
University in Wales, says  &UR; Robin Hood &LR;  was gay and liked  &UR; Little &LR; 
 &UR; John &LR;  better than Maid Marian, who was fictional anyway.
</P>
<P>
   According to Knight, 14th century ballads about the adventures
of the outlaw and his ``merrie men'' could not ``say outright that
he was gay because of the prevailing moral climate, but they do
contain a great deal of erotic imagery. The green wood itself is a
symbol of virility, and the references to arrows, quivers and
swords make it clear, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barry Dobson &LR; , professor of medieval history at Cambridge, told
the Times of London that he concurred on the ambiguity of the
relationship between Hood and Little John.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocate &UR; Peter Tatchell  &LR; said, predictably, ``It's
about time school history lessons acknowledged the contribution of
famous homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mary Chamberlain &LR;  of the Robin Hood Society said, just as
predictably, ``Robin remains a highly regarded figure the world
over, and children like to play at being Robin Hood. These claims
could do a lot of damage.''

   &UR; JUST SOME NICE OLD-FASHIONED NAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Children of the Baby Boomers, cherishing antique photographs of
their moms in granny glasses and their dads in tie-dyed T-shirts,
are also blessed with their own birth certificates, bearing those
wonderful names of the '60s and '70s:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Andrew Demcak &LR;  recalls a high school pal, in the '80s, who was
named  &UR; Celestial Fudge &LR; . ``We all called her Celeste,'' he recalls
kindly. &UR; Alexandra de Moya &LR;  says the name on her birth certificate
is  &UR; Utisha Mariposa &LR; . Utisha, she was told, means ``enlightened,''
and mariposa is the Spanish word for butterfly. She recalls school
pals named  &UR; Mao Che &LR; ,  &UR; Bean &LR; ,  &UR; Rain &LR; ,  &UR; Lucky Hippo &LR;  and
 &UR; Agwitch &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Raspberry Wheeler  &LR; (now Jessica), says she has a cousin still
named  &UR; Blueberry &LR; , and went to school with William Saroyan's
granddaughter,  &UR; Strawberry &LR; , who she thinks is now Sara.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frank Webster &LR;  admits to naming his son  &UR; Moon Shadow &LR; . ``As he
went through his early teens, he often talked about changing his
name to  &UR; Mike &LR; ,'' he writes, but he changed his mind and now is
happy to be known as Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the modern practitioners of this ancient hippie
name-giving craft,  &UR; Jeannette Dillon &LR;  gave her son the right to
choose his own middle name and adopt it legally. On July 1, he
became  &UR; Joshua Moctezuma Dillon &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANYTHING TO HELP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Reading recently that  &UR; David Cassel  &LR; had helped in the rescue of
a butterfly caught in the Sierra Club bookstore window,  &UR; David &LR; 
 &UR; Cassell &LR;  (one ``l'' more than the first, but no relation) couldn't
resist a similar call to action the other day.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter discovered a ladybug in the backseat of their car

MORE CHILDREN CONTRACTING `ADULT' DIABETES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: FIXES info box at end, DELETES reference to `high insulin
levels' (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Amid the routine of childhood sniffles and
earaches, pediatrician John Menchaca began to notice something
unusual several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rough, dark skin was emerging on the back of some of his
patients' necks. The skin change puzzled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents would say, `It looks dirty, and I kept scrubbing
and scrubbing it, and it was still there,' '' said Menchaca, a Fort
Worth physician for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Menchaca now views the skin change as a ``blessing in
disguise.'' When it appears, doctors are learning, the child runs a
greater risk of developing diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Adult-onset diabetes, also known as Type 2 diabetes, is commonly
associated with those older than 45. But more and more it is
showing up in children too young to drive, and medical
professionals blame America's losing battle against obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fatter today than we have ever been in the history of
this country,'' said Paul Villas, executive director of the
University of Texas System Texas-Mexico Border Health Coordination
Office in Edinburg, Texas. Villas has been leading efforts to
screen children living along the border for signs of Type 2.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, $44 billion is spent to treat kidney damage,
amputations and other complications related to diabetes, most of it
Type 2.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the disease in childhood will be more costly and
more debilitating, said Dr. William Archer, commissioner of the
Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 15 years ago, we didn't even know'' that Type 2 existed
in children, Archer said. ``We are going to have, I believe, an
epidemic of problems with blindness, kidney failure and
amputations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, officials from the Texas state health department
and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation organized a workshop in the
state capital Austin on children's Type 2. Soon after, several
studies were presented at the American Diabetes Association's
annual meeting that looked into the emerging problem and its
primary cause.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Texas Health Science Center recently
completed a pilot study assessing weight problems in three
elementary schools in the Fort Worth district. The three schools
were chosen to reflect a cross section of backgrounds; the
percentage of overweight students ranged from 9 percent to 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Menchaca and Ximena Urrutia-Rojas, assistant
professor at the UNT Health Science Center, sat down with school
officials to discuss screening at more schools.
</P>
<P>
   But screening, while helpful, is just one part of the solution,
said Jackie Thompson, director of health services for the school
district. The next step, she said, will be to brainstorm with local
public health officials about ways to help overweight students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just what the (school district) can do to screen the
students,'' she said. ``It's what's going to happen after we screen
the students.''
</P>
<P>
   For Menchaca, who helped with the school obesity study,
prevention of Type 2 has become a crusade. As a diabetic, he is
particularly concerned about Hispanic children, who, with other
minorities, are considered at more genetic risk.
</P>
<P>
   First, Menchaca screened his patients for weight problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then he sent letters to parents of at-risk children. And he paid
for a bilingual dietitian to teach an after-hours nutrition class
in his office waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   One of those letters landed in the mailbox of Lala Reyes of Fort
Worth. She immediately enrolled herself and her 11-year-old
daughter, Kathy, in the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy soon became one of the prize pupils, dropping her dress
size from 18 to 14 in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clothes, they look so big on her,'' Lala Reyes said
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, physicians were taught that children develop only
Type 1 diabetes. That occurs when the pancreas stops producing
insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2, responsible for more than 90 percent of all diabetes
cases, involves a reduction in insulin. The long-term consequences
are the same if the disease is not controlled through diet,
medication and, sometimes, insulin shots.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and newly
diagnosed blindness in adults age 20 to 74. People with the disease
at least double their risk of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Research is still trying to catch up with what physicians are
seeing in the office.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear, for example, exactly how many children might
have Type 2 diabetes or how fast the numbers are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   One 1996 study, conducted in the Cincinnati area, sifted through
12 years of children's medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1992, only 2 percent to 4 percent of all new cases of
diabetes in children were Type 2. By 1994, the percentage had
jumped to 16 percent, researchers said.

DID ROBIN HOOD FROLIC IN THE FOREST GAILY?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Stephen Knight &LR; , professor of English Literature at Cardiff
University in Wales, says  &UR; Robin Hood &LR;  was gay and liked  &UR; Little &LR; 
 &UR; John &LR;  better than Maid Marian, who was fictional anyway.
</P>
<P>
   According to Knight, 14th century ballads about the adventures
of the outlaw and his ``merrie men'' could not ``say outright that
he was gay because of the prevailing moral climate, but they do
contain a great deal of erotic imagery. The green wood itself is a
symbol of virility, and the references to arrows, quivers and
swords make it clear, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barry Dobson &LR; , professor of medieval history at Cambridge, told
the Times of London that he concurred on the ambiguity of the
relationship between Hood and Little John.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocate &UR; Peter Tatchell  &LR; said, predictably, ``It's
about time school history lessons acknowledged the contribution of
famous homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mary Chamberlain &LR;  of the Robin Hood Society said, just as
predictably, ``Robin remains a highly regarded figure the world
over, and children like to play at being Robin Hood. These claims
could do a lot of damage.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUST SOME NICE OLD-FASHIONED NAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Children of the Baby Boomers, cherishing antique photographs of
their moms in granny glasses and their dads in tie-dyed T-shirts,
are also blessed with their own birth certificates, bearing those
wonderful names of the '60s and '70s:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Andrew Demcak &LR;  recalls a high school pal, in the '80s, who was
named  &UR; Celestial Fudge &LR; . ``We all called her Celeste,'' he recalls
kindly. &UR; Alexandra de Moya &LR;  says the name on her birth certificate
is  &UR; Utisha Mariposa &LR; . Utisha, she was told, means ``enlightened,''
and mariposa is the Spanish word for butterfly. She recalls school
pals named  &UR; Mao Che &LR; ,  &UR; Bean &LR; ,  &UR; Rain &LR; ,  &UR; Lucky Hippo &LR;  and
 &UR; Agwitch &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Raspberry Wheeler  &LR; (now Jessica), says she has a cousin still
named  &UR; Blueberry &LR; , and went to school with William Saroyan's
granddaughter,  &UR; Strawberry &LR; , who she thinks is now Sara.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frank Webster &LR;  admits to naming his son  &UR; Moon Shadow &LR; . ``As he
went through his early teens, he often talked about changing his
name to  &UR; Mike &LR; ,'' he writes, but he changed his mind and now is
happy to be known as Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the modern practitioners of this ancient hippie
name-giving craft,  &UR; Jeannette Dillon &LR;  gave her son the right to
choose his own middle name and adopt it legally. On July 1, he
became  &UR; Joshua Moctezuma Dillon &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANYTHING TO HELP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Reading recently that  &UR; David Cassel  &LR; had helped in the rescue of
a butterfly caught in the Sierra Club bookstore window,  &UR; David &LR; 
 &UR; Cassell &LR;  (one ``l'' more than the first, but no relation) couldn't
resist a similar call to action the other day.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter discovered a ladybug in the backseat of their car
as he drove to her piano recital in Berkeley, he writes, whereupon
she made a wish. He opened the door to let the ladybug out, and
there was ``a loud crunch as a car ran into my opening door.''

FORT WORTH, Texas: researchers said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The average age of diagnosis was 14, according to the study, and
all but 8 percent of the children were overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Those expanding waistlines alarm medical professionals the most.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, 5 percent of children ages 6 to 11 fell into
the heaviest weight category, according to the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 1994, nearly 14
percent of children did.
</P>
<P>
   Potential culprits abound: supersize meal combos, video games,
limited physical education requirements, unsafe communities that
discourage exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is in the school lunch program?'' said Dr. C.W. Spellman,
director of the diabetes clinics at the UNT Health Science Center.
``What about people who supply all the vending machines in schools?
Why isn't bottled water half the price of Classic Coke? Why are
good things priced as a disincentive?''
</P>
<P>
   Lower-income families are often at a disadvantage, because
eating healthfully doesn't necessarily come cheap, said Dr. Robert
Trevino, a researcher based in San Antonio who has tracked Type 2
in children since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hot dogs and the sugar flakes in the morning,'' he
said. ``And that's all they have in the refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   And when approached, parents aren't always receptive to frank
discussions about weight.
</P>
<P>
   Menchaca's office fielded some irate calls after his letters
went out. And school district officials didn't want the names of
the three participating elementary schools to be made public,
fearing embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   More screening must be done before it's known how common weight
problems are among Fort Worth students, Urrutia-Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
   A more intensive screening effort last year in the Rio Grande
Valley area found that 17 to 27 percent of fourth-, fifth- and
sixth-graders had the skin discoloration, known as acanthosis
nigricans. Ninety-percent of those children were overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are right at the edge of the table of falling into
the diabetes pool,'' Villas said.
</P>
<P>
   During its recent session, the Texas Legislature approved
$471,000 for further screening along the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the after-hours classes in Menchaca's office, dietitian
Araceli Vazquez is trying to change eating habits. At the beginning
of the class, she had asked all the children to write down what
they ate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a three-day diary, they are eating pizza with cheese and
sausage and hot dogs and chocolate milk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating between English and Spanish, she leads the parents
and children through basic nutritional concepts with a light hand.
She compliments one girl's choice of 2-percent milk over whole. She
explains why corn tortillas are healthier that lard-heavy flour.
</P>
<P>
   Change can begin in small ways, Lala Reyes said. Preparing a
dinner recently, she stripped the skin off a whole chicken before
chopping it up. As it cooked in garlic and a little olive oil, she
ground carrots through the juicer for a sweet beverage. Kathy
played with the green peppers, using them to make a face on the
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Menchaca wants to make sure that Kathy and other children don't
become tomorrow's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you tell a parent that their kid is going to be sick
10, 15, 20 years down the road? It's so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   FOR YOUR INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   Acanthosis nigricans
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? The darkened skin can look thickened,
rough or even velvety.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE DOES IT APPEAR? It's often found on the neck or in the
folds of the skin, such as the elbows, the knees, the knuckles or
the armpits.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES IT MEAN? The skin change can be a warning sign of
diabetes.

CLINTON'S MEDICARE PROPOSAL CALLS ATTENTION TO PRACTICES OF
PHARMACY MANAGERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Barrett Toan calls himself a silent partner in the
health care system and if President Clinton has his way, there will
be many more like him.
</P>
<P>
   Toan is the president of Express Scripts Inc., which supervises
the filling of 295 million prescriptions a year for 47 million
people with private health insurance. In calling for Medicare
coverage of prescription drugs, Clinton wants to see Express
Scripts and similar companies play the same role for 39 million
older Americans and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   While such companies, known as pharmacy benefit managers, have
been popular for a decade or so, most consumers have only a vague
idea of the powerful force they exert over which drugs are sold and
which pharmacies sell them.
</P>
<P>
   With the plastic identification cards issued by Express Scripts
and similar companies, a patient can walk into a pharmacy, hand
over $10 and walk out with $70 worth of medicine. The pharmacy
benefit manager negotiates the complex arrangements behind that
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would give such companies a great new responsibility,
managing drug benefits for Medicare patients, who use a third of
all drugs prescribed in the United States. But that shift would
also illuminate some practices that have largely escaped public
notice, including the power of pharmacy benefit managers to affect
doctors' decisions and their dealings with drug companies. The
arrangements, which include rebates from the drug companies to the
managers for giving preference to certain drugs, would become much
more visible.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefit managers organize the market for prescription
drugs, securing deep discounts from drug manufacturers and retail
pharmacies for large employers or health plans. They try to
influence doctors' prescribing habits and encourage the use of
lower-cost drugs, including generic substitutes for brand-name
medicines. They strongly recommend certain drugs over others in
each therapeutic category _ antihistamines and treatments for high
cholesterol or high blood pressure, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, pharmacy benefit managers are like health
maintenance organizations: they try to control the cost of care. So
far, they have not engendered widespread hostility among consumers,
as some HMOs have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we could play a useful role in Medicare,'' Toan said
in an interview at his headquarters here. ``We help consumers get
the maximum value for the dollars they spend on pharmaceuticals.
Many elderly patients are paying prices 20 to 25 percent higher
than what our customers pay because they don't get the type of
discounts we can negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors and pharmacists have expressed concern about the
market power of pharmacy benefit managers. While Express Scripts is
independently owned, some of its chief competitors are owned by
drug companies and drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offices are besieged with faxes and phone calls urging us
to change the drugs we prescribe for patients,'' said Dr. Raymond
Scalettar, a Washington rheumatologist. ``It's very troubling, very
intrusive, and not necessarily in the patients' best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are equally troubled by the practice of drug
manufacturers' giving cash rebates to the pharmacy benefit managers
in return for having their products included on the list of
preferred drugs. Pharmacists worry that some drugs may be chosen
more for their rebates than for their efficacy. The terms of rebate
agreements are considered proprietary information and are a
carefully guarded secret.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns would grow if these companies managed drug
benefits for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan to cover prescription drugs is part of his
proposal to reorganize Medicare to make it more competitive and
financially secure as members of the baby boom generation approach
retirement age. Administration officials see pharmacy benefit
managers as a way to prevent explosive growth in the cost of
Medicare drug benefits without resorting to federal price controls,
which are anathema to drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's chief economic adviser, who
helped design Clinton's Medicare proposal, said, ``There are no
price controls in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Sperling said, the government would simply get
``reasonable discounts,'' like other health plans that buy large
quantities of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, pharmacy benefit managers handled 1.8 billion
prescriptions last year. Employers, labor unions and private health
plans have increasingly turned to such companies to control drug
spending, which has grown much faster than other health spending in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress, found that pharmacy benefit managers had reduced the
cost of drug benefits for federal employees by 20 percent to 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Drug benefit managers develop networks of retail pharmacies that
may include thousands of drugstores. In return for a large volume
of business, the drugstores must give discounts. Under a typical
arrangement, a drugstore receives the average wholesale price for a
drug, minus 15 percent. The pharmacist also gets a small dispensing
fee, perhaps $2 for each prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people often pay the highest prices for prescription
drugs because their purchasing power is fragmented. Under Clinton's
proposal, the government would hire a private company in each
region of the country to manage drug benefits for the large numbers
of Medicare patients who are still in the traditional
fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   Howard J. Bedlin, vice president of the National Council on the
Aging, a research and advocacy group, said, ``There's an emerging
consensus that pharmacy benefit managers have an important role to
play in Medicare reform, but you have to build in certain consumer
protections'' to guarantee the confidentiality of patients' records
and to inform consumers of any restrictions on their choice of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts, like other pharmacy benefit managers, reviews
prescriptions before they are filled at retail drugstores across
the country. The pharmacies file claims electronically. Express
Scripts can immediately tell the pharmacist if the customer has
insurance and how much of a co-payment to charge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Express Scripts has records of other drugs that a
patient has bought. This allows it to tell the pharmacist if the
new drug would duplicate an existing prescription, if it could
cause harmful interactions with other drugs or if a prescription is
being refilled too early. The company at this point could also
notify the pharmacist if another drug or a generic is preferred.
</P>
<P>
   While employers and HMOs praise the work of drug benefit
managers, many doctors and pharmacists have had frustrating
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Dillon, co-owner of Grubb's Pharmacy, a century-old
store on Capitol Hill in Washington, said he understood the need to
hold down health costs but had been exasperated by the techniques
of pharmacy benefit managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases,'' Dillon said, ``you have a college-age
customer service representative calling a doctor with 30 years of
experience and asking, `What is your medical justification for this
drug?'''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   John M. Rector, general counsel of the National Community
Pharmacists Association, which represents 35,000 independent
pharmacies, said the preferences for certain drugs were often based
on ``back-room deals that the consumer never knows about.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rector said, a pharmacy benefit manager ``sometimes
tells the pharmacist to dispense a more expensive, inappropriate
brand-name drug because the PBM is getting a rebate or kickback
from the manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Toan said most of the money from cash rebates was passed on
to the sponsor of a health plan, reducing the overall cost of drug
benefits for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Toan, a former director of the Missouri Social Services
Department, said Express Scripts was ``the nation's largest
independent pharmacy benefit manager.'' PCS Health Systems of
Scottsdale, Ariz., another benefit manager, has been owned since
January by Rite Aid, the drugstore chain. Their biggest competitor,
Merck-Medco Managed Care, is owned by Merck &AMP; Co., the drug
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts manages $10 billion a year in drug spending for
its clients, which include Bethlehem Steel and Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart L. Bascomb, executive vice president of Express Scripts,
said some drugs would not be affordable for many people without the
discounts obtained by pharmacy benefit managers. The average retail
prescription price of common cholesterol-lowering drugs, for
example, is $100 a month, or $1,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, Medicare is different from other clients of
Express Scripts. Toan, the president of the company, refused to
give details of its contracts with drug manufacturers and
pharmacies. But Congress and the public would probably insist on
knowing the details of any discounts negotiated on behalf of
Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller general of the United States would want to audit
Medicare's drug spending. Medicare officials would be tempted to
regulate the activities of pharmacy benefit managers to protect
Medicare patients and to save taxpayers' money. Pharmacists would
demand an explanation if they were excluded from the list of
drugstores serving Medicare beneficiaries in a particular region.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the best efforts of drug benefit managers, Toan said,
``Medicare, like commercial health plans, would probably face
double-digit increases in drug costs, in the range of 15 percent a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, beneficiaries would have to pay half
of any drug costs covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would serve as a check against unnecessary use of
medicines,'' Toan said. On the other hand, he said, ``a lot of new
medicines will address conditions of the elderly, and that might
keep up a fairly steep increase in drug spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent pharmacists complain that they have little
opportunity to negotiate with pharmacy benefit managers because
contracts are offered to them on a ``take it or leave it'' basis.
They say payments are so low that they often lose $5 or more on a
$50 prescription.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Toan said, ``That's our job, to seek the lowest
price we can get for our customers.''

PAKISTAN MAKES CASE FOR A HALT TO FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Castigated by many as a betrayer of the
dream of a liberated Kashmir, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said
Monday night in a televised speech that _ to the contrary _ he has
helped usher the cause onto the world stage and prudently steered
away from an all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not aware of the anxiety we passed through during
the past one and a half months,'' he said, explaining why he had
coaxed Pakistani-backed guerrillas to return from mountaintop
redoubts they had seized a few miles inside Indian-controlled
Kashmir. ``This is no secret that the threat of a big war with
India was looming by the way things had deteriorated between India
and Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   He added ominously, ``Missiles with nuclear warheads were
directed toward us, and our air force was put on alert.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-minute speech was the prime minister's first public
statement since he returned from a hastily arranged visit to
Washington on July 4. There he promised President Clinton to take
``concrete steps'' to end the fighting, which had pitted several
hundred well-armed Muslim infiltrators against the Indian air force
and battalions of infantry.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Washington puzzled and angered many here. Jubilant
news accounts had led them to believe that well-positioned
guerrillas were making easy prey of woefully vulnerable Indians
attempting frontal assaults up steep peaks. The fighting had put
the emotionally charged Kashmir issue onto front pages worldwide,
and then the prime minister seemed to knuckle under to American
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But with a troubled political opposition, a weakened judiciary
and an intimidated press, there is little on the political horizon
to challenge Sharif. In fact, for all the discontent, even the
nation's usually intrepid Islamic fundamentalists have been unable
to mount anything but relatively muted street protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision to give diplomacy another chance, to try it once
again, is not a result of haste, nor has it been taken under
pressure,'' Sharif insisted. ``A sage has said that it takes more
courage to come out of a war than to start a war.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the guerrillas had made the world understand that
``Kashmir is a nuclear flashpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   A withdrawal of the fighters _ known here as the mujahedeen, or
Muslim holy warriors _ began on Saturday. While the pullback may be
a testament to the prime minister's persuasive skills, it also
lends support to consistent Indian accusations that the invaders
were mostly Pakistan army regulars, a view shared by many analysts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mujahedeen organizations have not helped Sharif's credibility.
While he thanked the guerrillas Monday for heeding his plea,
leaders of several of the groups called Sharif a traitor and denied
they were making any retreat at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical criticism, Rifaat Hussain, a professor of
international relations in Islamabad, said: ``Nawaz shouldn't have
had such an early loss of nerve. Now he's nowhere. His idea of
defusing the crisis was to run to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his speech, Sharif made much of the assurance he
received from Clinton that the president would take a personal
interest in settling the Kashmir situation, a 52-year-old dispute
that has led the nations into two all-out wars. ``An assurance by
the leader of a power like America is not insignificant,'' Sharif
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistanis want the world to compel India to permit a
plebiscite, a vote to which India once committed itself. The vote
would allow the Kashmiris _ most of whom are Muslims _ to choose
whether they want to belong to largely Hindu India or Muslim
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's speech was quickly assailed by political rivals. The
leading opposition, the Pakistan Peoples Party, called for his
resignation, but the party has called for his resignation before,
and it is a party in disarray. Its leader, the former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, lives abroad. She faces arrest if she
return because she has been convicted of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy is constantly rumored to be endangered in Pakistan,
which has a powerful military that is said to be frustrated by
inept and corrupt civilians at the helm. But military leaders seem
to support Sharif's decision to reduce tensions with India, which
has a numerically superior military and a less-feeble economy.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night the prime minister spoke of resuming the ``Lahore
Declaration process,'' a high-level dialogue that began in February
with a bus trip to Pakistan by India's prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   But any talks are likely to be heavy with distrust. As Indians
see it, Sharif has proven a duplicitous rogue who pretended to be a
peacemaker while endorsing a plan by his generals to launch an
adventure into Kashmir. To the Pakistanis, Vajpayee is an
opportunist who has used the conflict to whip up a war hysteria to
benefit himself in coming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Their goals concerning the Kashmir dispute are different:
</P>
<P>
   Sharif hopes that the past two months of alarming headlines will
cause the world to recognize the danger of the situation. Vajpayee
welcomes no such attention, and says Kashmir is best kept a
bilateral concern.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more stirring parts of Sharif's speech was his
likening of the Kashmir situation to a volcano, and the mujahedeen
to lava. ``As long as lava boils, it finds its way to the plains,''
he said. ``And the Kashmiri resistance, like that lava, will find
someplace else. And it will never cool off.''

WTO AWARDS $125 MILLION IN SANCTIONS TO U.S. AND CANADA OVER BEEF
BAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A World Trade Organization panel ruled Monday that the
United States and Canada were entitled to nearly $125 million in
sanctions from the European Union because of its illegal ban on
hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   The amount was about half what the United States had sought but
more than double what the European Union had thought was
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration panel's decision creates the basis for the
United States and Canada to move to the next stage of the sanctions
process under the rules of the Geneva-based global trading group.
They must now seek formal permission to impose the sanctions; a
range of European imports could be hit with 100 percent tariffs, in
effect doubling their price.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the European Union rescinds the hormone-beef ban or
reaches a settlement with the United States and Canada, the
sanctions could be formally imposed on July 26 when the World Trade
Organization's dispute resolution body holds its next regular
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union rejected a ruling by the trade organization
two months ago that its ban on hormone-treated beef was illegal.
The 15-nation European trading bloc has said that it is
investigating evidence that shows such beef poses health risks. The
United States and Canada have said that the hormones, which are
used to promote cattle growth, are harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Although cattle producers in the United States expressed
disappointment with the scaled-down damages, officials from both
sides in the trade dispute sought to put the best face on the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon Brittan, outgoing trade commissioner of the European
Union, which had hoped for a figure of about $53 million, said the
arbitration panel's ruling showed that the United States and
Canadian claims were extravagant. Rita Hayes, the U.S. trade
representative at the World Trade Organization, said the ruling
recognized the ``serious damage'' the exporters had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier trade confrontation, the United States eventually
won authorization for $191.4 million in punitive duties on European
exports because of the European Union's policy of favoring imports
of bananas from former European colonies in the Caribbean. As in
that dispute, U.S. officials moved quickly to activate trade
organization mechanisms to clear the way for retaliatory measures
in the beef dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The beef dispute reflects profoundly different views in the
United States and Europe over altered or adulterated foods.
European fear of food tampering increased with the outbreak of
``mad cow'' disease in Britain several years ago. More recently,
those anxieties intensified over a scandal in Belgium over chicken
and other food products contaminated with the cancer-causing
chemical dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a strong regulatory body in its Food and
Drug Administration, but there is no European-wide body to track
food adulteration.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary United States list of European goods that could
be sanctioned in the beef dispute includes canned meats, Roquefort
cheese, truffles, paprika, chewing gum, chocolate and mineral
water. The Canadian list includes beef, cucumbers, gingerbread,
gin, vodka and soup.

 &HT;    Olazabal can't get a grip on club, game
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ At least Jose Maria Olazabal did not
fracture his sense of humor. Embarrassed by the outburst of anger
at the U.S. Open last month that severely hindered his chances this
week at the Carnoustie Golf Links, the Masters champion Monday was
able to chuckle at his fragmented game.
</P>
<P>
   The last two fingers on his right hand, which he broke when
slamming it into a hotel wall at Pinehurst, N.C., after a
first-round 75, are taped together and he ``cannot really grip the
club properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe ``the flight of the ball'' he was producing in
his practice round at Carnoustie, Olazabal, whose driving accuracy
has been suspect, except for the first week of April at Augusta
National, said, ``The flight of the ball is pretty much the same _
sideways with the driver and pretty straight with the irons.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal said that while he received an assurance from his
doctor that playing will not cause further damage to the hand, it
still causes him pain and will not be healed for two to three
weeks. ``I definitely hurt my chances because of the injury,''
Olazabal said, ``but I'm here to try the best I can. It is the
British Open. I love this tournament in a very special way, and I
will do whatever is needed to play in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Acutally, Olazabal said, it was commendable that he was able to
restrain himself at Pinehurst until a few hours after the round at
the U.S. Open, where he shot 4-over for the final four holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did pretty well holding my emotions on the golf
course and on the driving range and on the putting green,'' he
said. ``I was just on my own in the room, and I could express
myself freely at that time. That's why it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal was partnered with Miguel Angel Jimenez in their
practice round and lost a match at the 18th hole against
19-year-old Sergio Garcia and Miguel Angel Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very usual these days,'' Olazabal said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar fails to qualify
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar shot a round of 3-over 74 Monday at
the Monifieth Links and missed qualifying for the British Open by
eight shots. Kuchar had a 36-hole score of 3-over 145. Among those
making it were Canadian Mike Weir (71-66_137) and American Len
Mattiace (69-68_137).
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well, but I struggled with my putting,'' Kuchar said.
``It was one of those rounds where it just would not go in. I knew
I needed a good score just to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   The local wildlife caused a change in the playoff plans for
those at 138 who were trying for an alternate spot. Monifeith's
first hole was not used because of a flock of swans on the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Notes
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by his Loch Lomond victory Sunday on the western side of
Scotland, Colin Montgomerie said Monday, ``It would be a dream
scenario to win any major, never mind in Scotland.'' Montgomerie
thinks a winning score of 300 to be highly possible if conditions
turn severely windy. ``If (Monday's breeze) becomes a wind,'' he
said, ``you'll see scores higher than we've ever, ever seen in any
British Open.''. . .
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, who won here in 1975 with hardly any rough and
baked-out fairways, envisions a winning score ``well over par.''
Watson said, ``If we get the blow they're expecting Thursday, there
may be some real tears out there.''

   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ There's nothing logical about the game of
golf, now that it has gone global at the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, once an annual sparring partner for the United
States in Ryder Cups, have won the last two.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Franco of Paraguay, has won twice on the U.S. Tour.
</P>
<P>
   And the Americans are dominating links courses in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When the British Open begins at Carnoustie Golf Links on
Thursday, Americans will be seeking a fifth consecutive Open
victory. Not that it matters to the golfers. Or so they say.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis Love III observed Monday on the Carnoustie practice
green while watching an approaching mist, the stamp on one's
passport does not seem to matter as much as it used to. Maybe all
those Golf Channel replays are to blame for the bonding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just as happy for Nick Price when he wins as Justin
Leonard, because they're friends,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped the head-scratching from golf fans who
wonder why Americans are enjoying so much success abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first period of American domination. Tom Watson is
a five-time champion and won his first British Open in his first
try in 1975 at Carnoustie. Jack Nicklaus won three times, and Lee
Trevino and Arnold Palmer won two each. From 1970 until 1983,
Americans won 12 British Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation might be the greater sense of history
that the Americans feel, particularly in Scotland. Playing
links-style golf in particular presents a striking contrast to U.S.
target golf, plus a unique opportunity to pull on a turtleneck in
July and hit knock-down shots against a wind from the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the history of the place, knowing that the game of
golf was originated here, means a lot to us,'' Phil Mickelson said,
``knowing that the golf courses that were first played were these
dunes-style courses with hard, natural fairways. There was no
bulldozing. They just put a hole in the ground where it belonged.
There's a lot to be learned here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Americans, it's not like you have to grow up playing
here to play well here,'' Mickelson said. ``The hole is the same
size. The courses are the same length. The shots are the same. It's
just a little windier, but we have wind in Texas and on the tour as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor? The Americanization of the world's venues.
Outside of the British Open, the Europeans play very few
tournaments on links courses these days, diluting the advantage
they once had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played the Scottish Open here in 1995 and 1996, but that
was the only time we play a links course apart from playing the
British Open,'' two-time Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal said.
``I've always said it would be really nice for the European Tour if
we could play a few more links courses during the season. I would
love to see that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   European players view it as a cyclical matter. As an example,
they won six of seven Masters titles from 1988-1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody here wants to see a European winner again in
the Open,'' Ireland's Darren Clarke said, ``but it just seems to go
in spells. The best guy wins at the end of the week, and it just so
happens that the past few years the best player has been an
American. Which is exactly where the top players are.''
</P>
<P>
   As Love said, ``Now we've got Tiger Woods and David Duval. The
odds are just getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Until lately, perhaps. The emergence of Sergio Garcia, the
19-year-old protege of Spain's Seve Ballesteros, could be a factor
soon. Olazabal, also from Spain, suggests that Garcia eventually
will hold all the major championship trophies above his head.
</P>
<P>
   But first he must contend with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the majors, and this is one of the best of the
majors,'' Love said. ``It's got some history. It means a little
more over here. It's a special place and a special tournament.
</P>
<P>
   STREAKING

 &HT;    Last 48 hours a whirlwind for Cup champsBy Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good morning, America. That's where we found them Monday. In
Manhattan, on the set of ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' And over
in Rockefeller Plaza, just outside Studio 1A of the ``Today'' show.
Later, it was CNN, and Fox News. Indeed, wherever we looked Monday,
there was Team Ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Women's World Cup Champions. The best female soccer
side on the planet and suddenly, but forevermore, the Girls of
Summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always said this team is America's best-kept secret,''
midfielder Julie Foudy told Katie Couric on ''Today.'' ''So
finally, the secret is out!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the secret's been leaking for a month now. But
Saturday in the Rose Bowl, in the most remarkable coming-out party
in women's sports history, that secret was as fully exposed as
Brandi Chastain's midriff. Women's sports might never be the same.
Neither will the lives of the 20 players on the U.S. roster.
</P>
<P>
   At least if their first 48 hours as world champions are any
indication.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world was watching. At least it seemed that way. A
crowd of 90,185 _ the largest ever to attend a women's sporting
event _ packed the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. An estimated 40 million
more Americans were super-glued to their TVs, riveted for nearly
three hours by the World Cup Final. The United States versus China.
Babe City versus the once-Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   After 120 scoreless minutes, it had come to this. A shoot-out.
Penalty kicks. Five apiece, more if necessary. But Briana Scurry,
the American goalkeeper, had dived left and deflected Liu Ying's
shot on China's third penalty kick. Briana's a keeper. It was
China's only miss but the first four Americans all scored. So when
Chastain positioned the ball 12 yards from the Chinese goal, more
than 40 million Americans had but one thought:
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL) You goal, girl. (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   And when Chastain parked the ball in the upper-right corner and
hit nothing but net, the shot heard 'round the World Cup
reverberated across the country. And all heaven broke loose. The
ball was barely in the goal before Chastain ripped off her white
shirt to reveal her black sports bra, slid to her knees, clenched
her fists and shrieked for joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was momentary insanity,'' Chastain said. ``Nothing more and
nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   The insanity was contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Rose Bowl, the brittle old lady in Pasadena was back
on the field, in the midst of a mad celebration with her teammates.
Michelle Akers, 33, who suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and
has had 12 knee surgeries, had to leave the game at the end of
regulation. She was dehydrated, and had heat exhaustion, and was
hooked up to an IV in the locker room when Chastain scored. But
Akers returned to have her gold medal draped around her neck, to
help accept the World Cup trophy and to bathe in the adulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at the epicenter of a big rock being thrown into a huge
pond,'' Akers said. ''We don't know what the ripple effect will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   When Akers played on the first U.S. women's national team in
1985, players had to sew the letters ''USA'' on the backs of their
jerseys. In 1991, when the team returned from China after winning
the World Cup, it was greeted at New York's JFK International
Airport by a representative of the airline, another from U.S.
Soccer and one media member. On Saturday, President Clinton
attended the final, then came down to the locker room to
congratulate the victorious Americans. Hours after the game ended,
thousands of delirious fans still lingered outside the Rose Bowl.
So did one little girl, with an American flag stuck in her ponytail
and a fine grasp of the significance of this sporting moment for
girls everywhere. ''It's going to be awesome,'' she said. ''It's
not all about men any more. It's about me!''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a police escort, the U.S. team returned to the
Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena, where the Americans held their victory
party Saturday night. Most players partied until 3 a.m. before
grabbing a few hours sleep. When they awakened Sunday morning, they
found an itinerary slipped under their hotel room doors. Sept. 26
is the opening of the first Olympic training camp; the Americans
will be in Sydney next year to defend the Olympic gold medal they
won in Athens in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the team will compete in the U.S. Women's Cup in
the Midwest and a tournament in Germany in the fall. A trip to
South Africa is being planned and also a match with an Arab
all-star team in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday morning, however, only one destination mattered.
Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Like every authentic American championship team, the U.S.
women's team has already done its, ''We're going to Disneyland!''
TV commercial. But before the Americans even hooked up with Mickey
and Minnie on Sunday, Brandi had logged some serious air time.
Chastain did three hours of TV interviews via satellite before
doing Disneyland. On ''Meet the Press,'' she appeared on the same
show as Secretary of State Madeline Albright and First Lady Hillary
Clinton that also included discussions about Medicare and the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, 'Hi, I'm Brandi the soccer player. How do I fit
in?''' Chastain said. ''I guess how I fit in is that all these
things touch people and soccer touches people.''
</P>
<P>
   At Disneyland. Two floats transported the 20 players and coaches
through the park, then down Main Street. Mia Hamm, the star of the
U.S. team, stood with Minnie Mouse on the second float, waving to
the crowd. Later, at the Sleeping Beauty Castle, the team received
a crystal trophy from a Disney executive and Mia kissed Mickey
Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, at a rally held on the steps of the Los Angeles
Convention Center, the effervescent Foudy, whose nickname is
''Loudy,'' served as the emcee. Among her introductions:
</P>
<P>
   ''The Blur . . . the one they call 'The Kawasaki 5000' . .
.Tiffeny Milbrett!''
</P>
<P>
   ''The woman with the uncanny knack for taking her clothes off .
. .Brandi Chastain! She says it was temporary insanity. Do you
believe her?''
</P>
<P>
   ''The woman with the worst redheaded dye job I have ever seen in
my life . . .Kate Sobrero!'' Then it was off to Los Angeles
International to catch a 5 p.m. flight to Newark. By then, some
extraordinary numbers had come in. The 13.3 rating for U.S.-China
made it the most-watched soccer game on network TV. In the Los
Angeles market, it drew an astounding 20.8 rating and a 53 share.
''You don't see these numbers unless you're watching the NFL,'' ABC
spokesman Mark Mandel said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One billion people worldwide watched this tournament (on
TV),'' Chastain said. ''It just blows my mind. I can't imagine the
scope of this. The important thing about the World Cup is that
we've reached an audience outside of America to places where women
haven't been taken seriously as athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. team's overnight flight landed at Newark, it was
4:30 a.m. Monday. No matter. There was a small but enthusiastic
welcoming party: Ten excited little girls, all wearing World Cup
and USA soccer gear, had slept in the airport. ''They were jumping
around and asking for autographs,'' Chastain said. ''We all
obliged. They deserved them.''
</P>
<P>
   After busing to Manhattan, the Americans checked into a hotel
and had little time to sleep before rising for the morning talk
shows. Soccer officials raised the players' bonuses from some
$12,500 to $50,000 each. The U.S. Olympic Committee also said it
was awarding $120,000 to the team $6,000 for each player from its
Operation Gold Fund, which rewards American athletes who win gold
medals in the year's most important competitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just the beginning. ''Let's be real,'' said Hank
Steinbrecher, U.S. Soccer secretary general. ''This is lightning in
a bottle. The Queen Mother doesn't have enough money to pay them
what they're worth right now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the U.S. team hopscotched from ''Good Morning
America'' to ''Today'' to CNN and Fox News. The players wore
matching lavender shirts, walked the sidewalks of New York, stopped
traffic and linked arms and sang, ''We Are The Champions!''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sharing it with New York City because big things happen
here,'' said Chastain. Full-page newspaper ads from Budweiser,
Chevrolet and Nike hailed the victors. HarperCollins already is
pushing a new book by Hamm. The team will be featured on the covers
of Time and Newsweek due out today, and Sports Illustrated later
this week. Today in Central Park, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
will host a rally for the team at noon. On Wednesday, Hamm,
Chastain and Foudy will play in the LPGA JAL Big Apple Classic
Pro-Am in suburban New Rochelle; other players will attend the WNBA
All-Star Game that night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The only disappointment: David Letterman's show is not taping
this week. No problem. The Americans will return to New York next
week and appear Tuesday, July 20, with Letterman, who was
captivated by Chastain when she appeared on the show earlier this
year; he nicknamed the U.S. team, ''Babe City.''
</P>
<P>
   Will American women have a league of their own? That's a
distinct possibility for 2001, to capitalize on the extraordinary
response to this World Cup. To this team. ''We're at the cutting
edge of one of the most significant cultural revolutions in the
world,'' Steinbrecher said. ''And it states that in team sports,
women are absolutely equal, full partners to men, not subordinates.
. . . And we're exporting (the message) around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Team Ponytail was looking for some additional
international flavor. During training and the World Cup, the U.S.
women ate pasta and other foods loaded with carbohydrates. Not
Monday in Manhattan. ''I think,'' said Chastain, ''we're having
Chinese food tonight.''

 &HT;    World Cup team gets bigger bonus
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beneath the smiles of U.S. women's soccer players
during a victory parade at Disneyland on Sunday was the
satisfaction that their good deeds would be rewarded with cold hard
cash.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to past wranglings with both the women's and men's
national teams, the U.S. Soccer Federation is increasing its bonus
pool from $250,000 to $1 million for the Americans' win over China
Saturday in the Women's World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 players will be paid $50,000 each, on top of salaries
during World Cup preparations that ranged from $25,000 to $45,000.
Earlier, the bonuses has been announced to be roughly $12,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the culmination of 25 years of hard work at the grass
roots,'' federation president Bob Contiguglia said. ``We think this
(U.S. win) will increase the interest of soccer and the beauty and
enjoyment of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation and Women's World Cup officials decided to
increase the pot after determining that the tournament would earn
as much as $7 million in profits.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women's players were shocked by the announcement. Before
last year's U.S. Women's Cup, they threatened to boycott over
salaries. They had issued a similar challenge before the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The federation insisted on paying them a bonus only if they won
the gold medal, but players wanted to be paid for earning any
medal. The difference was moot after the Americans took the gold in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The only player unable to cash in is reserve defender Lorrie
Fair, who has a season of eligibility remaining at the University
of North Carolina.

CUSTOMS FACES BUDGET CRUNCH, CUTS OVERTIME ON BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Faced with a budget crunch, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has cut the number of inspectors working
weekends and holidays at already-crowded border crossing points,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction, which affects the Texas and New Mexico borders
with Mexico, means travelers crossing border bridges face more
congestion and delays, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact was felt here Sunday when three of the nine lanes at
the main international bridge from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, were
closed, said Gene Garza, port director in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   With three months left in the government's fiscal year, the INS,
which shares border duties with the Customs Service, has had to cut
overtime pay for inspectors at all ports of entry in Texas and New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Since overtime pays for much of weekend and holiday shifts,
fewer traffic lanes will be open, forcing vehicles to vie for
whatever number of inspection booths are open.
</P>
<P>
   The problem surfaced Monday when Laredo Mayor Betty Flores
publicly appealed to federal officials for more money to keep all
the lanes open and staffed.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who spoke at the dedication of a Union Pacific Railroad
inspection facility, caught INS officials by surprise, and most of
those quizzed about what she had said were reluctant to explain the
development or elaborate on the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the mayor's appeal, Mariela Malero, an INS
spokeswoman in Dallas, would only say, ``We continue to work with
headquarters and regional offices to address all the
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Malero declined comment on what led to the budget crunch or
specifics on its impact, but she said authorities are looking for
ways to make ends meet for the region's 25 ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol, which is part of the INS, won't be affected,
officials said. The immigration service is part of the Justice
Department, while Customs is a branch of the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second budget crunch for the INS this year.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the agency cut back on everything from overtime to
gasoline due a shortfall caused by a failure to predict rising
rent, phone costs and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cutbacks went into effect Friday and boosted waiting
time to enter the United States in El Paso as well as Laredo, the
busiest commercial crossing point on the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The typical wait Sunday was 90 minutes as compared with 35
minutes over the July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Reba, head of the U.S. Customs Service in South Texas,
said her inspectors would continue to work weekend and holiday
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS is short on overtime money,'' Reba said. ``We are
fine, but we cannot make up the difference'' in staffing on the
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The INS's financial woes come in the wake of a General
Accounting Office report that said bridges and highways along the
U.S.-Mexico border are becoming increasingly congested due to
stepped-up inspections by federal agents hunting drugs and
undocumented immigrants.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A difficult story to tell,'' Du Liniang says in
Scene 48 of ``The Peony Pavilion,'' the classic Chinese opera that
is the centerpiece of the Lincoln Center Festival this summer, as
it was to have been a year ago. And she refers merely to her own
adventures as heroine, in which, restored to mundane reality after
experiencing glorious first love in a dream, she wastes away to her
death only to be resurrected three years later by a return of love
from her dream partner, the young scholar Liu Mengmei.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of Chen Shi-Zheng's complete production of the work,
which was left for dead by bureaucrats in Shanghai last year only
to rise from the ashes, is hardly less wondrous and contorted. And
although Lincoln Center declared and celebrated victory after the
first of the production's six parts had opened the festival on
Wednesday, complete triumph was by no means assured until Saturday
night, when all 19 hours (1 less than advertised) had passed.
</P>
<P>
   For however much the opera may transcend the laws of nature and
the production may finally have eluded the grasp of politicians,
there was still the matter of sheer human frailty. Because of the
great length and difficulty of several roles, and the four months
of intensive rehearsal that were required, the lead actors are
working without understudies.
</P>
<P>
   Qian Yi as Du Liniang, in particular, appears in 20 of the
work's 55 scenes, generally the longer ones, which she typically
dominates. (The number would be 21 but for Chen's injection of
storytelling in a style called Pingtan in two scenes, including one
in which Du Liniang paints a self-portrait; here the scene is
related by an uncostumed narrator rather than acted.) And Ms. Qian,
one of two performers Chen deemed essential to the production and
spirited away from his troupe of last year, the Shanghai Kunqu
Opera Company, developed a thyroid condition during the winter that
sapped her energy and hampered her singing during the early
rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been corrected by medication, but even now, it
is said, Ms. Qian tires easily. Not that anyone could have guessed
such a thing from her radiant and energetic performance throughout
the six segments. If her lovely voice seemed small at times in the
965-seat La Guardia Concert Hall, especially in her lower register,
she was not alone, and miking was applied widely, though with far
greater subtlety than any done in Broadway theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In another rehearsal mishap, Luo Wen Shuai, a comic actor and
tumbler, ruptured an Achilles tendon, and this left a bigger mark
on the performances, cutting back on their brilliant acrobatics. At
that, however, Luo, with the energy, versatility and sheer feat of
memorization required of all the performers here, plays ``Scholar
Han, Scabby Turtle, Innkeeper, 13 others,'' as the program
laconically reports.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou Ming, the flutist and orchestra leader and the other
performer retained from Shanghai, met with another sort of natural
frailty during rehearsals, when the dry climate at Jacob's Pillow
in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts caused many of his bamboo
instruments, long steeped in Shanghai humidity, to crack. They were
repaired and others supplied, and he is putting on a display of
musical refinement and physical stamina as remarkable as Ms.
Qian's, playing all but constantly through the 19 hours, tracing
the melodies of most arias in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Chen gathered the other performers from the United States as
well as from China, where all were born. Compared with the original
Shanghai cast, as glimpsed in rehearsal and in a video of the dress
rehearsal last year, the new cast proved stronger at salient
points. The Liu Mengmei of Wen Yu Hang was sympathetic and
compelling even when the character seemed willfully obtuse or
obstinate; Jia Yong Hong was charming as Du Liniang's maid, Spring
Fragrance (and ``Prostitute, Elder, eight others''), and the
Pingtan storyteller, Hua Meng, was superb.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects may have been weaker, in part because this company
rehearsed a mere four months (some members less) in contrast to the
eight months in Shanghai. But all of that was incidental to the
magnificent spectacle crossing the stage: a spectacle imagined in
the first place by Tang Xianzu, who wrote ``The Peony Pavilion'' in
1598, and reimagined by Chen.

<P>
   Even so well versed an authority as Su Zheng, who teaches music
and women's studies at Wesleyan University and is a performer and
scholar of Chinese music, expressed her astonishment at finding the
work to be so much more than a love story. ``It is a whole social
critique,'' Ms. Zheng said, ``showing what life, what Ming society
was about.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke at a daylong symposium, ``Who Owns Culture,'' offered
on Sunday in the Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center in response to
the collapse of the presentation last year, and she was
enlightening on that subject as well. Without defending the actions
of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture, which at the last
minute denied the Shanghai company permission to leave China, Ms.
Zheng suggested that since most of China's encounters with the West
over the last 150 years have had painful consequences for China,
the authorities there tend to want to control any new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the symposium, sponsored by the New School as well
as Lincoln Center, was admirably free of self-congratulation on the
center's part and thorough in its attempt to determine what issues
lay behind the fracas. What was said at the time was that Chen's
production was ``pornographic, feudal and superstitious.'' (Such
charges related particularly to Part 2, where _ in Tang Xianzu's
text as well as Chen's production _ the sexually impenetrable
Sister Stone bawdily describes the fiasco of her wedding night, and
where Chen introduces ancient Chinese folk rituals, including the
burning of effigies, into the scene of Du Liniang's death and
funeral.)
</P>
<P>
   Broader political issues may have been at stake as well, with
the naturalized American Chen returning to work in China. Narrower
esthetic ones surely were. The Shanghai culture bureau considers
itself the guardian of kunqu, the most venerable form of Chinese
opera, which grew up in the region around Shanghai and adopted
``The Peony Pavilion'' as its signature work. Chen's production, it
was said, misrepresented kunqu style.
</P>
<P>
   But although he was working with a kunqu company, Chen never
disguised the fact that he was presenting his own interpretation of
the opera, drawing as much on the reconstructionist philosophy of
the Western early-music movement as on the kunqu tradition of
today. Nor was he trying to show what a specific past performance
might have been like.
</P>
<P>
   Chen always said that his goal was to present ``the best of
China,'' old and new: among other things, the splendid costumes,
set and surroundings, all handmade in China. The same generosity of
spirit led him to want to show off other aspects of Chinese
operatic tradition and civilization, like the Pingtan storytelling
and the folk rites along with more contemporary elements.
</P>
<P>
   With all the resources at his disposal, Chen wrestled a work
hardly ever performed in more than isolated excerpts into full,
vivid, blooming life. The end result bears little kinship to most
products of the early-music movement, although it shows, perhaps, a
route Western early-musickers  &UR; should &LR;  have taken. It undoubtedly
offers much to offend purists of whatever stripe, but it spoke
eloquently to at least one nonspecialist admirer of Chinese opera.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally a reality, the production can look ahead to
repeated performances at Lincoln Center (two parts per day on each
of the next two weekends), in Europe (this fall and perhaps next
summer) and maybe elsewhere. To Chen and his hardy troupe, these
must all look like so many blank pages on which to inscribe new
adventures.

   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the aftermath of last week's revelation about
the off-limits Crystal Springs Watershed _ that there are eight
homes lived in nearly rent-free by employees and supervisors of the
San Francisco Water Department _ other prominent water agencies
around the Bay Area said such a thing would never be permitted on
their lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Bay, there are no homes on watershed lands managed
by the East Bay Municipal Utility District, said the agency's
Charles Hardy. That includes the off-limit gem of the East Bay
hills, Upper San Leandro Reservoir, a jewel of a lake that is
surrounded by 18,600 acres, about half owned by EBMUD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rangers have their own homes off the property,'' Hardy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Marin Water District lands, there are also no homes but
rather what are described as ``ranger quarters,'' simple and
primitive compared to the homes in San Francisco. Watershed lands.
There are five ranger quarters over the course of 18,500 acres in
Marin, where there is public access on the watershed lands for
hiking, biking, horseback riding and fishing at lakes from shore.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ranger quarters in Marin even remotely resembles the
beautiful ranch-style homes and cottages set near different lakes
at Crystal Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranger quarters are there for public safety,'' said Libby
Pischel of the Marin Water District. ``Having trained staff on site
saves us a tremendous amount of time, things like search-and-rescue
and dealing with fire danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crystal Springs Watershed is a 23,000-acre parcel on the
Peninsula, located just south of Sweeney Ridge in San Bruno, where
there are four beautiful lakes and miles of service roads that
could provide a pristine park-like setting for public recreation.
The lakes are Upper and Lower Crystal Springs and San Andreas lake,
which can be seen from Highway 280, and Pilarcitos, tucked in a
canyon on the southeast flank of Montara Mountain, out of public
view.
</P>
<P>
   The route for the Bay Ridge Trail is planned for two existing
service roads from Sweeney Ridge to the junction of highways 92 and
35 but has been stonewalled for years by the Water Department. A
final environmental document that addresses the Bay Ridge Trail at
Crystal Springs will be released later this year, probably in
September, at which time the public will be able to provide
comments.
</P>
<P>
   The lakes could also provide dream-like settings for fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The best comparative example is at Barrett Lake near San Diego,
which was off-limits to the public for 26 years and faced similar
concerns over impacts from use. The lake is now open two days per
week, six months per year, with a reservation service and quota of
anglers drawn by lottery if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is catch-and-release, no bait is allowed, from boats
equipped with electric motors. The result is simply the best
freshwater fishing for bass and bluegill in the Western United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A similar program could be established at the four lakes at
Crystal Springs. According to a Department of Fish and Game fish
census using nets, the lakes on the off-limits watershed are loaded
with wild rainbow trout that range mostly 14 to 20 inches and
bigger, and scads of bass in the 3-pound class.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Water Department has blocked every attempt to
establish a fishing program or hiking access by a variety of means,
usually by simply ignoring requests. But I predict that at the
least, the Peninsula's 9-mile missing link for the Bay Ridge Trail
will be a go here.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many wondered why the Water Department has been so
adamant in its refusal to grant access.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's clear. The officials didn't want anybody to see their
houses. After all, doesn't it make sense that they just want it all
for themselves?

   CHINA-TAIWAN (Beijing) _ Taiwan has abandoned the political
formula that has long kept the peace with China, declaring that it
will no longer adhere to the line that the Chinese mainland and
Taiwan are two parts of the same country. Beijing's response is
immediate, and furious. Taking a step away from the conceptual
umbrella of eventual reunification between China and Taiwan that
has been a basic condition of all talks between them, President Lee
Teng-hui made a risky move that badly soured Taiwan's relations
with China and could also worsen the strains in the already
troubled ties between China and the United States. By Seth Faison.

STOCKS MIXED DESPITE BIG DAY FOR BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were narrowly mixed on light volume Monday,
although the Dow Jones industrial average did edge up to a new
record. The struggle in the stock market came despite a big day in
the bond market, where long-term interest rates fell sharply, with
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond ending at 5.90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said bonds benefited from a big slide in the Argentine
and Brazilian stock markets. Money flowing out of those markets may
well have sought safe haven in the Treasury market, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But any improvement in interest rates will be short-lived if
reports on producer and consumer prices scheduled for this week are
not friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producer price data will be an important determinant in
whether bond yields relax further, or are pushed back up,'' said
Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation reports, as well as a heavy schedule of corporate
earnings reports expected this week, caused many stock traders to
stay on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is about earnings, and whether or not
expectations, which are high, will be exceeded,'' said William
Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many stocks, especially technology shares, have had huge moves
in advance of these reports. Unless a company really blows past the
estimates, I expect we might see some profit-taking when the
numbers are announced.''
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a gain of 1 3/4, to 53 1/2, in International Paper,
which is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings Tuesday,
the Dow rose 7.28, or 0.1 percent, to 11,200.98, although broader
market measures slipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 4.18 points, or 0.3
percent, to 1,399.10. Declines in General Electric and America
Online shares more than offset gains in technology issues like
Lucent Technologies, Microsoft and MCI/Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index fell 2.63 points, or 0.1 percent, to
2,790.44. Big declines in Internet stocks like Yahoo! and
Amazon.com pulled the composite index lower.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks, however, had a decent day. The Russell 2000 index
of small company shares rose 1.32 points, or 0.3 percent, to
459.30.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was sluggish, 668.8 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange and 970.9 million shares on the NASDAQ market.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin of Donaldson Lufkin said a report expected from Intel
after the market closes Tuesday would also say a great deal about
how technology shares might fare in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to releasing financial data for the second quarter,
Intel is expected to provide an outlook on the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said, ``If Intel says Y2k is not an issue, that will
clearly be a positive,'' for the market. Intel shares slipped 13/16
to 65 7/16 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Amgen Inc., the world's largest biotechnology
company, fell 2 5/16, to 67, but were trading at $72.25 in
after-hours trading on the NASDAQ. Citing ``unusual'' trading in
its stock, on Friday the company said it would report
second-quarter results after the market closed Monday, about 10
days ahead of schedule. Profits rose 24 percent to $268 million, or
50 cents a share in the quarter, surpassing both the 41 cents a
share earned a year earlier and Wall Street expectations for 46
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak, a Dow component, gained 2 11/16, to 72 13/16,
after an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read raised his rating on the
photography company to ``buy'' from ``hold.''

WHISTLEBLOWERS WARN OF ALASKA PIPELINE DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An environmental disaster worse than the Exxon Valdez oil spill
could happen any day because of corrosion and poor maintenance of
the 800-mile-long Alaskan oil pipeline, warn six employees of the
company, in a detailed, 21-page critique to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, all with at least 10 years experience who said
they feared retailiation if their names were revealed, allege that
neglect and intimidation of whistleblowers has set the stage for a
rupture of the aging, 22-year-old pipeline that carries crude oil
from Alaska's North Slope to the port at Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a single gasket, or valve, or wire, or procedure,
or person that will cause the catastrophe,'' wrote the group in
their letter to two members of Congress, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, and the lead owner of the pipeline, BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a combination of small, perhaps seemingly
inconsequential events and conditions that will lead to the
accident that we're all dreading and powerless to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker accident, the worst oil spill in US
history, dumped 10.5 million gallons into Prince William Sound,
killing 250,000 seabirds and costing more than $2 billion to clean
up. But the employees of the pipeline company, called Alyeksa,
believe that a pipeline disaster could be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest recent leak came in 1996 when 35,000 gallons of oil
escaped, but the whistleblowers said Alyeska habitually neglects
potentially bigger problems, such as a leak from two gas pipelines
that went on for more than a year. They called company
record-keeping ``totally dysfunctional,'' and said managers play
down negative reports to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Joint Pipeline Office, a federal and state
agency that oversees the pipeline, said they are investigating the
charges, but noted they were already familiar with many of the
charges. They said they have issued often-critical reports in
recent years about poor maintenance records and problems with
corrosion of the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we think the pipe's unsafe or worn out? Emphatically no,''
said Gary Riemer, deputy pipeline corridor officer at the Joint
Pipeline Office. ``We are trying to look ahead for the next 10, 15,
25 years.'' As a result, he said Alyeska has replaced eight miles
of corroded pipe and inserted miles of sleeving to other pipes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the whistleblowers wrote in their letter that oversight
from the Joint Pipeline Office was ``totally useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at BP Amoco, the London-based oil company that owns 50
percent of the pipeline, declined to comment on the letter, saying
they had not reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-CA, a longtime critic of pipeline safety
who received the letter, said he was disturbed because Alyeska
officials had recently assured him that they are now more sensitive
to employee concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know why Alyeska employees apparently continue to
fear being sanctioned for signing their names to a letter raising
safety concerns about the pipeline,'' said Miller, who requested a
detailed response from the Joint Pipeline Office.

 &HT;    CCE increases expense estimates of European problems
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises said the massive recall of its
soft drinks because of the European health scare will cost $103
million _ $43 million more than it originally estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based bottler said Monday that the recall involved
17 million cases, instead of the 14 million initially forecast.
</P>
<P>
   That is partially because European consumers had a larger
inventory of products in their homes than anticipated. As a result,
more beverages had to be recalled and destroyed, thus raising the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   President and Chief Executive Henry Schimberg, however, saw a
silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unexpectedly high level of in-home product inventory
returned speaks to the popularity and penetration of our brands,''
Schimberg said in a statement. ``This popularity gives us
confidence that, as we continue to work closely with our customers
and the government authorities to finalize these issues, we will be
successful in restoring the full faith and confidence of consumers
throughout Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   CCE owns the two plants in Belgium and France that produced the
beverages blamed for nearly 250 illnesses in Belgium last month.
The scare that resulted spread to several other European nations,
which imposed full or partial bans of Coca-Cola products. Those
restrictions have been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the one-time charge in CCE's second quarter does
not include the additional impact of the recall on sales, cash
operating profit and earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts polled by First Call Corp. estimate the
company will earn 22 cents a share in the quarter, down from 27
cents a year ago. The estimate excludes the effect of the recall's
non-recurring charge, which would amount to a reduction of another
16 cents a share. But insurance may offset some of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   CCE, which is the world's largest soft-drink bottler, is
expected to report second-quarter earnings on July 20. Coca-Cola
Co., which owns 40 percent of CCE, is expected to report its
earnings Thursday.

NAACP THREATENS BOYCOTT OVER DEARTH OF BLACK CHARACTERS ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pointing out that not a single prime-time show among
26 to be introduced on the major broadcast networks this fall has
an ethnic minority character in a leading role, the president of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
Monday announced the start of a campaign to pressure both networks
and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The president, Kweisi Mfume, said the NAACP would open a
Hollywood office in October to conduct a long-term monitoring and
lobbying campaign of the television and film industries' progress
on integrating both their acting corps and their behind-the-scenes
production staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said the effort was likely to lead to a call for boycotts
of shows that remain racially segregated and of sponsors who
advertise on the shows. But first, he said, he has asked to meet
with the top executives of the four major networks _ ABC, CBS, Fox
and NBC _ to discuss the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will certainly have conversations with these executives and
with advertising executives,'' Mfume said in an interview after
making his keynote address to the NAACP's 90th annual convention in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as sure as I'm standing here, you can bet it's going to
come down to that,'' he said, referring to a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   In his address before more than 2,500 conventioneers, Mfume also
announced that the organization would file a federal class-action
lawsuit against handgun manufacturers and distributors, seeking
injunctive relief that would, in effect, regulate the marketing of
firearms more tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mfume and several lawyers involved in the suit said
they would file it by the end of this week in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District, in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The four networks issued statements Monday that essentially said
they had room for improvement in addressing the NAACP's concerns,
and would continue to try harder.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to get broader ethnic representation in
television shows presents programmers with two options: to develop
shows about minority characters, or to include more minority
characters in shows that then become ethnically diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers have resisted programs about minority
characters, believing that such programs will not be watched by
affluent white audiences (with exceptions, like ``Cosby'' on CBS).
</P>
<P>
   And some argue that even a ``real-life'' proportion of minority
characters (African-Americans make up 13 percent of the American
population) will rebuff some white viewers. That has not been a
problem with popular dramas like ``NYPD Blue,'' ``ER'' or ``Law and
Order.'' But comedies seem to fall more readily into categories of
white or black appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cable networks can succeed with much smaller
audiences, and more and more of them are appealing to particular
groups, defined not only by race but by age, class or
special-interest. Broadcast networks are trying to hold onto their
audience share in this fragmenting world and keep advertising
revenue high, which means appealing to upper-middle-class
Americans, who are especially coveted by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers are interested in demographics, but it doesn't
necessarily have to do with race,'' said Doug Alligood, senior vice
president, special markets for BBDO New York, a major advertising
agency. ``They might say a show is too low-rated in the demographic
I want, in terms of education or income level, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was not including UPN and WB, the relatively new
five-night-a-week networks, Mfume said, ``Because the Big Four are
the Big Four, and if we are successful with them, the others will
get the message real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   WB and UPN recently, and Fox about 10 years ago, have tried to
gain a foothold by appealing to black viewers, who did not find
many shows with black central characters elsewhere on television.
Once successful, they cut back on black shows or, as WB has done,
confine them to one night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Alligood and Mfume also said programmers are often influenced by
what they find appealing, and most programming and advertising
executives are white. But Mfume pointed out that, in the 1970s and
1980s, there were more multiracial casts, without apparent
advertising repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see slippage now,'' Mfume said, ``and we need to find out
how to make sure it does not keep sliding back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fox has no prime-time shows, returning or new, with lead
characters who are not white. One new show, a police drama called
``Ryan Caulfield,'' will have a black captain and desk sergeant,
Fox said, and its new science-fiction drama, ``Harsh Realm,'' has a
Hispanic villain.
</P>
<P>
   Fox does have one returning show (not scheduled to resume until
January) about a black family, a cartoon show called ``The PJ's,''
which has been criticized by Spike Lee and others as buffoonish.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has the best record on integrated casts, with nine returning
shows that feature black or other ethnic minority characters in
lead roles, and CBS's made-for-television movies have regularly
featured black or Hispanic themes. A new hospital drama ``City of
Angels,'' coming in January, will have an almost entirely
African-American and Hispanic-American cast.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had just one new show with a non-white main character,
``Third Watch,'' about an overnight police and fire-rescue squad in
New York, and is adding a black main character to its popular
police drama ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   One of NBC's most touted new shows, ``West Wing,'' is a drama
about the White House under a liberal Democratic administration,
yet its cast is virtually all white.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has one show about a black family, ``The Hughleys'' (they
live in a white suburb); main characters who are black on ``The
Practice,'' and secondary but regular black characters in a handful
of other returning shows. One new show, ``Snoops,'' about four
detectives, includes one black female among the four.

BLAIR UNVEILS BELFAST GOVERNANCE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As part of his last ditch effort to save the Northern
Ireland political settlement, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Monday unveiled the legislation he said will guarantee that neither
pro-British unionists nor Irish republicans can renege on their
obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as they read the bill, both the Ulster Unionists,
who represent middle-class Protestants in Northern Ireland, and
Sinn Fein, which has links with the Irish Republican Army, said
they wanted it changed, claiming it was slanted toward the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of political brinksmanship, a contentious
Protestant parade passed off peacefully in Belfast Monday in what
British and Irish officials hope was a good omen for the resolution
of a dispute that has stalled the peace process and the return of
local government to Northern Ireland after 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers from the Orange Order were prevented by the police and
British army from parading through a Catholic neighborhood in south
Belfast to commemorate the day in 1690 when Protestant King William
of Orange defeated the Catholic forces of King James II.
</P>
<P>
   Showcasing its new policy of restrained, token protest for the
second time in eight days, the Orange Order steered 20,000 of its
members to a nearby park to stage a rally. Last week, a similar
token protest was held in Portadown, where the Orange Order was
prevented from marching through a Catholic neighborhood, and where
rioting has flared for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from more than an hour of talks with Blair at 10
Downing St., Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said he would
propose amendments to the bill when it is debated in the House of
Commons Tuesday. He said the bill lacked specific language that
would call for Sinn Fein's exclusion from the Northern Ireland
Assembly if the IRA fails to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinn Fein assembly member Alex Maskey said the bill gives
unionists a veto not included in the Good Friday Agreement of April
1998, which is on the verge of collapse because unionists refuse to
form a local power-sharing government with republicans until the
IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Blair wants to rush legislation through Parliament this week to
ensure that power is transferred from London to the new Northern
Ireland Assembly. But to do that, unionists have to agree to sit in
the 12-person Cabinet with two members of Sinn Fein by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it broke with tradition this month and openly called
for the IRA to begin disarming, Sinn Fein argues it won its seats
in an election and cannot be excluded from government because of
the IRA's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The unionists, meanwhile, argue that the assembly should not be
dissolved if the IRA fails to live up to its obligation to disarm
under the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill unveiled Monday seeks to balance those two positions.
It says the institutions created by the agreement would be
suspended if either the unionists fail to sit in government or the
IRA begins to disarm. But rather than simply suspend the assembly,
the bill calls for a debate to determine what went wrong, and for
the assembly itself to decide whether it will continue if Sinn Fein
is excluded.
</P>
<P>
   That last provision effectively gives the largest Irish
nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the power
to decide whether Sinn Fein could stay and the assembly would
continue if the IRA refuses to disarm. The unionists have been
asking the SDLP and its leader, John Hume, to publicly declare what
it would do if the IRA does not disarm. But Hume, who last year
shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Trimble, has refused to take a
categorical position.
</P>
<P>
   With a huge majority in the House of Commons, Blair plans to
push the bill through the lower chamber Tuesday and get it through
the House of Lords by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But all that hinges on Trimble's decision, which is expected
Wednesday night. If the unionists accept the plan, the Cabinet
would be named on Thursday, with full powers devolved to Belfast by
Sunday. By next week, the IRA would have been expected to appointed
one of its members to liase with John de Chastelain, a retired
Canadian general in charge of the commission that will oversee the
disarming of paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says that if de Chastelain decides any of the
paramilitary groups are failing to disarm, he would notify
Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, who would then suspend the assembly,
putting into motion a series of events that would force the
politicians themselves to decide whether to scrap the peace
process.

SENATE BEGINS DEBATE ON MANAGED CARE HEALTH BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With health care protections for millions of
consumers at stake, the Senate Monday opened a critical debate over
patients' rights amid a multimillion-dollar advertising war and a
scramble by both parties to profit from the politically explosive
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle set off a swirl of medical horror stories,
parliamentary gamesmanship and dueling rallies, as Senate Democrats
pressed the most extensive plan to overhaul the nation's health
care system since President Clinton's failed effort in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate is who controls the delivery of
medical care in managed health systems: a patient's doctor or the
patient's insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both parties cited flaws in the current system, as
the four-day debate unfolded. Yet party leaders agreed on little
else but the title of their competing measures: ``The Patients'
Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the chief architect of the Democrat
plan, insisted during a flurry of speeches at rallies, news
conferences and his Senate podium that the managed-care system
could be substantially improved for the cost of ``one Big Mac'' a
month for each American worker. But one of Kennedy's leading GOP
critics, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, said the Democratic proposal
would cost $72 billion, enough ``to buy every McDonald's franchise
in America'' _ assertions Kennedy vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is scheduled to end Thursday when Republican leaders
force a vote on their measure. Until then, Democrats said, they
will offer amendments aimed at forcing senators to cast votes on
such politically explosive issues as whether to broaden the rights
of patients to sue their insurance providers over the quality of
their care.
</P>
<P>
   The votes, in many cases, could be used as ammunition in the
2000 elections. ``The American people deserve to know exactly where
every senator stands on each of these protections,'' said the
Senate minority leader, Thomas A. Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   With extraordinary stakes for a number of special interests,
from insurance companies to trial lawyers, the insurance industry
launched a $9 million ad campaign to try to influence the vote.
Firing back in their own multimillion-dollar effort were the
AFL-CIO and the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The media blitz is the most extensive since last year's Senate
debate over regulating the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton is expected to campaign for the Democratic
plan in a rally Tuesday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   By nearly every standard, the Democratic measure vastly differs
from the Republican plan to overhaul the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, citing concern about rising medical costs, oppose
the Democratic push to broaden the right for patients to sue to
obtain ``medically necessary'' care. Instead, Republicans favor a
plan to establish new consumer protections, including an appeals
process aimed at guaranteeing that patients have access to the
primary care physicians and specialists they need.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan also would expand access to emergency rooms,
medications and physicians who are outside a defined network.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say their plan would increase insurance premiums by
less than 1 percent, while the Democratic measure would boost
insurance costs by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats criticized the GOP proposal for covering only the 48
million Americans who are covered by ``self-funded'' plans, which
are run by employers rather than insurance companies. The
Democratic plan would apply to 161 million Americans, including
those in health maintenance organizations, and state and municipal
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans assert that federal regulations are not needed for
members of HMOs and state and municipal plans because they already
are regulated by state laws, a position shared by the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, citing HMOs as a vast source of patient complaints
about access to care, accused GOP leaders of promoting ``a license
for continued HMO abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a phony bill, a cynical bill, a minimalist bill, a bill
bought and paid for by the insurance industry,'' Kennedy said on
the Senate floor. He further blasted the measure as ``a bill of
wrongs ... an industry profit protection plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, countered that
the Democratic plan to expand the rights of patients to sue their
insurers is little more than ``a lawyers' annuity plan.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of provisions in the competing measures are similar in
principle, such as improving access for women to Ob-Gyn doctors.
But the Democratic plan would apply to about 50 million more women
than the more limited GOP proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic measure also would require health plans to cover
overnight hospital stays for women who undergo mastectomies and to
pay for routine health care costs associated with clinical trials.
The Republican plan does not address the mastectomy issue and calls
for a study of the clinical trial question.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders said their final package, which is expected to pass
the Senate, will include increased tax deductions for health
insurance costs, an initiative not included in the Democratic plan.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides jockeyed for an edge Monday, they engaged in a
series of complicated procedural ploys that Kennedy, a master of
Senate rules, described as ``parliamentary gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, leaders in both parties were uncertain whether
they were actually debating the Democratic or Republican
alternative. ``Let's just say we're debating health care policy,''
said a senior Republican aide.
</P>
<P>
   The first votes on Democratic amendments are likely to occur
Tuesday.

 &HT;    `Buffy' revampeds finale
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the WB decided to postpone the highly
anticipated season-ender of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' because it
dealt with high school violence and would have aired right at
graduation time, following the shootings in Littleton and Conyers.
A lot of ``Buffy'' buffs were outraged and flooded the WB with
protest phone calls and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   A lively black market even sprang up on the Internet and at
conventions like Atlanta's DragonCon selling bootlegs copies of the
finale, which had aired in Canada as scheduled. ($20 a copy was the
going rate.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy'' has garnered such a devoted audience because it takes
ordinary issues of adolescence _ love, sex, friendship, midterms _
and elevates them by overlaying a series of Armageddonish battles
between Good (Buffy and her buds) and Evil (vampires, demons, a
mayor who's scheduled to turn into a 60-foot serpent during
commencement). Although it could be ridiculous, instead ``Buffy''
has much more emotional resonance than more realistic shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the finale was painted into a corner, first by the long wait
(imposed by the WB) and also by depending on computer-generated
special effects. For months, the series has been building up to the
moment when the mayor of Sunnydale turns into the serpent, and when
he finally does, it's obvious that it was done on a TV budget
rather than a feature-film budget. In the summer of the digital
effects in ``The Phantom Menace,'' Mayor Monster looks more like
Mayor McCheesy.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the WB was absolutely correct in not airing this
episode in May. The big dragon, which caught all the flak, wasn't
really the problem; it's how the kids fight the monster, which has
some eerie reverberations of what happened at Columbine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the climactic battle is not as grand as it might
have been, the ``Buffy'' romantics will still get more than their
fix between our graduating heroine and her forbidden love, the
noble vampire Angel. Angel will be getting a spin-off series in the
fall, so he had to be written out of Buffy's life, but not before
creator Joss Whedon gives them a scene both sexy and sentimental, a
little Rick-and-Ilsa-on-the-runway moment that will have Buffsters
(the ones who didn't pay $20 for a bootleg) all a-swoon.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on to next season. Angel's gone, and Buffy and her
friends have all left high school (boy, have they left high
school), so the show's basic premises are going to undergo a pretty
basic morph. Whedon's a sharp guy who can pull it off, but even if
the worst happens and ``Buffy'' is like the high-school jock who
never lives up the glory of the game-winning touchdown, we'll
always have Sunnydale.

GORE URGES FAMILY-FRIENDLY GUN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With several pointed digs, Vice President Al Gore took
on the Republican frontrunner for president Monday, as outlined his
own plan for fighting crime, including photo licenses for every new
handgun owner in America.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside Boston Police headquarters in Roxbury, Gore
took aim at Texas Governor George W. Bush as he denounced hate
crimes, opposed loosening concealed weapon laws and said that gun
laws should be written for families, ``not for gun lobbyists and
their apologists.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the vice president never mentioned Bush by name, aides to
Gore encouraged the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome everyone and anyone to make the comparison on where
we stand and where they stand,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's
spokesman. ``If the holster fits, wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Gore proposed: a Constitutional amendment to
protect the rights of crime victims; beefing up the criminal
justice system with more prosecutors, defenders and judges; new
technology for police to help them map and target high crime areas;
banning cheap, easily concealed handguns; and requiring tougher
penalties for gun-related crimes, including violent crimes
committed in front of children.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the topics and applause lines in Gore's address found an
easy correlation to action Bush has taken - or not taken - while
serving as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during this year's legislative session in Austin, a
bill to require background checks on gun buyers at Texas gun shows
died. Bush says he supports such checks, but believes Congress
should pass such a bill, and so he didn't push the issue in the
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also kept his distance from the legislative debate on
hate-crimes legislation, which would have set higher penalties for
crimes committed because of a victim's gender, race or sexual
orientation. The Texas bill was named for James Byrd Jr., the black
Texas who was dragged to death behind a truck. That bill also died.
Bush didn't lobby the issue hard, his spokesman said, because he
regarded it as a vote of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said he views such a stance is unconscionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It astonishes me that, just two weeks after the terrible
crimes of hate in Illinois and Indiana, some still deny that hate
crimes merit stiffer punishment,'' Gore said. ``When a killer on
the rampage picks Jews, Blacks and Asian Americans as his victims,
I don't understand how some can still argue that hate crimes are no
different than all other crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, still without naming his leading rival, also offered a
note of contrast on two other Bush priorities: the Texas governor's
signing of legislation ending a 125-year prohibition on private
citizens carrying concealed weapons and also a bill to limit cities
ability to sue gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some want to enact new protections for gun manufacturers. I
want to pass new protections for families,'' Gore said. ``Some want
more concealed weapons - but they can't conceal the fact that
they're just doing the NRA's bidding. Some want to overturn local
gun control laws. I want to overturn the influence of the gun
lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also opposes mandatory child safety locks on guns. To that,
Gore quoted the Newton-based Stop Handgun Violence billboard.
``It's a lot easier to child-proof a gun than it is to bullet-proof
a child,'' said Gore. ``I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, however, said Gore's gun-licensing plan would
not work, and complained that the administration has been lax in
prosecuting gun-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A government registration of law abiding citizens will not
prevent criminals from committing crimes with guns,'' said Mindy
Tucker, Bush's spokeswoman. ``Tougher penalties and instant
background checks will. Governor Bush has consistently supported
instant background checks to keep guns out of the hands of
cirminals and juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the Clinton-Gore administration has refused to
provide additional funding for Project Exile, which gives resources
to federal prosecutors to help them make gun offenses a top
priority. She also said that the administration has failed to
prosecute hundreds of violations of the Brady law, which requires a
seven-day waiting period to purchase a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nine-page speech, delivered to a friendly crowd of
supporters, is his fifth major policy address in recent months and
it further distinguishes him from Bush and from his Democratic
rival, former Senator Bill Bradley. Both Bush and Bradley have
remained intentionally vague about their agendas, preferring to
hold off on taking too many specific positions.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley did put forth his own gun-control plan last month,
including proposals for the registration of all handguns and a ban
on the manufacture and sale of Saturday night specials. He also
called for a one-per-month limit on handgun sales.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bradley, Tony Wyche, welcomed Gore to the
gun-control debate. ``We're very happy the vice president has
started to support our proposals on gun control,'' Wyche said. ``We
think he should have gone further to ban gun dealers from
residential neighborhoods, and should have been more clear on gun
registrations.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has laid out his thoughts on education in Iowa,
faith-based organizations in Atlanta, cancer research in
Philadelphia, and liveability issues in Washington, D.C. In the
next two weeks, he is expected to delve into economic themes,
talking about how to help those who have not benefited from the
nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore lavished plaudits on Boston, calling the city's crime
fighting ``an inspiration,'' and heaped praise on Mayor Thomas M.
Menino, Police Commissioner Paul Evans and the Reverend Eugene
Rivers for their efforts to prevent crime before it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your success here is an inspiration: For 18 months here in
Boston, not a single precious child was killed,'' said Gore.
``Youth homicide is down by 75 percent. So far, in all of 1999, not
a single parent has lost a child to handgun violence. This summer
could be the safest in Boston's recent history. I really applaud
you.''

WHISTLEBLOWERS WARN OF ALASKA PIPELINE DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An environmental disaster worse than the Exxon Valdez oil spill
could happen any day because of corrosion and poor maintenance of
the 800-mile-long Alaskan oil pipeline, warn six employees of the
company, in a detailed, 21-page critique to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, all with at least 10 years experience who said
they feared retailiation if their names were revealed, allege that
neglect and intimidation of whistleblowers has set the stage for a
rupture of the aging, 22-year-old pipeline that carries crude oil
from Alaska's North Slope to the port at Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a single gasket, or valve, or wire, or procedure,
or person that will cause the catastrophe,'' wrote the group in
their letter to two members of Congress, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, and the lead owner of the pipeline, BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a combination of small, perhaps seemingly
inconsequential events and conditions that will lead to the
accident that we're all dreading and powerless to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker accident, the worst oil spill in US
history, dumped 10.5 million gallons into Prince William Sound,
killing 250,000 seabirds and costing more than $2 billion to clean
up. But the employees of the pipeline company, called Alyeksa,
believe that a pipeline disaster could be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest recent leak came in 1996 when 35,000 gallons of oil
escaped, but the whistleblowers said Alyeska habitually neglects
potentially bigger problems, such as a leak from two gas pipelines
that went on for more than a year. They called company
record-keeping ``totally dysfunctional,'' and said managers play
down negative reports to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Joint Pipeline Office, a federal and state
agency that oversees the pipeline, said they are investigating the
charges, but noted they were already familiar with many of the
charges. They said they have issued often-critical reports in
recent years about poor maintenance records and problems with
corrosion of the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we think the pipe's unsafe or worn out? Emphatically no,''
said Gary Riemer, deputy pipeline corridor officer at the Joint
Pipeline Office. ``We are trying to look ahead for the next 10, 15,
25 years.'' As a result, he said Alyeska has replaced eight miles
of corroded pipe and inserted miles of sleeving to other pipes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the whistleblowers wrote in their letter that oversight
from the Joint Pipeline Office was ``totally useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at BP Amoco, the London-based oil company that owns 50
percent of the pipeline, declined to comment on the letter, saying
they had not reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-CA, a longtime critic of pipeline safety
who received the letter, said he was disturbed because Alyeska
officials had recently assured him that they are now more sensitive
to employee concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know why Alyeska employees apparently continue to
fear being sanctioned for signing their names to a letter raising
safety concerns about the pipeline,'' said Miller, who requested a
detailed response from the Joint Pipeline Office.

<P>
   Winter temperatures at the Scott-Amundsen research station at
the South Pole average 80 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is
pitch dark nearly 24 hours a day. People who sign on to work there
understand that they will not see home for a long time: from
February to October, planes cannot even land.
</P>
<P>
   But an Air Force jet came close on Sunday, dipping low over the
base at 2 a.m. to drop medical supplies for a woman, trapped there
for the winter, who had discovered a lump in her breast and needed
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Her plight turns out to be even more complex than initial
reports suggested. The woman herself is the only medical doctor at
the station, according to a cancer expert who was consulted in her
case and who spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the patient must act as her own doctor, performing a
biopsy on herself and, if the lump is malignant, administering any
needed treatment, which might include chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   If she was to become incapacitated, that would leave the 40
other members of the research team without a doctor at the remote
Antarctic outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Erb, director of the Office of Polar Programs at the
National Science Foundation, which runs the base, declined to
identify the woman or say whether she was the station's doctor. Erb
said that although cancer experts in the United States had made a
``working diagnosis,'' the foundation was honoring the woman's
request for confidentiality, and would not reveal whether or not
she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hanson, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said that despite
the need to protect the patient's privacy, officials did not think
that the Air Force medical-drop mission itself could or should be
kept secret from the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to get out sooner or later, so it seemed
appropriate to explain as much as we could as soon as we could,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb also said that it was adequate to have one doctor at an
Antarctic station, backed up by people who had trained as
paramedics, along with computer, video and telephone links to
medical centers when needed. In addition, he said, people who sign
up for extended stays at the South Pole are carefully screened for
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone there is sufficiently fit that he or she is carrying
out assigned duties without any problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanson said that the woman, who is 47, had been working at
the station since December and had discovered the lump in her
breast in June. The foundation sought advice on her behalf from
doctors at the National Cancer Institute and other cancer centers.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation said in a news release, ``the patient and her
physicians decided on a course of drug treatment that they consider
appropriate to maintain her health and safety.'' But the release
did not specify what the treatment would be. Erb said that the
drugs sent in included several different treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   He said said that the jet zoomed in low over the base and
dropped the equipment from an altitude of about 700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never landed a plane at the South Pole in midwinter,''
Ms. Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb said that the equipment included a digital microscope and an
ultrasound machine, which can be used to measure the size of tumors
and to guide a doctor doing a biopsy. But, he said, ``The
preliminary report is that the ultrasound machine did not survive
the drop.'' He also said that it took time to retrieve and open all
the packages that had been dropped, and because satellite
communication with the base is possible for only a few hours a day,
he did not yet know about the condition of the other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant on the case said he thought the doctor would be
performing her own biopsy. Although the thought of driving a needle
into one's own breast to look for cancer cells might horrify most
people, he said, ``I would assume that somebody who chooses to go
to the South Pole is a tough person, a strong character. It
wouldn't shock me that somebody could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without ultrasound, video conferencing with an ordinary
camera, he said, might allow a radiologist to ``walk her through''
the procedure. She would then have to make microscope slides out of
the cells from the biopsy and stain them so that the slides could
be examined for cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   The digital microscope would allow the microscopic images to be
transmitted for diagnosis to a pathologist anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If cancer were found, chemotherapy could be started, and the
patient could have surgery later, after leaving the South Pole.
Although most women who need chemotherapy for breast cancer have
surgery first, studies have shown that giving chemotherapy first
and surgery later can work just as well, said Dr. Larry Norton,
head of the division of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer, who was not a consultant on the South Pole case.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor would need other drugs to treat chemotherapy's
side effects, including medication for nausea and, possibly,
antibiotics to take care of infections that might set in from the
tendency of chemotherapy to lower the counts of infection-fighting
white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, the consultant said, is that if the cells were
malignant, and if proper staining materials had been sent to the
base, it might be possible for the doctor to test her own cancer
cells for sensitivity to the naturally occurring hormone estrogen.
And if their growth was stimulated by estrogen, the doctor could be
given hormonal therapy instead of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The hormonal therapy would include the drug tamoxifen, to block
estrogen's effects. He said the hormonal approach would have milder
side effects than chemotherapy and could slow the growth of the
tumor until the patient could be flown out of the South Pole in
late October or early November.

HATCH UNDETERRED BY SHORTFALL IN CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ If Orrin G. Hatch had a nickel for every time he
asked voters for money Monday, he would still be far behind
Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, undeterred by the monumental game of campaign
catchup, Hatch, the conservative senator from Utah with just
$700,000 in commitments, paid his first visit to this state since
announcing July 1 that he would join the dozen or so candidates
already running for president.
</P>
<P>
   His nine-hour day spent in Manchester and Concord consisted of
explaining why he is running (``I'm the most qualified''); why he
got in the race late (``It took me a long time to decide''); and
why he thinks he can beat Texas Governor Bush, who has a $36
million campaign warchest and is way ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really tired of having the establishment dictate who we're
going to have for president,'' Hatch told Delta Dental employees in
the company cafeteria, where he asked for donations several times.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch, whom the National Rifle Association twice named its
Man of the Year, took aim not only at Bush, but at the Democratic
candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley.
He said that they all come from wealthy families, which he does
not, and that Bush has the least experience of the lead contenders,
having been governor for only five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing that separates me from the three top
candidates, it's theirs was a life of privilege and mine was one of
poverty,'' the 65-year-old grandfather of 18 said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hatch went on to become a lawyer. And 23 years ago, he
ran successfully to become a Republican senator from Utah despite
filing his campaign papers for that race on the last minute of the
last day of the deadline. ``Nobody gave me a chance to win,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he has been asked to run for president many
times before, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said he is
taking the plunge this time because the stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   He said President Clinton's successor could have the chance to
appoint three Supreme Court justices, something that could
dramatically alter the nation's legal, social and political
landscape. He warned that if a Democrat wins, the composition of
the court could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never get our country back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch declined to answer when asked if he would hold Supreme
Court candidates to a litmus test on certain issues, including
abortion, of which he is an outspoken critic. All he would say is
that his choices would ``represent everyone in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also made it apparent Monday the central role religion has
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   A member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, he
told voters throughout the day that the next president needs to
``restore morality to the White House'' just about as much as
foreign policy needs to be improved, which is quite a bit,
according to him.
</P>
<P>
   He said he asked New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith ``to pray''
over his reported decision to leave the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   And at a tour of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Children's Center
in Concord, he told a boy named Joshua that he had a ``really
important name. You have to live right,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   But this was also Hatch, sweltering in the sun while wearing a
12-year-old dark pinstripe suit, trying to show he is not as rigid
as he is sometimes portrayed. ``Al Gore has given the word stiff
new meaning,'' he said with the laugh.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Carney, a Republican political consultant, is not
amused, calling Hatch's last minute candidacy ``an afront'' to the
New Hampshire primary system, where grass-roots organizers so
necessary for success have already aligned themselves with other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only somebody from Washington, D.C., could think that with a
few months to go, no money, no name recognition, no distinct ideas
or message, that they could walk into the New Hampshire primary and
win without an effort,'' Carney said. ``It boggles the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Paul Young, senior political adviser to Republican
presidential candidate Steve Forbes, said: ``I haven't seen a
snowflake yet in New Hampshire'' and ``the average voter hasn't
begun to look at this race.''

STUDY: MOST TOO POOR TO PAY MEDICAL BILLS ELIGIBLE FOR AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Most patients whose unpaid medical bills are written
off by hospitals as bad debt are genuinely poor individuals who are
eligible for state medical assistance, a new study reveals.
</P>
<P>
   The study resolves a longstanding debate about the financial
status of ``bad-debt'' patients, said the researchers, and suggests
that many, if not most, of these patients could be enrolled in
free-care programs like Medicaid. This would alleviate the burden
of bad debt on Massachusetts hospitals, which last year amounted to
about $355 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked by the results,'' said Katherine London, a
policy specialist at the Massachusetts Division of Health Care
Finance and Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients were so much poorer than we expected _ the
majority of these patients were below the poverty level,'' said
London.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts provides free care to uninsured and underinsured
patients in several ways. Those who meet low-income qualifications
get treatment at no cost or at reduced rates by hospitals, which
are reimbursed from a state pool at the end of each year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, hospitals are reimbursed for emergency care to
nonpaying patients. However, hospitals must absorb, as bad debt,
unpaid bills for non-emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Monday and published in the latest issue of
the journal Health Affairs, was done at the behest of a special
commission directed by the state Legislature to scrutinize free
care.
</P>
<P>
   The authors are Joel S. Weissman, an associate professor in
medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical
School; Paul Dryfoos, an independent consultant; and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest overall message is that when hospitals see these
data, they should realize they can do a better job of enrolling
patients'' in programs for which the hospitals will be repaid _
like the state free-care pool _ or in entitlement programs like
Medicaid, said Weissman.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were previously released to health care providers,
and London said that hospitals already are working harder to screen
patients for Medicaid and free-care eligibility. Along these lines,
hospitals have put up larger and clearer signs to inform patients
about the programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals have always argued that they provide more free care
than the government gives them credit for,'' said Andrew Dreyfus, a
spokesman for the Massachusetts Hospital Association. ``This study
shows that a lot of what's written off as bad debt is really free
care,'' for which hospitals should be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   But getting people to apply for government programs can be
difficult, Dreyfus said, because of some patients' reluctance to
talk about their incomes, language barriers, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study tells us that we have a lot of work to do to make
sure we reach every eligible person,'' said Dreyfus.

TELEMUNDO APOLOGIZES TO HOUSTON ASTROS OWNER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Telemundo chairman and CEO Roland Hernandez issued a
letter of apology Monday to Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr.
after executives from the local Spanish-language TV station accused
McLane of insensitive remarks about Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, KTMD station manager Marco Camacho reported that
McLane said that Hispanics aren't smart enough to understand
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The story ignited a flurry of controversy in Houston and around
the nation as McLane was compared to then-Cincinnati Reds owner
Marge Schott, who was fined by Major League Baseball and banished
for a year for allegedly using ethnic slurs to refer to blacks and
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he believes that Camacho misunderstood McLane's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon my inquiry into the matter, and in reliance upon
your representations to me, the outstanding reputation which you
have earned over a long business career, and the high regard in
which you are held by many outstanding individuals in this
country,'' Hernandez wrote McLane, ``I believe that you did not
make any racially motivated comments to our station management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further, I believe that you and the Houston Astros strongly
support Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please accept my apology, and the apology of Telemundo, for
any difficulties this situation has caused you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the letter, McLane issued a statement praising
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership, sincere attitude and integrity made it
possible to right this wrong, and I appreciate his efforts,''
McLane said. ``The untruthful accusations made by their Houston
television station last month have caused great pain and anguish
for me, my family and the Astros organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Camacho declined comment, according to a KTMD spokesperson.
Hernandez said Camacho still maintains that he accurately
interpreted McLane's comments June 3.
</P>
<P>
   But after talking with Camacho, McLane and others in Houston,
Hernandez decided that his Houston station had been in error and
that Camacho misinterpreted the comments.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said his apology was issued at McLane's request.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez earns $50,000 annually as a director of Wal-Mart, in
which McLane is one of the biggest stockholders. Wal-Mart and
McLane also have close financial ties through a number of
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission filings indicate that
Hernandez owned 5,168 shares of Wal-Mart stock March 31. The stock
closed Monday at 47 7/16 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged comments between McLane and KTMD executives came
during McLane's casual conversation with Camacho, two other
Telemundo executives and several other people during a reception
June 3 in Houston. Later that evening, the Houston Advertising
Federation presented McLane its Trailblazer Award for improving
Houston's image with his strong marketing acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho later called his station and had it report that McLane
had made racially motivated comments.
</P>
<P>
   According to the news report, McLane said he does not market to
the Hispanic community because baseball is too complicated for
Hispanics and they don't keep up with the sport because it requires
reading newspapers daily.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said McLane complained that Hispanics buy the
cheaper seats at games and don't buy food at the Houston Astrodome
because they don't like what is served.
</P>
<P>
   The newscast sparked a furor in sectors of Houston's Hispanic
community, which considered a boycott of Astros game.
</P>
<P>
   McLane insisted that he had not put down Hispanics but was
explaining his team's problem attracting new fans.
</P>
<P>
   By June 8, the maelstrom started to die after the Houston
Chronicle reported that two people not associated with the Astros
said they had heard the same conversation and did not believe that
McLane had insulted Hispanics. One observer said she told Camacho
that same night that it would be wrong for his station to air the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, advertisers threatened to pull commercial
spots from KTMD, the smaller of Houston's two Spanish-language TV
stations. Los Angeles-based Telemundo owns KTMD and six other
Spanish-language TV stations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On June 11, after several hours of negotiations, Camacho and
McLane issued a joint statement in which Camacho said: ``It is now
clear that Mr. McLane is not biased or insensitive toward the
Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Camacho added that the two have decided that ``for the good of
the community, we should put this issue behind us and move
forward.'' But Camacho did not specifically retract his statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have since given Hispanic leaders a tour of Enron
Field, the team's new field that will open in 2000, and discussed
ways for the club to attract more Hispanic fans.

   COLOMBIA: LULL IN FIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of fighting that led President Andres Pastrana
to declare a partial curfew in nearly a third of the country,
government troops and rebel forces kept their distance from each
other. The military claims to have killed more than 200 rebels and
turned back an offensive that began Thursday, but leaders of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia say they have merely ordered
a break in attacks.

   MEXICO: QUESTIONS ON CAMPAIGN FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party failed to
account fully for $63 million in donations to the 1994 campaign
that brought President Ernesto Zedillo to office, the newspaper
Reforma reported. Based on documents from the agency that oversaw
the vote, the party reported the donations but not the donors. As a
new presidential campaign gets under way, the finances of the last
one are causing controversy because the governing party has blocked
efforts by Congress to examine them.

   BELGIUM: COALITION TAKES OFFICE

<P>
   For the first time in 41 years, a coalition government took
office without any members from the Christian Democrats. Guy
Verhofstadt, 46, the new prime minister, will have to try to
balance the interests of Greens, Liberals and Socialists. A food
scare involving dioxins is widely blamed for bringing down the
coalition of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene last month.

   NETHERLANDS: LEGALIZING EUTHANASIA
</P>
<P>
   The government has proposed a change in the law so that doctors
will formally be allowed to end the life of terminally ill patients
or help them in committing suicide. Until now such actions have
remained technically illegal, although in practice these
interventions have been decriminalized since 1993 when Parliament
adopted the stand that they would be tolerated as long as strict
guidelines were met.

   RUSSIA: COMPUTER BUG SHORTFALL
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry said its efforts to insulate Russia's
computers against the Year 2000 bug were flagging and were a matter
of growing concern. The government says that although it needs only
$187 million to protect critical systems, even that small sum will
be impossible to find before the New Year, and only a third of
vital computer systems are likely to be Year 2000 compliant _ far
less than the 80 to 85 percent target set only this spring.

   The U.N. Security Council called on rebel leaders in Congo to
sign the peace accord accepted by other parties to the conflict and
implicitly warned that a peacekeeping force could not be sent there
until they do. Council members ``expressed their dismay'' that the
Congolese Rally for Democracy and the Movement for the Liberation
of the Congo failed to accept the cease-fire plan at a ceremony in
Lusaka, Zambia, and ``strongly urged the rebel leaders to resolve
their differences and sign the agreement as soon as possible.''

LANDMARK DECRIES OVERZEALOUSNESS OF BAY STATE REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Customers and officials of Houston-based Landmark
Securities Corp., a nationwide chain of day-trading firms, say they
are launching a campaign to keep the Boston office open after state
regulators moved last week to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is blatantly unfair,'' said Steve McCarthy
of Equity Traders, a company that provides office space and
computer equipment to Landmark in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about us doing anything wrong. This is about
(Massachusetts Secretary of State) Bill Galvin not liking day
trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin's office, which has led the nation in cracking down on
abuses at day-trading firms, filed an administrative complaint
against Landmark last Thursday alleging ``numerous violations'' of
state securities laws. Landmark would be shut down in Boston if it
fails to disprove the allegations at a yet-to-be-scheduled
administrative hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of Landmark's day-trading customers have now signed a
petition and have sent it to Galvin's office, asking that the
complaint be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely nothing wrong going on in this office,''
said Eric D'Orio, a 27-year-old Landmark customer who signed the
petition. ``If they close this place down, they're taking away my
livelihood. This is how I pay my bills. It infuriates me.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Galvin's office dismissed the petition as
irrelevant and said plans to close the firm will go forward. But
the dispute highlights a growing tension between regulators and
firms that cater to day traders.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading _ which gets its name from the practice of holding
stocks for less than a day _ has become big business across the
country. Firms such as Landmark have sprung up to cater to a
growing number of speculators who trade huge blocks of stock in
transactions that often last only seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated traders work in boutiques such as Landmark eight hours
a day, five days a week, often performing hundreds of trades a day
in pursuit of profits on miniscule movements in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators have warned the practice is little more than
gambling, and that most people don't make the kind of riches
sometimes claimed by the industry. Many inexperienced traders
hoping to tap a vein of stock-market riches have instead found
themselves buried in debt after months of nonstop trading,
regulators have said. Meanwhile, the firms collect large
commissions on the multitude of transactions, whether traders make
money or lose it.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's complaint, Galvin's office alleged Landmark
officials conducted improper loan schemes that funneled cash to
traders running low on funds, enabling them to continue trading and
generating commissions for the firm. The complaint also alleged
that some Landmark officials profited personally from the loans,
which charged ``usurious'' fees.
</P>
<P>
   While regulators have said day traders should be protected from
an industry that in some cases may be exploiting them, McCarthy
said: ``The traders don't want that protection. These guys are here
to to take a risk. It's not the government's business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they're happy with the treatment they get there,''
Galvin said in an interview after receiving the Landmark petition.
``But it's irrelevant. It doesn't mean they can get away with
violating securities laws. I'm sure there are people who get
usurious loans from loan sharks who are happy, too.''

TEAM MEETING TO DETERMINE SAMPRAS' STATUS ON US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The No. 3 player in the world still insisted Monday
that, barring a teammate's injury, he does not want to be the No. 1
or 2 singles player on the United States Davis Cup squad.
</P>
<P>
   But don't count on Wimbledon men's champion Pete Sampras being
out of that equation when the US lineup is announced by captain Tom
Gullikson before Friday's quarterfinal tie opening matches at
Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on the outcome of a team meeting later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Sampras, along with teammates Todd Martin, Jim Courier,
and Alex O'Brien, practiced for the first time as a unit at
Longwood and at nearby Pine Manor College and then, with the Davis
Cup as a prop, met the media at the Westin Copley Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was not a team member when the US defeated host Great
Britain, 3-2, in the first round in Birmingham, where three of the
four matches went to five sets, including the clincher by Courier
over Greg Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
   But his patriotic juices got to flowing afterward and Sampras
ended a two-year Davis Cup hiatus when he contacted Gullikson about
a doubles spot on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sensitive being a part of the team,'' Sampras said
Monday. ``What Jim and Todd did in England was an inspiration to
myself. I've had some conversations with Tom and Jim and Todd about
me playing just doubles here and they didn't have a problem with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the last thing I want to do is jump on the bandwagon. If
Todd or Jim got hurt, then I would play (singles). I think those
guys deserve to play singles and it's their show. I'm just happy to
be part of it. If we get through this tie and I show the commitment
by being here, then I'll play singles in our next round.''
</P>
<P>
   But could that part be expanded sooner than later?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, if that's what a team meeting produces later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete obviously just gave a pretty strong commentary on how he
kind of wanted to come on to the team and it's kind of amazing that
he could be so humble,'' said Gullikson. ``Circumstances do change
and what you heard from Pete was his honest opinion of how things
should work. It's something he truly believes, but unless the other
four guys physically throw him onto the court, I don't know if
he'll play singles here.''
</P>
<P>
   But picture the Red Sox having Ken Griffey in their lineup and
using him as a late-inning defensive replacement. That was a
parallel scenario offered to Gullikson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not going to force him (Sampras) to play
(singles),'' added Gullikson. ``We're going to have a team
discussion very shortly about the whole thing and just get all the
opinions out on the table. I'm just happy he's back on the team and
where it goes from there, who knows? I'm glad he had a change of
heart and wants to be a part of it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Martin said: ``I've told Tom that I think we should
have our best team out on the court. If I'm not part of that,
that's fine with me. But if Tom feels I should be on the court, I'd
like to be on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier, whose game has been jump-started since last fall,
thanks in large part to improved health, said the team discussion
will be held ``in the next few days. We'll sort that out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to put a competitive team on the playing field and
I think whichever way we go, we'll have a competitive team,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made it very clear to Pete that once you're on the team,
you're on the team . . . We wanted him on the team and there's no
reason for any awkward feelings. It's time to go out and win three
matches before the Australians do, and that's a simple concept.''

MALAYSIA OPENS CYBERJAYA, ITS HIGH-TECH CITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Japan, Calif.)   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CYBERJAYA, Malaysia _ When 25 senior executives from technology
companies around the world gathered here last week to tour
Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor project, it had all the
appearance of a somewhat dutiful pep rally for a
technology-friendly Southeast Asian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, however, was far from routine _ either in its lush
tropical setting or in the object of the corporate kudos: Mahathir
Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, the prime minister of Malaysia, has been engaged in
the fight of his life over the last year. As the Asian economic
crisis tore through this normally tranquil country, Mahathir, 73,
imposed widely criticized controls on Malaysia's capital markets,
vilified foreigners for causing Asia's misery, and imprisoned his
popular former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here feared that the furor would doom Mahathir's
ambitious vision to make Malaysia the technology lodestar of Asia.
The prime minister's actions baffled some members of the panel of
foreign executives that advises him on his flagship project, the
Multimedia Super Corridor, a project that was begun in 1996,
officially opened last Thursday and is expected to take two decades
to complete.
</P>
<P>
   If the three-day meeting to mark the opening did not quite
dispel those fears, it provided a much-needed psychic boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleasantly surprised by the amount of progress,
frankly, that has been achieved,'' said Lewis Platt, the chairman
of Hewlett-Packard and one of the executives on the advisory panel.
Platt said he had heard a stream of bad news about Malaysia and the
Super Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's grand plan to carve an Asian Silicon Valley out of
vast palm-oil plantations here is not dead _ though it is not
thriving either. While Malaysia has signed up 228 companies to
invest in the Super Corridor, only nine have moved into the
270-square-mile swath of land between Kuala Lumpur and its
futuristic airport. Just one, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen,
is American.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the upbeat remarks of Platt and other executives, most
major foreign companies are still guarded about their commitments.
The slow pace of investment has forced Malaysia to roll back its
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you plan for X number of dollars, and your economy
suddenly shrinks by 6 percent, you have to scale things back,''
said Mohamed Arif Nun, the head of operations at the Multimedia
Development Corp., which runs the venture. ``But it has not
destroyed the integrity of the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Malaysia has settled down a bit, Mahathir seems
determined to get things back on track.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony inaugurating Cyberjaya, the new city that will be
the heart of the Super Corridor, the prime minister reminded his
visitors that they had 12 months to move their operations into the
area _ or lose a package of tax exemptions and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of companies are here now. NTT, the Japanese telephone
giant, just opened a research center, while Alcatel, the French
telecommunications equipment maker, announced plans to open a
facility with 40 engineers. But the big American players _
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems among others _
have yet to break ground or even rent office space.
</P>
<P>
   Jaya is a Malay word meaning success, and Cyberjaya's planners
confidently predict that it will someday be home to 240,000 people.
For now, it feels like an ultra-modern ghost town. Roads and
bridges crisscross land that used to be covered by palm trees,
while fiberoptic cable snakes underground.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a new Multimedia University to serve,
Stanford-style, as an academic hothouse for the community. The
school, which opened in May, has 2,600 students and will eventually
enroll 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Executives here acknowledged that last year's spate of troubles
made the Multimedia Super Corridor a tough sell. Zasmida Abu Samah,
the manager of sales and marketing for Cyberjaya's real estate
developer, said it was difficult to lure new tenants between
January 1998 and last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was very hard,'' she said. ``After January 1998, it
was dead silence. We couldn't get people to call us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zasmida said companies began expressing interest again after
Malaysia was host for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum last November. Although the summit was
rocked by a speech in which Vice President Al Gore rebuked Malaysia
for its suppression of freedoms, it did not degenerate into violent
street protests, as some predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political situation is something we pay close attention
to,'' said Frank Smith, a partner at Ernst &AMP; Young in Singapore.
``But it hasn't been a particularly destabilizing influence on our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young, the accounting and consulting firm, had proposed
to build a regional technology center in Cyberjaya. Although it is
revising the plan, Smith said it still planned to move operations
here. ``We just didn't do it as fast as we planned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's decision to impose controls on Malaysia's capital
markets last fall was a bigger cause for concern. The move, which
he said was necessary to stabilize Malaysia's currency, the
ringgit, drew harsh criticism. The prime minister aggravated
matters with outbursts against foreign currency traders.
</P>
<P>
   During talks with the executives, Mahathir was questioned about
the policy, according to a panel member. ``He said, `all we did was
fix the currency.''' said this person, who spoke on condition that
he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Malaysia can lay all fears to rest, it still faces
formidable rivals. Singapore and Hong Kong are both building
multi-billion-dollar technology parks _ seizing on high-technology
as a ticket out of their own doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hedging its bets, the Multimedia Development Corp.
announced plans to build a film studio and theme park in Cyberjaya
_ marrying Silicon Valley with Hollywood, according to its
proponents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the visitors said the all-encompassing nature of the
Multimedia Super Corridor could give it an edge. With plans for
schools, apartments, even golf courses, Cyberjaya is no mere office
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these other countries are building technology parks to
incubate small companies, which is fine,'' said John Gage, the
chief researcher at Sun Microsystems. ``But Malaysia thinks very,
very differently.''
</P>
<P>
   As he puts a tumultuous year behind him, Mahathir must now hope
that the world will come to share his vaulting vision.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' three-year-old Senior Pharmacy Program,
which the Legislature currently wants to expand, was beset with low
enrollment and excessive management costs during its first 18
months of operation, state auditor A. Joseph DeNucci said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, auditors said, is that the state did not
try hard enough to sign up eligible seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also noted that state officials wildly overestimated
the number of elders Senior Pharmacy could enroll, but spent almost
as much money administering the program as if their projections had
been met.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1997, the program's administrative costs were
$928,313, or 83 percent of its budgeted volume, although the number
of applicants was only 13 percent of the budgeted figure.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pharmacy is at the center of a current legislative debate
over how to help elders pay the spiraling costs of prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee is negotiating over budget
bills that would open Senior Pharmacy to a greater number of elders
and increase its benefits. Last week Gov. Paul Cellucci proposed to
replace it with a state-subsidized pharmacy insurance plan
available to all Bay State elders.
</P>
<P>
   State auditors found that the Senior Pharmacy program, designed
in 1996 to help low-income elders pay for prescription drugs, spent
only $9.1 million in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, even though the
Legislature authorized $30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 27 percent of the program's expenditures were for
administrative costs. The contractor hired to process Senior
Pharmacy applications, for instance, spent $18 per application in
fiscal 1997, instead of the $3.27 agreed upon in the agency's
contract with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors faulted administrators for not making low-income elders
aware of the program. Senior Pharmacy is currently designed for
those with yearly incomes under $12,360 ($16,590 for a couple). In
addition, administrators did not set target enrollment numbers and
hold contractors accountable for meeting goals, the 22-page audit
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors found a $16,442 mathematical error in state payments to
West Suburban Elder Services, Inc., a nonprofit agency hired to do
Senior Pharmacy enrollment. They also criticized administrators for
granting no-bid contracts totalling $52,445.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson here is that we all have to be realistic about what
can we do that will help people and attract people,'' said Glenn
Briere, a spokesman for DeNucci. ``This just shows that there were
mistakes made in the past that we should learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere added that the audit report is ``not saying that the
state is not able to run this kind of program.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci administration officials defended their management of
Senior Pharmacy, pointing out that the number of elders benefitting
from the program has climbed to nearly 30,000 from the
disappointing first-year enrollment of 16,500. Initially, officials
projected that 60,000 low-income elders would sign up, but they
currently estimate that about 48,000 individuals are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enrollment growth, the Senior Pharmacy program spent
only $13 million of its $30 million appropriation in fiscal 1999,
which ended July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is not perfect,'' said Derrek Shulman, a spokesman
for the Executive Office of Elder Affairs, which runs Senior
Pharmacy. ``But any program that starts from scratch as this one
did has problems. We're very proud of how the program is doing and
how it's grown.''
</P>
<P>
   If no changes are made in Senior Pharmacy, state officials
currently project it will enroll about 33,000 elders within the
next year and expend $14.7 million. The program's costs are paid by
an increase in the state cigarette tax earmarked in 1996 for
children's health insurance and Senior Pharmacy.

IBM TO ACQUIRE SEQUENT COMPUTER SYSTEMS
</HEADLINE>
   (md) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sixteen years ago, 18 engineers and executives left
Intel Corp. to create a new company and a new kind of computer that
would tie together multiple microprocessors, the brains of personal
computers, to achieve power that rivaled conventional minicomputers
and mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   The technology worked, but the company, Sequent Computer
Systems, never really achieved critical mass. On Monday, Sequent
agreed to be acquired by International Business Machines Corp. for
$810 million, or $18 a share in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Sequent will become a subsidiary of IBM, and Sequent's
technology, which allows hundreds of processors to act as one large
computer, will be folded into IBM's server computers, including the
RS 6000 and Netfinity lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sequent shares had traded up in recent weeks as news of the
pending deal leaked, but they closed Monday at $17.281, down .156
cents, in Nasdaq trading. IBM shares closed at 137.8125, up 43.75
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Sequent shares had traded as
low at $5.68 in the past 52 weeks as the company's earnings
disappointed Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal was an appropriate exit strategy for
Sequent, which despite market-leading technology has struggled to
close sales in competition with far larger rivals. With 1998 sales
of $784.2 million, and 1999 revenue projections not a great deal
higher, Sequent found the $1 billion mark an elusive goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably good for both sides,'' said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``Many of us thought
this would have made sense a couple of years ago, but IBM probably
had to get over a bit of not-invented-here attitude. They need a
high-end Intel-based server.''
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, which had earlier partnered with Sequent to create a
new version of the Unix operating system, the acquisition adds to
an already strong selection of high-powered servers. Sequent
frequently won sales bids against Digital Equipment Corp. and
Tandem Computer Corp., both now part of Compaq Computer Corp., as
well as the Hewlett-Packard Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc., all of
which are IBM's major rivals in the server market.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Sequent, the merger addresses the major issues we faced:
size, reach and software availability,'' Casey Powell, Sequent's
founder, chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone
conference call. ``It's been a particular disadvantage to us, a
company that has not yet reached $1 billion in revenues, as we
compete on a daily basis with companies of $40 billion to $50
billion in sales. Now we are part of the largest computer company
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell will report to Robert M.Stephenson, IBM's senior vice
president and group executive for servers. Stephenson said IBM
would both sell Sequent machines, and fold Sequent's technology,
NUMA, for nonuniform memory access, into its own servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, customers want servers that can scale quickly to
manage unpredictable workloads or spikes in online traffic,'' he
said. ``NUMA is an elegant solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sequent has more than 2,500 employees worldwide with 56 sales
offices in North America, Europe and Asia. No layoffs are planned,
and Stephenson said IBM would add more salespeople to its server
group.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER SLOWS PRODUCTION OF JEEPS  
</HEADLINE>
 (md) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ DaimlerChrysler AG is slowing production of the Jeep
Grand Cherokee, a sign that sales of sport utility vehicles may be
growing a little less quickly.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said Monday that it would eliminate overtime and
shorten shifts at the end of this week at its huge Jefferson North
assembly plant in Detroit. The factory, the sole source of the
Grand Cherokee, will start producing the vehicles at a rate of
294,000 a year, down from a previous annual rate of 354,000, said
Daniel Moore, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the Grand Cherokee, which was redesigned for the
current model year, were up 9 percent last month from a year
earlier, and were up 11 percent in the first half of this year from
the same period last year. But the sales still have not met the
company's optimistic forecasts, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall sales of sport utility vehicles grew 4.2 percent in June
from a year earlier, a strong pace but less brisk than the
segment's 12.3 percent growth rate since the current model year
began last October, according to Morgan &AMP; Co. Inc., a consulting
company in West Olive.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry officials say that they are not worried. Auto
makers were offering unusually generous discounts a year ago, which
inflated sales in June, 1998, and make the sales since then look
less robust by comparison, said George Pipas, a market analyst at
the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles ``are still outperforming the industry,
and I would expect them to continue to outperform,'' Pipas said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson North factory will continue to run around the
clock, although with more time for maintenance between shifts. The
three daily shifts will now last seven hours each, with an hour for
maintenance between each shift, Moore said. The shifts have been
lasting seven hours and 48 minutes each; the slower pace of
production was first reported over the weekend by The Detroit Free
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit auto makers are facing much more competition from
foreign rivals, particularly car-like sport utility vehicles being
shipped here from Japan. According to Ward's Automotive Reports, a
weekly trade journal, sport utility vehicle sales by Ford,
DaimlerChrysler and General Motors only rose 1.4 percent in June
from a year earlier, while foreign auto makers' sales of the
vehicles climbed 23.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee faces some of the toughest competition,
from such models as the Lexus RX300, which is based on the Toyota
Camry's design.
</P>
<P>
   John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that the
market had changed since DaimlerChrysler decided three years ago to
increase capacity for the new Grand Cherokee. ``There are simply
more alternatives for the consumer today than there were when they
decided on the capacity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles have faced particularly strong criticism
this summer, with President Clinton calling for tighter limits on
their smog-causing emissions and with environmental groups
demonstrating in large cities to demand tighter regulations. But
Casesa said that it was unclear whether this had affected sales.

TRAPPED AT SOUTH POLE, DOCTOR BECOMES A PATIENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter temperatures at the Scott-Amundsen research station at
the South Pole average 80 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is
pitch dark nearly 24 hours a day. People who sign on to work there
understand that they will not see home for a long time: from
February to October, planes cannot even land.
</P>
<P>
   But an Air Force jet came close on Sunday, dipping low over the
base at 2 a.m. to drop medical supplies for a woman, trapped there
for the winter, who had discovered a lump in her breast and needed
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Her plight turns out to be even more complex than initial
reports suggested. The woman herself is the only medical doctor at
the station, according to a cancer expert who was consulted in her
case and who spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the patient must act as her own doctor, performing a
biopsy on herself and, if the lump is malignant, administering any
needed treatment, which might include chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   If she was to become incapacitated, that would leave the 40
other members of the research team without a doctor at the remote
Antarctic outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Erb, director of the Office of Polar Programs at the
National Science Foundation, which runs the base, declined to
identify the woman or say whether she was the station's doctor. Erb
said that although cancer experts in the United States had made a
``working diagnosis,'' the foundation was honoring the woman's
request for confidentiality, and would not reveal whether or not
she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hanson, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said that despite
the need to protect the patient's privacy, officials did not think
that the Air Force medical-drop mission itself could or should be
kept secret from the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to get out sooner or later, so it seemed
appropriate to explain as much as we could as soon as we could,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb also said that it was adequate to have one doctor at an
Antarctic station, backed up by people who had trained as
paramedics, along with computer, video and telephone links to
medical centers when needed. In addition, he said, people who sign
up for extended stays at the South Pole are carefully screened for
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone there is sufficiently fit that he or she is carrying
out assigned duties without any problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanson said that the woman, who is 47, had been working at
the station since December and had discovered the lump in her
breast in June. The foundation sought advice on her behalf from
doctors at the National Cancer Institute and other cancer centers.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation said in a news release, ``the patient and her
physicians decided on a course of drug treatment that they consider
appropriate to maintain her health and safety.'' But the release
did not specify what the treatment would be. Erb said that the
drugs sent in included several different treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   He said said that the jet zoomed in low over the base and
dropped the equipment from an altitude of about 700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never landed a plane at the South Pole in midwinter,''
Ms. Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb said that the equipment included a digital microscope and an
ultrasound machine, which can be used to measure the size of tumors
and to guide a doctor doing a biopsy. But, he said, ``The
preliminary report is that the ultrasound machine did not survive
the drop.'' He also said that it took time to retrieve and open all
the packages that had been dropped, and because satellite
communication with the base is possible for only a few hours a day,
he did not yet know about the condition of the other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant on the case said he thought the doctor would be
performing her own biopsy. Although the thought of driving a needle
into one's own breast to look for cancer cells might horrify most
people, he said, ``I would assume that somebody who chooses to go
to the South Pole is a tough person, a strong character. It
wouldn't shock me that somebody could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without ultrasound, video conferencing with an ordinary
camera, he said, might allow a radiologist to ``walk her through''
the procedure. She would then have to make microscope slides out of
the cells from the biopsy and stain them so that the slides could
be examined for cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   The digital microscope would allow the microscopic images to be
transmitted for diagnosis to a pathologist anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If cancer were found, chemotherapy could be started, and the
patient could have surgery later, after leaving the South Pole.
Although most women who need chemotherapy for breast cancer have
surgery first, studies have shown that giving chemotherapy first
and surgery later can work just as well, said Dr. Larry Norton,
head of the division of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer, who was not a consultant on the South Pole case.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor would need other drugs to treat chemotherapy's
side effects, including medication for nausea and, possibly,
antibiotics to take care of infections that might set in from the
tendency of chemotherapy to lower the counts of infection-fighting
white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, the consultant said, is that if the cells were
malignant, and if proper staining materials had been sent to the
base, it might be possible for the doctor to test her own cancer
cells for sensitivity to the naturally occurring hormone estrogen.
And if their growth was stimulated by estrogen, the doctor could be
given hormonal therapy instead of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The hormonal therapy would include the drug tamoxifen, to block
estrogen's effects. He said the hormonal approach would have milder
side effects than chemotherapy and could slow the growth of the
tumor until the patient could be flown out of the South Pole in
late October or early November.

BOOKING THROUGH THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 18)

<P>
   If you know where you are going and where you want to stay, you
don't need anything more technologically advanced than a hotel's
800 number. If you are more flexible, or less certain, you may be
able to save some money by booking through the Web. There are
almost as many approaches as there are destinations, and this
column touches on just a few. There are still kinks to be worked
out: While airlines and hotels are bracing for electronic bookings,
they are still the exception. Only about 3 percent of independent
travel arrangements are expected to be made online this year,
according to a report issued in May by Jupiter Communications, a
new-media research company based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With Priceline's service, as almost everybody knows from the
commercials with William Shatner, you enter the price you want to
pay for a room and, if the hotel accepts it, your stay is reserved.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline says it will get back to you within an hour, and if
the accommodations meet your price and date requests, your credit
card is charged immediately. Priceline's Web page guarantees ``that
you'll always stay in a well known, name-brand hotel,'' but there's
a major caveat: You have no choice of hotel (beyond specifying
location and a quality rating of one to five stars) and
reservations cannot be changed or canceled (though the company says
it will try to intervene with the hotel on behalf of the customer
in case of an emergency).
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, the price you propose has to be reasonable, and
Priceline provides a guide giving the usual range of hotel prices
in the destination you choose (1,100 cities, towns and resorts, all
in the United States). There is no point in offering a dollar or
two for a room, and it is certainly not worth the trouble offering
a few dollars less than you would pay if you called the hotel
directly.
</P>
<P>
   Another service, Travelscape.com, offers hotel accommodations in
about 80 cities, mostly in the United States but also in Mexico and
the Bahamas, as well as air and hotel packages. There is no
bidding, but the site guarantees that the rates offered are the
lowest available for the 500 hotels in its system. Travelscape.com
will add another 700 hotels in the next three to four months,
according to Michael Reichartz, a Travelscape.com vice president.
The mix includes a wide variety of both independent establishments
and members of chains, at a range of discounts. ``If there is a
lower rate found for the same dates and hotel booked,
Travelscape.com will refund the difference immediately,'' the site
says. With limitations, the reservations can be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   There are innumerable other services with hotel information and
bookings. They include Travelnow, The Hotel Guide and
Informedtourist.com which links to other booking sites. If you have
a favorite chain of hotels, odds are you can type its name in the
form ``www.nameofchain.com'' and connect to its Web site. I tried
that with Hyatt, Marriott and Ramada, and they all worked.

AVOIDING LONG LINES IN ITALY  
 VANCOUVER FERRY SERVICE  
 REDUCED-PRICE TICKETS IN PARIS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. I will be visiting Rome and Florence and would like some
advice on how to avoid long museum lines. _ Herbert Kelley,
Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. Waiting as long as three hours under the blistering sun (or
pouring rain, for that matter) can be a maddening part of visiting
Italian museums, especially in the busy summer months. But with the
introduction of two reservation services within the past year, it
is now possible to get around the long lines at many museums (but
not, alas, at the Vatican museums).
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, the Phone Reservation and Information Service, (39-06)
328101, allows one to buy tickets to the Borghese Gallery, the
Palazzo Barberini National Gallery of Classical Art, the
archeological site at Ostia Antica, the Spada Gallery, the Corsini
Gallery and the principal monuments in Ravenna and Ferrara. In the
case of the Borghese Gallery and the Palazzo Barberini, the tickets
will be marked with a set time to visit. You can also use the
service to book tickets to the nightly music and dance performances
held at the amphitheater in Ostia Antica.
</P>
<P>
   The service costs about $1 plus the cost of the museum ticket
(between $4.25 and $5.25). Tickets to the Borghese and Barberini
galleries must be picked up at least one hour before the time given
on the ticket; other museum tickets can be picked up at the box
office any time on the booked day. The service operates Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Florence, Firenze Musei, (39-05) 5294883, offers a similar
service for the Uffizi Galleries, the Academy Gallery, the Boboli
Gardens, Vasari's Corridor, which links the Palazzo Vecchio to the
Pitti Palace, the Archeological Museum, the Convent and Museum of
St. Mark, the Bargello Museum, the Semiprecious Stone Workshop, the
Medici Chapels and the Pitti Palace's Silver Museum, Palatina
Gallery and the Gallery of Modern Art. The booking service is
available from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday to Friday and from
8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Saturday. There is a $1 fee for the
tickets, which can vary from around $2 to $6.50. Set times are
given for all the museums and tickets can be picked up at the
museum's ticket office 15 to 20 minutes before that time.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is Select Italy, a tour operator based in
Wilmette, Ill., and Venice. It offers similar reservation services
at www.selectitaly.com or by calling (847) 853-1661. For example,
the Pitti Palace Pass, valid for the Galleria Palatina, the Museo
deglia Argenti and Boboli Gardens, all in Florence, costs $39.
Reservations for single museums, such as the Borghese Gallery and
the Galleria degli Uffizi are also available, with a $15 service
fee.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to see Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper,''
which has been under restoration for more than 20 years, a
reservation is required. Groups of 25 people are admitted into the
refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie at 15-minute intervals (if
you want to stay longer than 15 minutes you have to pay for another
ticket). Admission is $6.50 plus a $1 booking fee and can be
reserved from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. by calling (39-02) 89 42 11 46.

   Vancouver's Fast Ferry
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there high-speed ferry service between Vancouver and
Vancouver Island? _ Leonard Bohman, Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Beginning this month, there is such service. BC Ferries'
PacifiCat Explorer, a high-speed catamaran, began operating between
Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Departure Bay in Nanaimo on
Vancouver Island on July 1. The voyage takes an hour and 10 minutes
_ 25 minutes faster than the ride on BC Ferries' other vessels on
that route.
</P>
<P>
   The new catamaran accommodates up to 1,000 passengers and 240
vehicles and travels at speeds of up to 42 mph.

   Cheap Tickets in Paris
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a way to obtain reduced-price tickets to
performances in Paris? _Joanne Olson, Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, at least to some performances. A Paris business called
Le Kiosque Theatre sells tickets at a substantial savings.
Apparently, the two dark red and green kiosks _ one near the Place
de la Madeleine subway station on the west side of the Madeleine
church, the other in front of the main entrance to the Montparnasse
station on Place Raoul Dautry _ are something of a French secret. A
spokeswoman said that only about 5 percent of their tickets are
sold to foreigners. (The clerks, by the way, do speak English.)
</P>
<P>
   Tickets must be purchased on the day of performance. Among the
offerings this summer are: Offenbach's ``Monsieur Choufleuri'' and
``Les Dames des Halles'' at the Theatre Silvia Monfort (tickets
cost $15, compared to $25 at the box office; ``La Folie
d'Isabelle,'' a Comedia del Arte classic performed by the Mysteres
Bouffes company at the Arenes de Montmartre ($8 instead of $11);
and concerts at the Sainte Chapelle on the Ile de Cite ($14 instead
of $23).
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to performances at Paris' principal opera houses _ the
Garnier and the Bastille _ are not sold at the kiosks, although
reduced admission for students, people under 26 or over 60 are
offered at the operas' box offices on the day of performance.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks are open Tuesday to Saturday, 12:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
and Sundays from 12:30 to 4 p.m. (closed on Sundays during July and
August). No telephone inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   If you're visiting Paris next year, a ticket to a Thursday
performance at four Paris national theaters _ the Comedie
Francaise, l'Odeon, Le Theatre de Chaillot and Le Theatre de la
Colline _ will cost only $7.75 (instead of $23 to $62).

ARGENTINE STOCK PRICES TUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The Argentine stock market suffered
its worst session in seven months on Monday, falling 7.7 percent on
concerns that the government deficit is widening and a year-old
recession is deepening.
</P>
<P>
   The broad drop came on the heels of a 4.4 percent decline of the
main stock index on Thursday, the last day of trading before
Friday's Independence Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock tumble in what was until recently a favorite emerging
market contributed to a selling mood that pulled down stock prices
across Latin America; Brazil's market fell nearly 3 percent and
Mexico's market shed 1.5 percent. The slide in Argentina also
elicited concerns on Wall Street of more potential weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina faces severe challenges as it tries to deal with a
strengthening U.S. dollar, weak agricultural commodity prices and
stagnant global export markets,'' wrote David Malpass, senior
economist at Bear Stearns, in a report Monday. Malpass attributed
the sliding stock prices to ``shortfalls in tax revenues during the
recession and concerns over Congressional inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the health of the Argentine economy have grown
since the government revised its economic data a month ago. The
decline in first-quarter output was recalculated, from 2.8 percent
to 3 percent. At the start of the year, the government projected
that the economy would grow this year, but economists now estimate
that the contraction could be as steep as 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp devaluation of the Brazilian real in January has made
Argentine exports increasingly uncompetitive with the country's
largest trading partner, particularly hurting the automotive and
steel industries.
</P>
<P>
   With tax receipts falling sharply, the government has also been
forced to raise the yearly fiscal deficit to $5.1 billion _ nearly
double the number first targeted in negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   And unemployment is expected to climb to at least 15 percent in
the next few weeks, almost 3 points higher than last October.
Private forecasters in Argentina have estimated that industrial
production has fallen nearly 13 percent in the last year _ well
above government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing impression among investors that President
Carlos Saul Menem is losing his influence in his final months in
office. Last week, he and his congressional supporters were forced
to back down on a new vehicle tax to pay teacher raises when tens
of thousands of truck drivers went on strike across the country.
The retreat suggested to some analysts that the government would
back down on needed tax measures under pressure from other interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading presidential candidates have also contributed to
the market's anxiety because they have failed to declare their
economic policies. And both Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo Duhalde, the
candidate of the ruling Justicialist party, and Buenos Aires Mayor
Fernando de la Rua, of the opposition Alianza party, hurt investor
confidence in recent weeks when they suggested that Argentina will
need some kind of relief from payments on its $130 billion foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, Duhalde said he would seek support from Pope
John Paul II for a debt moratorium for struggle countries like
Argentina.

BRAZIL PROPOSES $700 MILLION IN INCENTIVES FOR FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Ford Motor Co. may receive an incentives
package from the government of more than $700 million to install a
car factory in Brazil's impoverished Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed package, reported in Brazilian newspapers Monday,
has created a political controversy over the use of public funds to
spur job creation in some regions over others.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the package, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is
expected to issue a decree in coming days providing Ford with
federal financing and other incentives such as tax breaks. In
return, Ford has agreed to invest an estimated $1.3 billion to
build a state-of-the-art compact car plant in the relatively poor
state of Bahia, creating 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials and Cardoso's office had no comment on the
reported incentives package.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the effort to lure Ford to the northeast region
of Brazil would be a victory for Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the
powerful senator from Bahia who is considered the glue that holds
Cardoso's fragile coalition together in Brasilia. Meanwhile,
leading members of the president's own Social Democrat party in the
industrialized south have criticized what they perceive as neglect
on Cardosos part.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unfair competition from a federalist point of view,''
Gov. Mario Covas of Sao Paulo told reporters here. Similar comments
from Covas and others have recently plagued the Cardoso
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some local news reports cited the possibility of problems with
Argentina and the World Trade Organization if the incentives
granted to Ford are considered too wide-reaching. Yet the
controversy so far seems more related to domestic politics than
international trade differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned but not extremely worried,'' said a senior
diplomat at the Argentine Embassy in Brasilia. ``Brazil is our
largest trading partner and we have mechanisms to resolve these
problems amicably.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford had originally hoped to build the factory in the southern
state of Rio Grande do Sul but abandoned those plans after a
financing dispute with local socialist officials.

CLUES TO THE STIFF SENTENCE FOR WHISTLEBLOWER IN ARCHER DANIELS
CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a federal judge in Chicago handed down prison terms last
week for three former executives of Archer Daniels Midland Co. who
were convicted of fixing prices, she added a final twist to a
bizarre case: the stiffest sentence went to the informant who first
alerted the government to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   How could that be?
</P>
<P>
   In part, the outcome stems from the complex workings of the
federal sentencing guidelines, which use a complex formula for
determining ranges for prison terms for each defendant. In this
case, that formula did not work to the best interest of the
informant, Mark Whitacre.
</P>
<P>
   But it also is partly the result of one finding by Judge Blanche
Manning during the sentencing hearing that has left legal experts
perplexed. She determined that Whitacre was a manager of the
conspiracy _ and thus liable to heavier penalties _ even though he
was outranked by at least one of his co-defendants, whom she found
to have no managerial role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how it's possible,'' said John C. Coffee
Jr., a professor at Columbia University Law School. ``I'm just
trying to think of any shred of an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts said that the outcomes in the Archer Daniels
case underscored how the sentencing guidelines _ so often
criticized by judges as a straitjacket binding them to particular
outcomes _ can, in certain cases, be about as restrictive as a
sport coat.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, the judge sentenced two executives, Michael Andreas
and Terrance Wilson, to the same sentence: two years in prison and
a $350,000 fine. Andreas, the company's former vice chairman, and
Wilson, the former head of corn processing, were chief targets of
the criminal investigation almost from its opening days in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Whitacre was sentenced to two and a half years in prison even
though, just a few months after the price-fixing conspiracy began,
he brought the matter to the attention of the government. For years
afterward, he worked as a government informant in the case,
secretly tape-recording his colleagues and competitors as they met
to fix prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitacre brought many of his troubles on himself. Soon after
raids on Archer Daniels in 1995, Whitacre was discredited as a
witness and eventually lost his immunity from prosecution, when it
was disclosed that he had been illegally taking millions of dollars
from the company, even while working as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   That alone helped to account for some part of the odd outcome in
the price-fixing sentence. In 1997, Whitacre pleaded guilty to
fraud charges and was already serving a nine-year sentence. As a
result, under the sentencing guideline calculations, Whitacre would
be treated as a repeat offender _ a designation that automatically
pumps up the possible sentences under the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by ruling that Whitacre was a manager in the conspiracy,
while his co-defendants were not, the judge increased Whitacre's
``offense level'' to the highest of any of the executives.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stumped legal experts. ``She's taking a very, very
bizarre view of the word manager,'' said Gerald Lefcourt, a
prominent defense lawyer in New York City. ``The vice chairman is
at the higher level of the conspiracy. Not to give him a managerial
role and to give it to someone who carried out the price fixing is
pretty silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the case said that they could not explain the
ruling. But they pointed out that Whitacre's lawyer did not object
to his designation as a manager, while lawyers for both Andreas and
Wilson did.
</P>
<P>
   A clerk said that the judge would have no comment on her
sentencing but would be issuing a written opinion on the case in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   While that portion of the ruling struck legal experts as odd, in
the end it seemed to have made no difference to the actual time in
prison Whitacre will serve. Only 20 months of Whitacre's new
sentence will be on top of his current term, with the additional 10
months served concurrently. In other words, the amount of time he
will actually serve in prison for price fixing will be a few months
less than the sentence of Andreas or Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some legal experts worry about the message that that
future possible informants might take after seeing that Whitacre's
actual sentence was the longest of anyone's in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not have imagined a whistleblower, even this kind of
self-destructive, unreliable whistleblower, being turned on this
harshly by the government,'' said Coffee of Columbia. ``It doesn't
bode well for future whistleblowers.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors involved in the Archer Daniels case said that
Whitacre's case was so bizarre _ and his own decisions so unusual _
that they do not worry think it will have any effect on future
informants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a unique situation,'' said Scott Lassar, the U.S.
attorney in Chicago who was a prosecutor in the case. ``Since he
embezzled $9 million, and continued to embezzle while he was
cooperating, it is hard to compare him to any other informant.''

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE ADS FEATURING CONGRESSIONAL
SPOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Washington Talk column; ad text follows) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The commercials begin like ordinary 30-second
public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen is a familiar scene like a man and woman in an
office or people in a hurry on a busy sidewalk or a couple sitting
at the kitchen table. The actors begin talking to each other about
literacy or drugs or drunken driving or breast cancer. Or in some
cases an offstage narrator talks about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 seconds before the end of the commercial, an odd thing
happens. The wife of the local congressman or senator appears on
screen. ``Hello, I'm Simone-Marie Meeks,'' one wife says in a
typical example. ``My husband, Congressman Gregory Meeks, and I
urge you to read with your children. Because literacy is a gift for
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks is a Democrat from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the woman's face fades away and the narrator says, ``This
message brought to you by the National Association of
Broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   These ads, which start in more than 40 states this week, are a
sweet deal all around.
</P>
<P>
   For the television stations, it is an opportunity to give a nod
to public service and a chance to fill empty time for which they
have not sold advertisements. Because the wife and not the
politician is the one on the air, opposing views do not have to be
given equal time.
</P>
<P>
   For the politicians, generally eager to show off their families,
it is an effortless, risk-free way of keeping their names before
the public, a benefit not available to potential challengers.
</P>
<P>
   For the National Association of Broadcasters, one of the most
aggressive and influential trade associations, it is a quiet way of
further ingratiating themselves with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And finally the public will benefit if people see the
commercials and take the advice to heart.
</P>
<P>
   As the perks of incumbency go, this is small potatoes. It does
not rank, for example, with the benefits of having offices and a
large staff paid for by taxpayers, of being able to raise campaign
contributions relatively easily or postage-free franked mail.
</P>
<P>
   As political wheeling and dealing by a special interest, it does
not compare in importance with the large sums of unregulated money
that interest groups give to political parties. And it pales next
to the nearly $500,000 the political action committee of the
National Association of Broadcasters gave to congressional
candidates for the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   But many people here said it seemed just a little fishy. Andrew
Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a nonprofit
law firm that often challenges the broadcasters in court and in
lobbying battles, said the ads raised ``serious questions about
whether there are not ulterior motives that may not be more
important to the broadcasters than the stated objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Public service commercials serve a purpose when they are made by
recognizable public figures like actors or athletes who might
command attention, Schwartzman said. But he said he doubted that
the wives of politicians would have much positive effect.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters have a long legislative agenda. The main
legislation they want from Congress for this year would prohibit
satellite companies from carrying local, over-the-air broadcast
signals. The broadcasters also want measures to increase the number
of stations one company can own and block the expansion of
low-powered radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Bobeck, a spokesman for the broadcasters association,
said the organization had no ulterior motive in working with
congressional wives on public service advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no political agenda here,'' Bobeck said. ``The
individuals choose the issues themselves. Any spouse who wants to
participate can do so.''
</P>
<P>
   And wives who were interviewed said they were only trying to
promote good causes. Mrs. Meeks, for instance, made three
commercials _ on literacy, breast cancer and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't enjoy doing it at all,'' Mrs. Meeks said. ``It's just
my face on the screen and not my husband's, and it's not
particularly flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the issues she dealt with were ``especially
important to the people in the 6th Congressional District.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was a joint production of the broadcasters and the
Congressional Club, an organization of congressional spouses. The
wives of 20 senators and more than 60 congressmen agreed to make
commercials. So did a few of their children and the husband of one
congresswoman, Lino Lipinsky, whose wife, Rep. Diana DeGette, is a
Colorado Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The wives of Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and
liberals, freshmen and veterans are participating. The only pattern
seems to be that for some reason, few of the congressional
districts are in big cities. Mrs. Meeks was the only New Yorker who
took part.
</P>
<P>
   The spots were taped recently at a studio here arranged for by
the broadcasters' association and will be transmitted by satellite
to stations in the participants' districts and states beginning
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking part were offered 16 scripts to choose from. Some
of the other issues included drinking during pregnancy, drug abuse,
conflict resolution and the importance of completing school.
</P>
<P>
   Issues that are even remotely controversial like smoking, AIDS
and contraception were avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Bobeck, the broadcasters' spokesman, said similar projects had
been done in every odd-numbered year since 1985. He said the
commercials were not made in election years so ``it doesn't get
mixed up in campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people who have been around Washington and politics for
decades, like Schwartzman and David Cohen, the co-director of the
Advocacy Institute, said they had never heard of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose organization advises and trains people who lobby
for liberal causes and who has long criticized the perks of
incumbency, said it sounded to him like ``audio-visual franking.''

</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters has begun the
Congressional Family Public Service Announcement Project, a series
of commercials, of which this one on alcohol consumption and
pregnancy is representative:
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN The commercial begins with a tight shot of a glass
with a baby crying in the background. Ice cubes drop and liquor
pours into the glass. After the narrator begins speaking, the shot
widens to reveal that the glass is in fact a baby bottle.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT Narrator: You wouldn't dream of feeding your baby
alcohol. But if you're pregnant and you drink, so does your baby.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional family member: Hello I'm ---------. My husband,
Congressman --------- and I want you to have a healthy baby. If
you're pregnant, don't drink alcohol.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since a health care revolution
began moving patients into managed care more than a decade ago, the
Senate opened a high-stakes debate Monday over how to protect the
rights of patients and regulate the companies that provide health
insurance for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, is the first
of several politically potent health care issues _ such as an
overhaul of Medicare to include a new prescription drug benefit for
the elderly _ to come to the fore in Congress this session. It
would regulate health maintenance organizations and has broad
implications for doctors, insurance companies, employers and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With health care a steady voter concern, the legislation is also
considered so significant for next year's congressional campaigns
that Republicans and Democrats were going to unusual lengths Monday
to frame the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Each side brought in aggrieved citizens to support its version
of the bill. Republicans showcased small business owners who said
they could not afford health insurance for themselves and their
employees or could barely afford it. Democrats gave a platform to a
father who spoke of his son who died of cancer, and of an HMO that
he said refused to pay for a certain regime of cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And in a particularly convoluted procedural move, the
Republicans introduced the Democratic bill and the Democrats were
planning to try to amend it into the Republican version of the bill
as each side sought the best way to highlight its opponents' weak
points.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused the Democrats of crafting legislation that
would favor lawyers by expanding the right to sue. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, said the Democratic bill gives a patient the right to
``choose any lawyer that they could pick out of a phone book.
That's their idea of health care freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that the Republicans were protecting the
profits of health maintenance organizations. ``It is interesting to
hear HMOs and their allies in the Senate weeping crocodile tears
over the cost increases they claim our protections will cause,''
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., noting that the top 10 HMOs
in the country made $1.5 billion in profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheapest insurance policy is one that pays the fewest
benefits when you get sick,'' Kennedy said, ``and that seems to be
the goal of too many unscrupulous managed care companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As the four-day debate began, an array of powerful interest
groups, from the insurance industry to organized labor to the
American Medical Association, were also waging television and
newspaper advertising campaigns on both sides of the issue,
primarily in the states of swing Republicans, some of them up for
election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The war of the airwaves reflected the awareness that the health
insurance industry's ``Harry and Louise'' ad campaign helped sink
President Clinton's proposal for universal health care coverage in
1994 and that a multimillion dollar campaign by the tobacco
industry last year proved fatal to anti-smoking legislation by
reframing it as a tax increase for smokers instead of as a public
health issue.
</P>
<P>
   The health insurance industry announced a $10.5 million
television campaign, featuring doctors, designed to burnish the
image of managed care over the next year. The AFL-CIO put more than
$400,000 worth of ads on the air in eight states in favor of the
Democrats' bill. And a coalition of businesses and insurance
companies continued an advertising campaign that they said would
cost $1 million across two weeks, against the Democrats' bill.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how to regulate health maintenance organizations and
how to deal with patients' grievances, their ability to appeal the
decision of an HMO, their access to medical care and consumer
information. Both versions of the bill would give patients easier
access to emergency rooms, and specialists like obstetricians and
pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   But there are significant differences between the parties over
how aggressively the federal government should regulate a health
care industry increasingly dominated by managed care plans. ``This
is a difference in approach that we think is as profound as
anything that divides Republicans and Democrats,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill, in deference to the rights of states, would
in many cases extend its consumer protections only to 48 million
Americans whose insurance is regulated exclusively by the federal
government and not by the states. Its grievance procedures would
apply to a broader group of 120 million Americans. The Democrats,
in contrast, would cover all 161 million Americans with private
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would expand the rights of Americans to sue their
health plans in state court, but the Republicans would not.
Currently most Americans in managed care plans must bring suits
over coverage decisions in federal court, where a patient can
typically collect the value of the care denied but not punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and Democrats also differ over who decides
whether treatment is medically necessary, with Republicans allowing
insurance companies to make the final judgment and Democrats
granting that decision to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   With regulation of health maintenance organizations a
centerpiece of their legislative agenda, the Democrats for several
years have had the upper hand in this debate. It was their party
that forced the legislation to the floor by tying up the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and their industry allies Monday sought to turn
the debate away from the Democrats' preferred ground of patient
protection to the question of increased premium costs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their case, they put an early version of the
Democrats' measure on the Senate floor as the base bill for debate
instead of their own bill. The Congressional Budget Office had
found that that bill would have raised the costs of insurance
premiums by 6.1 percent. The Democrats subsequently altered their
bill so that it would raise premiums by 4.8 percent. The Republican
bill would raise premiums by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans repeatedly cited the earliest version of the
Democratic bill as they argued that the Democrats would force
people and small businesses to give up health insurance as too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrat bill is fatally flawed,'' said Senate
Majority Whip Don Nickles from Oklahoma, charging that it would
increase health care costs for a family insurance plan by $350.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would add 1.8 million people to the list of the
uninsured,'' he said, ``That is a serious mistake. We don't want to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The same theme was struck in the ads run by the coalition of
businesses and health insurers in several states represented by
Republican senators. One such 30-second spot featured three
Americans worried about losing their health insurance. ``I gotta
pay more for new government regulations?'' asked one indignant man.
``I can barely afford insurance now.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the Republicans were inflating the price
of their bill and overstating its effects on the ranks of the
uninsured. They said it would cost an individual an additional $2 a
month in premiums, or as Kennedy put it, ``the cost of a Big Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats sought to portray the Republican bill as
inadequate and their own bill as one that would protect patients
from insurance companies seeking to cut costs by providing inferior
care. ``Theirs is not a bill of rights,'' Daschle said. ``It's a
bill of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 55-45 hold over the Senate, the Republicans are likely to
prevail by week's end. But the days will bring a series of votes on
amendments that both sides want to use to highlight their
differences in the next election.

<P>
   Eager to assume more direct control over the future of its
assets on the Internet, Walt Disney Co. announced Monday that it
would create a single company combining the Infoseek search service
and portal with Disney's own Internet holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be known as Go.com, will merge Disney.com,
Disney's Club Blast, The Disney Store Online and other holdings
with Infoseek, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney already owns 42 percent of Infoseek. The deal, which had
been widely expected, is the company's attempt to create an entity
whose stock will provide Disney with a currency for additional
Internet acquisitions. It will also help attract Internet managers
who expect part of their compensation to come in the form of stock
options in an industry where share prices have soared over the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Infoseek are already working closely together, but a
dual management structure is viewed as unwieldy by many in the
industry. The company clearly hopes that creating a more
streamlined operation with its own shares will streamline both
management and dealmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, Disney will own 72 percent of the
new company, through a tracking stock, meaning that the assets
continue to be owned by Disney, but the share price effectively
tracks the performance of those assets. Infoseek shareholders will
own the balance, or 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, Infoseek shareholders will get
1.15 shares of the new company for each of their Infoseek shares.
Since Disney now owns 42 percent of Infoseek, 57 percent, or 35
million of its 62 million shares, are held by others. Those will
become 41 million shares in the new company, leaving roughly 145
million shares of the tracking stock outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Though Disney did not provide much financial data Monday, James
Preissler, an analyst at Paine Webber who follows Infoseek, said,
``If you are a believer in the synergy that Disney brings to the
story, from both a content standpoint as well as a distribution
standpoint, then the deal bolsters that strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street the initial impulse when the deal was announced
was to wonder whether it might fall apart if Infoseek shareholders
believed they were not being paid enough for their assets. There
was precedent for that concern since Lycos shareholders, angry that
USA Networks Inc. was not paying enough of a premium for Lycos,
blocked that merger earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek shareholders filed seven suits Monday in Delaware
Chancery Court over the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock rose 18.7 cents Monday to close at $27.81, while
Infoseek's shares dropped $5.56 to close at $45.93.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Preissler said he thought the deal was likely to go
ahead. ``It fairly values all the assets that are contributed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said the combined company was expected to have revenues
of $350 million, of which $150 million would come from traditional
sales from the Disney catalog. The balance will come from Internet
operations of the two companies, Disney said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when Disney made its initial investment in Infoseek,
Walt Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, talked about the advantages
of melding Infoseek's Internet capabilities with Disney's marketing
prowess. ``When all the technology is out there, it is the
entertainment value that attracts people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics wondered Monday whether Disney, already a mature
media company, could work well with the faster-moving Internet
operator. Disney's image, certain and safe, has no edge. John
Tinker, who follows Disney for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities,
said he saw the deal is a creative venture for Disney. But he views
the key challenge as Disney's ability to sublimate its traditional
image within Go.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has kind of an image of monitored, safe sex,'' he said.
``On the Internet everyone wants freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said the company was well aware that: ``You don't want
big corporate brother pushing you to a certain site,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are more subtle moves a marketing company might
make, Eisner continued, such as using jokes on the Go.Com home page
to liven it up a bit and differentiate it from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts agree that management would pose the most
immediate problem.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Motro, president and chief executive officer of Infoseek,
is leaving the company once the deal is completed. Steve Wadsworth,
president of Disney's Internet operations, is expected to take
over.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he faces a variety of problems at Go.com. Infoseek's
stock has not done as well in recent months as those of its
competitors, and though Go.com's customer base has increased, it is
not rising as fast as Yahoo's, for example. Moreover, the company
failed to meet analysts' first-quarter estimates.

THE WB BLEW IT IN DELAYING `BUFFY' FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WB missed a fabulous opportunity by postponing the season
finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like every ``Buffy'' episode, the delayed finale is dripping
with symbolism. Creator Joss Whedon delights in it, exploring teen
angst on two levels _ one achingly real for any viewer who can
remember the high school experience, the other really aching, but
only for the stunt people and anyone who gets too close to a stray
slayer kick. For the rest, it's a fantasy experience, save for the
inherent allegorical meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of otherworldly meanies do get whacked in the finale,
which airs Tuesday night. A few good guys, too. But violence, while
always a part of ``Buffy,'' is never the message. Tonight's lesson,
for instance, includes a subtle reminder on the importance of
inclusiveness and teamwork. And the marquee exercise _ no surprise
here _ involves the triumph of righteousness over cruelty, hatred
and fear, regardless of cost or loss.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice to hear this message on May 25, five
weeks after the horrible shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo. But the brass at The WB thought otherwise, fearing
the network would be viewed as insensitive if it aired the episode,
even though it was the second half of a two-part story that began
the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away too much detail, Tuesday night's episode is
a sort of Joan of Arc tale for the '90s, in which Buffy (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) leads students in an uprising against the city's
mayor, who chooses the graduation ceremony at Sunnydale High as the
springboard to his transformation into an enormous serpent bent on
world domination, or at least mastery of the greater Sunnydale
metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   The ridiculousness of it all suggests that The WB may be taking
itself too seriously, which is a dangerous development right there.
I mean, come on! The politician as disgusting reptile? How
subversive is that? Rather than questioning the network's motives,
we should be giving it an award for accuracy in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And The WB, last time I checked, is all about entertainment. It
doesn't even have a newsmagazine to blur the distinction between
entertainment and information. It exists solely to entertain and,
theoretically, make money for its investors.
</P>
<P>
   By taking the ``Buffy'' finale off the air in May, The WB played
right into the hands of those who want to blame television and the
movies for every act of violence that disrupts our lives. These
people never seem to suggest that the good kids of the world owe
their Eagle Scout behavior to ``Touched by an Angel'' or ``7th
Heaven,'' so the link they make between TV and violence strikes me
as a bit lame. Sure, there's stuff on TV I would never allow a
child to watch, but it usually involves babes in bikinis wielding
automatic weapons. Unfortunately, in the eyes of many who've never
even seen ``Buffy,'' The WB's executive order reduced one of the
best-written, best-acted shows on TV to the level of ``Acapulco
H.E.A.T.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the real shame.

 &HT;    School shooting suspect's hearing delayed
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The hearing to determine whether Heritage High School
shooting suspect Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon will stand trial as an
adult may begin about the time that his schoolmates are going back
to class.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rockdale Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider
agreed to postpone the hearing, which was supposed to begin this
morning, until early August. Solomon's attorneys asked for more
time for psychiatric tests on the 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the trial date back didn't sit well with Heritage High
Principal Lowell Biddy, who said he fears the hearing will dredge
up bad memories at a time when students should be focused on
academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is just so poor, especially for those students who
are involved,'' Biddy said. ``They should have considered what is
best for the majority of the kids. This will be such a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale students go back to school Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockdale school board Chairman Bill Malarney said the
judicial system can't work around schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to allow the judicial system to work, both for the
defense and the prosecutor,'' Malarney said. ``We should allow the
courts to do what they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Harris, a lawyer for the Atlanta firm representing Solomon,
said the teenager ``suffers from long-term, untreated and major
depression with psychotic features and has some degree of suicidal
tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read said he had wrapped up
interviews with witnesses last week and expects to call a few of
them at the hearing. Solomon is accused of shooting six of his
classmates on May 20 as they sat in the school's commons area
waiting for classes to begin. He faces 21 charges of aggravated
assault, cruelty to children and weapon possession. None of the
injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is the second since the shooting. Originally scheduled
for June 1, the hearing was continued to allow Solomon to undergo a
state-ordered psychiatric exam.
</P>
<P>
   If Solomon were convicted on all counts as a juvenile, he would
spend 18 months to five years in a youth development center. If
tried as an adult, he would face sentences totaling up to about 400
years, although some sentences might run concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff Wigington canceled his
participation in a summit this week on school violence in
Washington so he could attend the Solomon hearing. Representatives
from schools across the country that have been the site of
shootings, including Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
will meet through Thursday at the FBI's Center for Analysis of
Violent Crime in Leesburg, Va. They plan to profile the suspects
and determine similarities in their backgrounds, rampages and
motivation.

 &HT;    New Yorkers to get chance to love chicken chain
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Popeyes Chicken &AMP; Biscuits announced it is doubling
the chain's number of restaurants in New York City within the next
five years in three separate deals.
</P>
<P>
   Three franchisees will develop 21 new Popeyes restaurants in
Manhattan and Brooklyn. Currently, the chain has 19 restaurants in
the New York City market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance is that we've identified New York as a top
growth market,'' said spokesman Scott Hudler. 'We can use that
growth to develop in the outer communities. This is part of a
national effort to expand the Popeyes brand through franchising.''
</P>
<P>
   Popeyes, which offers a quick-service New Orleans-style chicken
concept, is a division of Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises. It also
operates Cajun Kitchen restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Popeyes has 1,325 units, of which 85 percent are franchises. In
1998, the division reported more than $982 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was recently awarded the the Restaurants and Institutions
Choice in Chains Gold Award for customer service.

TAIWAN DROPS `ONE-CHINA' STANCE, AND BEIJING IS FURIOUS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Taiwan has abandoned the political formula that has
long kept the peace with China, declaring Monday that it will no
longer adhere to the line that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan are
two parts of the same country. Beijing's response was immediate,
and furious.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a step away from the conceptual umbrella of eventual
reunification between China and Taiwan that has been a basic
condition of all talks between them, President Lee Teng-hui made a
risky move that badly soured Taiwan's relations with China and
could also worsen the strains in the already troubled ties between
China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades the artful political ambiguity known as the
``one China'' policy has held in check the potentially explosive
issue of the future of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties to the dispute formally agree that China and Taiwan
are part of one country _ separated by civil war 50 years ago _ and
almost all countries recognize Beijing as its legitimate capital.
But Beijing has never given up its vow to reunite Taiwan with the
mainland, by force if necessary, and the United States has pledged
to defend the island.
</P>
<P>
   So Beijing has tolerated Taiwan's de facto independence, as long
as the island never actually declares it and tries to rewrite the
delicate political formula.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, an unpredictable politician whose provocative steps in 1996
brought Taiwan to the brink of war with China and then delivered
him a resounding victory in a presidential election, did just that
over the weekend in an interview with the German radio station
Deutsche Welle.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Lee said, Taiwan will treat contacts with China as
``state-to-state'' relations. ``Under such special nation-to-nation
relations,'' he said, ``there is no longer any need to declare
Taiwanese independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's sudden turnaround on this diplomatically critical
terminology provoked muted response in Taiwan at first, as other
politicians debated what he meant while Lee himself maintained a
conspicuous silence.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday another senior Taiwanese official came forward to
clarify what Lee's remarks meant: that Taiwan would scrap the
`one-China' formula that has been used as a base for all
discussions with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new definition reflects our disappointment over the
Communists' `one-China' principle,'' said the official, Su Chi,
chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council. ``We think the
current abnormal relationship across the straits is the result of
the Chinese Communists refusing to face reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise shift outraged officials in Beijing, who accused
Lee of taking ``an extremely dangerous step'' and implied that they
could use force to prevent Taiwan from trying any new rhetorical
tricks on the touchy issue of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sternly warn Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities not to
underestimate the Chinese government's firm determination to uphold
national sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity,'' said Zhu
Bangzao, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ``Don't underestimate the
courage and force of the Chinese people to oppose separatism and
Taiwan independence.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no public indication for what prompted Lee's sudden
change, though the timing suggested an obvious possibility: local
politics. A presidential campaign is getting underway in Taiwan,
and the stance of Lee's Nationalist Party toward the mainland will
be a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Taiwan's main opposition party, the Democratic
Progressive Party, nominated former Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian as
its candidate to succeed Lee, whose term expires next year.
Nationalist Party supporters are expected to be split between Vice
President Lien Chan, supported by Lee, and a popular former
official, James Soong, who may defect to another party.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls in Taiwan reflect popular support for better ties
with the mainland, the Nationalist Party is eager to woo away some
supporters from the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors a
formal declaration of independence from China.
</P>
<P>
   hat single word, independence, lies at the crux of the
bickering between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan and China have acted separately and
independently of each other for 50 years, governments on each side
have until now accepted the premise that they are both parts of the
same country _ that Taiwan is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other countries, forced to choose whether to
recognize Beijing or Taipei as the legitimate representative of
China, have by now nearly all chosen Beijing, leaving Taiwan
diplomatically isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Washington switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
State Department spokesman James Foley said Monday that the
American policy of ``one China'' remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. position on Taiwan's future is also clear,'' Foley
said. ``We believe that it is a matter for the Chinese people, on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, to resolve. The United States has
an abiding interest and concern that any such resolution be a
peaceful one.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a State Department official said the administration was
``not consulted in advance'' on Lee's statement. The official said
the administration was still trying to find out from Taiwan
officials what Lee had said in his radio interview and ``what it
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's view is that Taiwan is temporarily under the
administration of another, while it awaits the forces of history to
push it to reunification with the mainland. As a result, Beijing
often seems obsessed with any hint that Taiwan will declare itself
independent in name, as well as in reality.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound bizarre to an outsider, but one of the meanest
insults a Chinese official can use against Lee is that he is a
``splitist,'' or someone who aims to split Taiwan away from China.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, while official bickering between China and
Taiwan has veered between a high pitch and low pitch, the flow of
money, people and culture across the Taiwan straits has boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese television programs are now regularly broadcast in the
mainland, since they are often of higher quality. Taiwanese
businessmen have invested more than $30 billion in mainland China,
and hundreds of thousands of them now live here.
</P>
<P>
   But popular indifference to the oratorical fighting between
Beijing and Taipei has not diluted the criticism that Beijing
continues to spew about Lee. Monday's excoriations in Beijing were
the harshest since 1996, when China was infuriated by Lee's
political maneuvering that led to a visit to the United States, the
first by a Taiwan president since Washington dropped diplomatic
recognition two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   China launched missiles into the ocean near Taiwan in an attempt
to intimidate voters just before the presidential election in
Taiwan. Instead, the panic gave Lee a decisive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Beijing has continued to denounce Lee, depicted in China's
media as a dishonest man who proclaims his interest in
reunification while he is really inching back toward an all-out
declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee's flagrant redefinition of cross-straits relations as
`state-to-state' relations exposed his political malice,'' said a
spokesman for the Communist Party's Taiwan Work Office, quoted in
Beijing newspapers Monday. ``Lee has been deceiving Taiwanese
compatriots and misleading people internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, said he was
shocked by Lee's remarks. Taiwan's new position, Wang suggested,
could make it impossible to continue the series of meetings between
representatives of Taipei and Beijing that have been underway
off-and-on since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This formulation means there is no basis for contact, exchange
or communication,'' said Wang in a dispatch by the New China News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is scheduled to visit Taiwan in October; he would be the
most senior mainland official to do so since the Nationalist Party
retreated to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait chimed in, too. He called Lee's
remarks ``a crude sabotage of the cross-straits relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Statesmen should keep their word, and their failure to keep
their promise will only cause disaster to the people of Taiwan,''
Tang said, the New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though officials in Beijing chose vitriol, they might have
pointed to the fine print of Taiwan's own Unification Guidelines,
adopted in 1991 to identify steps toward unification between Taiwan
and China. It calls for defining Taiwan's relations with China as
those between `equal political entities,' rather than
`state-to-state.'
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's terminology, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan official, Su, argued that the old formula was being
exploited by Beijing to undermine the legitimacy of the Nationalist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown our goodwill by calling ourselves a political
entity under a one-China policy,'' Su said. ``But the Chinese
Communists have used this policy to squeeze us internationally. We
feel there is no need to continue using the one-China term.''

MERRILL LYNCH PRESIDENT RESIGNS UNEXPECTEDLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Herbert Allison Jr., the president of Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., unexpectedly resigned Monday, extending a period of upheaval
at America's largest brokerage firm and leaving it without an heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Allison's departure, effective by the end of July, appears to be
fallout from the turmoil generated by rapid change at Merrill. The
firm has overhauled its core business of selling stocks to
investors to meet the challenge of Internet-based rivals. It has
also reshuffled the management of its money management and bond
divisions in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes bore the stamp of Allison, 55, widely viewed as a
brainy, detail-oriented No. 2 to David Komansky, Merrill's chairman
and chief executive. But the rapid pace of change made Allison the
target of critics within Merrill's executive ranks and soured his
chances of succeeding Komansky down the road, people who work at
the firm and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill called the departure a retirement and said that it came
at the behest of Allison, who informed Komansky of his decision
over the weekend. A spokesman for the firm said that Allison's
departure was not the result of an internal power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The firm said it had no immediate plans to name a successor. But
Komansky said in a statement that two senior executives, Stephen
Hammerman and John Steffens, both vice chairmen, will assume
increased management responsibilities. Half a dozen business
divisions that had reported to Allison will now report directly to
Komansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key strengths of Merrill Lynch is a depth of
management talent unmatched in our industry,'' Komansky said. ``The
seasoned executives leading our business and support groups have
the ability to lead our company, execute our strategy and produce
superior results.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill lost money in the fourth quarter of last year and has
acted aggressively to reshuffle managers and change strategies in
several core areas of its business since then. Its financial
performance so far this year has been solid, however, and Allison's
departure comes as Merrill prepares to announce strong quarterly
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect Merrill to announce second-quarter earnings
Tuesday of about 10 percent more than it did in the same period a
year ago, itself a robustly profitable quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Allison's departure came late in the day
Monday and had no noticeable impact on Merrill's stock, which rose
62.5 cents to $77.875.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, a 28-year Merrill veteran, took up the position of
president at the same time Komansky became chairman in December
1996. At the time, many at Merrill viewed them as an ideal team.
Komansky advanced through Merrill's core brokerage operation and is
viewed as gregarious, the public flag carrier for the firm. Allison
had a reputation as a number cruncher and a hands-on manager who
preferred to operate behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   The formula appeared to work well for a time. But the
relationship between the two men became strained after Merrill hit
a rough patch late last year amid a general slump in financial
markets, several people close to Merrill said. Allison stepped
forward at that time to attack what he perceived as weaknesses in
Merrill's huge bond division, laying off several thousand people
and prompting a stream of voluntary departures. Some outside
analysts later called Allison's moves an overreaction to a
temporary market downturn and blamed him for hurting morale.
</P>
<P>
   Allison has also taken some heat for the weak performance of
Merrill's mutual funds and for some expensive acquisitions Merrill
made abroad to bolster its money management operation, moves that
have dampened its earnings more than some analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Another big challenge came this year, when Allison pushed hard
to restructure Merrill's tradition-bound brokerage operation to
meet the challenge of the Internet, a move that was deeply
unpopular with the firm's nearly 15,000 retail brokers. Allison and
Steffens, who heads the brokerage division, battled for months over
how and how fast to incorporate Internet trading into the mix of
services offered to the firm's retail clients, several people who
work at Merrill have said in recent interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Merrill gave clients the choice of doing some or all of
their trading online instead of through their brokers, an offering
that will be phased in during coming months. The move was intended
to stop the flow of clients to rivals like Charles Schwab, which
has moved most of its stock brokerage business online. But the
final strategy was widely viewed within Merrill as a victory for
Steffens over an alternative plan put forward by Allison.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the firm denied that dissension over online
trading had a role in forcing Allison's departure. The spokesman
said that there were discussions before the change took place, but
that after the strategy was set senior executives rallied behind
the plan.

GORE CRIME PROPOSAL URGES PHOTO LICENSES FOR NEW HANDGUN OWNERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vice President Al Gore outlined his plan for
crime-fighting on Monday, essentially delivering two very different
speeches in one: On the one hand, he called for gun control
measures that go beyond anything President Clinton has proposed,
requiring photo licenses for all new handgun owners and banning
cheap handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sounded a number of conservative anti-crime themes,
saying he'd support longer sentences for all crimes committed with
guns, and for those who commit crimes in front of children. He
pledged to work with states that want to stop plea bargaining on
crimes committed with guns. A program he calls ``Stay Clean to Stay
Out'' would send parolees who fail mandatory drug tests back to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at police headquarters, surrounded by uniformed
officers who made the vice president look unusually loose, Gore
also pledged to push for a federal law establishing ``gang-free
zones'' with curfews on individual gang members, and a ban on
``gang-related clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   After giving Gore a Fenway Park T-shirt for his newborn
grandson, Boston Mayor Tom Menino called the vice president a
``visionary'' and ``friend of American cities'' who with the
president has helped push crime in Boston to its lowest rate since
1971. (Recalling a speech Gore made at a St. Patrick's Day event
two years ago, Menino added, ``They say he's wooden! Huh! I wish I
was as wooden as he was that morning!'')
</P>
<P>
   Recent school shootings have made gun control a major focus in
the campaign, and Gore, one of the original co-sponsors of the
Brady Bill, has a long history of pushing for it. But since the
shootings at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., this spring, he
has regularly spoken of limits on gun sales as only part of the
solution to youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we give our kids something to believe in?'' he asked the
crowd. ``Then the lure of cheap sensation will not hold sway over
them. Do we model decency and honor to them? Then they will remain
untempted by theft and deceit.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the speech, he said, ``Our children cannot
reach for their dreams if they are ducking for cover. A parent
struggles to pass on the right values in a culture that practically
screams out that chaos and cruelty are cool. And a good parent is
undermined in trying to teach the great, simple lessons of right
and wrong, of the rule of law and responsibility, when a burdened
justice system lets criminals off too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he supported ``common sense gun control
measures'' already advocated by the administration, including a
three-day waiting period for gun purchases, a one-gun-a-month limit
and requiring child safety locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley also has announced a gun
control proposal that is similar in many respects but would go even
further, requiring that all handguns be registered. On ``Good
Morning America'' Monday, Gore said he did not necessarily oppose
the idea of registering guns, but felt the licensing idea would
work just as well since background checks would be incorporated.
Aides said Monday that Gore felt licensing for anyone who wanted to
buy a gun would be less cumbersome for ``law-abiding citizens''
than registration of all guns would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If other measures are needed, we're open to that,'' a Gore
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who cast a tie-breaking vote in May when the Senate passed
legislation expanding a system of background checks on gun
purchases, was clearly eager to contrast his views on gun control
with those of his Republican competitors, particularly Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who has signed a ``conceal and carry'' law and
legislation limiting liability for gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some want to enact new protections for gun manufacturers,''
Gore said in the speech. ``I want to pass new protections for
families. Some want more concealed weapons _ but they can't conceal
the fact that they're just doing the NRA's bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, called Gore's reference to
the National Rifle Association ``so irresponsible he ought to be
ashamed.'' Bush supported the law limiting suits against gun
companies, she said, because ``He doesn't believe we should
subcontract the legal process to trial lawyers. He feels people
should be punished for their illegal actions, not manufacturers of
a legal product.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker also defended the conceal-and-carry law, saying that
since the governor signed it in 1995, ``many people feel safer,
particularly nurses and other women who work at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice president, said the issue
was an important one for Gore. ``We always like comparisons to
Republicans on this issue,'' he said. ``If the holster fits, wear
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Moffitt, incoming president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, denounced the speech,
saying some parts of it sounded too Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture war stuff sounds very much like what you'd hear
from Pat Buchanan,'' Moffitt said. ``And he wants to turn federal
courts into fashion police trying to dictate what people wear? I
don't know how you square chasing people down because of their
clothing with what the constitution says.''

U.S. SAYS IT HAS FINGERPRINTS OF EMBASSY BOMBING SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Monday that the fingerprints of two
Egyptian associates of Osama bin Laden have been found on
statements taking responsibility for bomb attacks against two U.S.
embassies in Africa last August.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Hadi Eidarous, 42, and Adel
Abdel-Meguid Abdel-Bary, 39, were arrested in London on Sunday and
ordered held by a British magistrate Monday. Prosecutors in New
York said fingerprints of both men were found on a statement faxed
to three news organizations that took responsibility for the
bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 that
killed 224 people and injured more than 4,500.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents made public Monday in New York, prosecutors
also accused the two men of maintaining contact with Muhammad Atef,
who has been described as bin Laden's military commander. Their
fingerprints were found on a declaration of war against U.S.
citizens issued in February 1998 by bin Laden, the court documents
said. The U.S. government also accused Eidarous of organizing a
terrorist cell for bin Laden in Azerbaijan in 1995 and providing
``fugitive terrorists'' with passports.
</P>
<P>
   The statements were found during a raid by the police last
September of an office in London rented by Abdel-Bary. They matched
the copies of faxes taking responsibility for the bombings that
were received by news organizations after the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two men strongly denied Monday that they had any
ties to terrorism and vowed to fight efforts to extradite them to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers described Eidarous as a former army officer and
Abdel-Bary as a lawyer who now helps fellow Egyptian dissidents.
They said each man has five children and lives in London with his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Gareth Pierce, Eidarous' lawyer, said that her client was the
subject of ``Kafkaesque'' U.S. abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The charges bring to 17 the number of people charged with
participating in the African bombings or in what prosecutors
describe as a global conspiracy by bin Laden to kill Americans.
Five are being held in New York for trial, three are in custody in
Britain and nine, including bin Laden, remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   The court documents appear to suggest that Eidarous and
Abdel-Bary worked with a third man, Khalid Al Fawwaz, a Saudi
national who was arrested in London in September for distributing
bin Laden's private and public instructions from London around the
world. Fawwaz has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting
extradition. Those instructions included the February 1998 decree
signed by bin Laden authorizing attacks on Americans worldwide that
had both men's fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   The court documents cited evidence found in searches of both
men's homes and offices in London as well as telephone records. The
lists of alleged links to bin Laden include records showing that a
satellite phone used by Atef, bin Laden's alleged military
commander, called Eidarous' cellular telephone 84 times between
January and August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the three statements taking responsibility for
the bombings were faxed to news organizations from a public fax in
a British post office the day after the bombings. At the hearing
held Monday in the Bow Street Magistrates Court in London, Arvinder
Sambi, appearing for the Crown Prosecution Service on behalf of
U.S. prosecutors, said both men's fingerprints covered the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Eidarous' fingerprints were found on the claims of
responsibility,'' Miss Sambi said. ``Mr. Bary's fingerprints were
on the fax that was sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court, Abdel-Bary's lawyer, Iqbal Ahmed, said his
client ``absolutely denies the allegations,'' which he said were
the result of a ``belated and unsupported'' extradition application
from the United States. Calling his client a ``respected lawyer,''
Ahmed said, ``He is opposed to violence, and he has publicly
condemned the bombings.''

CLINTON SEEKS TO MEND TAX DIFFERENCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as his advisers blasted Republican Party tax
cut proposals, President Clinton on Tuesday met with Congressional
leaders in an effort to bridge differences over taxes, Medicare and
other spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the hourlong meeting at the White House produced no
substantial agreements, Republican and Democratic leaders emerged
saying the discussions had been upbeat and that both sides were
eager to work on how to spend up an expected trillion-dollar budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Even House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, normally one of
President Clinton's toughest critics, said that he ``was impressed
with the president's enthusiasm'' about dealing with the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Armey was less charitable toward House Minority leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo, saying he hoped the president could convince the
Democratic leader to abandon his ``do nothing '' attitude that had
been impeding action in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The outward display of optimism masked differences between
Democrats and Republicans over tax policy that could play out
through the fall and possibly carry over into the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled Tuesday to take
up an $864 billion tax cut proposal that Democrats have warned
could lead to new deficits and the inability to shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said
the meeting with their GOP counterparts had not convinced them to
back such a big tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle warned that if the tax cuts were approved and the
surpluses did not materialize, the government would find itself
short of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he backed modest targeted tax cuts, but that
Democratic lawmakers would not rubber stamp any proposal offered
them by the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to collapse to their position if we think
their position is wrong headed, '' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said
they had agreed to work on legislation that would guarantee that
surpluses generated by Social Security payroll tax would be
dedicated to shoring up the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president had called
the meeting to discuss with the congressional leaders ``what his
principles are, what he thinks can get done, how we can cut taxes
the right way, how we can pay down the debt and secure this
economic recovery for the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, administration officials shot down
Republican tax proposals saying they would rob the government of
funds needed to extend the life of Medicare and pay for essential
domestic and defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   White House National Economic Director Gene Sperling charged
that the Republicans had failed the ``fiscal responsibility test.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling called it ``puzzling, disturbing and disappointing that
the Republicans now put forward a tax cut plan that leaves zero,
zero, for Medicare over a 10-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   And Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that ``huge tax
cuts are the wrong way forward because they mean more debt and
because they mean more risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have responded that they have set aside enough money
to save the entitlements and meet basic needs. They accuse the
administration of wanting to use the surplus to fund more
government programs rather than return extra money to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need more Washington spending,'' said Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The latest debate was triggered by Republican plans to start
moving massive tax cuts through Congress, beginning with an $864
billion tax cut proposal crafted by Ways and Means Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer plan would cut federal income tax rates by 10
percent, slash the top tax rate on capital gains from 20 percent to
15 percent, eliminate the inheritance and gift taxes, and offer
deductions for individuals purchasing long-term health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman William
Roth, R-Del, has proposed a $792 billion tax cutting package, which
would reduce the lowest tax bracket from 15 percent to 14 percent,
reduce the tax penalty on married people, and provide tax
incentives for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton administration officials say they prefer the Roth
plan because it targets middle class citizens, they say both plans
are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has proposed instead a $250 billion tax package
that officials say would leave enough money to extend the life of
Medicare by 12 years and fund domestic and defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president has proposed using $374 billion for Medicare,
including $46 billion to provide a new prescription drug benefit
for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget would also add $328 billion for other
programs, including $127 billion for beefing up defense.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the Republicans have provided no
additional money for Medicare and have not spelled out how they
would give out a large tax cut and continue to fund defense and
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge, however, that the Republicans have dealt with
Social Security by ensuring that $1.9 trillion in surplus that
comes from the Social Security payroll tax would be dedicated to
saving that entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Rushton, an Archer spokesman, said the surplus dedicated to
Social Security is enough to fix Medicare's financial problems as
well.

ERUPTION IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The political reality underlying student protests and bloody
clashes with the police in Tehran and other Iranian cities is that
a growing number of Iran's youthful population despises the
country's corrupt clerical dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   For the protesting students and for the rest of the world, the
central question hovering over the current demonstrations is
whether this eruption of discontent will be a passing cloud in the
sky or the beginning of the end for the ruling mullahs.
</P>
<P>
   It has already become evident that students are not risking
beatings and death merely to show support for the marginal reforms
of Iran's elected president, Mohammad Khatami. He has issued a
statement saying that the protesters have made their point and
``now students should cooperate with the government and allow law
and order to be established in society.''
</P>
<P>
   The students have other ideas. They refused to cease
demonstrating until their demands are met. They want July 15 to be
designated a national day of mourning for their companions who were
killed by the police and vigilantes doing the dirty work of the
hard-line clerics. The students are also demanding an open trial of
the authorities who ordered the police to carry out last Friday's
deadly attack on a dormitory in Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
   The slogans of the protesters suggest they are passing beyond
calls for limited reforms. When officials attempted to read to the
demonstrators a statement from the supreme leader of the Islamic
Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, students drowned out Khamenei's
messengers, shouting: ``Down with the dictator!'' and ``Either
Islam and the law or another revolution!''
</P>
<P>
   For the clerics who censor newspapers and have stolen and
squandered Iran's great wealth, this evocation of a second
revolution must come as the ultimate threat. They know that more
than 500 journalists are about to go on strike and that they face a
highly informed population that listens to the BBC, Radio Free
Europe, and Radio Israel. Now they also know that many Iranians
want them to go the way of the Shah.

GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY GAP IS GROWING, U.N. REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Globalization is compounding the gap between
rich and poor nations and intensifying U.S. dominance of the
world's economic and cultural markets, according to the latest
human development report published Monday by the U.N. Development
Program.
</P>
<P>
   The 262-page report, the 10th the program has issued, is the
first to focus on the spread of the Internet and computer
technology as well as the impact of globalization. It concludes
that the so-called ``rules of globalization'' should be rewritten
to keep the 60 countries that are worse off they were in 1980 from
falling even further behind.
</P>
<P>
   While short on specific proposals for making international
markets work ``for people rather than profits,'' the report
recommends, as have previous versions, faster debt relief,
redirection of aid to the poorest countries, and a task force to
review ``global governance.'' It also endorses a tax of 1 cent
(U.S.) on lengthy e-mails to raise $70 billion a year that could be
used to connect those without access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The report warns that the glaring, growing inequalities in the
distribution of wealth pose a ``dangerous polarization'' between
rich and poor countries. ``Global inequalities in income and living
standards have reached grotesque proportions,'' warns the report.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous reports, it says little about what role the
poorest nations themselves play in their predicament. It says
little about the corruption and mismanagement of resources in many
of the poorest countries that have discouraged foreign investment
and squandered millions of dollars in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The report highlights the dominant role of the United States,
and as a result, of English _ the language of choice for 80 percent
of web sites _ in the new global telecommunications marketplace. It
notes that 26 percent of Americans use the World Wide Web _ as
opposed to 3 percent of Russians, 0.4 percent of the population of
South Asia and 0.2 percent for Arab states. And it says that United
States has more computers than the rest of the world combined.
</P>
<P>
   It also notes that the annual sales of General Motors are larger
than the gross domestic products of Thailand or Norway, and that
Ford generates more income than Saudi Arabia. America and the other
rich, industrialized nations hold 97 percent of all worldwide
patents, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report says, the gap between globally
well-connected and unconnected peoples is likely to grow even
faster given the technology explosion. The number of Internet users
Monday, 150 million, is expected to grow to 700 million by 2001. An
American needs to save a month's salary to buy a computer; a
Bangladeshi must save all his wages for eight years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Jolly, the report's main author, said the report is
neither anti-American nor anti-free-market. ``The report
specifically endorses markets as the best guarantee of
efficiency,'' said Jolly, ``but not necessary of equity.''
</P>
<P>
   America, he said, was among the first to appreciate the dangers
of monopoly and, as such, to pass anti-trust laws to dilute
concentrations of economic power in the ``megacorporations'' _ the
world's top 10 corporations. The international community, he said,
has yet to figure out how to deal with such global market
concentrations.

N.Y. TIMES CO.   EXECUTIVE NAMED PUBLISHER AT BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a surprise move that ended 126 years of leadership
of The Boston Globe by the Taylor family, The New York Times Co.
Monday replaced publisher Benjamin B. Taylor with Richard H.
Gilman, senior vice president of operations at the Times.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove Taylor, 52, was made by Times publisher
and company chairman Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and by Times company
president and CEO Russell T. Lewis, according to Times spokeswoman
Nancy Nielsen. But it was new publisher Gilman, 48, who faced the
Globe editorial staff Monday to explain the dramatic development
that came six years after the Times purchased the Globe for $1.04
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While choosing not to discuss the details of why the Times
acted, Gilman, whose appointment became effective Monday, cited
``differences in approaches to management.'' This led to
speculation that stylistic and corporate cultural differences
between New York and Boston _ at a time when the Globe is
struggling with declining circulation and sagging classified
revenues _ may have played a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   In a noontime meeting with Globe newsroom employees, Gilman
captured the mood of the day by acknowledging that ``this catches a
lot of people, including myself, a little bit by surprise. . . .
Any time there is a dramatic change, and this certainly qualifies
as a dramatic change, it's an emotional moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman emphasized that ``the citizens of Boston and all of you
are justifiably proud of your newspaper'' and vowed to continue a
major ``investment in the quality of journalism.'' In an interview
later in the day, he also stressed that no further changes were
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other shoe to drop here. I'm here by myself. That's
the only change that's on the horizon,'' Gilman said, adding he had
``complete confidence'' in editor Matthew V. Storin and editorial
page editor H.D.S. Greenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been given complete reassurance about our editorial
independence,'' Storin said. ``They have said all the right things
both publicly and privately. But this is business. There are no
guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who will remain as chairman of the Globe Newspaper
Company Board, said Monday that Gilman's arrival in Boston ``could
be good for the Globe because one of our ongoing challenges is
educating New York about all the good things that are going on at
The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from the journalistic community seemed to be a mix of
resignation and concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the bottom line is that even The New York Times, which
operates at a very high standard of journalism, must move to the
same economic and technological impulses that drive the entire
industry,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of Harvard's Joan
Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. ``We will
have to see what impact this has on the editorial side of the
paper. . . . Will The Boston Globe shrink from being a major
regional paper to a smaller paper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that strikes me as noteworthy is that these
companies were attracted to each other because the Taylors and
Sulzbergers were members of a shrinking tradition'' of local,
family-run newspaper companies, said Tom Rosenstiel, director of
the Project for Excellence in Journalism. ``It's noteworthy that
under the ownership of The New York Times, that shrinking family
(management) is down by one.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo distributed to the Globe staff Monday, Gilman singled
out the twin problems of declining newspaper readership and the
erosion of classified advertising as two issues that have surfaced
at the Globe in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any surprise . . . that we consider Sunday
circulation the single biggest challenge,'' said Taylor. For the
six-month period ending in March, the Sunday Globe's circulation
was 730,420, compared with 751,377 two years earlier, and the paper
is now concentrating its efforts on building up the Sunday numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released at last month's meeting of Globe
department heads, total classified advertising in 1999 was down 4.5
percent from last year. And an April press release announcing the
Times Co.'s first quarter 1999 earnings pointedly noted that
``performance was strong at The New York Times and the Regional
Newspaper Group, where ad revenues increased 5.4 percent and 6.7
percent, and weak at The Boston Globe, where help wanted
advertising continued to soften.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taylor told the staff Monday that the Globe's financial
picture is solid, with a ``very real prospect that we will have our
third record year (of earnings) in a row'' and a 25 percent margin.
Newspaper analyst John Morton concurred, saying ``certainly there's
nothing in the performance of The Boston Globe to suggest that any
change was in order. It's the Sulzbergers' own newspaper. They can
do whatever they damn please.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that reality, much of the speculation Monday centered on
what both Taylor and Gilman alluded to as differences in management
technique, with observers suggesting that differences between the
harder-charging New York style and the Taylors' more conservative
bent _ as well as the Times' desire for more centralized control of
the Globe _ may have proved to be a crucial factor in the change of
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people inside the Globe, Monday was a day to
contemplate the end of the stewardship of the Taylor family, which
built a reputation through the generations for loyal, benevolent
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a morning meeting of department heads that she
characterized as ``very stunned and sad,'' columnist Ellen Goodman
recalled how ``most of us have worked for at least two generations
of Taylors and (how) we've been very lucky to have the family as
publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, William O. Taylor, who retired in 1997
after 20 years as publisher, noted: ``This is a very sad day for
both Ben and myself as our family winds up a long career managing
this newspaper. I hope the history books will be kind to both of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the large noontime gathering, Gilman asked for a round of
applause for Benjamin Taylor, who began his career as a Globe
reporter more than a quarter-century ago. As the staff rose for a
long and emotional standing ovation, Taylor slowly got up from his
seat and waved _ almost reluctantly, shyly _ to those who had
suddenly become his former employees.

FTC RECOMMENDS CONGRESS HOLD OFF ON PRIVACY LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While finding that the online industry has a long
way to go in protecting the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade
Commission has approved a report recommending that Congress hold
off on legislation to regulate how companies can collect and use
consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   The report, approved 3-1 by the commission, was a victory for
industry groups that have been scrambling for the last year and
half to avert privacy legislation. They have made a case for
self-regulation, encouraging companies to declare policies that
allow consumers to choose and control the information collected
about them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former federal trade commissioner who is now
a legal counsel to the Online Privacy Alliance, a group of Internet
and technology companies that was formed a year ago when the
commission threatened to seek legislation, said, ``I think it does
reflect that the industry has done an enormous amount of work over
the last year and a half and we are on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates insist that the latest surveys of the
privacy practices of online marketers _ and the commission report
itself _ prove that self-regulation is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is plenty of evidence that self-regulation has
not worked,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties advocacy
group. ``What these privacy policies are telling people is how much
privacy they don't have. The consequence as a legal matter is
expectations of privacy in the online world continue to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not without criticism of the industry. Indeed, it
cites a survey this spring by Georgetown University showing that
while 66 percent of Web sites now post privacy policies _ up from
14 percent a year earlier _ only 10 percent also follow the
commission's criteria for protecting personal information, giving
consumers choice and control over such information and a form of
redress if it is misused.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The self-regulatory initiatives described above reflect
industry leaders' substantial effort and commitment to fair
information practices,'' the report states. But it goes on to say
that ``only a small minority of commercial Web sites have joined
these programs to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be officially submitted on Tuesday at a hearing
of the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection, at which trade commission members and others
on both sides of the privacy issue are expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Edward Markey of
Massachusetts, says he intends to introduce an online privacy
``bill of rights'' to protect consumer control over personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the commission, denied that its
conclusions were in conflict. ``Responsible elements of the
Internet community have begun to do what they set out to do,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, just putting a notice on the Internet
about a privacy policy is not all the protection that consumers
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the commission would continue to closely monitor
online privacy. And the report lays out an agenda for public
workshops and task forces of industry, privacy and consumer groups
to make sure the progress continues.
</P>
<P>
   It also promises another review of Web site privacy practices,
probably in another year, Pitofsky said, emphasizing not just the
adoption of policies but their substance, monitoring and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes a year after the commission released the first
survey on Web site privacy practices and won approval of
legislation requiring Web sites that collect information from
children to get parents' permission. It also warned that it would
seek legislation regulating the use of personal information
collected from adults if substantial progress was not made.

BRUINS NET TALLAS FOR ANOTHER YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- One down, one to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins locked up Rob Tallas with a one-year contract Monday,
leaving Byron Dafoe as their remaining restricted free-agent
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Tallas, whom the Bruins dealt to keep on
expansion draft day when they sent center Randy Robitaille to the
Atlanta Thrashers, signed a pact reportedly worth $700,000 plus
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a significant increase from last year's $625,000
salary, but Tallas said he feels it's consistent with what his
peers around the league are making, and he's very pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Tallas played 17 regular-season games and earned a
7-7-2 record and a 2.61 goals-against average. If Tallas plays 35
games next year, he'll pocket $25,000 and earn $25,000 for every
additional five-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A one-year deal at this time is pretty much fair for both,''
said Jay Fee, Tallas's representative. ``His contract for next year
will be at the upper reaches of backup goalies' salaries. I think
the main thing we were worried about in Boston is that he not start
wasting away here. I've been assured that the plan is to play
Robbie more next year. Get him going earlier, and get him more
routine work than he had last year, and that's really important.
What happens in the double expansion draft next year, I don't know.
Obviously, Boston likes him, and I think he appreciates the fact
that they went through a lot of trouble to try to hang onto him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the expansion draft, the Bruins lost forward Peter
Ferraro to Atlanta. Then, as part of the agreement not to pick
Tallas, the Thrashers turned around and swapped Ferraro back to the
Bruins for Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' said Tallas. ``After talking to Jay and looking
at where I fit in the league, (filing for arbitration) wasn't
necessary at all. I'm right there. There's a chance for me to play
some more games this year, depending on Byron's contract. I'm happy
with that. We talked about a two-year deal, but the best thing for
me right now is a one-year deal with two teams coming back next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-year deal gives Tallas more leverage next summer as two
new teams will be joining the league for the 2000-2001 season. He
feels that by being a free agent again rather than being under
contract, he's left with more options.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they decide they want to keep (he and Dafoe) together for
another couple of years, it's definitely easier because if you're
signed, the other team isn't really taking any risk by picking you
up,'' he said. ``They know what your salary is going to be; they
grab you and go from there. That definitely will have a big part of
it next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas feels as if he is living a charmed life. He is able to
stay in Boston, he received a new contract he believes is fair, and
he feels he'll get more of an opportunity to play next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has worked out,'' he said. ``I always said I'd deal
with it when it comes. I didn't want to stress myself out and worry
about anything. Look what happened. This summer has totally worked
out in my favor. It's not always going to happen this way. There's
going to be adversity, but so far everything has been great. For me
to go in there and even ask for anything higher than I'm getting
right now is ridiculous. I'm loyal to them just as they've been
loyal to me this whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   You can guarantee that Dafoe's negotiations, which started out
very friendly, are not going to go as smoothly as they did for
Tallas. The deadline for filing for arbitration is Thursday. Look
for Dafoe to opt not to file and instead retain the option of
holding out at the start of training camp. That means the Bruins
are going to have their hands full, and Dafoe is going to retain
any leverage he has. Tallas said if the situation results in Dafoe
holding out, he'll be there to take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come into camp in shape, and I'll hope for the
best,'' he said. ``I hope I do get more games, but it's up to
(coach Pat Burns). With the way the race was at the end of the year
and Byron playing so well, Byron wanted those games, which made it
difficult for me. This year, depending on Byron's contract, who
knows if he's going to be at camp? If he's not, I'm taking on that
responsibility of being the No. 1 guy.''

SENATOR SMITH'S MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A political party cannot last long if it insists on rigid
positions that are shunned by most voters.
</P>
<P>
   So from an entirely practical, self-preservationist viewpoint,
the Republican national chairman, Jim Nicholson, is right to chide
Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who wants to quit the party
because some Republicans are less than absolute in their opposition
to abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, political parties will continue to lose
relevance if they cannot at least summon enough strength to protect
their own organizational integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Voters can be excused if they look skeptically at Smith's plan.
In ignoring the advice of many friends and deciding to run for
president, Smith willingly took on a long-shot crusade partly to
advance his conservative positions.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, it has become clear that his candidacy
was not catching on, even in his own state, home of the nation's
first primary. The prospect was that as a Republican, Smith might
get very few votes, possible even fewer than some of the fringe
candidates. This would be an embarrassment to him and would
undercut his message.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson was correct on writing Smith to call his defection ``a
serious mistake'' and potentially counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, if Smith continues to seek the presidency as an
independent candidate, he might still receive an embarrassingly
small number of votes, and most of those would probably hurt the
Republican nominee more than the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that several other Republicans, including Steve Forbes,
Pat Buchanan, and Gary Bauer, have criticized Nicholson _ Forbes
accused him of ``running people out of the party'' _ only shows
that the ideologues would rather fight each other than win votes.

DREAM OF A TOUR-DE-FRANCE WIN IS DEFERRED A YEAR FOR AN INJURED
JULICH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE GRAND BORNAND, France _ The Tour de France took the day off
Monday, and unhappily for Bobby Julich, he was not here. The
Cofidis rider was in Nice, recovering from the injuries he
sustained Sunday in the time trial in Metz that knocked him out of
the race.
</P>
<P>
   His broken ribs and elbow mean that his dream goes unfulfilled
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1986, when he was 14, Julich watched on television
as Greg LeMond become the first American to win the Tour de France.
That changed his life, Julich often says. He dropped the other
sports he played at school in Glenwood Springs, Colo., and
concentrated on racing his bicycle.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julich won his share of races as he grew older, joined the U.S.
national team and then turned professional in 1993. He experienced
some terrible times, too, including the collapse of his first team
and the year he had to spend as an independent rider in the United
States, eating up his savings as he paid his way to races, hoping
for another chance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he wound up riding in his first Tour de France two
years ago. He finished 17th, then vaulted to third last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned so much last year,'' he said during an interview
this past spring. ``I spent time on the trainer putting the tape of
the Tour de France in, and I learned a lot not only from the Tour
de France but looking at the tape. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few times when I was nervous and caught up in the
situation. I was second for a couple of weeks and I began thinking,
`I don't have much higher to go but I can really lose a lot.' I was
kind of playing it safe. People can maybe say I wasn't aggressive,
but the situation I was in, I couldn't deal with it like a seasoned
veteran. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I was sitting there, watching the tape, and
yelling at myself, totally regretting not attacking. That's not
what I want. The next Tour I want to lay it all on the line and
give myself a 100 percent chance of winning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was laying it all on the line Sunday in the time trial in
Metz when he came down a hill too rapidly and crashed, breaking
several ribs and his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, he was confident, saying that he expected ``a great
time trial.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good, my legs are good, my morale is super,'' he
said. ``Basically I'm arriving at the first time trial unscathed
and very motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the pollen allergies that troubled him in races in June had
got better, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, as he said months before, sitting in the sunshine in Nice,
where he lives during the season with his wife, Angela, ``Destiny
has been a big part of my career.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julich added: ``One thing I'm convinced of now, success doesn't
necessarily mean you'll be happy and failure doesn't necessarily
mean you'll be miserable. It's seeing the bright side of the
situation you're in and not thinking too much about the bad things.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest place to be is at the top because you're going to
get knocked off. And the people who get back there are the people
who've learned to deal with failure as much as success.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julich was happy to talk about a number of topics in bicycle
racing, including drugs. ``I just hope the riders take more
responsibility,'' he said. ``Winning at all costs is not worth it.
There's honor in second, third, fifth, 20th place or even finishing
100th. You don't measure human beings by the number of bicycle
races they've won.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why did winning the Tour de France mean so much to him? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because it's the biggest bicycle race in the world, he said.
``But I'm not in this sport to say that I'm the best at anything,''
he said. ``I'm in this sport because I love it, first of all, and
second, to see what my limits are. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that a lot of people pass their heyday and think, `What
if I would have taken it a little more seriously?' or `What if I
had taken advantage of that opportunity?' or `What if, what if?' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that with me I'll take advantage of it when I can so
that later I won't regret the decisions I'm making.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such an easy sport,'' he said before he got on his
motorbike and went home. ``Do a lot of training, don't get sick,
don't get injured. What was it Eddy Merckx said when somebody asked
him how to become a top rider? `Ride lots.''' &QL;

IRANIAN POLICE MOVE IN TO CRUSH ESCALATING STUDENT PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ The most widespread and sustained protests since
Iran's revolution two decades ago spread throughout the country
Monday, while security police and their vigilante supporters moved
to crush pro-democracy student demonstrators outside Tehran
University.
</P>
<P>
   Students demonstrated in 18 cities and towns, including major
cosmopolitan cities like Tabriz, Shiraz and Isfahan and more
traditional cities like Mashad and Yazd, Iran's official news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding batons and lobbing tear gas canisters, the security
forces emptied Tehran University Monday evening in a campaign to
crush the demonstrations. In Tehran, students who had gathered
inside the gates of the sprawling university complex in the heart
of the capital fainted from tear gas that could be smelled more
than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filthy swine! Filthy swine!'' one red-faced student screamed
over and over from inside the cramped quarters of one of the
caged-in vehicles. ``Jerk!'' yelled another. Others yelled
obscenities that are seldom heard in public in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, wrapped in the all-encompassing black chador, cursed
the clergy with obscenities. A number of people were injured and
received assistance from health personnel in a blood transfusion
truck and passersby.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of injured students were taken to the campus mosque for
treatment, and a parade of ambulances streamed in and out of the
campus as a voice on a loudspeaker called all medical students to
help. Students set a huge bonfire to try to neutralize the tear
gas, one witness said.
</P>
<P>
   The vigilantes, fervent revolutionaries who serve as volunteers
for the regime, carried cables, chains and batons as they emerged
from the government-owned buses that parked near the university,
the witness said. The students had intended to stage an all-night
sit-in, but by midnight, most of them had left the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations _ and the crackdown _ reflect a deep struggle
over the course of Iran's revolution. Students are impatient with
the slow pace of reforms promised by President Mohammed Khatami.
The students are not calling for a change in the Islamic system of
government, rather for a quickening of the movement towards
democracy and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are the diehard Islamic revolutionaries, some
of them in positions of power, some of them veterans of Iran's long
war with Iraq, who take their lead from Iran's Supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and believe that the country's moves
towards democracy are a betrayal of revolutionary purism.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami does not control the police and security forces, who
have enraged and frightened many Iranians by a campaign of
intimidation that included the murders of prominent intellectuals
as well as political attacks on Khatami's allies in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations and the crackdowns do not mean that Iran's
Islamic Republic is in jeopardy. ``We should not assume that this
movement could turn into a revolution,'' said an editorial Monday
in the reformist newspaper, Neshat. ``It's neither nor possible nor
desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   The five days of rage were sparked by the passage by Iran's
parliament of a tough new press law and by the closure of Salam, a
popular left-leaning Islamic newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces and vigilantes stormed a dormitory at Tehran
University on Thursday night and beat students as they slept,
pushing some from second- and third-story windows. Although the
official death toll stood at two, Iran's newspapers, quoting
students, claimed that between five and eight students had died.
</P>
<P>
   As striking as the extent of the protests throughout the country
is the form they are taking. Until now, criticisms of Ayatollah
Khamenei, who is in charge of the armed forces, the security and
intelligence apparatus, and radio and television, were made
privately. Now the criticism of Khamenei, who lacks the religious
credentials of his predecessor and has resisted any embrace of
reform, has burst into the open.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to calm the highly charged atmosphere, Khamenei on
Monday delivered an emotional speech condemning the attack by
security forces on a dormitory last week after the first protests.
He spoke to a hand-picked crowd of thousands in a cavernous hall
reserved solely for his use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bitter incident has broken my heart,'' he said in the
speech, which was broadcast on both radio and television. He added
that it was un-Islamic to enter the private spaces of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning acknowledgment that some of the demonstrators had
turned against him, he added, ``Even if things make you angry and
they condemn me, even if they set fire to my picture, remain
silent. Take no action until the day that the country needs it!''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women in the crowd moaned and wept loudly.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech he said, ``The greatest dream and honor for me is
that I give my life in this honorable, glorious magnificent path''
_ a statement the security forces and the vigilantes may have
interpreted as a message that they should risk their lives instead.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei also blamed ``enemies,'' including the United States,
for the attack on the dormitory. Over and over, the crowd chanted
``Death to America.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the university, there was no crying for the ayatollah.
When a speaker tried to read the text of Khamenei's speech, the
crowd booed. ``Commander-in-chief resign!'' and ``Down with the
dictator,'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   There were posters of President Khatami but none of Ayatollah
Khamenei, whose photographs and portraits dominate public
buildings, shops and landscapes throughout Iran along with those of
his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami called on students to exercise restraint, saying in a
meeting with education officials, ``students should cooperate with
the government and allow law and order to be established in
society.''

</P>
<P>
   In another incident Monday, uniformed and plainclothes security
police and anti-riot police protected by shields and helmets
clashed with several hundred student protesters. The police rounded
up dozens of students in Valiasr Square, one of Tehran's busiest
intersections, beating some of them and forcing them into cages
mounted on the back of pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown came after a police car and two police motorcycles
were set on fire, apparently by students, one witness said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone-throwing students smashed storefront windows. Many
shopkeepers pulled down the gates of their stores both to prevent
looting and to get a closer look at the action in the streets.
Police froze traffic just before rush hour. Helicopters kept watch
overhead. Security police roamed among the thousands of people
gathered in the square arresting suspicious-looking young people
and rounding up photographers to prevent them from taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day at the university, students stood up on a
makeshift dais near the law school and one after one explained
their views and stated their demands. Among them are the creation
of a national day of mourning in memory of the students who were
killed, the holding of a public trial for the people who ordered
and carried out the dormitory attack, and the return of the bodies
of those killed.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker in a black shirt criticized the lack of
organization. ``We have to have a plan and a leader,'' said the
man, who, like the other speakers, did not identify himself. ``We
have to find out which of our friends have been killed, and who
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker called for the execution of the perpetrators of
last Thursday's dormitory attack.
</P>
<P>
   A number of student organizers said they believed that the
all-day open microphone was a trap set by infiltrators in their
midst who both tried to provoke the students into more radical
action and ended up being part of Monday night's crackdown. One
speaker said that some in the crowd were offering razor blades to
students who might want to use violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very strange that the students were allowed to speak so
freely,'' he said. ``The whole thing is too suspicious.''

WOMEN ON TOP OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides the victory, the thrill of the Women's World Cup soccer
game was how well it played out in the hearts of fans.
</P>
<P>
   These players have pulled off a nearly chivalrous balance. They
are aggressive athletes but with a gentle love for the game. Their
interviews skip over canned and scripted answers. When goalkeeper
Briana Scurry talked about watching Liu Ying approach a penalty
shot, fans got to see through Scurry's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Liu ``didn't look like she wanted to be there. She didn't have
that confidence. You could see it in the way she walked up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry blocked the shot _ moving the American team toward
victory and taking fans to a universe far away from
multimillion-dollar endorsements and contract disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In this world of pure joy about the game, the word
``confidence'' shakes off its hackneyed shell. It becomes a
crackling term that bundles the virtues of practice, focus, desire,
and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   In this world, Brandi Chastain's game-winning penalty-kick goal
doubles as a compelling psychological contest between Chastain and
the Chinese team's goalie Gao Hong. Gao, Chastain explains, can get
into confidence-shattering staring matches. So without looking at
Gao, Chastain saw what had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The win also sheds glory on Title IX, the controversial 1972
policy that required gender equity in school and college sports.
Title IX created opportunities for female athletes even when demand
wasn't obvious. It was a leap of public policy faith, an ancestor
of the baseball movie chestnut, ``If you build it, they will
come.''
</P>
<P>
   As more girls and women played sports, more friends and
relatives paid attention. Television cameras followed. Now members
of America's younger generations take female athletes for granted _
blase about the fact that women aren't just televised gymnasts and
tennis players but also soccer and basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   It's a change that promises to grow. The World Cup's new
champions will surely inspire future champions who will renew our
passion for hard-won victories.

CLINTON MEETS WITH CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ON TAX AND SPENDING
MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Republican leaders warily met
Monday on a broad array of tax and spending proposals that expose
the deep divisions and distrust between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton back from a week-long tour of impoverished areas
and Congress returning to work after the July 4 recess, talks began
in earnest in the Oval Office late Monday afternoon on matters of
social policy and money that will drive negotiations in Washington
through the fall budget-writing season, and probably well into the
2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invited Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert and House Majority Leader Dick Armey to the White
House to discuss his plans for Medicare and Social Security and to
hear Republican proposals for large tax cuts. The Democratic
leaders of the Senate and House, Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt,
also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the Republican leaders that he is willing to
work with them to use the bulk of projected federal budget
surpluses of $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years to insure the
solvency of Social Security and Medicare, aides said after the
meeting. But he repeated his view that Republican plans to cut
taxes by $800 billion or more over the next decade would make it
impossible to revamp Medicare or to add billions in new spending
for education, the military and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's chief economic adviser, said the
president expressed willingness to discuss tax cuts of a smaller
magnitude, but only after dealing with what he views as more
pressing priorities. Clinton has said he would be willing to devote
about $250 billion of the estimated surplus over the next decade to
tax breaks intended to spur retirement savings among low- and
middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere of the Oval Office meeting was described as
friendly, administration officials earlier in the day described the
Republican tax-cutting plans as a ``shell game'' that threatened to
undermine the economy, consume the estimated surpluses and put the
federal budget back into the red just as a rosy scenario of surplus
is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called the tax cuts
``potentially explosive'' if projected surpluses fail to
materialize. Sperling said the Republican proposals were
``puzzling, disappointing and disturbing'' because they leave
nothing for the repair of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The vehemence of the White House reaction this early in the
process led Republicans to question the president's sincerity when
he says he seeks to put partisanship aside and reach a compromise
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure out if he really wants to get
things done _ cooperate on Social Security, Medicare, taxes, even
trade _ or is he going to go the partisan route,'' Lott said in an
interview with the Associated Press. For all the money being put on
the table by the surplus, reaching a deal will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how to apportion the excess revenue is about
more than numbers. Republicans support a big tax cut not just
because it would give money back to voters, but because it would
move the money out of Washington, and therefore help their efforts
to reduce the size and influence of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said their intent is not to block a tax
cut, but to assure continued funding of military, education, health
and environmental programs, while pumping new money into Medicare
and avoiding the risk of renewed budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, any compromise would be more complex than finding a
number between $250 billion _ the amount Clinton says is
appropriate for a tax cut over the next decade _ and $864 billion,
the figure in the Republican tax legislation that will be taken up
by the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake to think you just look at these numbers
and somehow say, well, can you just split the difference?'' said
Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director. ``You have to ask,
what do you want to get on defense, what do you want to get on
Medicare, and you have to put first things first.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the most complicating factors may be the
political judgments made by leaders of both parties about how a
deal, or the lack of one, would play on the campaign trail in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are factions within both parties that see an ideological
showdown as the best way of turning out voters on their behalf next
year. And there are both Democrats and Republicans who believe that
they will do better by going to the voters with a record of
accomplishment, even if it means compromise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If Clinton and the Republican leadership cannot find some common
ground, and if the tax bill that emerges from Congress this month
looks more like the partisan House version than the more
compromise-oriented Senate version, the most likely outcome this
year will be gridlock, said Robert Greenstein, the executive
director of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning research organization.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, Greenstein said, would be ``a feeding frenzy''
of tax cuts and new spending that could return the nation to the
deficits of the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gridlock here can actually be the responsible policy and
should not be seen as some form of failure,'' Greenstein said.

about $250 billion of the estimated surplus over the next decade to
tax breaks intended to spur retirement savings among low- and
middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere of the Oval Office meeting was described as
friendly, administration officials earlier in the day described the
Republican tax-cutting plans as a ``shell game'' that threatened to
undermine the economy, consume the estimated surpluses and put the
federal budget back into the red just as a rosy scenario of surplus
is about to begin. Republicans questioned the president's sincerity
when he says he seeks to put partisanship aside and reach a
compromise this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure out if he really wants to get
things done _ cooperate on Social Security, Medicare, taxes, even
trade _ or is he going to go the partisan route,'' Lott said in an
interview with the Associated Press.

 &HT;    Pedro Martinez: Halfway to 30
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's not just that he is doing this during baseball's
most prolific slugging era, or that he's doing it in the DH league,
or doing it in tiny Fenway Park, where pitchers have labored in
fear for nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   What is more appealing in Pedro Martinez's quest this summer is
its simplicity: a man of everyday construction (5 feet 11),
throwing harder than he might (97 mph) and demanding some of the
game's greatest hitters to do something about it. Nothing is more
elemental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've faced him twice,'' Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. said,
``and he basically says, `Here, hit this.' And I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's newest favorite son starts for the American League
tonight in the 70th All-Star Game, catching his breath before
continuing his run at the game's first 30-win season in 31 years.
At 15-3, he leads the majors in victories and ERA (2.10), leads the
AL in strikeouts (184) and innings (132 2/3).
</P>
<P>
   Immune from the malaise that has hit so many star pitchers this
season, Martinez's start has been bettered by only nine players
since the first All-Star game in 1933. The last was Randy Jones'
16-3 first half in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when chicks dig the long ball, one man strives against
the trend. Asked how hard was the decision to make Martinez his
starter, AL manager Joe Torre said, ``Unless I didn't want to come
to town, it was the only choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 28, easily could have won 18 already. In his three
losses, to the White Sox, Expos and Devil Rays, Boston scored three
runs in support. His 16-strikeout performance against Atlanta on
June 4 still has the Braves shaking their heads. In a surprisingly
strong first half for Boston, he has made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched 18 games and kept us in the game 18 times,''
manager Jimy Williams said. ``That statement says it all. It tells
you how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have reworked their rotation to give him a break
entering the second half, prompting more questions about the
possibility of Martinez being the first pitcher to win 30 since
Denny McLain in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'd love it,'' Martinez said. ``But it's not easy.
I've never won 20 in my career. This is the best chance I've had.
But I can only get ready for the next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when Tommy Lasorda was sure he could not use
Martinez as a starter, Los Angeles dealt him to Montreal for second
baseman Delino DeShields. Once in Canada, Martinez spent a couple
of years dodging a reputation as a head-hunter, winning a
respectable 38 times in three years but being viewed as a
pedestrian fastballer on a nowhere team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I was going to be the player I am today,'' he
said, ``with all the bad things they said about me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cy Young season of 1997 _ 17-8, 1.90 ERA, 13 complete games,
305 strikeouts _ changed everything, as he was transformed before
the Expos' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Then-teammate Sean Berry said, ``Well, for one thing, he throws
100 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, 97. And then he throws that great change-up, a killer
change-up, and then he has a slider, too. He knows how to pitch a
little better now than he did back then. He was there physically a
long time ago, and now he's there mentally, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after the game's home-run record fell, a pitcher's
pursuit of 30 wins takes its place. And just as Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa cautioned against what eventually happened in 1998, the
same advisories are going out to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be lucky,'' Torre said. ``You have to have the
lead. With the number of people he strikes out, it takes its toll
by late August or September. I think it's going to be very
difficult for him to win 30. Not that he's not capable. We all know
he's the premier pitcher in the league, and there's no question you
have to try like hell just to stay up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Durability has remained a concern during Martinez's career. He
always has thrown his share of pitches _ his 113.7-pitcher average
leads the AL _ and he has paid a price. After an 11-2 start in
1998, he went 8-5 in the second half. During his career, he is
46-20 (.697) before the break and 38-26 (.594) after it.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers prompted the Red Sox to move him to the back of
the rotation. His two or three innings tonight will be the only
live work he will have between his last start on July 7 and his
next scheduled start against Florida on July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws a lot of pitches, has a lot of strikeouts; he may
wear down more than the average guy,'' Boston pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan said. ``That's why you really track his number of pitches,
and the number of days he has between starts. I think he'll be OK
in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight will mark Martinez's third All-Star appearance _ he made
the team last year but did not pitch_ but his first since his
ascension to be the game's best. Fenway will be festooned as usual
with flags of the Dominican Republic, a celebration of a pitcher in
the era of the slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Who does Martinez most look forward to facing? ``None of them,''
he said, although the feeling is mutual.

IN WNBA, QUALITY IS UP, BUT THE GATE IS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERRY BREWER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The novelty that has covered the Women's National Basketball
Association like a fresh coat of paint is beginning to chip.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of the star-studded cast from the defunct
American Basketball League, the WNBA entered its third season
finally being able to say that it had the best women's professional
basketball league in the nation _ or world, for that matter. Every
team now has a bona-fide star, and the deeper rosters have meant
faster-paced games.
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday night's first All-Star Game at Madison Square
Garden, all 18,645 seats are sold. But comparing last season's
final average with the first half of this season, attendance has
decreased 12 percent _ from an average of 10,821 to 9,536.
</P>
<P>
   League officials say they are not panicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're at the stage where we're really testing our
audience,'' WNBA President Val Ackerman said, ``and separating the
fans who came to watch us because we were new from the fans who
really care about the sport. We may have some fluctuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Gillom, the Phoenix Mercury's All-Star center, noticed
the drop in attendance during a June 24 game against the Sting at
Charlotte Coliseum. She could hear sections of fans yelling her
name in a modest crowd of 4,514. The place had such little density
that it might have floated in water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It concerned me a lot,'' Gillom said. ``I'm looking for this
league to go up, not take a step back. It's hard to put a finger on
it. The players have definitely made an impression on the fans.
That's why I guess it surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 franchises that had teams last season, only one _
Sacramento _ has seen its attendance increase this season. The two
expansion teams, Minnesota and Orlando, are averaging 9,703 and
8,631 fans. The previous 10 franchises had averaged 10,334 in their
first seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is averaging a league-worst 6,139 fans, approaching
the single-season mark for low attendance set by Sacramento's
average of 6,578 last summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   League officials seem puzzled about why there has been a
decrease. They have their guesses. While Ackerman said the
attendance has tended to increase during the second half of the
season, she said the late-ending NBA season took some of the luster
off the start of the WNBA season. The attention given to Wimbledon
earlier this month and then to the U.S. women's soccer team during
its World Cup run did not directly compete with the WNBA for fans,
Ackerman said, but news media hype definitely swayed that way.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the league began, the league had all the
attention. The WNBA originally expected to draw 4,000 to 5,000
fans. The leaguewide average that first season was 9,669.
Expectations have since increased, and the goal is now to average
10,000 fans per game leaguewide, as was done last season. And in
spite of the 12 percent decrease so far, that goal is clearly
within reach this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty point guard Teresa Weatherspoon, whose team is averaging
12,682 fans this season (down from 14,935 last season but second
best in the league), is not alarmed by the attendance figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a concern, but I really don't look into the
stands,'' she said. ``Our job is to go out and do the best we can.
The fans usually respond to that.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA officials like to throw out a comparison to the brother
league, the NBA, to keep attendance in perspective. The NBA did not
average 10,000 fans per game leaguewide until 1975-76, a full 29
years after the league was founded. The WNBA did it in year two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flat attendance thus far is not to the extent that the sky
is falling,'' said Dean Bonham, the head of the Bonham Group, a
Denver sports marketing firm that specializes in analyzing
financial deals for sports properties. ``The WNBA is not going to
be like any other sports league because it started up unlike any
other start up in history. It's really a joint venture, more than
it is a start up of a major league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of synergy with the NBA that keeps costs down
and makes them have great promotion and marketing. But most of its
real success will start being measured after Year 3. The people who
will be long-term fans will start to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonham suggested that the league should focus on two things:
quality of the product and drawing a fan base of young females.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that the ABL players have helped the league as new
stars like Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith, Utah's Natalie Williams,
Charlotte's Dawn Staley and Minnesota's Tonya Edwards have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the fans who go to WNBA games are female,
according to league demographic studies. The WNBA's figures also
show that boys and girls ages 7 to 17 make up about 20 percent of
the attendance. And, the league says, there is little overlap with
NBA season ticket-holders. Only about 10 percent of NBA season
ticket-holders are WNBA season ticket-holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not like most of our fans are checking `yes' on the
back of their NBA season tickets to come watch us,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the growth of the league lies within its ability to
market its marquee players. While the WNBA has done a tremendous
job of marketing the Washington rookie forward Chamique Holdsclaw
and most of the prime players who have been with the league since
it started, most of the former ABL stars are still unknown
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Only one former ABL player _ Nikki McCray, who bolted a year
before the league folded _ was voted as a starter for the All-Star
Game. Five others were selected as reserves, which means that six
of the 22 All-Stars once played in the rival league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the players from the ABL aren't used to so much hype,
but they are great players with great stories,'' said Maura McHugh,
an assistant coach with Sacramento who used to be the head coach of
the ABL's Long Beach franchise. ``I hope that, in time, people will
really recognize that they are elite players, and people will
realize that there are so many great players to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of those players will shine at the first All-Star
game Wednesday night. It is a stage _ national television, a
sellout crowd and a purposeful date on which there is no
major-league baseball _ that could give the league a jolt, the kind
that you would give to a car whose battery has run down
temporarily.

AMAZON.COM TO EXPAND SALES OF ELECTRONICS AND TOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to position itself as the Internet's first true
department store, Amazon.com plans to introduce two new divisions
Tuesday, one for consumer electronics and another for toys.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has grown from just an online bookseller into the largest
Internet retailer by far, with more than 10 million customers. In
addition to books, Amazon already operates sections for music and
videos, as well as an auction site. Analysts estimate its sales
will exceed $1.3 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Through a gifts section it introduced last year, Amazon has
offered a handful of toys and electronics items. But now it will
offer thousands of products in each category.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither category has attracted many sales on the
Internet. In 1999, online sales of toys will be $52 million,
according to estimates by Jupiter Communications, the Internet
research firm, and sales of electronics will be $78 million. By
contrast, online book sales will be $1.1 billion, Jupiter
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In toys, unlike electronics, some prominent online merchants
have emerged. The leader is eToys, which went public earlier this
year and has established a well-known brand and quality reputation.
But its sales in the fiscal year ended in March only amounted to
$30 million. Toys ``R'' Us, the leading toy-store chain, has
fumbled its first online efforts and is now working on a new
initiative in conjunction with Silicon Valley venture capitalists.
Kay-Bee Toys, the chain owned by Consolidated Stores Corp., bought
Brainplay.com, a specialized Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The electronics field is more fragmented, with a handful of
start-ups, like 800.com, and electronics sections on larger sites,
like Cendant Corp.'s Netmarket. One hurdle to online electronics
sales has been that large manufacturers like Sony have not wanted
many of their products sold online. In part, this has been to
protect their local dealers, but some manufacturers have been
deciding whether to open online stores of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said that the company,
which is based in Seattle, had been able to get access to a wide
range of consumer electronics products, but he declined to say how
many items Amazon would carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go to a manufacturer and say we bring 10 million
experienced online shoppers and the ability to do a good job
selling your product,'' Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that in toys, the battle between Amazon and Etoys
will be hard fought. ``In terms of customer service, they are both
singing from the same choir book,'' said Mark Johnson, an analyst
with Jupiter. ``Amazon just has unbelievable scale and a much
larger customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not so long ago skeptics were predicting that Amazon
would wilt in competition with Barnes &AMP; Noble, the much larger
bookseller. That did not happen, and Toby Lenk, chief executive of
eToys, said his company could be the David to slay Amazon's
Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   His company's strength, he said, was its specialization in goods
for children. And eToys has initiated a preemptive strike, opening
its own children's bookstore on Tuesday, with 85,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same rules don't apply when you sell things for kids than
when you sell books,'' Lenk said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amazon offers a service that lets regular customers
buy items with a single click of the mouse, assuming they have
already entered their shipping address and credit card number. Lenk
said that eToys requires a password for customers to complete
purchases to prevent kids from charging away on their parents'
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos argued that the one-click purchase system would be an
important convenience for customers and would drive impulse
purchases. Customers, he noted, have the option of disabling the
feature. What is more, he said, since Amazon would store and ship
all its products from its network of warehouses around the country,
customers could combine books, toys and electronics in one order
and save on shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Amazon's toy store emulates the look of eToys, with lots
of information about toys and suggestions for children, broken out
by age groups. Amazon said that it was spending even more to
develop reviews and other information content about its products.
For example, it said it had hired Dr. Penelope Leach, the noted
pediatrician and author of several well-regarded books on child
rearing, to recommend educational toys.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, for the consumer electronics section, it has hired
editors to write buying guides and individual product reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, we will do a full Consumer Reports-level of
testing,'' Bezos said. For now, the company does not accept any
money from toy or electronics manufacturers to promote their
products. Eventually, it will charge fees for prominent placement
of positive reviews, as it does with books.
</P>
<P>
   But Bezos said the opinion in the review would be independent of
any fee paid by the manufacturer. And in both categories, readers
will be able to submit their own product reviews and ratings, as
they do with books, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos would not say how much these new departments would
contribute to Amazon's sales, but he noted that the company's past
expansions had grown quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We launched music and four months later we were the leading
seller of music online,'' Bezos said. ``And we became the No. 1
seller of videos in 45 days.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Jill Kopelman was a girl of 9 or 10, she would
accompany her father, Arie L. Kopelman, the president of Chanel
Inc., on business trips to Paris, and among the fashion players she
liked to watch were Elizabeth Saltzman and Andre Leon Talley, both
editors at Conde Nast. Little did they know they were helping a
young writer sharpen her eye and ear for the nuances of the fashion
world.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Kopelman, now 25, said shortly before filming began on
``Intern,'' a romantic comedy she and her friend Caroline Doyle
wrote, ``I would sit in the Ritz bar and, like, eavesdrop on their
conversations while my parents talked about taxes or something.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, as extras took their places at Il Cantinori,
the restaurant on East 10th Street, Ms. Saltzman, the fashion
director of Vanity Fair, and Talley, the editor-at-large at Vogue,
were ready for their close-ups. They are playing themselves in the
movie. And so, too, will the designers Tommy Hilfiger, Cynthia
Rowley, John Bartlett and Narciso Rodriguez. Making a cameo
appearance at Il Cantinori was the actress Gwyneth Paltrow. Ms.
Paltrow, who won the Oscar this year for best actress, has been a
close friend of Ms. Doyle's since they were at Spence, the Upper
East Side girls' school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy for her and Jill,'' Ms. Paltrow said, as her hair
was being combed out on the first day of filming. ``They're so
talented, and the script is funny and irreverent. I think this is
the beginning of a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about a 23-year-old fashion magazine intern, played
by Dominique Swain, who from the bottom of the heap gets to observe
the narcissism of fashion's upper reaches. The script is mean,
outrageous and darkly funny, and it reflects the writers'
experiences as interns at Harper's Bazaar, Mademoiselle and
Interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters are all based on real editors,'' Ms. Kopelman
said. ``The most hyperbolic scenes are 100 percent true. All the
actors who came in for auditions said: `This is crazy! How did you
think this up?' But it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing a scene in which the movie's heroine, Jocelyn, is
approached by the beauty editor of the fictional magazine Skirt, Ms
Doyle said: ``The editor walks up to Jocelyn and says, `Bob.' And
she says, `No, Jocelyn.' And the editor says, `No, you need a
bob.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doyle smiled. ``That happened to me. Then the real editor
said: `Look at this picture of Linda Evangelista. You don't know
how many thousands of people would kill for my advice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doyle, who was a Russian studies major at Barnard College
and spent three years in Moscow helping to start the Russian
edition of Marie Claire before she decided to leave magazines and
write ``Intern,'' added: ``There's that fine line being an intern
at a fashion magazine. You don't know if you're supposed to be
going to get the dry cleaning of the person you're working for. Or
sending flowers to her friends or buying gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kopelman interjected, ``Or retyping Rolodexes.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its perversity and potential for satire, the fashion
world (and its parallel universe of fashion magazines) has proven
resistant to the comic skills of filmmakers. No director, with the
exception of Stanley Donen, who made the 1957 movie ``Funny Face,''
has been able to do much more than sneer at a few eccentric home
folk _ and Donen had the advantage of working in an era that still
could be amused by a character not unlike Diana Vreeland, who coos
such lines as ``Think pink!''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen failed to excite audiences with his 1998 film
``Celebrity,'' and of course, there was the famous letdown of
``Ready to Wear,'' which the director Robert Altman filmed in 1994
during the Paris collections. Altman seemed to have everything
going for him. He had big stars, credentials, the involvement of
the fashion world _ everything that is, except a cliche-free
script.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only filmmaker who got the fashion world right was
Douglas Keeve, who made ``Unzipped,'' the 1995 documentary about
Isaac Mizrahi. That was in part because Keeve had access to
Mizrahi, and in part because his humor was at right angles to the
fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intern,'' which will also star Peggy Lipton and Joan Rivers
(as a swooning editor), is being made on a shoestring budget of $1
million. Its producers, Galt Niederhoffer and Daniela Soto-Taplin
of Given Films in SoHo, made the 1997 film ``Hurricane Street'' and
later this year will produce the film version of ``Prozac Nation,''
starring Christina Ricci. They don't think of ``Intern'' as
strictly a fashion movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Cinderella story,'' Ms. Soto-Taplin said, referring to
the office romance that blossoms between Ms. Swain's character,
Jocelyn, and Paul, the magazine's token heterosexual male, played
by a newcomer, Ben Pullen. Ms. Niederhoffer added that neither she
nor her partner knew much about fashion and that they decided to
produce the script simply because they were charmed by its language
and array of characters, like a model named Resin whose best friend
is called Aloha.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in Amber and Shalom,'' Ms. Kopelman said with a grin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The story behind ``Intern'' is every aspiring screenwriter's
dream. Last fall, Ms. Doyle and Ms. Kopelman, who had graduated
from Yale University and was working at Interview, decided to quit
their jobs and write a screenplay, working mostly on the Doyles'
dining room table. Ms. Doyle's mother, Kathleen Doyle, owns William
Doyle Galleries, the the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just broken my engagement, Ms. Kopelman recalled, and
her mother and father ``were devastated.'' ``Then I announced I was
going to write a screenplay,'' she added. ``My parents are the best
parents, but I think it was just the odds that were speaking to
them. Every busboy across America has a script.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a month they had finished ``Intern.'' It took them
another month to find an agent, although it was Ms. Kopelman who
sent the script to Ms. Niederhoffer, whom she knew through a mutual
friend. The day before Ms. Niederhoffer called to say she wanted to
buy the script, both Ms. Doyle and Ms. Kopelman were offered jobs
with magazines that anyone eager to move out of their parents'
apartments would have accepted. But they declined.
</P>
<P>
   And even though it took just a week to sell the script, with no
strings attached like rewriting, Ms. Kopelman said her parents
remained cautious. ``They didn't want me to get excited,'' she
said. ``They were, like `That's great. We're happy for you, but
don't get your hopes up because these kind of things often don't
get made.' They really didn't believe it until it was in Variety.''
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriters will serve as associate producers of the film.
They were involved with choosing the director, Michael Lange, whose
credits include episodes of ``The X-Files'' and ``The Tracey Ullman
Show,'' and they went to auditions for the cast. Indeed, it is
through their New York connections, both personal and professional,
that Ms. Doyle and Ms. Kopelman have been able to arrange some of
the locations during the four weeks of filming (including the
Chanel offices and the Doyle Galleries). Graydon Carter, the editor
in chief of Vanity Fair, said they could film in his magazine's
offices _ provided they cast his summer intern. ``It seemed a fair
ransom,'' Ms. Kopelman conceded. They helped to entice Jimmy
Hanrahan, who does costumes for MTV, to handle wardrobe. And of
course, they brought in Ms. Saltzman, Ms. Paltrow and Talley.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Talley, who wore a white Fendi mink coat for his scene
at Il Cantinori, needed much enticement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great script,'' Talley told Ms. Kopelman with a
flourish of his hand. ``I'll tell you, I wouldn't have done it if
it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kopelman beamed. ``Well, we're so psyched,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The young women, no longer novices, have already written their
second script, and have formed their own production company, which
they are calling Skirt Films, after the magazine in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they plan to do next, Ms. Kopelman laughed and said,
``We want to get a new agent.''

HOUSE STOPS FUNDING FOR PURCHASE OF FIRST F-22 FIGHTERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House panel dealt a potential death blow Monday
to the Air Force's 21st-century flagship, the F-22 jet fighter,
voting to withhold the $1.8 billion that had been budgeted to buy
the first of the planes.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee that appropriates military money told the
Air Force to rethink or reject the $70 billion program, which is
behind schedule and $1 billion over budget. It ``sent a signal to
the Air Force saying, `We want you to seek a new direction,''' said
the committee chairman, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force intends the F-22 to be its premier fighter for the
first half of the 21st century, replacing the F-15. But the
unanimous decision by the House Appropriations Committee's defense
subcommittee, which includes some of the most dedicated hawks in
Congress, put the program's future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has three fighter jets on the drawing board _ the
F-22, the Joint Strike Fighter, and an updated F-18. The
subcommittee said Monday that this may be one plane too many. The
three jets have a combined price of about $350 billion, a sum far
in excess of the entire Pentagon budget for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not enough money to fund all these three programs,''
said the subcommittee's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Murtha of
Pennsylvania. ``Down the road, the money's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis concurred. ``I do not believe we can afford three lines of
tactical fighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 has passed only 5 percent of its flight tests. Its
manufacturers are having trouble connecting the plane's wings to
its body and perfecting the cockpit computers that drive its
navigation and war-fighting systems, government auditors say. But
the Air Force and the main contractor, Lockheed Martin, were set on
building 438 of the fighters, at a cost that independent estimates
have placed at $70 billion and rising.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Air Force were on the verge of giving Lockheed
Martin billions to begin building the first 16 planes in 2000 and
2001. But government critics of the program, including the auditors
of the General Accounting Office, called that plan a
``buy-before-you-fly'' boondoggle.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Rodrigues, a senior GAO official, questioned in testimony
before Congress in March whether the Air Force wanted to put
billions into an ``increasing rate of production on an aircraft
we're having trouble producing.'' The House Armed Services
Committee reported in May that it was ``concerned by significant
increases in F-22 budgets'' and ``disturbed by the prospect of
higher costs and increased program risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to eliminate financing for the first F-22s, made in
secret Monday morning and officially announced at 4 p.m., shocked
the Air Force and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously surprised,'' said Tom Burbage, president of
Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems in Marietta, Ga., which had
mounted a large and sophisticated advertising program to build
public and political support for the F-22 program. ``We do not
understand the subcommittee's rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officers said Monday night that they had just learned
of the move and were trying to gauge its severity. A senior
Pentagon official said ``the Department of Defense was surprised
and disappointed'' by the decision and would work to reverse it.
</P>
<P>
   The House panel left $1.2 billion for F-22 research and
development in its spending bill, giving the program a chance to
continue. But unless the panel rescinds its decision on the $1.8
billion, the first F-22s cannot be built. With criticism coming
from across the political spectrum of the House, the program is in
peril.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the first jets was redirected to other Air Force
programs. Had it been spent to buy the F-22s, members of the
defense appropriations panel said, the $70 billion program could
have gone forward regardless of its technical problems and costs,
driven by a too-late-to-stop-now mentality that has propelled
troubled Pentagon programs in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wait much longer before we take this step, there'll
never be a chance to get off this track,'' Lewis said. ``You'd
better do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress rarely kills major military procurement programs
outright, preferring to let them die lingering deaths or have the
Pentagon perform the coup de grace. The last big Air Force fighter
program to be eliminated was the A-12 fighter, shot down by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney in 1992 after he determined that he had been
deceived about the plane's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.8 billion for the first F-22s remains in the Senate's
version of the Pentagon spending bill. Once the full House passes
its military spending measure, the two bills must be reconciled.
Lewis and Murtha said they thought the Senate would concur with the
decision to eliminate the money for the F-22s.

 &HT;    'Bodies were all over the house': 5 adults, 2 children found
dead
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It could be days before police learn what happened at
3783 Adamsville Drive Monday, the site of Atlanta's worst mass
killing this century.
</P>
<P>
   The case so far depends largely on the accounts of the sole
survivor, an 11-year-old boy who was shot in the elbow and hid in a
closet for eight hours before fleeing to a neighbor's house.
</P>
<P>
   Five adults and two children, ages 9 and 11, were found shot
inside the house on the quiet residential street. Investigators
said the motive was unclear and they had scant details by Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bodies were all over the house,'' said Deputy Chief C.B.
Jackson of the Atlanta Police Department. ``We're investigating it
currently as a multiple homicide. The possibility does exist that
one of the persons inside, who is also deceased, is responsible for
all the shootings and that injury to himself was self-inflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting began about 6 a.m. and did not last long, Jackson
said the boy told police.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called at 2:38 p.m. by Evelyn Broadus, who lives
next to the house where the killings occurred in southwest Atlanta
off Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The neighborhood is made up of
single-family homes with well-kept yards, and residents described
it as quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Broadus heard a knock at her door in the early afternoon and
found her 11-year-old neighbor, shivering, his arm bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Georgia Hall said the boy told her his stepfather had
shot ``everyone in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `My stepfather shot my mama, my auntie, my brother,
everyone,' '' Hall said, shaking her head. ``We immediately called
911. We could not believe what had happened. We just called the
police and sat with the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But when officers arrived, they were kept at bay by a
Rotteweiler and a pit bull, which stood inside the entrance
guarding the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took investigators almost three hours to get inside,'' said
police spokesman John Quigley. ``The dogs would not let them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Animal Control officials coaxed the dogs out and
put them into two small trucks. Homicide detectives, uniformed
officers and a handful of top brass then spilled into the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might imagine, there are bodies in a number of rooms,
there is quite a bit of blood,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers found at least one weapon in the house, Jackson said.
Family members and friends who flocked to the neighborhood said two
of the adults shot were sisters Dana Briskey and Essie Hugeley. The
women's grandmother, Hattie Mae Hugeley, arrived at the house after
hearing about the killings from her grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking a nap and my grandson ran into the bedroom and
said, `Grandma are you watching the news? I think Dana and Essie
and some of their kids have been murdered,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two women were my granddaughters. This hurts. This hurts
a lot. Those children are my great-grandchildren and they're
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Police would not identify the dead and did not say how they were
related.
</P>
<P>
   No previous mass killing in Atlanta claimed as many victims, at
least as far back as the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as December 1995, two men sprayed bullets into men
playing cards in a ramshackle house, killing four. Brothers Elijah
and Freeman Salahuddin were charged with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's killing brought back memories of the notorious 1973
Alday family murders in Seminole County, Ga. The family interrupted
a burglary at their mobile home by three escaped Maryland
prisoners. Ned Alday, his brother Aubrey, sons Jerry, Chester and
Jimmy, and Jerry's wife, Mary were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving boy of Monday's shooting was awake, alert and in
good condition, officials at Grady Memorial Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's interacted fairly well with the physicians and nursing
staff of the emergency department answering questions
appropriately, given the things that he's gone through,'' Dr. Leon
Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Fuller, who lives two doors down from the boy, described
the him as a smart, happy go-lucky child.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just as sweet as he could be, and God had to be with
him for him to hide,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Jocynta and Kiera Lewis stood outside watching the house
they had visited many times, since Briskey and Essie Hugeley moved
there almost four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They said the sisters lived there with their children and a man
who had been dating Briskey for about a year. They said Briskey and
Essie Hugeley were close and loving with their children and that
the man was often seen playing and talking with the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Said 22-year-old Jocynta Lewis, tears streaming down her face:
``What could have set this man off this way?''

 Wells Exec's Comments Raise SEC Eyebrows  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Commission recently challenged Wells
Fargo about the bank's apparently contradictory statements on job
cuts following its merger with Minnesota's Norwest in November.
<P>
   The bank said the federal watchdog agency queried it after Chief
Operating Officer Leslie Biller told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune
in March that a 5 percent staff cutback described in the bank's
1998 annual report was something ``we don't even think is going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of a top executive publicly disparaging the bank's
official financial statement prompted the SEC to write in April
asking for an explanation, Wells Fargo spokesman Larry Haeg said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the agency wanted to know whether Biller's comment
meant that a $280 million charge the bank took for merger-related
severance costs in the fourth quarter of 1998 wasn't warranted. The
SEC is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of public financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``They said, `You accrued $280 million for position
eliminations. Have things changed?''' said Haeg.
</P>
<P>
   The bank told the SEC that it believed its job-cut projections
were accurate and the severance charge proper. The agency sent a
letter asking for further clarification in May and has not
contacted the bank since, Haeg said.
</P>
<P>
   SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But, speaking generally, Heine said the agency often asks
companies to justify accounting actions if there is evidence they
weren't appropriate. The SEC can force companies to restate
earnings if financial reports already have been issued.
</P>
<P>
   The letters were from the SEC's division of corporation finance,
which supervises accounting practices. Such queries aren't
potentially as serious as inquiries from the agency's enforcement
division, which can result in fines or other sanctions if
violations of securities laws are found.
</P>
<P>
   Biller's comments reflected the bank's eagerness to portray
itself as a friendly employer even as it was slashing about 4,600
of its total of 92,000 full-time positions. The job cuts are
scheduled to take place through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Norwest bought Wells Fargo, took its name and made
San Francisco the headquarters of the combined bank. Although the
old Wells Fargo was known as a hard-driving employer, Norwest had a
reputation for pampering its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the merger, the bank has stressed finding new jobs for
employees whose positions are scheduled to disappear as duplicate
operations of the two banks are shut.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new Wells Fargo issued its annual report early this
year, the bank had claimed that it didn't know how many positions
it would eliminate as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has said it was reluctant to disclose a specific number
because it feared doing so would cast a spotlight on the
destruction of jobs rather than on its programs to keep and retrain
displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les was concerned that a discussion of job elimination would
have a negative effect on morale,'' Haeg said.

N.Y. TIMES CO.   EXECUTIVE NAMED PUBLISHER AT BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a surprise move that ended 126 years of leadership
of The Boston Globe by the Taylor family, The New York Times Co.
Monday replaced publisher Benjamin B. Taylor with Richard H.
Gilman, senior vice president of operations at the Times.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove Taylor, 52, was made by Times publisher
and company chairman Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and by Times company
president and CEO Russell T. Lewis, according to Times spokeswoman
Nancy Nielsen. But it was new publisher Gilman, 48, who faced the
Globe editorial staff Monday to explain the dramatic development
that came six years after the Times purchased the Globe for $1.04
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While choosing not to discuss the details of why the Times
acted, Gilman, whose appointment became effective Monday, cited
``differences in approaches to management.'' This led to
speculation that stylistic and corporate cultural differences
between New York and Boston _ at a time when the Globe is
struggling with declining circulation and sagging classified
revenues _ may have played a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   In a noontime meeting with Globe newsroom employees, Gilman
captured the mood of the day by acknowledging that ``this catches a
lot of people, including myself, a little bit by surprise. . . .
Any time there is a dramatic change, and this certainly qualifies
as a dramatic change, it's an emotional moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman emphasized that ``the citizens of Boston and all of you
are justifiably proud of your newspaper'' and vowed to continue a
major ``investment in the quality of journalism.'' In an interview
later in the day, he also stressed that no further changes were
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other shoe to drop here. I'm here by myself. That's
the only change that's on the horizon,'' Gilman said, adding he had
``complete confidence'' in editor Matthew V. Storin and editorial
page editor H.D.S. Greenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been given complete reassurance about our editorial
independence,'' Storin said. ``They have said all the right things
both publicly and privately. But this is business. There are no
guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who will remain as chairman of the Globe Newspaper
Company Board, said Monday that Gilman's arrival in Boston ``could
be good for the Globe because one of our ongoing challenges is
educating New York about all the good things that are going on at
The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from the journalistic community seemed to be a mix of
resignation and concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the bottom line is that even The New York Times, which
operates at a very high standard of journalism, must move to the
same economic and technological impulses that drive the entire
industry,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of Harvard's Joan
Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. ``We will
have to see what impact this has on the editorial side of the
paper. . . . Will The Boston Globe shrink from being a major
regional paper to a smaller paper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that strikes me as noteworthy is that these
companies were attracted to each other because the Taylors and
Sulzbergers were members of a shrinking tradition'' of local,
family-run newspaper companies, said Tom Rosenstiel, director of
the Project for Excellence in Journalism. ``It's noteworthy that
under the ownership of The New York Times, that shrinking family
(management) is down by one.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo distributed to the Globe staff Monday, Gilman singled
out the twin problems of declining newspaper readership and the
erosion of classified advertising as two issues that have surfaced
at the Globe in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any surprise . . . that we consider Sunday
circulation the single biggest challenge,'' said Taylor. For the
six-month period ending in March, the Sunday Globe's circulation
was 730,420, compared with 751,377 two years earlier, and the paper
is now concentrating its efforts on building up the Sunday numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released at last month's meeting of Globe
department heads, total classified advertising in 1999 was down 4.5
percent from last year. And an April press release announcing the
Times Co.'s first quarter 1999 earnings pointedly noted that
``performance was strong at The New York Times and the Regional
Newspaper Group, where ad revenues increased 5.4 percent and 6.7
percent, and weak at The Boston Globe, where help wanted
advertising continued to soften.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Taylor told the staff Monday that the Globe's financial
picture is solid, with a ``very real prospect that we will have our
third record year (of earnings) in a row'' and a 25 percent margin.
Newspaper analyst John Morton concurred, saying ``certainly there's
nothing in the performance of The Boston Globe to suggest that any
change was in order. It's the Sulzbergers' own newspaper. They can
do whatever they damn please.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that reality, much of the speculation Monday centered on
what both Taylor and Gilman alluded to as differences in management
technique, with observers suggesting that differences between the
harder-charging New York style and the Taylors' more conservative
bent _ as well as the Times' desire for more centralized control of
the Globe _ may have proved to be a crucial factor in the change of
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people inside the Globe, Monday was a day to
contemplate the end of the stewardship of the Taylor family, which
built a reputation through the generations for loyal, benevolent
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a morning meeting of department heads that she
characterized as ``very stunned and sad,'' columnist Ellen Goodman
recalled how ``most of us have worked for at least two generations
of Taylors and (how) we've been very lucky to have the family as
publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, William O. Taylor, who retired in 1997
after 20 years as publisher, noted: ``This is a very sad day for
both Ben and myself as our family winds up a long career managing
this newspaper. I hope the history books will be kind to both of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the large noontime gathering, Gilman asked for a round of
applause for Benjamin Taylor, who began his career as a Globe
reporter more than a quarter-century ago. As the staff rose for a
long and emotional standing ovation, Taylor slowly got up from his
seat and waved _ almost reluctantly, shyly _ to those who had
suddenly become his former employees.

FEDERAL LAWSUIT ACCUSES TOYOTA OF VIOLATING CLEAN AIR ACT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The federal government sued Toyota on Monday, accusing
it of violating the Clean Air Act by selling 2.2 million cars on
which the ``check engine'' light would not illuminate even when the
vehicles are emitting excessive pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of similar disputes
pitting the government against automakers and truck makers. In each
case, the government has contended that the vehicles' computer
diagnostic equipment had been programmed to meet federal standards
during laboratory tests, but not during actual driving on the road.
</P>
<P>
   What sets the Toyota case apart is the company's decision to
fight the government in court. In previous cases involving General
Motors in 1995, Honda a year ago and seven manufacturers of
heavy-duty diesel engines last October, the manufacturers chose to
pay fines and take remedial action before litigation began.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's stance in theory exposes it to large penalties.
Christine Romano, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that under
the Clean Air Act, Toyota could face a fine of $25,000 to $27,500
for each of 2.2 million vehicles that allegedly failed to comply,
depending on when each vehicle was sold.
</P>
<P>
   But the maximum possible penalty, nearly $60 billion, is
extremely unlikely. The law directs judges to consider a company's
economic gain from pollution, its previous environmental record and
its ability to stay in business if it pays the maximum fine. Toyota
has a fairly good environmental record, its gains from the alleged
pollution are unclear and the maximum fine would equal eight months
of its global sales.
</P>
<P>
   Previous settlements out of court have been much smaller. Honda,
for example, settled a similar dispute a year ago involving 1.7
million Honda and Acura automobiles. To offset any emissions from
vehicles with poorly functioning warning lights, Honda extended the
warranty on all of these vehicles' emissions equipment to 14 years
or 150,000 miles instead of three years or 36,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Honda also paid $10.1 million in federal fines and $2.5 million
in fines to California, which also accused the automaker of
violating state rules. And Honda agreed to pay for $1 million of
federal environmental research and $3.5 million of environmental
research by California. The $17.1 million in payments plus the
warranty costs were considerably less than the company's likely
liability of more than $42.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   California also ordered Toyota last September to come up with a
plan to fix 330,000 vehicles sold there that are among the 2.2
million vehicles involved in the federal case. Toyota refused, and
hearings began Monday before an administrative law judge in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal case, Toyota on Friday rejected a federal
settlement offer that included a fine of $75 per car, making the
cost in excess of $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute involves vehicles' so-called evaporative
emissions of unburned gasoline, which contributes to smog. Toyota
contends that state and federal rules only require vehicles'
warning lights to meet tests in laboratories. Tiny quantities of
gasoline fumes constantly escape from a vehicle's gas cap and from
joints in the gasoline tank and fuel lines. These losses are
monitored by vehicles in recent model years using systems that
measure the pressure of the gasoline vapor in the system. A warning
light is supposed to go on when the pressure falls while the
ignition is on.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed Monday in the federal court for the
District of Columbia, the Justice Department said that Toyota had
put computer software into its vehicle that caused the engine light
to turn on only when unacceptable evaporative emissions coincided
with a certain pattern of stops and accelerations. This pattern is
used in the test but rarely occurs in the real world, the complaint
said, adding that Toyota did not disclose the existence of the
software to regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The rules do not give regulators the authority to conduct random
checks, as they have done, of whether the vehicles actually perform
in use the way they did in the laboratory, said Joseph Tetherow, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles, ``only had to meet lab tests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When California first adopted rules in 1991 regarding the
evaporative emissions and the activation of engine lights, Toyota
developed a system and it passed the state's laboratory tests and
was certified for use, Tetherow said, adding, ``They said it was in
compliance, they gave their approval before we went ahead and put
it in our vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California Air Resources
Board, said that, ``in-use compliance has always been a part of the
board's program.'' Regardless of how the administrative law judge
rules, the board can subsequently rule for or against the company,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental regulators contend that without reliable warning
lights, consumers will not know when their vehicles start producing
unacceptable levels of pollution. Carol Browner, the administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency, said Monday night that,
``Today's action shows this administration's commitment to insure
that companies will not profit from polluting and that the public
health will be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed Monday's lawsuit on behalf of the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The suit covers most of Toyota's vehicles from the 1996 through
1998 model years. Specifically, it covers Lexus cars as well as
Toyota Camry, Avalon, Corolla, Tercel, and Paseo cars; Sienna
minivans; 4Runner and RAV4 sport utility vehicles; and Tacoma and
T100 pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Tetherow said that none of the vehicles involved posed any
threat to the environment or public safety. If the warning lights
on all of these vehicles failed, the combined annual evaporation of
hydrocarbons from their fuel tanks and engines would be equal to
the painting of two medium-sized houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act allows a maximum penalty of $25,000 per
vehicle sold by Jan. 31, 1997, and $27,500 per vehicle sold after
that. Toyota sold 588,650 vehicles in the 1996 model year with the
contested emissions systems, 857,620 in the 1997 model year and
735,897 in the 1998 model year.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Romano said she did not have the precise number sold
before Jan. 31, 1997 _ when the peak penalty rose _ making it
impossible to calculate precisely the maximum overall penalty
possible in the case.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Chip Equipment Industry Is Back From the Brink  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
After a devastating 1998, the semiconductor equipment industry _
the companies that make the machines that make chips _ is back on
the growth curve.
<P>
   As equipment-makers and their customers gathered at the Moscone
Center yesterday for the 29th annual Semicon West trade show, the
mood was mostly upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the industry was mired in its sharpest decline in
recent memory, battered by the Asian economic crisis, technological
uncertainties and a glut of unsold chips and PCs. But in recent
months, sales of new equipment have been recovering, and industry
leaders now project continued improvement as chipmakers retool to
accommodate new markets and changes in manufacturing technology.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the trade association that sponsors Semicon West
anticipates so much growth that it's contemplating moving the
sprawling show out of the Bay Area, on the grounds that the region
lacks the exhibit facilities and hotel space that will be required
in future years. The weeklong show, which this year features almost
4,400 booths and is expected to attract some 75,000 attendees, is
already split in two: One segment runs through tomorrow
Wednesday &LR; at the Moscone Center, while a second will be staged in
San Jose tomorrow through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a year makes,'' said Stanley T. Myers,
president of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International,
the trade group that sponsors the show. According to a survey of
member companies that together account for about 80 percent of the
industry's total sales, revenues for 1999 should be up 9 percent
from over &LR; last year, to a total of $23.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's still short of industry revenues before last year's
21-percent drop. But companies responding to the survey projected
18.3 percent growth next year, which would bring the total back to
its historic high, and then further growth of 21.8 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, however, have yet to benefit from the upturn.
``It's bifurcated recovery,'' said Mark FitzGerald, vice president
of securities research and economics at Merrill Lynch in San
Francisco. ``The companies doing well are those delivering advanced
technology that can help chip manufacturers get their costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Makers of chips destined for use in PCs are the equipment
manufacturers' largest customers, and pressures growing out of
declining prices and intense competition in the PC market are
``filtering down through the whole food chain,'' FitzGerald said.
</P>
<P>
   These cost pressures are hitting just as the industry is facing
what Myers called ``a materials revolution.'' For nearly 20 years,
most chips have been made with the same basic set of raw materials.
But now, chipmakers are replacing aluminum, the material
traditionally used for the microscopic wires connecting the
millions of transistors on their products, with copper, which
offers better performance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the industry is moving to a new production process
that reduces the size of on-chip circuits from .25 micron to .18
micron _ about a five-hundredth the width of a human hair. And it's
starting to make its chips out of silicon wafers 12 inches in
diameter, instead of the current 8-inch wafer format.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hype as well as the new-product announcements at the
show involved copper. Novellus Systems of San Jose took over the
Yerba Buena Center for the Arts for a multimedia extravaganza,
including a nauseating ride on a rocket-ship simulator, designed to
turn showgoers into ``agents of change'' promoting the move to
copper.
</P>
<P>
   KLA-Tencor, a San Jose company that specializes in diagnostic
and yield-improvement tools, also created a 3-D video tour of the
inside of a chip to show how its new electron-beam monitoring
device can detect flaws in copper-based production.
</P>
<P>
   Novellus and others hope the transition to new materials will
help them gain ground on the traditional industry leader, Applied
Materials of Santa Clara, whose 1998 revenues of $4 billion made it
roughly twice as big as the next largest player, Japan's Tokyo
Electron.
</P>
<P>
   James Morgan, Applied's CEO since 1976, insisted his company,
noted for the breadth of its product line, is ready for the
challenge. ``There are seven fundamental processes in chip
production, and we have a lead in most of them,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Semicon West's future in the Bay Area, the trade group is
committed to keeping the show here in 2000 and 2001, but hasn't
made a decision about subsequent years. Myers said the group has
considered sites in Austin, Boston and especially Las Vegas. The
main problem, he said, is the shortage of hotel and exhibit space
here.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco currently ranks 12th in the nation in convention
space, according to Doug Neilson, vice president of the San
Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. Moscone West, a new
building scheduled to open in 2003, will add 300,000 square feet to
the center's current 442,00 square feet of exhibit space, he said,
but even that might not be enough for Semicon West, currently the
largest show, in terms of exhibit space, held here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the other advantages San Francisco offers will
keep them here,'' said Neilson. ``But ultimately the city is never
going to be a place for mega-trade shows _ we just don't have the
space here.''

 &HT;    UGA reviews racial policies
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The University of Georgia is reviewing its admissions
policies after a federal judge ruled they stigmatize minority
students and amount to reverse discrimination, UGA President
Michael F. Adams said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield of Savannah, Ga.,
dismissed a contentious affirmative action lawsuit against the
Board of Regents on a technicality that the student applicant
lacked standing to bring his claims.
</P>
<P>
   But the Regents' legal victory was accompanied by the federal
judge's stinging condemnation of UGA's policies that allow racial
preference in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``jaw-dropping'' revelations that UGA's admissions
policies benefit only a handful of minority students, Edenfield
said: ``The court would be remiss if it didn't briefly note what
the record evidence now compels: UGA cannot constitutionally
justify the affirmative use of race in its admissions decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday, Adams said UGA, which has 6.2
percent black enrollment, is pleased that Edenfield's ruling last
week did not invalidate current admissions policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, it is clear that the judge is giving the
university advice about an area of the law that is evolving,''
Adams said. ``It is incumbent upon us to work with legal counsel,
the Regents and the university staff to review the institution's
current practices and policies to ensure that they do not
discriminate against anyone, while we continue our efforts
diligently to recruit qualified minority students.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen R. Portch, chancellor of the University System of
Georgia, said, ``Prolonged litigation is not in anyone's best
interest. The judge's views on UGA's admission policies, though,
pose some challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Parks, an Atlanta lawyer representing a student denied
admission to UGA in fall 1997, said he will appeal Edenfield's
dismissal of the lawsuit. If UGA does not change admissions
practices, Parks added, he has other plaintiffs ready to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see if UGA will take Judge Edenfield's language
to heart and amend or fix the program,'' Parks said. ``We have
another whole group of high school seniors who want to apply to UGA
next year and don't want their race or sex taken into consideration
in admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   UGA is the only public campus in Georgia that admits to using
race as an admissions factor. Each of the 34 schools in the
university system has individually crafted admissions policies that
must comply with minimum requirements set by the Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' lawsuit, filed in 1997, attacked UGA admissions policies
as well as those of the state's three historically black public
universities. But rulings by Edenfield, beginning in January, have
whittled away Parks' plaintiffs from the litigation. The judge
ruled that four plaintiffs who sued the historically black schools
lacked standing, as did a white female plaintiff denied admission
to UGA in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield granted Parks a single victory _ a claim brought by
Kirby Tracy, a white student denied admission to UGA in the fall of
1995. In a decision handed down in January, Edenfield ruled UGA's
previous ``dual-track'' admissions program was unconstitutional and
that Tracy could not compete on equal footing with UGA applicants
``solely on the basis of his skin color.''
</P>
<P>
   In an order issued July 6, Edenfield denied a motion by the
NAACP to reconsider his ruling in favor of Tracy. But he denied
Parks' bid for class-action status, and awarded Tracy $1 in damages
because Tracy has since transferred to UGA.
</P>
<P>
   In response to court decisions nationwide striking down one
affirmative action program after another, UGA in 1995 abandoned its
dual-track program. This now-defunct admissions process put some
black applicants in competition with each other at a lower
standard, without having to compete with non-black candidates.
</P>
<P>
   UGA now allows race to be one of several factors that help
applicants who fall below minimum grades and test scores required
for automatic admission.
</P>
<P>
   But UGA's current policy is more of the same, Edenfield wrote.
``In other words, it's still the same ship; UGA has simply
rearranged the deck chairs,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Green, who lives in Dalton, unsuccessfully sought
admission to UGA in fall 1997. His grades and test scores were too
low to gain automatic admission, but they were high enough to get
him further consideration. His application advanced to the final
stage of the admissions process, where it was read by two UGA
admissions counselors who gave him the lowest possible score. They
later testified they did not consider Green's race when making
their decision. UGA denied Green's application.
</P>
<P>
   Because Green's race was not a factor in the final stage of the
process, and because his race made no difference in the earlier
stages, he ``cannot say that he was prevented, because of his race,
from competing on an equal footing with non-whites,'' Edenfield
wrote. ``This is a huge disappointment for Craig,'' Parks said.
``It is a legally correct decision on the constitutionality of the
admissions process, but it's not a compassionate decision. . . .
It's a tragedy that the young man who chose to take on this system
and had it found unconstitutional does not get the benefit of a UGA
education.'' Green's lawsuit established UGA gave minority
applicants ``an automatic advantage over some whites when competing
for admission,'' all to justify UGA's need for ``diversity'' among
its student population, Edenfield wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Edenfield said UGA's desire for diversity was ill-defined
and hard to justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``State officials promote exactly what society does not need nor
tolerate: racial stereotyping, where government officials simply
assume that blacks, for example, think one way, and whites
another,'' Edenfield wrote. ``. . . UGA officials evidently
employed racial preferences first and asked questions later.''
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield added that any racial preference in admissions
``stigmatizes'' minority students, ``the vast majority of whom
earned admission without the benefit'' of any racial preference.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also expressed concern that UGA's race-based
admissions preferences achieve only ``an insignificant increase in
'racial diversity' at UGA.''
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Edenfield recited pre-trial testimony from John
Albright, associate director for undergraduate admissions, who was
asked whether black enrollment at UGA would drop if race were not
used as a factor in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may,'' Albright answered. ``. . . I would think it would
reduce it by a handful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This jaw-dropping revelation suggests that UGA is willing to
stigmatize its non-white students for the sake of a largely
symbolic racial preference,'' Edenfield wrote. ``This fact alone
should force any reasonable decision-maker to re-examine, if only
on simple practicality grounds, whether such racial preferences can
be justified at all.''

NEW GLOBE PUBLISHER BEGAN CAREER IN REPORTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Richard H. Gilman, like Benjamin B. Taylor, the man he
succeeds as publisher of The Boston Globe, began his newspaper
career as a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started my career in newspapering,'' the former New York
Times senior vice president of operations told Globe editorial
staff members Monday, ``as a cub reporter covering the night police
beat while I was going to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, 48, eventually rose to the position of assistant
managing editor at The Arizona Daily Star, in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a first-rate mind and had a rapid rise here,'' said Steve
Auslander, the Star's executive editor, in a telephone interview
Monday. ``He was well respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Auslander characterized Gilman's newsroom style as having been
``between hard charging and easy going _ a pretty good blend of the
two. If someone had told me (then) he'd be the publisher of a major
metropolitan newspaper, it wouldn't have surprised me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Gilman was happy to dwell on his
journalistic roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The love of newspapering actually began when I was in junior
high school and I produced a mimeographed newspaper about the
school. I delivered newspapers as a kid. I wrote a sports column in
the high school paper and covered school sports as a stringer for
the local paper. I did all those kinds of things. So I had those
newspaper instincts in my blood from a very early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman first worked for the Star while an undergraduate at the
University of Arizona. A government and journalism major, he
graduated in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The summer before his senior year, Gilman, a Detroit native,
worked as a reporter intern at The Detroit News. After graduation,
he returned to the Star. In addition to reporting, Gilman worked as
a copy editor, assistant city editor, and city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman left the paper to attend Harvard Business School. ``There
was a lot of talk about the business side of the business,'' he
recalled Monday. ``I came to the conclusion that if I really wanted
to have a future for myself, I ought to go to business school. It
was always my intention to return to newspapers. But once you get
caught up in that, it's not that easy to jump back over the fence
and return to the news side.'' He earned an MBA in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   During his time at Harvard ``I became a fan of the Globe,''
Gilman said at Monday's staff meeting. ``To me, (Globe
sportswriters) Peter Gammons and Will McDonough walked on water.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman joined the Times in 1983 as assistant to the vice
president of circulation. He spent the next four years working in
the paper's circulation department, followed by three years in
several production posts. He was named vice president for systems
and technology in 1992 and senior vice president a year later. The
Times' circulation was added to his responsibilities last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman and his wife Wendy have a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A sports fan and history buff, he said he welcomed the return to
Boston. ``My wife and I had been in New York maybe three months
(after getting his Harvard degree) and I remember driving down a
highway and turning to her and saying, `You know, Boston really is
a great city.' ''

NEW JERSEY WATER-MAIN LEAK REPAIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORADELL, N.J. _ A major water main that began leaking Sunday was
repaired Monday, ending the third water emergency in a decade for
about 750,000 residents of Bergen and Hudson Counties.
</P>
<P>
   The leak, which started about 4 a.m. Sunday, led officials to
ban on all outdoor use of water and to appeal to residents to boil
water for drinking. The leak reduced water pressure to some homes
and apartments in Fort Lee, Tenafly, Englewood Cliffs and Alpine,
touched off a run on bottled water in some stores, and prompted
some worried fire chiefs to summon volunteer firefighters for
stand-by duty.
</P>
<P>
   United Water Resources, the Harrington Park utility that owns
the 78-inch main, reported that repairs were completed by
mid-afternoon Monday, without any of the major supply disruptions
that followed ruptures in the company's mains in March 1989 and
February 1996. The 1996 rupture left between 35,000 and 50,000
customers without water for three days. In the latest break, Sgt.
Dwane Razzetti, deputy coordinator of Bergen County's emergency
management office, said about 20 homes, all in Alpine, lost their
water for brief periods Sunday night and again Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Henning, a spokesman for United Water, said the company
gradually began flowing water through the 78-inch pipe about 4 p.m.
Monday and hopes to return it to full capacity sometime Tuesday.
Henning said a gasket failed at an elbow joint in the pipe on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The water main is the biggest in United Water's distribution
system and carries the bulk of water treated at the company's
purification plant at Oradell Reservoir, Henning said. After it was
shut down, the company relied on two 36-inch pipes that led from
the treatment plant, imported water from the Jersey City water
system and the Passaic Valley Water Commission and used supplies
stored in above-ground tanks throughout Bergen and Hudson Counties,
Henning said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy demands on water between 7 and 9 p.m. Sunday drained a
tank in Englewood Cliffs, creating the scattered pressure problems
in towns on and near the Palisades, Henning said.
</P>
<P>
   At Engine Company One, one of four fire houses in Fort Lee, one
volunteer fireman, Ralph Porrino, a private investigator, was on
emergency duty. He had planned to spend the day tracking down a
bail jumper. Another volunteer on stand-by, Bill Thompson, who is
retired, gave up a day of fun. ``I'd be up in New Milford in my
sister's pool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Food Emporium, a 24-hour supermarket in Fort Lee,
customers gobbled up one and two gallon jugs of water as quickly as
clerks put them on shelves. Sales had doubled since Sunday night,
the manager, Jim Vitel, said. ``We're trying to keep up with
demand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Lee dentist, Michael Schneider, turned off the tap water
in his office and filled patients' rinsing cups with Evian water.
``They're getting kind of a kick out of it,'' he said. ``I just
wanted to be on the safe side.''

HUGE DEBATE OVER PG&AMP;E SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The fate of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s crown jewels will be
debated today when a state Senate committee takes up a bill that
would determine under what conditions the company could spin off
its vast hydroelectric system and what impact that transfer would
have on consumers.
<P>
   PG&AMP;E, which has already sold its fossil-fuel plants to other
companies, now wants to transfer its valuable hydropower system to
an unregulated sister company. The San Francisco utility thinks
that it can earn more profits from the system if it is freed from
price regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for making that transfer, state Sen. Debra
Bowen, Marina del Rey (Los Angeles County), wants to require that
any new owner meet more-stringent environmental standards and agree
to pricing restrictions to make sure it doesn't abuse its market
power. In addition, Bowen wants to ensure that the system, if it is
transferred, is valued at a price that benefits PG&AMP;E ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other conditions are contained in a bill, SB1063, that
will be heard by the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications
Committee this afternoon. Bowen authored the bill and chairs the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first piece of legislation to emerge from a
three-month debate concerning how _ or whether _ PG&AMP;E should be
allowed to divest its &UR;  &LR; hydropower system.
</P>
<P>
   The future of that system is critically important because its
touches everyone in Northern California who drinks water, uses
electricity or cares about the state's environment.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E's hydroelectric system is the largest under private
ownership in North America and, many believe, the world. The system
consists of 68 powerhouses and 94 dams on 16 river systems that
collectively produce 3,890 megawatts of power _ enough to light 4
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   But its value springs from more than just its electric output.
</P>
<P>
   Hydroelectric power can be ramped up and down more quickly than
any other source of electricity in response to minute-to-minute
fluctuations in demand. This means those 3,890 megawatts of
capacity have unrivaled ability to help stabilize the state's
electric system. As a result, PG&AMP;E's hydropower commands a premium
price over other kinds of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to supplying 15 percent of the state's power,
whoever controls PG&AMP;E's hydroelectric system largely controls the
flow of water out of the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2.6 million acre feet of water that run through PG&AMP;E's
hydroelectric system, the company has rights to sell 200,000 acre
feet for drinking and irrigation. That's enough to flood a
200,000-acre parcel of land with clear mountain water a foot deep.
</P>
<P>
   Those water rights are certain to appreciate as California grows
more densely populated. By 2020, the state is expected to have
added 15 million residents to its current 32 million, creating an
annual deficit of 2.4 million acre feet of water in normal-rainfall
years.
</P>
<P>
   The state is proposing to expand freshwater reservoirs to
provide for the needs of a thirsty state, and it's possible some of
that storage could be added to lands leased from PG&AMP;E, adding to
the value of that land.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, PG&AMP;E's hydropower empire includes 140,000 acres of
forestland surrounding PG&AMP;E generating facilities where generations
of Californians have camped, hiked and picnicked. It appears that
40,000 acres of this land could be carved out and sold to
developers.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen's legislation doesn't grant PG&AMP;E the right to transfer its
hydro system to its unregulated affiliate, such as PG&AMP;E Generating
Co. of Bethesda, Md., but it does establish restrictions that would
apply to any owner:
</P>
<P>
   _The owner would have to follow rules that prevent an operator
from exercising unfair market power in the sale of electricity. It
would not be allowed to sell power &UR;  &LR; for more than $20 per megawatt
hour, nor could it withhold capacity to force prices up.
</P>
<P>
   _It also would be required to craft an environmental plan by
December 31, 2001, showing how it would more speedily meet state
water quality standards. Instead of making improvements as power
projects come up for 30- or 50-year license renewals _ something
that will happen to half of PG&AMP;E's power stations during the next
10 years _ the owner would have to develop an expedited plan to
improve fish habitats by boosting water flows.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Bowen last week, a coalition of environmental
groups said, ``This transition should be used to ... reverse the
degradation'' that began in the 1860s with construction of water
canals and flumes by hydraulic gold miners. Those water diversions
later became part of PG&AMP;E's hydropower system.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most controversial provision of the Bowen bill
concerns how the waterpower system will be valued.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, PG&AMP;E proposed to the state Public Utilities
Commission that appraisers set the value. Ratepayer advocates
pummeled that idea, saying it would be impossible for appraisers to
arrive at a fair value because no comparable system has been
auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big problem is finding a value for hydro plants in the West
because they haven't been sold to date,'' said David Wagman,
research director for Resource Data International in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, sales of hydropower systems that are regarded as
inferior to PG&AMP;E's have sold for an average of $1,000 per megawatt,
Wagman said.
</P>
<P>
   Crude as that measure is, it suggests PG&AMP;E's system would be
worth a minimum of $3.89 billion. The price likely would climb with
recognition of water, real estate and other values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratepayers deserve the maximum amount of money, and the only
way you're going to get that is by auctioning the system,'' says
Jim Scarff, an attorney for the PUC's Office of Ratepayer
Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   How the system is valued is of crucial importance to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, PG&AMP;E must credit
ratepayers an amount equal to the value of the California
hydroelectric system, to offset billions of dollars of PG&AMP;E debts
that customers are being forced to repay. Most of these debts stem
from PG&AMP;E's Diablo Canyon nuclear plant and from contracts PG&AMP;E
signed to purchase power from high-cost sources such as windmills.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC estimates that ratepayers are still on the hook for
about $4 billion worth of such debts.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon (San Diego County), has been
trying to negotiate a price that PG&AMP;E Generating Co., the
unregulated affiliate, might pay. In legislative hearings last
spring, Peace said ratepayers should get at least $4 billion for
the hydro system.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E reportedly has balked at paying anything above $3.4
billion, sources said last week, and the discussions appear to have
hit a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E executives declined to comment for this story, and Peace
could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pick an arbitrary number, Bowen now proposes that an
interim value be set. If the interim value were high enough _ $3
billion to and  &LR; $3.5 billion _ it's possible that ratepayers could
end their debt repayment as early as April.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, rates could fall by 20 percent for residential
customers and small businesses, and up to 40 percent for large
business and industrial customers.
</P>
<P>
   There is bound to be fierce debate about the Bowen proposal.
Some consumer advocates believe that the state should not rush into
anything and forfeit a once-in-a-century opportunity to completely
re-examine the way land and rivers are used.
</P>
<P>
   Other states are tearing down dams, for example, and restoring
stretches of rivers to their primordial wildness. But there's no
such proposal here nor is there serious policy discussion of any
transfer of the system into public hands.
</P>
<P>
   Nettie Hoge, executive director of the consumer group The
Utility Reform Network, said she favors an interim valuation
because it will end the rate freeze. But she admits that it simply
defers the most vexing questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult questions aren't answered by this
legislation,'' Hoge says. ``Those questions still concern who gets
the hydroelectric system, ultimately, and what should we be doing
for the environment.''

FORT DIX BIDS FAREWELL TO KOSOVARS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DIX, N.J. _ Jane Checkan opened her arms to 8-year-old
Shqiponje Dushica, whose fingernails were painted purple and red,
and whose ears were somehow covered with stars in green ink from a
recent bingo game.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 24 hours, the girl and her family, refugees from
Slobodan Milosevic's murderous campaign in Kosovo, would leave the
refugee resettlement center here for Phoenix, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll come tomorrow to say goodbye,'' Ms. Checkan promised, her
voice cracking. ``Give you one last hug.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had she spoken than Shqiponje threw her arms around
the retired federal worker, who was one of scores of volunteers in
May when planeloads of refugees began arriving in Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the last of those refugees are leaving. By Friday, just 50
Kosovars will remain at Fort Dix, which turned itself virtually
overnight into a reception center for refugees from the overcrowded
camps in Macedonia. The massive resettlement operation here will
close down altogether by the end of this month, with 4,000 Kosovars
from Fort Dix sent to communities scattered across 40 states.
Another 5,000 Kosovars bypassed Fort Dix, and went directly to
relatives and sponsoring families upon their arrival in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The departures will also end the second incarnation as a refugee
reception center for Fort Dix, which took in refugees from the
Hungarian uprising of 1956. Traditionally the main boot camp for
soldiers from the Northeast, Fort Dix became a training camp for
reservists two years ago. Along with McGuire Air Force Base next
door, which can accommodate any size aircraft in the Pentagon's
arsenal, Fort Dix also serves as a staging area for U.S. forces
mobilizing for operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the movement of people through Fort Dix was
in rather than out, as the camp became what one military official
called ``a modern-day Ellis Island.'' While the refugees have been
here, regular reservists slept in tents. Their barracks had been
turned into dormitories for the arriving families, who were at one
time expected to swell to 6,000. The effort involved making steep
stairwells safe for toddlers, stocking playrooms with teddy bears
and toy carriages and finding plastic flowers that helped turn mess
halls into dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But if Fort Dix represented an unaccustomed flash of grace to
the Kosovars _ made homeless by their former countrymen and barely
tolerated in Macedonia _ it also appeared to transform not just the
buildings, but the people who worked here.
</P>
<P>
   The official, government-endorsed encouragement to be kind to
the victims seemed to have warmed the officials, soldiers and
volunteers who took part in the relief operation.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. James R. Helmley, commander of the task force here, began
his military career in Vietnam 22 years ago, on an operation
code-named Ruthless Combat. This one was called Provide Refuge.
``This is a different planet we're on now,'' he said Monday. ``This
is feel good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost to an individual, those working here describe a specific
moment when their presence at Fort Dix became something more than
an assignment. Helmley went out nightly to visit the children, and
said one night soon after he arrived, a 6-year-old girl asked him
to bend down. He thought she wanted to tell him something, but
instead, she hugged him and said, ``God Bless You,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go sit under a tree, go through a handkerchief and
come back here for a moment,'' he said, looking around his office.
``I'm just really blessed to be a part of this operation.''
</P>
<P>
   For Laura Serna, a Red Cross worker who used her computer to
search for information about families separated by the war, that
moment came with her first ``hit,'' she said, for a woman who was
seeking word on the whereabouts of her family, and whether they had
survived. They had. ``I think everybody in the room broke down when
that happened,'' Ms. Serna said, holding out her arm. ``I still get
goosebumps,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   After checking with each family for any last requests to trace
relatives, the American Red Cross was packing up its computers and
planning to close its office this week. Ms. Serna knew she would
think about the Kosovars after she returned home to Mount Vernon,
Wash. ``I'll wonder where the people ended up,'' Ms. Serna said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the refugees leaving fast, the chatty clusters of families
and friends of weeks past have largely disappeared from picnic
benches, with the fields mostly empty as the clouds hung low. A few
children rolled down a hill on plastic bicycles. Nearby, a hobby
horse and a soccer ball, prized possessions not so long ago, sat
undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   At a picnic table, Kleopatra Gikokas, 18, and her friends
scanned departure schedules for the next few days, searching for
their names. She arrived on the last plane here May 29, after
Milosevic had said he would withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo. ``We
didn't trust Milosevic's word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even consider his word,'' added her friend, Aida
Sopi, 19, who knows she will go to Brooklyn, N.Y., but not when.
``We had a very warm welcome here,'' she said, ``and we're
expecting it will be the same wherever we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedri Raci, 21, who used to run an import-export business in
Kosovo, arrived on the last flight to Fort Dix, after he witnessed
neighbors and relatives being murdered by Serb forces. Now he
wanted to return home to Kosovo, but was told he would have to go
to a sponsoring family, in Charlottesville, Va., first.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has not yet declared Kosovo safe for the
refugees to return and so all the refugees leaving Fort Dix have
been sent to sponsoring agencies in the United States. Once
Washington deems Kosovo safe, it will pay for the return flight of
any refugees who go home, said Ms. Checkan, who has been handling
public information for the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The women who used to sit under a tree, knitting blankets,
sweaters and scarves from donated wool and needles cut from coat
hangers, have gathered their yarn and moved on. There are few
listeners left for the nightly radio broadcast in Albanian, played
over the loudspeakers. In the evenings, there are no more card
games or chats until 3 a.m., just the anxious countdown to a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. had promised NATO it would take in 20,000
Kosovar refugees, the swift close of the war is bringing about an
end to the resettlement operations with less than half the promised
number of refugees coming to the United States. With Kosovars
massively abandoning the refugee camps in Macedonia to return home,
easing the pressure on the United States to relieve overcrowding at
the Macedonian camps, the U.S. is halting resettlement of the
Kosovars with the remaining cases here, Ms. Checkan said.

<P>
   In the meantime, Raci wonders when his turn will come.

 _ SF CHRON  
 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Keeping Your Finance Data Safe 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: Thanks for your recent tip on how to keep track of the value of
a stock portfolio, using free services available on the Internet.
I'd like to try it, but I'm afraid that someone might break in and
look at my financial data.
<P>
   A: That's possible. I have gone back and forth about security
with various Web site operators, and none has convinced me that any
site is invulnerable to hackers. Most Web sites do all they can to
preserve security, but anything can be broken into. There are some
pretty ingenious hackers out there.
</P>
<P>
   It's also conceivable that the people who operate the Web site
where you store your portfolio data can (and will) peek at your
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   If such things bother you, there's a ploy you might consider.
Try disguising the size of your portfolio by entering sharply
diminished share totals. Suppose, for example, that you hold 100
shares of General Motors, recently worth about $7,000. When you key
in your portfolio data, indicate instead that you hold 10 shares.
It then will appear that you only have $700 worth.
</P>
<P>
   Do that with your other holdings as well, dividing the actual
share totals by 10. When you look at the daily portfolio update,
it's an easy matter to multiply by 10 in your head. Meanwhile, no
one who might take an electronic peek at your portfolio would have
the vaguest idea how much you are worth.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be Bill Gates, you might want to divide your
share totals by 100 million, rather than 10, but the same principle
applies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Inside Investors
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does one find out what portion of a public company is
owned by insiders? Also, how do you find out if the insiders are
running the company mainly for their own benefit, at the expense of
other shareholders? I ask this because I invested in a company that
had a large stash of cash, but soon afterward, the insiders
depleted it by giving themselves huge bonuses and the stock price
went down.
</P>
<P>
   A: Get a copy of the latest proxy statement issued by whatever
company interests you. It will tell you how many shares are owned
by each of the directors and principal executives, and it also
lists any other individuals or institutions that own at least 5
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy also provides a detailed breakdown of the compensation
paid to the five top officers in the latest fiscal year. If you
skim through the compensation sections of enough proxies, you can
sense which companies have the greediest managements.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only huge bonuses that can pinch a company's finances.
Huge stock options can dilute a company's earnings per share by
greatly increasing the number of shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if an executive owns a large stake in a
company, that can be good for the other shareholders. A major owner
has a compelling incentive to keep the company healthy and the
stock price high.
</P>
<P>
   Proxies normally are sent to shareholders once a year, just
ahead of the annual meeting. You probably can get a copy by calling
the company's investor relations department. Or try searching the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Web site at www.sec.gov.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Choosing an Index Fund
</P>
<P>
   Q: Waterhouse Securities has a mutual fund that duplicates the
performance of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones industrial
average. Would this be a good long-term investment? I don't have a
clue about the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's OK. You're in good company.
</P>
<P>
   No one can confidently predict the performance of any mutual
fund or other security.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is any guide, then the Waterhouse Investors Dow
30 Fund (as it is called) should be a good long-term investment. In
the 30-year period ended last month, the Dow industrials posted an
average annual gain of 13 percent, including reinvestment of
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterhouse fund is a no-load _ which is good. You won't have
to pay an up-front commission to buy the shares.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fund imposes an annual management fee of 0.81
percent of invested assets _ on the high side for index funds,
which are passively managed. The Vanguard Index Trust 500 Fund,
which tracks the performance of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index,
charges a management fee of only 0.18 percent annually. That is a
big advantage, considering that the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 have turned
in virtually identical performances on balance during the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   If the Waterhouse and Vanguard funds both gained exactly 13
percent every year for the next 30 years, someone who invested
$10,000 in each of them today and then stood pat would wind up with
a hefty $315,000 in the Waterhouse fund but an even heftier
$373,000 _ nearly $60,000 more _ in the Vanguard fund.

STEALING HEADLINES AND HEARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only constant in life is change, and I'm left numbed and
disoriented from the reconfigurations occurring in our midst in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like it was only a fortnight ago that I was using a
typewriter to pound out these words, but I've now been using a
computer since I was forced, kicking, screaming and complaining,
into making the transition for the 1984 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   I remember there was a time when only Navy guys and Hell's
Angels had tattoos, but now it's become so fashionable among young
people and some not so young to have their bodies festooned with
such skin-scarring graffiti that you're dismissed as a maverick
outcast if you don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I'm such an old codger that I actually can recall when the
general populace kept its money in low-interest savings accounts in
banks instead of investing it in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   I swear there was a time in America when people communicated
long distance via either mail, or telephone instead of E-mail and
actually conducted their business in person rather than over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I vaguely can recollect those by-gone days when you could take
kids to the movies without fear of being bombarded with the crass
sexual claptrap and politically correct dung that you find in such
mindless junk as ``Wild Wild West'' and ``Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, if someone told me, say, a year go, or even, say, a week
ago that a bunch of American women soccer players easily would
upstage the 70th All Star game, I would have hooted uproariously
and said, ``Sure, and the next thing you're going to tell me is
that the Women's World Cup championship match is going to get
larger television ratings than the NBA championship finals between
the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I guess times, indeed, are changing dramatically,
especially on the athletic scene.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ladies actually did generate greater Nielsen TV ratings
in their game with China than the NBA finals managed 13.3 to 11.3
and they actually have commanded more attention the past few days
than baseball's mid-season classic.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed?
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed that a bunch of enthusiastic,
bright-eyed, underpaid ladies the $50,000 bonus each will receive
for the team's stirring victory over China doesn't even amount to
one-seventh of what Kevin Brown earns each time he makes a start
for the Dodgers would be earning greater headlines this juncture of
the summer than Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey Jr., Pedro
Martinez, Mike Piazza and the rest of baseball's glamorous players?
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought the most popular jocks in America at this
time serenaded by David Letterman, feted by Disneyland, revered by
an entire nation would be a bunch of gals named Michelle Akers, Mia
Hamm, Brandi Chastain, Briana Scurry, Kate Sobrero, Tiffeny
Milbrett, Julie Foudy and the rest of their teammates?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the relative newness of women team sports and the
incredible success enjoyed by the U.S. soccer team has something to
do with this phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, would an entire nation have been glued to its television
sets the ratings in L.A. were a stunning 20.8 had Norway and Brazil
duked it out for the World Cup title Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I think it's far more than victories that have propelled
these American ladies to cult status among even many hardened male
sports patrons who in the past dismissed women athletics with
haughty disdain.
</P>
<P>
   It's the strong feeling here that the unparalleled popularity of
Tony DiCiccio's troops is a widespread backlash against so much of
what the public passionately dislikes about modern athletics the
strikes, the lockouts, the high-priced tickets, the loutishness of
its performers, the greediness of its overseers, the general
disregard for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   These soccer players have a charismatic charm about them that
has been beguiling.
</P>
<P>
   You also must understand none have been busted for possession of
dope. None who are married have faced assault charges for roughing
up their husbands. None who are single have run afoul of the law
for beating up their boyfriends. None have been arrested for public
drunkenness, or has any had an unseemly incident in a strip joint.
None refuses to sign autographs. All have been gracious to their
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Brandi Chastain caused quite a stir in a provocatively posed
ad she did for ``Gear'' magazine. And Briana Scurry once streaked
nude around her hometown neighborhood late at night, although no
one was around to see her impromptu 1996 Olympic gold medal
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, girls will be girls, and no one is perfect, not even
these wonderful American soccer champions who play their game with
an uncommon competitive zeal and do so without the finger-pointing,
self-congratulatory mugging that too often stains athletic events
these days.
</P>
<P>
   These ladies have captured a nation because they have come to
epitomize the quintessential essence of sportsmanship, and haven't
been spoiled into becoming conceited, self-important boors like so
many of their male brethren.
</P>
<P>
   This may change in the future when the inevitable huge amounts
of money start rolling in and their perspectives become altered
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the time being, these American women are clearly at the
top of the athletic ladder, worshiped not only for their vast
accomplishments but also for the exemplary manner in which they
conduct themselves.

 &HT;    Ohio's Kasich may bow out of presidential race
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Kasich's wild card run for the presidency
might soon fold as sources close to the campaign acknowledged
Monday the Westerville, Ohio Republican has begun a sober
assessment of whether to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Months after joining a passel of Republican candidates seeking
the party's nomination for president in 2000, Kasich hasn't made
discernible gains in either poll results or fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Todd Harris deflected questions about whether
an announcement was imminent
</P>
<P>
   In one indication of the campaign's condition, a fund-raising
event scheduled for Monday in Seattle was canceled because of poor
response.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources close to the campaign said the evaluations are now
more intense, a month before the Iowa straw poll, and one of the
two said a decision about whether to withdraw or press ahead could
come soon.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Kasich's future has grown intense following a
weekend rumor that he was preparing to endorse one of the other GOP
presidential candidates. The speculation hit Washington hard
Monday, bolstered by Kasich's hedging about the rumor when
questioned on the campaign trail Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked directly if he was about to withdraw, Kasich told The
Associated Press in Concord, N.H., ``When we get to the point where
we've made a decision and are going to talk about it, we'll let you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is mounting for all the Republican candidates to
demonstrate their viability in the face of front-runner Gov. George
W. Bush's juggernaut campaign. Two weeks ago campaign finance
totals were tallied and Bush announced that he broke all previous
records by raising more than $36 million in the first six months of
his campaign. He's raised twice as much as Vice President Al Gore,
and his closest money rival in the GOP, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, has just over $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich's campaign office said he has raised $3 million, but $1.4
million of that was transferred from his congressional campaign
account.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Columbus, Ohio Republicans are waiting to hear
if Kasich will seek a 10th term in Congress after a decision is
made about his presidential campaign.

TRAPPED AT SOUTH POLE, DOCTOR BECOMES A PATIENT

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter temperatures at the Scott-Amundsen research station at
the South Pole average 80 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it is
pitch dark nearly 24 hours a day. People who sign on to work there
understand that they will not see home for a long time: from
February to October, planes cannot even land.
</P>
<P>
   But an Air Force jet came close on Sunday, dipping low over the
base at 2 a.m. to drop medical supplies for a woman, trapped there
for the winter, who had discovered a lump in her breast and needed
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Her plight turns out to be even more complex than initial
reports suggested. The woman herself is the only medical doctor at
the station, according to a cancer expert who was consulted in her
case and who spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the patient must act as her own doctor, performing a
biopsy on herself and, if the lump is malignant, administering any
needed treatment, which might include chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   If she was to become incapacitated, that would leave the 40
other members of the research team without a doctor at the remote
Antarctic outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Erb, director of the Office of Polar Programs at the
National Science Foundation, which runs the base, declined to
identify the woman or say whether she was the station's doctor. Erb
said cancer experts in the United States had made a ``working
diagnosis,'' but he declined to reveal whether a biopsy had been
performed. He said she would begin taking medication as soon as it
was retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation said it was honoring the woman's request for
confidentiality, and would not reveal whether or not she had
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hanson, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said that despite
the need to protect the patient's privacy, officials did not think
that the Air Force medical-drop mission itself could or should be
kept secret from the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to get out sooner or later, so it seemed
appropriate to explain as much as we could as soon as we could,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb also said that it was adequate to have one doctor at an
Antarctic station, backed up by people who had trained as
paramedics, along with computer, video and telephone links to
medical centers when needed. In addition, he said, people who sign
up for extended stays at the South Pole are carefully screened for
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone there is sufficiently fit that he or she is carrying
out assigned duties without any problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanson said that the woman, who is 47, had been working at
the station since December and had discovered the lump in her
breast in June. The foundation sought advice on her behalf from
doctors at the National Cancer Institute and other cancer centers.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation said in a news release, ``the patient and her
physicians decided on a course of drug treatment that they consider
appropriate to maintain her health and safety.'' But the release
did not specify what the treatment would be. Erb said that the
drugs sent in included several different treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   He said said that the jet zoomed in low over the base and
dropped the equipment from an altitude of about 700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never landed a plane at the South Pole in midwinter,''
Ms. Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb said that the equipment included a digital microscope and an
ultrasound machine, which can be used to measure the size of tumors
and to guide a doctor doing a biopsy. But, he said, ``The
preliminary report is that the ultrasound machine did not survive
the drop.'' He also said that it took time to retrieve and open all
the packages that had been dropped, and because satellite
communication with the base is possible for only a few hours a day,
he did not yet know about the condition of the other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The consultant on the case said he thought the doctor would be
performing her own biopsy, or perhaps already had. Although the
thought of driving a needle into one's own breast to look for
cancer cells might horrify most people, he said, ``I would assume
that somebody who chooses to go to the South Pole is a tough
person, a strong character. It wouldn't shock me that somebody
could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without ultrasound, video conferencing with an ordinary
camera, he said, might allow a radiologist to ``walk her through''
the procedure. She would then have to make microscope slides out of
the cells from the biopsy and stain them so that the slides could
be examined for cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   The digital microscope would allow the microscopic images to be
transmitted for diagnosis to a pathologist anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If cancer were found, chemotherapy could be started, and the
patient could have surgery later, after leaving the South Pole.
Although most women who need chemotherapy for breast cancer have
surgery first, studies have shown that giving chemotherapy first
and surgery later can work just as well, said Dr. Larry Norton,
head of the division of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer, who was not a consultant on the South Pole case.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor would need other drugs to treat chemotherapy's
side effects, including medication for nausea and, possibly,
antibiotics to take care of infections that might set in from the
tendency of chemotherapy to lower the counts of infection-fighting
white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, the consultant said, is that if the cells were
malignant, and if proper staining materials had been sent to the
base, it might be possible for the doctor to test her own cancer
cells for sensitivity to the naturally occurring hormone estrogen.
And if their growth was stimulated by estrogen, the doctor could be
given hormonal therapy instead of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The hormonal therapy would include the drug tamoxifen, to block
estrogen's effects. He said the hormonal approach would have milder
side effects than chemotherapy and could slow the growth of the
tumor until the patient could be flown out of the South Pole in
late October or early November.

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ The most widespread and sustained protests since
Iran's revolution two decades ago spread throughout the country
Monday, while security police and their vigilante supporters moved
to crush pro-democracy student demonstrators outside Tehran
University.
</P>
<P>
   Students demonstrated in 18 cities and towns, including major
cosmopolitan cities like Tabriz, Shiraz and Isfahan and more
traditional cities like Mashad and Yazd, Iran's official news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding batons and lobbing tear gas canisters, the security
forces emptied Tehran University Monday evening in a campaign to
crush the demonstrations. In Tehran, students who had gathered
inside the gates of the sprawling university complex in the heart
of the capital fainted from tear gas that could be smelled more
than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filthy swine! Filthy swine!'' one red-faced student screamed
over and over from inside the cramped quarters of one of the
caged-in vehicles. ``Jerk!'' yelled another. Others yelled
obscenities that are seldom heard in public in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, wrapped in the all-encompassing black chador, cursed
the clergy with obscenities. A number of people were injured and
received assistance from health personnel in a blood transfusion
truck and passersby.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of injured students were taken to the campus mosque for
treatment, and a parade of ambulances streamed in and out of the
campus as a voice on a loudspeaker called all medical students to
help. Students set a huge bonfire to try to neutralize the tear
gas, one witness said.
</P>
<P>
   The vigilantes, fervent revolutionaries who serve as volunteers
for the regime, carried cables, chains and batons as they emerged
from the government-owned buses that parked near the university,
the witness said. The students had intended to stage an all-night
sit-in, but by midnight, most of them had left the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations _ and the crackdown _ reflect a deep struggle
over the course of Iran's revolution. Students are impatient with
the slow pace of reforms promised by President Mohammed Khatami.
The students are not calling for a change in the Islamic system of
government, rather for a quickening of the movement towards
democracy and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are the diehard Islamic revolutionaries, some
of them in positions of power, some of them veterans of Iran's long
war with Iraq, who take their lead from Iran's Supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and believe that the country's moves
towards democracy are a betrayal of revolutionary purism.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami does not control the police and security forces, who
have enraged and frightened many Iranians by a campaign of
intimidation that included the murders of prominent intellectuals
as well as political attacks on Khatami's allies in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations and the crackdowns do not mean that Iran's
Islamic Republic is in jeopardy. ``We should not assume that this
movement could turn into a revolution,'' said an editorial Monday
in the reformist newspaper, Neshat. ``It's neither nor possible nor
desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   The five days of rage were sparked by the passage by Iran's
parliament of a tough new press law and by the closure of Salam, a
popular left-leaning Islamic newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces and vigilantes stormed a dormitory at Tehran
University on Thursday night and beat students as they slept,
pushing some from second- and third-story windows. Although the
official death toll stood at two, Iran's newspapers, quoting
students, claimed that between five and eight students had died.
</P>
<P>
   As striking as the extent of the protests throughout the country
is the form they are taking. Until now, criticisms of Ayatollah
Khamenei, who is in charge of the armed forces, the security and
intelligence apparatus, and radio and television, were made
privately. Now the criticism of Khamenei, who lacks the religious
credentials of his predecessor, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
and has resisted any embrace of reform, has burst into the open.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to calm the highly charged atmosphere, Khamenei on
Monday delivered an emotional speech condemning the attack by
security forces on a dormitory last week after the first protests.
He spoke to a hand-picked crowd of thousands in a cavernous hall
reserved solely for his use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bitter incident has broken my heart,'' he said in the
speech, which was broadcast on both radio and television. He added
that it was un-Islamic to enter the private spaces of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning acknowledgment that some of the demonstrators had
turned against him, he added, ``Even if things make you angry and
they condemn me, even if they set fire to my picture, remain
silent. Take no action until the day that the country needs it!''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women in the crowd moaned and wept loudly.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech he said, ``The greatest dream and honor for me is
that I give my life in this honorable, glorious magnificent path''
_ a statement the security forces and the vigilantes may have
interpreted as a message that they should risk their lives instead.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei also blamed ``enemies,'' including the United States,
for the attack on the dormitory. Over and over, the crowd chanted
``Death to America.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the university, there was no crying for the ayatollah.
When a speaker tried to read the text of Khamenei's speech, the
crowd booed. ``Commander-in-chief resign!'' and ``Down with the
dictator,'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   There were posters of President Khatami but none of Ayatollah
Khamenei, whose photographs and portraits dominate public
buildings, shops and landscapes throughout Iran along with those of
his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami called on students to exercise restraint, saying in a
meeting with education officials, ``students should cooperate with
the government and allow law and order to be established in
society.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In another incident Monday, uniformed and plainclothes security
police and anti-riot police protected by shields and helmets
clashed with several hundred student protesters. The police rounded
up dozens of students in Valiasr Square, one of Tehran's busiest
intersections, beating some of them and forcing them into cages
mounted on the back of pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown came after a police car and two police motorcycles
were set on fire, apparently by students, one witness said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone-throwing students smashed storefront windows. Many
shopkeepers pulled down the gates of their stores both to prevent
looting and to get a closer look at the action in the streets.
Police froze traffic just before rush hour. Helicopters kept watch
overhead. Security police roamed among the thousands of people
gathered in the square arresting suspicious-looking young people
and rounding up photographers to prevent them from taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day at the university, students stood up on a
makeshift dais near the law school and one after one explained
their views and stated their demands. Among them are the creation
of a national day of mourning in memory of the students who were
killed, the holding of a public trial for the people who ordered
and carried out the dormitory attack, and the return of the bodies
of those killed.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker in a black shirt criticized the lack of
organization. ``We have to have a plan and a leader,'' said the
man, who, like the other speakers, did not identify himself. ``We
have to find out which of our friends have been killed, and who
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker called for the execution of the perpetrators of
last Thursday's dormitory attack.
</P>
<P>
   A number of student organizers said they believed that the
all-day open microphone was a trap set by infiltrators in their
midst who both tried to provoke the students into more radical
action and ended up being part of Monday night's crackdown. One
speaker said that some in the crowd were offering razor blades to
students who might want to use violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very strange that the students were allowed to speak so
freely,'' he said. ``The whole thing is too suspicious.''

 _ SF CHRON   Disney to Buy Rest of Infoseek 
 &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Fresh from hitting box-office pay dirt with its ``Tarzan''
animated movie, Walt Disney Co. said yesterday that it will swing
deeper into the jungle of the Internet by acquiring the 57 percent
of Sunnyvale's Infoseek Corp. it doesn't already own.
<P>
   After the deal is completed, probably by the end of the year,
all of Team Mickey's Internet assets will be gathered in a single
operation _ dubbed Go.com _ and a new stock will be created to
track &UR;  &LR; Disney's expanded online assets.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is intended to make Go.com a more nimble player
than Disney in the fast-moving Internet industry, and to capitalize
on Wall Street's dot-com mania.
</P>
<P>
   Go.com's shares are almost certain to generate interest among
investors, who have steered clear of Disney's stock in recent
months amid earnings disappointments, uncertainties surrounding the
entertainment giant's broadcast properties and sagging sales of
merchandise resulting from Asia's prolonged economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will package Disney's Internet assets in a quantifiable
entity,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP;
Co. in New York. ``Those assets have been hidden in the overall
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   While financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps,
analysts placed the total market capitalization of Go.com at about
$7 billion. This would value Infoseek at roughly $52 a share, in
line with Friday's close of $51.50.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek shareholders will receive 1.15 shares of the new Go.com
tracking stock for each share of the portal they hold. The Infoseek
buyout comes as no surprise. Disney signaled that a deal may be
afoot a few weeks ago when it confirmed that it was in talks with
the portal.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies already cooperate in Go Network, which unites
Disney's online resources _ including sites related to its ABC and
ESPN divisions _ with Infoseek's directory services.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company will inherit Go Network's &LR;  go.com  &LR; Web
address.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which will hold a 72 percent stake in Go.com (with the
remainder held by individual shareholders), expects the combined
businesses to generate about $350 million in pro-forma revenue for
the current fiscal year, with approximately $200 million of that
coming from Internet-related activities and the rest from the
Disney catalog.
</P>
<P>
   There are no estimates as to when Go.com will turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining Disney's Internet assets with Infoseek takes our
online strategy to the next level,'' Michael Eisner, Disney's
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Go.com ``will unlock the value and potential of
our combined Internet assets.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. While the current Go Network is one of
the top five sites on the Web in terms of traffic, according to
market researcher Media Metrix, its revenues remained flat at $30
million in the latest quarter _ a troubling sign in the
hyper-growth-oriented Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek said its own revenues in the quarter ended in April
jumped 105 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek's share price has steadily risen in recent weeks as
speculation mounted that a buyout by Disney was in the cards. It
closed yesterday down $5.56, or almost 11 percent, at $45.94 as
investors cashed in on the gains.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's stock, meanwhile, edged 19 cents higher to $27.81. The
Mouse House has watched its share price drop by more than 25
percent in the past year as Wall Street analysts have taken an
increasingly downbeat view of the company's near-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to be able to do anything right,'' said Steve
Adams, managing director of First Security Van Kasper &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Adams, who sees Disney now trading at attractive,
bargain-basement levels, added that ``the moves they're making onto
the Internet are smart. They're starting to position themselves for
long-term value.''
</P>
<P>
   John Ball, Disney senior vice president of corporate
development, admitted that ``our international and consumer-product
devisions have experienced some growth problems.'' But he insisted
that ``if you think ahead two, three, four years, we believe growth
will be reignited.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball also observed that Disney shareholders won't miss out on
whatever growth is experienced by the new Go.com stock. ``People
who hold Disney shares will have a 72-percent interest in Go.com,''
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   However, this could end up being a liability for the new
concern's shares. With virtually no prospect of Go.com being
purchased by another company, the venture will lack much of the
cachet surrounding most Net firms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although many investors will be attracted by the
notion of a stock representing Disney's online properties, there
will be others who are deterred by Go.com being a tracking stock,
as opposed to a ``pure'' Internet investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tracking stocks are not the way many people like to play
the Internet,'' said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald in New York. ``There's no shortage any longer of other
Internet stocks out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet known who will run the new company, but this much
is sure: It won't be Harry Motro, Infoseek's president and chief
executive. While Motro has agreed to stay on until the acquisition
is complete, he said in an interview that he plans to leave the
company after the deal goes through ``for personal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was totally my choice,'' Motro stressed, dismissing
rumors that he had been forced out by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to discuss future career plans. ``There is no other
business interest I have planned,'' Motro said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's chief financial officer, Thomas Staggs, will head up
the transition leading to the unveiling of Go.com. He has been
overseeing much of the company's Internet efforts since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some Infoseek shareholders sued Disney in Delaware Chancery
Court yesterday, claiming the buyout shortchanged them. Such
shareholder suits have become commonplace in the Delaware courts
following announcements of large corporate acquisitions, but rarely
halt a purchase.  &QL;

MALARIA A FOCUS OF HEALTH GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Alaska, Wash.)   (For release on Sunday, July 18)  
(DW) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malaria was in its usual top spot on the agenda when 1,800
experts in travelers' health met in Montreal last month. Malaria
protozoa, which move in parasites spread by mosquito bites, have
evolved strains resistant to drugs faster than human research can
catch up. There is no vaccine, and the disease causes the deaths of
a million people annually in Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable risk for American travelers. Government
figures show that from 1980 to 1995, it got reports of 3,513
civilian cases, of which the vast majority, 2,907, were contracted
in sub-Saharan Africa. All but 185 of the others were from Asia,
the Caribbean and South America. There were 59 deaths among these
cases, 43 of which were contracted in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the conference of the International Society of Travel
Medicine had a major new malaria drug to discuss, Malarone. In the
weeks just after, the computer exchanges of the society spun with
talk of where the drug could be bought legally and, whether for
prevention or treatment, what the cost would be.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome is expecting approval of Malarone _ its name for
pills combining atovaquone and proguanil _ by the Food and Drug
Administration for sale in the United States as a preventive drug
and as a treatment for malaria. The company submitted its
application in December.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Malarone has been approved for both prevention and
treatment in Denmark only, and is approved solely for treatment in
Britain, although physicians there report giving it to travelers as
a protective measure, too.
</P>
<P>
   As a preventive, Malarone must be taken daily while mefloquine,
which is now the most-prescribed drug in the United States for
prevention of malaria, is taken weekly. Physicians worry about
travelers' compliance when drugs must be taken daily.
</P>
<P>
   But mefloquine, sold under the trade name Lariam by Roche
Holdings, is not recommended for people subject to seizures or
psychiatric disorders. News reports of nightmares and more serious
side effects have caused apprehension, particularly in Britain.
These concerns mean that a new drug to ward off malaria is welcome.
Testing supervisors said the the possible side effects of Malarone
were headache, abdominal pain, upper respiratory infection, pain,
nausea or vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Malarone costs (PS)2 a pill, or about $3.15. It is
expected to cost $2.50 to $3 or more in the United States _ a
weekly cost of $17.50 to $21, against the $10 weekly for one Lariam
pill. Lariam is started one or two weeks before a traveler leaves
to evaluate side effects, and is continued for four weeks after
return. Malarone, a Glaxo Wellcome spokesman said, is started one
to two days before entering the malarious area, and is continued
only seven days after return.
</P>
<P>
   Mefloquine was developed when malaria evolved into a form that
resisted the drug chloroquine. Now resistance to mefloquine is
reported in areas of Thailand and western Cambodia. There are other
drugs in the laboratory that may be developed for use when
resistance to Malarone develops, which one expert estimated might
be in about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, no malaria prophylaxis is 100 percent sure, and
travelers should take careful precautions against night-biting
mosquitoes in malarious areas, and should be aware of the symptoms
_ fever and chills, muscle aches and headache, a situation often
mistaken for influenza by physicians not aware that a patient may
have traveled to a malarious area. Prompt treatment is vital.
Physicians say that properly treated, malaria is not fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Chickenpox was also on the agenda at the Montreal meeting.
Chickenpox is easily communicable _ for instance, one can catch it
from a fellow passenger on a bus or plane.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, according to Dr. Mary Wilson's reference
work, ``A World Guide to Infections'' (Oxford), 90 percent of the
cases occur in children under age 10, who are then usually immune
for life. Overseas, the disease is more common among adults, who
may suffer serious consequences, including pneumonia and
encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for adult Americans who are going to work among
young people overseas or refugees, or who are traveling the
backpack-and-hostel route to be immune to chickenpox. That means
travelers must know they have had it, or have been vaccinated
against the varicella zoster virus with a vaccine that was licensed
only in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, Dr. Elaine C. Jong of the University of Washington
School of Medicine presented a paper, ``Varicella Vaccine: Is It a
Travel Immunization?'' in which she concluded it probably was.
Others concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pretravel clinic visit,'' Dr. Jong said, ``is an
opportunity to immunize susceptible healthy travelers against
chickenpox, which could cause illness and exclusion from travel
before, during or after the trip, and protects the residents in
receiving countries against imported infection.'' For adults, the
vaccine requires two injections.
</P>
<P>
   At Travelers Medical Service in New York, the director, Rebecca
W. Acosta, said her questionnaire for pretravel visits asks clients
whether they have had chickenpox. If they are in doubt, she said,
the clinic performs blood tests because they are cheaper than the
course of two vaccinations, which costs a total of $150. Most
clients are found to be immune, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Acosta said that some states and many school districts are
now requiring chickenpox vaccinations because fewer Americans are
getting the disease in childhood than formerly. One problem is that
the chickenpox vaccine is so new no one is sure how long it confers
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme vaccine is also on the list of recommended vaccines at the
Acosta's clinic. This is recommended for domestic travelers over 15
who are going climbing or camping in areas where Lyme disease has
occurred. Three shots, at $75 each, are recommended. The schedule
now recommends the second shot after 30 days and the third after a
year, but this is likely to be modified to quicken full immunity.
The vaccine is not approved for children under 15.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A paper presented at the conference by Dr. Martin Cetron of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and associates reported
on research, not yet complete, into the deaths of three people _
aged 63, 67 and 79 _ who had received yellow fever vaccine. The
paper implies that the vaccine may be more dangerous to older
people than to others.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow fever vaccine is the only one for which the World
Health Organization still condones requiring a certificate. But,
the WHO says, many countries require this certificate when the
vaccination is not really needed. Both the organization's book
``International Travel and Health; Vaccination Requirements and
Health Advice'' and the CDC's ``Health Information for
International Travel'' list the countries requiring the
certificate, but those requirements are based on whether a traveler
has recently been in a yellow fever area.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors say that colleagues may administer the yellow fever
vaccine even when a traveler is going directly from the United
States to a country requiring a certificate only for those arriving
from infected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Cetron said that a great deal more research into the specifics
of the three cases was ahead, but that one thing was clear:
Physicians and clinics should be sure that the traveler's itinerary
requires yellow fever vaccine. Mrs. Acosta said that requirements
were often misinterpreted; for India, for example, it depends where
the traveler will be only in the six days preceding arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Another health warning emerged as summer began: A flu epidemic
in Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada. According to the
Centers for Disease Control, 428 acute respiratory infections among
tourists and 104 among tourism workers from May 22 to June 29. Four
tourists were hospitalized with pneumonia, and the centers said
that laboratory analysis indicated that the illnesses were
influenza A, a viral infection. Last year, almost 5,000 people on
land and sea tours in the area fell ill and four died of flu.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC suggested that travelers at risk for flu, including
people over 65, speak to their doctors before leaving and ask about
taking along prescription antiviral pills, either amantadine or
rimantadine. Cetron said that antivirals, taken within 48 hours of
flu symptoms, could lessen the risk of complications.
</P>
<P>
   The flu vaccine for next year will not be prepared until fall.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 edition of ``Health Information for International
Travel'' made its debut at the conference. This big yellow book,
which most commercial travel-health guides lean on, has been
reformatted for clarity and legibility. The information on malaria
risk and prophylaxis has been updated as of April, and the section
on recommendations for the HIV-positive travelers has been expanded
and shifted to a section on travelers with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   The book is sold by the superintendent of documents, (202)
512-1800 as document No. 017-023-00202-3. It costs $22 in the
United States; $27 from overseas.

RECALL OF SOFT DRINKS TO COST COKE BOTTLER $103 MILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Belgium, Luxembourg)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's bottler said Monday that it would take a $103
million charge against second-quarter earnings to cover expenses
associated with the recall of soft drinks in Europe last month,
about 70 percent more than previously acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, said two weeks ago that the
recall involved 14 million cases of soft drinks and would cost the
company $60 million. But that number ballooned to $103 million, or
about 16 cents a diluted share, the company said, after 17 million
cases of products were returned by people living in countries where
Coke products were taken off the shelves in the biggest recall in
Coca-Cola's 113-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The charge erases second-quarter earnings for shareholders of
Coca-Cola Enterprises and leaves little remaining for the full
year. After the crisis occurred, analysts had expected earnings of
about 25 cents a share for the year, but that was before the full
cost of the recall could be calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts now expect the company to earn about 9 cents a share,
said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola drinks in Belgium and Luxembourg were ordered off
store shelves by the governments of those countries on June 14 and
June 15 after hundreds of people in Belgium reported feeling ill
after drinking Coke and Fanta.
</P>
<P>
   More products were returned in France, where the government
ordered Coke to shut down a plant in Dunkirk that produced cans of
soft drinks that were found to have a strange odor, traced by the
company to a phenol compound that was applied to wood shipping
pallets. Coke products were banned in Belgium and Luxembourg for
more than a week, and factories in France and Belgium were closed
for the same amount of time while government investigators sought
to trace what had caused symptoms like nausea, dizziness and
headaches reported by people who drank the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in the nonrecurring charge is partially due to
higher product returns as a result of greater-than-anticipated
inventory in consumers' homes,'' Coca-Cola Enterprises said in a
statement. ``In addition, disposal costs increased because of the
larger quantities of product destroyed and the estimated per-case
cost of disposal which reflects the extraordinary quality control
procedures that will be used for product destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the charges would not affect Coca-Cola
Enterprises' earnings for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Asman, a spokeswoman for the bottler, called the situation
``unprecedented'' and added that the company had no idea how many
soft drinks were already in people's homes when the recall began.
Those drinks were brought back to stores and turned over to Coke
executives, who were ordered to destroy them. Some of those drinks
may have been from factories other than the ones under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they had people returning their Coca-Cola whether
or not it came from those plants,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global
consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``That's probably what
got them.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the $103 million ``not small potatoes,'' noting that
it was about 6 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises' overseas volume
for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much the recall will cost the Coca-Cola Co.
The company is expected to release its second-quarter earnings
before the stock market opens on Thursday. Coca-Cola Enterprises is
scheduled to report earnings on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing of this magnitude has ever happened in the Coke
system,'' Ms. Asman said.

SPORTS COLUMN: FENWAY'S ALL-STAR MONSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's known as The Green Monster or The Wall, but by any
other name, Fenway Park would smell as sweet. To sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   From the 310-foot mark below the left-field foul pole to the
379-foot mark near center field, it's 37 feet high with an ``All
Star Game `99'' logo in big letters. Above is a 23-foot screen
where Bucky Dent's home run landed for the New York Yankees in the
1978 divisional playoff and where the Boston Red Sox went to die.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway up the light tower in straightaway left field are three
huge Coca-Cola bottles that are as much a target as an
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   But the real target Tuesday night is the Mass Pike beyond
Lansdowne Street. Nobody has ever hit one that far, but you never
know.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's All-Star Game, the fans will be hoping to see
Mark McGwire reach the Massachusetts Turnpike, anywhere from 525
feet to 598 feet away. But whether he does or not, the Green
Monster or The Wall is baseball's All-Star aberration, the most
compelling area of ball park architecture in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the Green Monster,'' Carlton Fisk was
saying, ``everybody knows where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   And everybody knows that Fisk, then the Red Sox catcher and now
the American League's honorary captain, waved one of Fenway Park's
most famous home runs off the left-field foul pole to square the
1975 World Series with the Cincinnati Reds after six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Wall is really inviting, and we hope the National League
hitters shoot for it; that's when they don't hit it,'' Fisk said.
``I remember Dick Allen going 0-for-7, but then he took his normal
swing and hit one 20 rows deep into the center-field bleachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those NL hitters, especially the righthanded-swinging
starters with 154 homers this season _ Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire,
Matt Williams, Jeff Bagwell, Mike Piazza and Jay Bell. McGwire
knows it best from 18 homers in 11 seasons with the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Wall is a lot closer than the number says,'' the
Cardinals' first baseman said, alluding to the 310-foot mark. ``I
lost a couple of line drives that would probably have been out in a
normal ball park but hit the Wall. It turns a homer into a
single.''
</P>
<P>
   According to The Boston Globe's videotape study that analyzed
the trajectory of McGwire's record 70 home runs and long fly balls
last season, if he had played all his games in Fenway Park, he
would have hit three more but he would have lost nine for an
overall total of 64.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, the major-league leader this season with 32 for the
Chicago Cubs, hasn't been in Fenway Park since his earlier visits
as a member of the Texas Rangers and the Chicago White Sox, but he
remembered hitting his first big-league homer here off Roger
Clemens, then with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that day on,'' Sosa said, ``I told myself, `I can play
this game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa played it so well last season, he hit 66 homers, but he'll
always wonder how many he might have hit with half his games in
Fenway Park if the free-agent contract he once signed with the Red
Sox during a labor dispute had not been voided by the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would've played here,'' Sosa said with a smile, ``maybe I
would have hit 72.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, whose two homers led the Mets to two victories over
the Yankees last weekend, professed not to be thinking about The
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very alluring,'' the Mets' catcher said, ``but I think my
strength is gap to gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is more difficult for a left-handed slugger in Fenway Park,
although there's a red seat halfway up the bleachers in right field
for the Red Sox's most legendary hitter. Ted Williams lofted a home
run off the straw hat of a fan sitting there in 1946, the same year
he hit two homers in Fenway for the AL in a 12-0 rout in the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., the Mariners' center fielder with 29 homers,
always arrives at Fenway Park with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't change my approach in Fenway,'' he said. ``I try to
hit it back up the middle. If it's outside, I try to hit The Wall.
If it's inside, I try to hook it around that pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey meant Pesky's Pole down the right-field line that Red
Sox shortstop Johnny Pesky somehow hit for homers.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no nickname for the pole down the left-field line.
The Green Monster wouldn't tolerate any trespassers.

GORE TAKES AIM AGAINST GUN OWNERSHIP RIGHTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore proposed a variety of crime-fighting
ideas Monday aimed partly against gun ownership rights and
indirectly at the Republican presidential campaign of Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as the Democratic candidate for president, Gore called
for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing rights for crime
victims. They should have official input on the sentencing of the
criminal who wronged them, be notified of the perpetrator's release
from prison and have the right to compensation for the crime, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who delivered his detailed speech at Boston police
headquarters, called for a national law against ``hate crimes,''
more federal funds to hire prosecutors and police officers, and
tougher sentences for crimes against the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But ``for all the challenges we face in the fight against crime,
there is one that looms over the rest: It is too easy for a child
or criminal to get a gun in America,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government should require states to restrict handgun
sales to buyers who have a special license, including a photo
identification, showing that they have passed a background check
and learned about gun safety, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the government should ban cheap ``junk'' handguns, require
child-proof safety locks on handguns, restrict gun purchases to one
per month and provide grants to help states end plea-bargaining for
criminals who use guns, the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many political leaders who take their marching
orders from the gun lobby,'' Gore said. ``I call upon you to join
with me to create a family lobby that is greater and more powerful
than the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign spokesman said the remarks were not intended for
contrast with any other candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore staffers have eagerly acknowledged in the past few
weeks, in response to the shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado, that Gore is trying to highlight the contrasting gun
ownership policies of Bush, the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes gun registration and the gun purchasing license
idea, saying that the documentation of law-abiding citizens will
not prevent criminals from using guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to support tougher sentences for gun violence,
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. She contended that the Clinton
administration, which includes Gore, has not adequately prosecuted
gun-related crimes under existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican candidate, Elizabeth Dole, said Gore has been
missing from the crime-fighting scene because the federal
government prosecuted few cases involving weapons being carried
into schools.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has proposed some of the most far-reaching gun control
ideas in the Republican field, calling for child-proof safety
locks, among other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is proud of statistics showing crime at its lowest level in
25 years and is proposing new programs to suppress crime further,
spokesman Roger Salazar said. He repeated the statement when asked
why Gore had not broached the ideas earlier as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Gore continued to criticize those ``who want more
concealed weapons'' and ``want to enact new protections for gun
manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed the 1995 law that allowed law-abiding citizens to
carry concealed handguns in Texas as well as a law passed this year
virtually banning lawsuits against gun manufacturers by cities and
other local government agencies. He has said concealed weapons
allow citizens to protect themselves against criminals and that the
lawsuit ban would reduce frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also said that gun safety locks should be voluntary and
that gun buyers should have to wait a day _ rather than the
three-day period favored by Gore _ before a background check clears
the way for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's competition
for the Democratic nomination, has already called for the
registration of each gun in the nation, a ban on the sale of
``Saturday Night special'' handguns, a ban on gun sales in
residential areas, mandatory safety locks and gun safety training
for every gun owner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said in the prepared text of his speech that the need for
hate crime legislation was bolstered when a Midwestern racist
recently shot blacks, Asian-Americans and Jews before killing
himself during a police chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It astonishes me that, just two weeks after the terrible
crimes of hate in Illinois and Indiana, some still deny that hate
crimes merit stiffer punishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's state Legislature, Bush declined to take sides
over a hate crimes bill for Texas, but also said that laws should
punish deeds instead of thoughts. The bill did not pass.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also addressed issues of crime and race.
</P>
<P>
   He said there should be scholarships to help more minorities
become police officers, prosecutors and public defenders. He also
urged a ban on ``racial profiling'' _ the practice of putting
people under criminal suspicion because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am elected president, (the ban) will be the first civil
rights action of the new century,'' Gore said.
</P>

THE WB BLEW IT IN DELAYING `BUFFY' FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WB missed a fabulous opportunity by postponing the season
finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like every ``Buffy'' episode, the delayed finale is dripping
with symbolism. Creator Joss Whedon delights in it, exploring teen
angst on two levels _ one achingly real for any viewer who can
remember the high school experience, the other really aching, but
only for the stunt people and anyone who gets too close to a stray
slayer kick. For the rest, it's a fantasy experience, save for the
inherent allegorical meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of otherworldly meanies do get whacked in the finale,
which airs Tuesday night. A few good guys, too. But violence, while
always a part of ``Buffy,'' is never the message. Tonight's lesson,
for instance, includes a subtle reminder on the importance of
inclusiveness and teamwork. And the marquee exercise _ no surprise
here _ involves the triumph of righteousness over cruelty, hatred
and fear, regardless of cost or loss.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice to hear this message on May 25, five
weeks after the horrible shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo. But the brass at The WB thought otherwise, fearing
the network would be viewed as insensitive if it aired the episode,
even though it was the second half of a two-part story that began
the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away too much detail, Tuesday night's episode is
a sort of Joan of Arc tale for the '90s, in which Buffy (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) leads students in an uprising against the city's
mayor, who chooses the graduation ceremony at Sunnydale High as the
springboard to his transformation into an enormous serpent bent on
world domination, or at least mastery of the greater Sunnydale
metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   The ridiculousness of it all suggests that The WB may be taking
itself too seriously, which is a dangerous development right there.
I mean, come on! The politician as disgusting reptile? How
subversive is that? Rather than questioning the network's motives,
we should be giving it an award for accuracy in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And The WB, last time I checked, is all about entertainment. It
doesn't even have a newsmagazine to blur the distinction between
entertainment and information. It exists solely to entertain and,
theoretically, make money for its investors.
</P>
<P>
   By taking the ``Buffy'' finale off the air in May, The WB played
right into the hands of those who want to blame television and the
movies for every act of violence that disrupts our lives. These
people never seem to suggest that the good kids of the world owe
their Eagle Scout behavior to ``Touched by an Angel'' or ``7th
Heaven,'' so the link they make between TV and violence strikes me
as a bit lame. Sure, there's stuff on TV I would never allow a
child to watch, but it usually involves babes in bikinis wielding
automatic weapons. Unfortunately, in the eyes of many who've never
even seen ``Buffy,'' The WB's executive order reduced one of the
best-written, best-acted shows on TV to the level of ``Acapulco
H.E.A.T.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the real shame.

 NINE ARRESTED IN CREDIT CARD SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One thing that hundreds of people who fell victim to
an elaborate credit card scheme had in common was that they had all
rented a car from the Thrifty car rental agency in Warwick, R.I.,
over the last three years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing they had in common was that a former employee at
the agency was accused of selling copies of their rental car
agreements for $20 apiece to a group of Nigerian immigrants in New
York who used the information to steal $1.4 million, according to
prosecutors from the Queens County district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants used information from the rental agreements to
dig for more data in computer banks to call banks and transfer
money from the victims' credit card accounts into bank accounts
that they had opened under false identities, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Nigerian immigrants were arraigned Monday in the credit
card scheme, which was also linked to a broad range of other
crimes, including tax fraud, forgery of drivers' licenses and
Social Security cards to help illegal immigrants obtain employment,
and dealing in drugs. All nine pleaded not guilty to the charges,
which were handed up in a 268-count indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said 1,300
people from 21 states had had their credit identities stolen by the
ring since early 1996. Law enforcement officials traced the illegal
wire transfers, ranging from $600 to $44,000 and said most of the
stolen money was sent back to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The former Thrifty employee, who was not identified by
prosecutors Monday, was also accused of selling rental car
agreements in Chicago and Missouri but has not yet been charged in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that while the banks that issued the credit cards
eventually covered the losses, ``the victims still suffered
immeasurably because of the loss of their credit ratings and of
their good names.'' He added that consumers ultimately wound up
paying for this kind of fraud through high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said the car rental agreements included the driver's license
number of the renter, which in some states is the same as a Social
Security number. The suspects are said to have used the Social
Security numbers to obtain copies of birth certificates, which
provided mothers' maiden names _ the password that many banks use
to authorize money transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Brown and Police Commissioner Howard Safir called for
changes in the banking industry to make it harder to transfer large
sums of money by phone. They also said law enforcement efforts were
handicapped by the fact that banks seldom report this type of fraud
and instead assume it as a cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incomprehensible to me that banks would transfer large
amounts of money out of an account based simply on a telephone call
without any significant means of identification,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said a major hurdle in prosecuting this kind of credit
card fraud was that neither victims nor banks readily reported the
crime. ``People are not rushing forward to report it because the
credit card companies tell them they're not liable for it,'' he
said. ``So banks need to rush forward and report this, but they
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said banks often made it easy to transfer money
electronically to attract more customers. ``They figure if one of
100 transactions is fraudulent, then that's the cost of doing
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the illegal transactions in the current case, worth $1.1
million, were authorized by MBNA-America, a bank based in
Wilmington, Del. Other financial institutions lost between $21,000
and $64,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Dalphon, a spokesman for MBNA, which has 40 million
customers worldwide, said he believed that it was just coincidence
that the bulk of the illegal transfers came out of MBNA accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fraud losses are actually among the lowest in the
industry,'' he said. ``This particular scheme was brand new. It was
something we hadn't seen before, and since then, we've put in
controls so that it won't happen again.'' He would not elaborate on
the new controls.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the credit card scheme was uncovered while
police officers were investigating suspected drug dealing in the
Rockaways. Wiretaps subsequently led officials from one of the drug
suspects to other suspects involved in the credit card theft and
forgery. Officials said they did not know whether all the suspects
were legal immigrants or where in Nigeria they came from.
</P>
<P>
   The three suspects charged with selling $16,500 worth of heroin
face up to life in prison if convicted and are being held without
bail. They are Joseph Omesiete, 44, a security guard from Far
Rockaway, N.Y.; Babatunde Shodunke, 34, a taxi driver from
Rosedale, N.Y.; and Bola Adeola, 34, a security guard from Arverne,
N.Y. Adeola also has been charged in the credit card scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the credit card operation was organized by
Ayodele Peters, 28, who they said ran it from his home in the
Canarsie section of Brooklyn. He faces seven years in prison if
convicted and was unable to post $60,000 in bail. His lawyer, David
E. Levine, declared his innocence and said, ``He wouldn't be
sitting in jail for $60,000 bond if he had $1 million he'd stolen
from people.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine also represents Peters' wife, Yewande Elegbe Peters, who
faces 25 years in prison if convicted in the scheme. Levine said
Mrs. Peters, who worked as a state Health Department inspector,
gave birth two weeks ago to twin boys two months prematurely. ``The
birth was brought on by the aggravation of this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four other suspects were released on bail and face between 7
and 15 years in prison if convicted. They are Derrick Roundtree, a
35-year-old accountant from the Flatbush section of Brooklyn;
Olusola Ashaye, a 42-year-old security guard from the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn; Abiodun Oguntoyinbo, a
38-year-old security guard from Bedford-Stuyvesant; and Adebiyi
Otulaja, a 37-year-old youth counselor from Arverne, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Payne, a spokesman for Thrifty, said he had little
information on the case. ``We do recommend that our locations take
the utmost care in handling this kind of information,'' he said,
adding that many agencies use shredders to destroy the forms.

STATE RULING COULD INCREASE HEALTH-CARE PREMIUM COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many New Yorkers, already facing increases in health
premiums of more than 10 percent, could face even greater increases
after a ruling by state insurance regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applies to a popular form of coverage: so-called
point-of-service plans, which generally allow customers to receive
care outside their health maintenance organization's network if
they pay extra.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, insurance companies can no longer offer lower
rates for such plans based on the low health care spending by
employees of some large companies. Independent insurance agents say
the ruling, which affects health plans with 2 million members,
could force up the monthly premium for such plans by $100 to $200
for companies that provide family coverage. The premiums average
$650 a month now, with the employers' share varying widely.
</P>
<P>
   Point-of-service plans usually encourage their members to use
network hospitals and doctors, but the members are permitted to go
to physicians outside the HMO network for an extra charge. The
state has treated them as HMOs, which must offer the same rate to
all customers in New York, except for the portion of services by
non-HMO doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, state regulators allowed the HMOs to offer attractive
deals to big employers to get their business. They based rates on
the number of non-HMO services. But insurance officials say the
companies were inflating the numbers and telling the insurance
department that more members were using non-HMO services than was
actually the case.
</P>
<P>
   The department issued the ruling after receiving complaints from
insurance brokers who said some companies were changing prices in
an inconsistent manner. Members of Oxford Health Plans, which
specializes in point of service, used Oxford doctors 90 percent of
the time and non-network doctors 10 percent, said Charles Henricks,
acting chief of the insurance department health bureau. But in
trying to entice customers with lower rates, Oxford understated how
many of its members were using network doctors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other big companies used similar sleight of hand to meet
Oxford's prices, Henricks said. Now regulators say that they cannot
do that. Under the new ruling, which takes effect on Feb. 1, 2000,
the point-of-service programs have to offer the same prices to all
comers.
</P>
<P>
   There is a debate about who will benefit. Some industry experts
say premiums for some point of service plans will go up 25 percent
or more. State officials expect the ruling to benefit smaller
groups that were not getting the attractive deals.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges would be on top of double-digit annual increases
already projected for many groups in New York and across the
country as insurance companies push for higher revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But insurance companies say there will be little change in
costs. Oxford says it will rewrite its plans to avoid the ruling,
and several other insurance companies say they are watching closely
to decide what to do. Benefits consultants noted that large
employers can escape the consequences of the ruling by taking
responsibility for insuring their own people, as many already do.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional fee-for-service insurers and self-insured employers
are not subject to the new New York regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Point-of-service plans have about 2 million members in New York
state, including 1 million Oxford members, with the rest shared by
16 other HMOs. They include Cigna Corp., Aetna and United
Healthcare Group. There will be no change for smaller employers
with 2 to 50 workers, which already are charged a rate that does
not reflect their medical histories.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford said Monday it would keep its prices for large employers
substantially unchanged by offering its coverage through an
indemnity unit, Oxford Health Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   While the insurance companies say the ruling should not affect
premiums, several consultants said there could be sharp increases
for some groups.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said health plans based on indemnity
insurance are usually priced higher than the HMO plans, based on
the expectation that costs would be higher if members and their
doctors could make their own decisions with few restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Travers, a partner in Travers O'Keefe, a Manhattan
insurance agency, said Oxford had handed one large company a 24
percent increase for this year, breaking a promise to limit annual
increases to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Travers said that after his agency complained to regulators,
Oxford agreed to the 6 percent increase, which he said was $10
million lower than the original increase.
</P>
<P>
   Henricks said regulators noticed discrepancies when took a close
look at Oxford after disclosure of the company's financial
problems. He said Oxford had been losing money on its
point-of-service business, apparently because of the low rates that
it was charging some big employers.

TAIWAN DROPS `ONE-CHINA' STANCE, AND BEIJING IS FURIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 
(LEADS with 9 grafs to recast, add background on Nixon's visit,
Taiwan's burgeoning democracy; Pickup 8th graf pvs, Lee's sudden
turnaround ...)  (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Taiwan has abandoned the political formula that has
long helped avert war with China, declaring Monday that it will no
longer adhere to the principle that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan
are two parts of the same country. Beijing's response was
immediate, and furious.
</P>
<P>
   The shift, surprising and sudden, risks badly souring Taiwan's
relations with China and also could worsen the strains in the
already troubled ties between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Led by President Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's government is
essentially taking a step away from the conceptual umbrella of
inevitable reunification between China and Taiwan that has been a
basic condition of all talks between them.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the deliberate ambiguity known as the ``one China''
policy allowed Beijing and Taipei to maintain the fiction that each
was the legitimate ruler of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Nixon's visit to China in 1972, it has also been
a cornerstone of U.S.-China relations, allowing Washington to
support Taiwan but recognize Beijing as the capital of China.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Beijing has watched warily as the arrival of
democracy on Taiwan led to more open debate, with an opposition
party that put Taiwan independence in its platform. Beijing warned
all along that it would use force if Taiwan's government declared
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by dropping the one-China formula, Lee _ Taiwan's first
native-born president _ is moving a critical step in the direction
of asserting Taiwan's independent status, while stopping short of
an actual declaration.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview over the weekend on German radio, Lee, an
unpredictable politician whose provocative steps in 1996 brought
Taiwan close to armed conflict with China and then delivered him a
resounding victory in a presidential election, said that from now
on, Taiwan would treat contacts with China as ``state-to-state''
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under such special nation-to-nation relations,'' he said,
``there is no longer any need to declare Taiwanese independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's sudden turnaround on this diplomatically critical
terminology provoked muted response in Taiwan at first, as other
politicians debated what he meant while Lee himself maintained a
conspicuous silence.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday another senior Taiwanese official came forward to
clarify what Lee's remarks meant: that Taiwan would scrap the
one-China formula that has been used as a base for all discussions
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new definition reflects our disappointment over the
Communists' `one-China' principle,'' said the official, Su Chi,
chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council. ``We think the
current abnormal relationship across the straits is the result of
the Chinese Communists refusing to face reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift outraged officials in Beijing, who accused Lee of
taking ``an extremely dangerous step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sternly warn Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities not to
underestimate the Chinese government's firm determination to uphold
national sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity,'' said Zhu
Bangzao, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ``Don't underestimate the
courage and force of the Chinese people to oppose separatism and
Taiwan independence.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no public indication for what prompted Lee's sudden
change, though the timing suggested an obvious possibility: local
politics. A presidential campaign is getting underway in Taiwan,
and the stance of Lee's Nationalist Party toward the mainland will
be a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Taiwan's main opposition party, the Democratic
Progressive Party, nominated former Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian as
its candidate to succeed Lee, whose term expires next year.
Nationalist Party supporters are expected to be split between Vice
President Lien Chan, supported by Lee, and a popular former
official, James Soong, who may defect to another party.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls in Taiwan reflect popular support for better ties
with the mainland, the Nationalist Party is eager to woo away some
supporters from the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors a
formal declaration of independence from China.
</P>
<P>
   That single word, independence, lies at the crux of the
bickering between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan and China have acted separately and
independently of each other for 50 years, governments on each side
have until now accepted the premise that they are both parts of the
same country _ that Taiwan is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other countries, forced to choose whether to
recognize Beijing or Taipei as the legitimate representative of
China, have by now nearly all chosen Beijing, leaving Taiwan
diplomatically isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Washington switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
State Department spokesman James Foley said Monday that the
American policy of ``one China'' remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. position on Taiwan's future is also clear,'' Foley
said. ``We believe that it is a matter for the Chinese people, on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, to resolve. The United States has
an abiding interest and concern that any such resolution be a
peaceful one.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a State Department official said the administration was
``not consulted in advance'' on Lee's statement. The official said
the administration was still trying to find out from Taiwan
officials what Lee had said in his radio interview and ``what it
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's view is that Taiwan is temporarily under the
administration of another, while it awaits the forces of history to
push it to reunification with the mainland. As a result, Beijing
often seems obsessed with any hint that Taiwan will declare itself
independent in name, as well as in reality.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound bizarre to an outsider, but one of the meanest
insults a Chinese official can use against Lee is that he is a
``splitist,'' or someone who aims to split Taiwan away from China.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, while official bickering between China and
Taiwan has veered between a high pitch and low pitch, the flow of
money, people and culture across the Taiwan straits has boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese television programs are now regularly broadcast in the
mainland, since they are often of higher quality. Taiwanese
businessmen have invested more than $30 billion in mainland China,
and hundreds of thousands of them now live here.
</P>
<P>
   But popular indifference to the oratorical fighting between
Beijing and Taipei has not diluted the criticism that Beijing
continues to spew about Lee. Monday's excoriations in Beijing were
the harshest since 1996, when China was infuriated by Lee's
political maneuvering that led to a visit to the United States, the
first by a Taiwan president since Washington dropped diplomatic
recognition two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   China launched missiles into the ocean near Taiwan in an attempt
to intimidate voters just before the presidential election in
Taiwan. Instead, the panic gave Lee a decisive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Beijing has continued to denounce Lee, depicted in China's
media as a dishonest man who proclaims his interest in
reunification while he is really inching back toward an all-out
declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee's flagrant redefinition of cross-straits relations as
`state-to-state' relations exposed his political malice,'' said a
spokesman for the Communist Party's Taiwan Work Office, quoted in
Beijing newspapers Monday. ``Lee has been deceiving Taiwanese
compatriots and misleading people internationally.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, said he was
shocked by Lee's remarks. Taiwan's new position, Wang suggested,
could make it impossible to continue the series of meetings between
representatives of Taipei and Beijing that have been underway
off-and-on since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This formulation means there is no basis for contact, exchange
or communication,'' said Wang in a dispatch by the New China News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is scheduled to visit Taiwan in October; he would be the
most senior mainland official to do so since the Nationalist Party
retreated to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait chimed in, too. He called Lee's
remarks ``a crude sabotage of the cross-straits relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Statesmen should keep their word, and their failure to keep
their promise will only cause disaster to the people of Taiwan,''
Tang said, the New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though officials in Beijing chose vitriol, they might have
pointed to the fine print of Taiwan's own Unification Guidelines,
adopted in 1991 to identify steps toward unification between Taiwan
and China. It calls for defining Taiwan's relations with China as
those between `equal political entities,' rather than
`state-to-state.'
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's terminology, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan official, Su, argued that the old formula was being
exploited by Beijing to undermine the legitimacy of the Nationalist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown our goodwill by calling ourselves a political
entity under a one-China policy,'' Su said. ``But the Chinese
Communists have used this policy to squeeze us internationally. We
feel there is no need to continue using the one-China term.''

ON BASEBALL: FROM BOONDOCKS TO BIGS, ON A SLIDER AND A PRAYER

<P>
   BOSTON _ As he sat in a hotel ballroom filled with American
League All-Stars Monday, Jeff Zimmerman was in a unique position.
Not Cal Ripken, not Derek Jeter or Bernie Williams, not Roberto
Alomar or Rafael Palmeiro or John Wetteland or Ivan Rodriguez or
Pedro Martinez could make the claim Jeff Zimmerman could.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first graduate of the Northern League, an independent
minor league, and the French National League _ yes, the league
plays in France _ to be named to a major-league All-Star team. Oh,
did we mention that he's Canadian, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually the first Canadian player,'' Zimmerman said
Monday, ``to win a French championship. That had been my claim to
fame up until today.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's claim to fame in reality is the 0.86 earned run
average and .106 opponents' batting average he has produced for the
Texas Rangers as the most effective set-up reliever in the major
leagues this year. Those numbers don't look real, but they
represent his rookie performance and the reason Zimmerman, who two
years ago was pitching in an independent league, will have a seat
in the American League bullpen at Fenway Park Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not even a dream come true for me, because it's just
something I never dreamed of,'' Zimmerman, a 26-year-old
right-hander, told a host of reporters. ``Maybe I dreamed of
playing hockey in the NHL. I grew up in a real small town back in
rural Alberta. This is just an amazing thrill for me. It's tough
enough for me to imagine myself playing major-league baseball, let
alone having the success I've had so far this year and to find
myself in the All-Star Game as a middle relief pitcher. It just
blows me away. It's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   His presence in Boston represented a great leap from the days
when he resorted to sending his resume to all major-league clubs
and could not hire an agent to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother had the Hendricks agency in Houston,'' Zimmerman
said, referring to his brother, Jordan, a reliever with the Seattle
Mariners. ``I talked to them, hoping they'd represent me, but they
didn't want to give me the time of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman comes from the farming community of Carseland, a town
of 500 with an elementary school but no traffic lights. ``If you
blink, you might miss it,'' he said. The area offered so few
baseball opportunities that when he and Jordan were teen-agers,
their parents arranged games with American Legion teams as far as
an eight-hour drive away in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman became more mainstream when he attended Texas
Christian University, but his efforts in two seasons there did not
attract even one major-league club. He went undrafted and contented
himself playing for the Canadian national team in international
tournaments. It was that experience that led him to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pitching coach from Team Canada who coached in
France,'' he said. ``It was a good opportunity to go and work with
him, develop some pitches and experience another culture and
another country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 season in France was critical to Zimmerman's
development. That's where he mastered the slider that leaves AL
hitters muttering and shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition was about on the level with junior colleges in
the United States,'' he said. ``I was able to experiment a little
bit. I could throw the slider and not worry about getting hurt on
it. If I got into situations where I fell behind, I could just
throw three fastballs by the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   His season on the shores of the Mediterranean left Zimmerman
with a terrific slider, but it eventually became a source of jokes
among his Texas teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get teased about that a lot, especially by veteran guys like
Mike Morgan,'' Zimmerman said. ``He's always ribbing me, telling me
he's going to go over there in the off-season and try to pick up a
slider. He said if I could find one, he could find one.''
</P>
<P>
   The slider, Zimmerman said, is not comparable to ones thrown by
pitchers like David Cone, John Smoltz and Kevin Brown. But, he
said, ``I have a herky-jerky funky delivery, and that might hide my
slider a little better. It might be a little more deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, the Rangers' closer, said Zimmerman's motion made his
slider ``difficult to pick up and identify as a slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman played professionally for the first time in 1997 as a
starter with the Winnipeg Gold Eyes of the Northern League, going
9-2 with a league-leading 2.82 ERA. It was after that season that
he sent out resumes telling clubs who he was and how he had
developed slowly but was improving each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, seeking players to fill out a new Class A
minor-league team, were the only club to respond, but they signed
him and made him a reliever, and Zimmerman advanced rapidly. Last
year at Class A Charlotte and Class AA Tulsa, he was a combined 5-2
with nine saves, a 1.28 ERA and 81 strikeouts in 77 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland said Zimmerman got his attention in spring training
this year when he struck out five batters in a two-inning
appearance against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In 35 games and 521/3 innings, Zimmerman has struck out 46,
walked 11, allowed 18 hits (only one home run, by Paul O'Neill) and
gained eight victories against no defeats. It earned him a rare
All-Star spot for a reliever who isn't a closer.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting his flight to Boston on Sunday night with his
All-Star and Ranger teammates, Rafael Palmeiro, Wetteland and
Rodriguez, Zimmerman said: ``I'm glad I have three other teammates
to come to the All-Star Game with me because I might be intimidated
coming here myself, trying to talk with Cal Ripken or Derek Jeter
or stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been Zimmerman, though, who has been doing the
intimidating this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since a health care revolution
began moving patients into managed care more than a decade ago, the
Senate opened a high-stakes debate Monday over how to protect the
rights of patients and regulate the companies that provide health
insurance for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, is the first
of several politically potent health care issues _ such as an
overhaul of Medicare to include a new prescription drug benefit for
the elderly _ to come to the fore in Congress this session. It
would regulate health maintenance organizations and has broad
implications for doctors, insurance companies, employers and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With health care a steady voter concern, the legislation is also
considered so significant for next year's congressional campaigns
that Republicans and Democrats were going to unusual lengths Monday
to frame the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Each side brought in aggrieved citizens to support its version
of the bill. Republicans, whose version provides generally less
regulation than the Democratic version, and would be less
expensive, showcased small-business owners who said that already
they could barely afford health insurance for themselves and their
employees, or could not afford it at all. A man given a platform by
the Democrats told of a son who had died of cancer after an HMO had
refused to pay for a necessary treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The floor strategy was particularly convoluted, as each side
tried to position itself to attack the other's legislation rather
than defend its own. So the bill the Republicans brought to the
floor for debate Monday was an early, more expensive Democratic
version that the minority had superseded. And the Democrats planned
to try to turn that bill into the Republican legislation, through
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused the Democrats of crafting legislation that
would favor lawyers by expanding the right to sue. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, said the Democratic bill gives a patient the right to
``choose any lawyer that they could pick out of a phone book.
That's their idea of health care freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that the Republicans were protecting the
profits of health maintenance organizations. ``It is interesting to
hear HMOs and their allies in the Senate weeping crocodile tears
over the cost increases they claim our protections will cause,''
said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., noting that the top 10 HMOs
in the country made $1.5 billion in profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheapest insurance policy is one that pays the fewest
benefits when you get sick,'' Kennedy said, ``and that seems to be
the goal of too many unscrupulous managed care companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As the four-day debate began, an array of powerful interest
groups, from the insurance industry to organized labor to the
American Medical Association, were also waging television and
newspaper advertising campaigns on both sides of the issue,
primarily in the states of swing Republicans, some of them up for
election next year, who are regarded as swing voters on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The health insurance industry announced a one-year, $10.5
million television campaign, featuring doctors, that is intended to
burnish the image of managed care. The AFL-CIO said it was putting
more than $400,000 worth of ads on the air in eight states in favor
of the Democrats' bill. And, acting against the Democrat's bill, a
coalition of businesses and insurance companies continued an
advertising campaign that they said would cost $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The war of the airwaves reflected the awareness that the health
insurance industry's ``Harry and Louise'' ad campaign helped sink
President Clinton's proposal for universal health care coverage in
1994 and that a multimillion dollar campaign by the tobacco
industry last year proved fatal to anti-smoking legislation by
reframing it as a tax increase for smokers instead of as a public
health issue.
</P>
<P>
   The issue before the Senate is how to guarantee patients' access
to medical care. Both versions would give patients easier access to
emergency rooms, and specialists like obstetricians and
pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   But there are significant differences as well. ``This is a
difference in approach that we think is as profound as anything
that divides Republicans and Democrats,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, saying they are acting in deference to the
rights of states, would extend many protections only to the 48
million Americans whose insurance is regulated exclusively by the
federal government, not by the states, although the provision in
their bill guaranteeing a right to appeal a health plan's denial of
treatment would apply to a broader group of 120 million. The
Democrats, in contrast, would cover all 161 million Americans with
private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would expand the rights of Americans to sue their
health plans in state court, but the Republicans would not.
Currently most Americans in managed care plans must bring suits
over coverage decisions in federal court, where a patient can
typically collect the value of the care denied but not punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and Democrats also differ over who decides
whether treatment is medically necessary, with Republicans allowing
insurance companies to make the final judgment and Democrats
granting that decision to doctors, subject to some federal
guidelines. Both bills would allow patients to appeal adverse
decisions _ first to the health plan and then to an independent
panel _ although the details differ.
</P>
<P>
   With regulation of health maintenance organizations a
centerpiece of their legislative agenda, the Democrats for several
years have had the upper hand in this debate. It was their party
that forced the legislation to the floor by tying up the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and their industry allies Monday sought to turn
the debate away from the Democrats' preferred ground of patient
protection to the question of increased premium costs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their case, they put an early version of the
Democrats' measure on the Senate floor as the base bill for debate
instead of their own bill. The Congressional Budget Office had
found that that bill would have raised the costs of insurance
premiums by 6.1 percent. The Democrats subsequently altered their
bill so that it would raise premiums by 4.8 percent. The Republican
bill would raise premiums by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans repeatedly cited the earliest version of the
Democratic bill as they argued that the Democrats would force
people and small businesses to give up health insurance as too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrat bill is fatally flawed,'' said Senate
Majority Whip Don Nickles from Oklahoma, charging that it would
increase health care costs for a family insurance plan by $350.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would add 1.8 million people to the list of the
uninsured,'' he said, ``That is a serious mistake. We don't want to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The same theme was struck in the ads run by the coalition of
businesses and health insurers in several states represented by
Republican senators. One such 30-second spot featured three
Americans worried about losing their health insurance. ``I gotta
pay more for new government regulations?'' asked one indignant man.
``I can barely afford insurance now.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the Republicans were inflating the price
of their bill and overstating its effects on the ranks of the
uninsured. They said it would cost an individual an additional $2 a
month in premiums, or as Kennedy put it, ``the cost of a Big Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats sought to portray the Republican bill as
inadequate and their own bill as one that would protect patients
from insurance companies seeking to cut costs by providing inferior
care. ``Theirs is not a bill of rights,'' Daschle said. ``It's a
bill of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 55-45 hold over the Senate, the Republicans are likely to
prevail by week's end. But the days will bring a series of votes on
amendments that both sides want to use to highlight their
differences in the next election.

GARCIAPARRA, BOSTON'S HERO, LEADS SHORTSTOP PACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The passionate feelings about whether Nomar Garciaparra
would be voted in as the American League's shortstop for the
All-Star Game over Derek Jeter filled this parochial city for
weeks. After Garciaparra squeaked by Jeter, with a late boost from
Internet voters, the dominant question shifted to whether or not
Garciaparra would be healthy enough to play.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra missed Boston's last nine games with a strained left
groin muscle, but he eased the minds of every cab driver, bellhop
and bartender who fretted about the sinewy shortstop's availability
at fabled Fenway Park on Tuesday night by stressing that he would
definitely start. An entire city exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   So Red Sox fans are breathing easily because Garciaparra's
injury will not stop him from starting in this midsummer spectacle
and because the incomparable Pedro Martinez will start against the
National League's Curt Schilling, the former Red Sox minor-leaguer
and current star for the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I didn't want to come back to Boston,'' joked Manager
Joe Torre, ``I think that was the only choice.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no debate about Tuesday's starting pitcher for the AL,
because of Martinez's brilliance and because Torre recalled the
ovation the fans gave him when he returned following prostate
cancer surgery here in May and wanted to give them a gift. But
Torre and David Cone continued the ongoing shortstop debate by
respectfully arguing that Jeter, a fellow Yankee, deserved to be
the starter, not Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeter might be the MVP of the league,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect this shortstop debate to cease for another decade.
While players discussed Martinez's being halfway to the magical
total of 30 victories and Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire targeting the
Green Monster, they gushed over the shortstops from the American
League. The group is so talented _ with All-Stars Garciaparra,
Jeter and Cleveland's Omar Vizquel _ that Alex Rodriguez, a
wondrous 24-year-old who had 42 homers and 46 steals for Seattle
last season, was not even selected, primarily because he missed
time with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are freaks of nature,'' said Barry Larkin, who is
starting at shortstop for the NL. ``It's amazing the things that
they're capable of doing. These guys are a rarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin sounded more like a fan than a player who is appearing in
his seventh All-Star Game as he talked of favoring Jeter's defense,
Garciaparra's overall play and Rodriguez's power. What about
Vizquel? Vizquel refused to put himself in the same category as the
terrific trio since he is more renowned for bunting than bashing
baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard to see guys like this come around in
baseball ever again,'' Vizquel said. ``Guys doing what they're
doing is unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the consistent Larkin, there is also strength at the
position in the NL with Florida's Alex Gonzalez, an All-Star who
might win the Rookie of the Year Award, and the Mets' Rey Ordonez,
who could be the best defensive player in the majors. But they are
not as formidable as the big three of Nomar, Derek and A-Rod and
the little one named Omar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking shortstop, nowadays you're talking about
some of the very best players in the game,'' said Cal Ripken, the
pioneer for the power-hitting shortstop, who played 14 All-Star
Games at the position. ``It's great to watch and to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone added: ``These guys are MVP-type players who play
shortstop, which is normally a defensive position. I don't know how
that's going to impact future generations, but I know there a lot
of kids who are playing shortstop because of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is not 100 percent, but he said that he was capable
of playing and would use the All-Star Game as preparation for the
resumption of the season on Thursday. While Garciaparra was coy as
to how much he plans to play, he might only bat once. Simply seeing
him at his familiar position, even briefly, should satisfy fans who
helped ensure he would be the marquee shortstop for this marquee
game in his own city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a great time to be a fan of the game,''
Garciaparra said. There's great players all around at every
position in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially shortstop. Jeter admitted he studies box scores to
see how other shortstops have done and claimed it motivates him to
do even better. The Yankee danced like a Rockette when he was asked
to name the best shortstop and playfully decided on his father,
Charles, a former college shortstop. That was not the only time
Jeter behaved like an excitable 12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're overwhelmed by this whole experience,'' Jeter said.
``You feel like a little kid. You want to run around and get
autographs from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It is always interesting to watch All-Stars interact with
All-Stars. There was Jeter peeking over the heads of reporters
gathered around Bernie Williams to get a smile from his teammate,
and Garciaparra's relatives toting a video camera to tape his
unforgettable day, and Ken Griffey Jr. blaming his tardiness on his
3-year-old daughter, who wanted her father to watch cartoons in the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the chatty Schilling, who called himself
``excited, honored and anxious'' to start the game, even if he said
that watching Martinez dominate hitters has been like watching an
elite major-leaguer subdue Class AAA hitters. But Schilling grinned
and said he planned to throw lots of fastballs and relish his
All-Star experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as nervous for this game as any game I've ever pitched,''
Schilling explained. ``Because I'm still a fan, I guess. I grew up
watching the All-Star Game. Tomorrow night, it's the only game on
Earth.''

MARTINEZ IS STARTING, BUT HE REFUSES TO FORGET A SNUB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston's Pedro Martinez is excited about starting the
All-Star Game at Fenway Park on Tuesday, but the Red Sox pitcher
still harbors animosity toward Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove for
failing to start him last season. Hargrove picked David Wells, who
was a Yankee then, and Martinez took the choice as a snub.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's All-Star Game break, Martinez was 11-2 with a
2.87 earned run average and had 142 strikeouts and 34 walks in
1251/3 innings. Wells was 11-2 with a 3.75 ERA and had 88
strikeouts and 17 walks in 1121/3 innings. In addition, Wells had
thrown a perfect game for the best team in baseball. While the
statistics favored Martinez, it was not shocking that Hargrove
chose Wells, and it seemed a little drastic for Martinez to hold a
year-long grudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a different manager this year,'' Martinez said in
reference to Joe Torre. ``Last year we had a manager who was in
love with David Wells. This year, the manager didn't bring any
excuses like the other guy gives me a better chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who did not pitch in the 1998 All-Star Game, added,
``I'm sure Hargrove knows and realizes what happened after that,''
in an apparent reference to his beating Cleveland in Game 1 of the
division series last year. The Indians won the series.
</P>
<P>
   With a 15-2 record at the break this season, Martinez has
created a stir about possibly becoming the first pitcher in 31
years to win 30 games. Detroit's Denny McLain went 31-6 in 1968,
and Martinez thinks the lofty goal is attainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get the outings, I don't see why not,'' Martinez said.
``I don't see why it's that difficult if you have 35 starts. It
could happen. I don't know if anyone can do it. I hope it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other All-Star pitchers doubted that Martinez could reach 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in 35 starts,'' Curt Schilling said. ``No way. Just the
fact that you can talk about it as a realistic shot at the All-Star
break is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone compared winning 30 to Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting
streak and said: ``I think he would have to be perfect. He's going
to have to be near perfect to do it, and he's going to need the run
support and some help from his bullpen because he's not going to
throw a complete game each time out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ JACK CURRY
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez `Out of Line'
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez chose not to participate in the All-Star Game if
he was not picked as a starter by the fans, and the Texas
outfielder was criticized by some for not accepting being selected
as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk, the former Red Sox catcher who is the honorary
captain for the American League, spoke harshly about Gonzalez's
decision and called it ``totally out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether that's an attitude or selfishness on his
part, but it is, when you consider what kind of player he is, what
kind of statistics he has on the board at this time and not
allowing the rest of the league or the rest of the world to see his
talents,'' Fisk said. ``I think down the line he may regret that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, who played with Gonzalez in Texas, said: ``For me as
a friend and a person, I think the decision he made wasn't a very
good decision. But that's his business. Nothing I can do about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ JACK CURRY
</P>
<P>
   Torre's `Shy' Debut
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, manager of the American League All-Star team, Monday
recalled the first time he started in an All-Star Game. It was at
Shea Stadium in New York, he said, in 1964, when he was ``a shy
23-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Drysdale was the starting pitcher, and Torre, who was
catching, wanted to go over the signs with him for his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what sign he wanted for the spitter,'' Torre
related, ``and he said, `I'll just throw it off my fastball.' I
said OK. It was probably the dumbest thing I've ever done. In the
first inning I wound up going back to say hello to Mayor Wagner
about four times. After that, we had a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MURRAY CHASS
</P>
<P>
   Excited a Million Times Over
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell was elected to start at second base for the National
League All-Stars, but that role will have to take second place to
the experience he had Sunday. As part of an Arizona Diamondbacks
promotion, a female fan won $1 million because Bell hit a grand
slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to to hit a home run; I tried to hit a home run and
fortunately I did,'' Bell said. ``That was a much bigger highlight
than being here, no question about it. I couldn't have asked for a
better end to the first half than to have someone win $1 million
because I swung a bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who had already hit 23 home runs this season, said he knew
the situation when he went to bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably more excited about a home run than I ever have
been,'' he said. ``I was excited that this lady won a million
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MURRAY CHASS
</P>
<P>
   Dream Park for Sosa
</P>
<P>
   During the work stoppage of 1994, the Red Sox signed Sammy Sosa,
Kevin Appier and John Wetteland to free agent contracts. But all
three were voided because the signings occurred before baseball
instituted its new policies for the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   What would have happened to Sosa if he had come to Boston and
played in friendly Fenway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I would have hit 72,'' said Sosa, whose 66 homers were
second last year to Mark McGwire's career record of 70.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their plane from Anaheim, Calif., landed at Newark
International Airport at 4 a.m. Monday, and they slipped into New
York City while it was dozing. By 6 a.m., the U.S. women's soccer
team was leaving its midtown hotel and stepping onto a chartered
bus. Most of the players had not had time to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired I can't even give you good quotes right now,''
Kate Sobrero said. ``I'm just so exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one was complaining. A blizzard of morning television
shows awaited the 1999 Women's World Cup champions, news media
attention that they thought was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler than in 1991, Mia Hamm recalled, when the U.S. team
flew into New York after winning the first women's world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking we might get a ticker-tape parade,'' Hamm
said. ``Only two people showed up at the airport. This shows the
evolution of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   So 19 women _ every player except Michelle Akers, who has
chronic fatigue syndrome and was still recovering from heat
exhaustion and remained in California _ put on matching outfits
they had picked months ago and hit the town. They wore lavender
shirts, black pants, matching black sandals and cemented smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Weary but still chipper, they hopped on and off their bus for
four hours, stopping for appearances on ``Good Morning America,''
``Today,'' CNN and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   As they traveled, the players interacted with fans, signed
autographs and, especially, talked to little girls. They stopped
midtown traffic when they lifted up their championship trophy and
bopped around singing, ``We Are the Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   With their trademark grace and congeniality, the U.S. team,
which beat China on penalty kicks on Saturday, marched on with
their victory tour. They saved the yawns for commercial breaks, but
as the camera lights turned on, so did their charm.
</P>
<P>
   They were so courteous that some of the players offered to move
to seats in the back of the bus to accommodate the small news media
contingent that traveled with them.
</P>
<P>
   They played with the microphone during a commercial break on
``Good Morning America.'' Jackie Joyner-Kersee stopped by the ABC
set for hugs and praise. Wayne Gretzy called. Vice President Al
Gore saluted them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm did not seem to mind when a ``Today'' show producer looked
down at his scribbled notes and pronounced her first name ``Mian.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at CNN, a worker asked her to spell her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``M-I-A H-A-M-M,'' she said kindly as the rest of the crew
giggled.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain laughed at and set up countless jokes about her
shirt-tossing, sports bra-bearing celebration moments after her
Cup-winning penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   Here was one exchange as Chastain finished explaining how she
lost her gold medal from the World Cup in Los Angeles on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost it in the ruckus after the game,'' she said.
``Somebody's enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammate Carla Overbeck quickly responded, ``You should say
it just flew off when you took your shirt off.''
</P>
<P>
   The players scurried to the bus after each show, stopping to
sign as many autographs as time allowed. Once on the bus, they
didn't have much time to relax. Many of the players' cellphones
rang so much that it sounded like a telethon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch us at 8:30 on `Good Morning America,''' one player said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 17 messages on my cellphone!'' said the team spokesman,
Aaron Heifetz.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday, the team can relax for a few days _ and with more
financial assurance. Each player will now receive a $50,000 bonus
from the U.S. Soccer Federation instead of the original $12,500
they were promised if they won the title. The United States Olympic
Committee said it was giving $6,000 to each player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   A few players planned to leave Monday to go home, but much of
the team will be at Niketown on Fifth Avenue Tuesday at noon for a
rally.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled to be on ``The Late Show With David
Letterman'' next Tuesday. A few players are planning to go to the
Women's National Basketball Association All-Star Game Wednesday
night at Madison Square Garden. Some will participate in
Wednesday's LPGA JAL Big Apple Classic Pro-Am in New Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is that we're promoting women's soccer,''
Chastain said. ``It's worth all of this. We're tired, but we're not
complaining. This is such a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what this team does now, Hamm said: ``Rest.''

WORLD CUP MARKETERS MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the apparent savvy marketing and luck that vaulted the
U.S. women's soccer team into the public consciousness, one area of
business failed to ignite: the retail sale of licensed merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchandising was a missed opportunity,'' June McIvor, the
senior vice president and chief operating officer of the Women's
World Cup, said Monday. ``It didn't catch on. Retailers
underestimated what the event was about, and by the time they
understood it, it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling T-shirts, jerseys, caps, key chains and other
merchandise emblazoned with the official logos and slogans of
events and leagues is a standard sport-business practice.
Short-term ``hot markets'' for the apparel of World Series or Super
Bowl winners often reap millions of dollars in quickie regional
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not happen for the Women's World Cup, which
succeeded only in selling licensed goods at the stadiums where the
games were played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't keep it in stock at the stadiums,'' she said.
``Even before the first game at Giants Stadium, we were sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling the products at retail proved an unusually hard sell,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain the lack of retail acceptance,'' McIvor said.
``It seemed like a perfect product. Manufacturers cut back on
production.'' Among retailers, she said, only the Lady Foot Locker
chain did reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas U.S.A., a World Cup sponsor and apparel manufacturer,
generated late sales of T-shirts once the tournament began, but
nearly all came from stadium vendors. Rick Chastain (no relation to
the U.S. player Brandi Chastain), Adidas U.S.A.'s director of event
marketing, said, ``The traditional retail relationship was not as
much as we had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lady Foot Locker, where 7,000 tournament tickets were given
away in an Adidas promotion, merchandise sold briskly, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas sold a mixture of T-shirts and caps, plus more expensive
custom-made and embroidered jerseys and warm-up suits that were
produced overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said the lack of a broad-based retail ardor was
understandable because ``the World Cup didn't market itself prior
to the event as much as we had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to retailers a year ago with our line of goods,'' he
said, ``but we didn't see tremendous outreach in the public of the
event itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of winning may propel stars like Mia Hamm, Brandi
Chastain, Julie Foudy and Briana Scurry to sign more endorsement
deals, especially if they stay with the national team through next
year's Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the World Cup victory translates into the start of a
professional women's league (sometime after next year's Olympics)
or a network frenzy to snare the rights to the 2003 tournament are
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizing a league takes a lot of heavy lifting,'' said Doug
Logan, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, which was started
after the United States was host to the men's 1994 World Cup in
which the American team had little chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now women's soccer has the attention of the public, but the
public is fickle,'' Logan said, adding that finding talented
players would not be an insurmountable obstacle even if the popular
Americans were dispersed to each team in the league. ``It's a
bigger problem to be playing on a hot Wednesday with the threat of
thunderstorms, and an advance sale of 714 tickets.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news media's perception of the league is crucial to its
success, Logan said. ``Even if you fill up a small stadium, it's
hard to convince the media that something significant has taken
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13.3 overnight Nielsen rating for the U.S.-China World Cup
final on Saturday is no guarantee of network interest in the 2003
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested, but a lot depends on if the American women
win the Olympics next year,'' said Howard Katz, the president of
ABC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports Group, flatly said he
was not a convert and was not interested in the 2003 event. ``I
don't think Saturday's game will have any lasting impact on U.S. TV
ratings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, leading into Saturday's final, women made up only
34 percent of the World Cup audience on ESPN and 35 percent on
ESPN2, compared with 39 percent for ESPN's Women's National
Basketball Association games and 40 percent for the National
Collegiate Athletic Association women's basketball championship
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men may just be more tuned in to watching sports,'' McIvor
said. ``Watching sports events is a new experience for a lot of
women.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of women watching Saturday's final may have been
higher because of the influx of casual viewers enticed by the hype
leading up to the game.

SLUGGERS SWUNG, FANS CAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There had never been a night quite like this one. Who
ever heard of a batting practice block party?
</P>
<P>
   Only the privileged could get tickets to the Home Run Derby, won
by Ken Griffey Jr., but that didn't stop thousands of resourceful
New Englanders from taking it to the street _ Lansdowne Street,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the young and the ticketless. In the quest for home
run balls hit over the Green Monster during All-Star batting
practice and Home Run Derby, citizens of Red Sox Nation trekked to
the back wall of Fenway toting fielding gloves, catcher's mitts,
fishing nets, cardboard boxes, and all other forms of hardball
entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   As free summer shows go, this topped the Fourth of July Pops on
the Esplanade. It was Wallbanger Woodstock _ a festival of flyballs
raining down from the heavens _ played right here on Yaz-gur's
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Closed to vehicular traffic, Lansdowne was packed with baseball
fans, police, and media representatives. The show was sensational,
the price unbeatable, and dozens of souvenirs found their way into
the hands of deserving fans.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m., while high-rollers were clinking glasses at pre-derby
cocktail parties around town, the real ball fans were on Lansdowne,
booing Yankees Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams as the Fenway PA
blared hometown tune, ``Dirty Water.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite moment came early in the evening when cameras caught
Masco (garage) employee, Angelo Grech, and MBTA cop Bob Don
colliding under a shot, then rolling on the roof of the garage,
wrestling for the ball like a couple of Napoleons. It was Boston
baseball's most dramatic flyball clash since Mike Greenwell
demolished Ellis Burks in the Oakland outfield almost a decade ago.
Scrappy Grech came away with the ball but gave it to the policeman,
explaining, ``I felt bad knocking him on his butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Few folks were granted access to the coveted space atop the
Lansdowne Garage (managed by Masco Standard Parking). It was leased
to Pepsi for All-Star Week, and remained largely empty save for a
sprinkling of policemen, Pepsi folk, and garage officials. Despite
the inherent exclusivity, the garage featured a fairly democratic
group, including salesmen and truck drivers from the soft drink
company. As the night wore on, Pepsi people invited some lucky fans
to share the homer landing pad.
</P>
<P>
   Johnathan Kerr of Plymouth and M.J. LeBlanc of Attleboro, a
couple of slick-fielding 11-year-olds, scored a pair of the early
souvenirs off the bats of John Jaha and Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half into the batting-practice sessions, the net
over Fenway's Wall was peppered with baseballs. Intermittently,
loose balls fell to the sidewalk below, causing mad scrambles.
Mounted Boston police attempted to keep order, and eventually
erected a temporary fence to keep fans off the sidewalk on the Wall
side of the street. This was not a particularly popular move.
</P>
<P>
   The mood improved when fans heard the announcement that McGwire
was taking his batting-practice hacks. Mac missed in his first
round, but then Jeff Bagwell crashed a ball off the Cask 'N Flagon
brickwall, and Sammy Sosa almost cleared the garage. Sosa's blast
was the only pre-contest swat that made it all the way to the
Framingham commuter tracks _ on one hop, of course.
</P>
<P>
   After batting practice, a member of the Fenway ground crew
climbed the ladder inside the park and made his way up and down the
plank at the bottom of the screen. Thirty-seven feet over left
field, he picked the net clean while fans on the street below
begged for a merciful drop of Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   In the mad moments before the contest, young men hoisted their
girlfriends on their shoulders, bags of peanuts flew through the
air, and fans chanted, ``Yankees suck.'' A woman held a sign that
read, ``chicks dig the long ball.'' French Quarter comes to Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   The contest itself seemed as if it would be anticlimactic before
McGwire's first-round barrage of 13 homers. Sean McDonough's
play-by-play could be heard as the packed street waited for the
missiles of July. ESPN deadening commercial breaks were roundly
booed.
</P>
<P>
   Local hero Nomar was the first righty batter and the street
shook when Garciaparra's first homer nestled into the screen. Then
Nomie really drove 'em wild by hitting one over the net, over
Lansdowne, and onto the garage roof. Former Sox property Bagwell
hammered five homers in his first round, reminding folks of what
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's first official homer went way over Lansdowne Street
and measured 436 feet. His third one crashed into the light tower
(470 feet) and came back on the field, denying the masses outside.
The next one went over the Coke bottles. Then another. And another.
It was a little like watching Larry Bird in a 3-point contest.
Unfortunately for the folks on Lansdowne, Mighty Mac fizzled in
Round 2 and the finals featured two lefty sluggers, Griffey and
Burnitz.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunate 35,000 no doubt enjoyed the show from the cramped
confines of Fenway's boxes, grandstands, and bleachers, but on this
night, Lansdowne Street was the place to be. It certainly wasn't
like this when Rocky Colavito and Hank Aaron took batting parctice
during Fenway's last All-Star Game in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   American League batting practice starts this afternoon at 5:05.

KATE SPADE STRIDES INTO SHOES; ATLANTA TO CHELSEA; WHAT VISIONAIRE
BEGAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might say that Kate Spade's business is principally for the
limbs. She has bags and wallets for those who like to express
themselves by what they carry, and she has added stationery and
colorfully bound organizers, which can make the interior of a pink
sail-cloth tote look as orderly as a Sister Parish room.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Spade, who runs her five-year-old business with her
husband, Andy, is branching into shoes. The first collection,
mainly of leather thongs, crystal-covered sandals and slides in
Life Saver stripes, will arrive in stores in the fall in time for
resort clothes. The shoes are being made under a license to GFW
Group, which also produces private-label shoes for Bergdorf
Goodman. They'll sell for $160 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   What took her so long to come out with shoes to go with her
bags? Ms. Spade laughed. ``I would have loved to have done them
sooner, but we've been growing so much,'' she said. The company,
which started with half a dozen nylon bags, expects to have a
wholesale volume this year of $40 million. Last February, Neiman
Marcus, the Dallas-based retailer, bought a 56 percent stake in
Kate Spade for $33.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spade and her husband, who is developing an accessories line
for men, called Jack Spade, said they have no plans to design
clothes, though they make a few things like pajamas and scarves.
With accessories driving a lot of designer businesses, who can
fault them for their decision or timing? As Spade said, ``I think
we kind of sneaked in through the back door when everybody was
focused on the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   JEFFREY FROM ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Aug. 2, his birthday, Jeffrey Kalinsky, along with
a rabbi and a throng of friends and family, will cut the ribbon for
Jeffrey, a 12,000-square-foot store on West 14th Street in the
meat-packing district. In a way, Jeffrey is Kalinsky's version of a
Judith Krantz title: ``I'll Take Manhattan in a Pair of Gucci
Pants.'' Kalinsky, whose family has been in the shoe business for
50 years, was a retail buyer in New York before opening a boutique
in Atlanta in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's betting that the popularity of Chelsea (and the offer
of valet parking) will lure the downtown and uptown fashion crowds
to humble 14th Street. Last week, he showed a visitor the space,
which runs like a jetway from 14th Street to 15th Street and is
technically on the ground floor of 450 West 15th Street, which
includes KCD, the fashion public relations firm, and the designer
John Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very art gallery and movie set,'' Kalinsky said.
The space will have white walls, a concrete floor and minimalist
furniture by Troy covered in gray Ultrasuede. In the center will be
a shoe salon (with sizes from 4 to 12, AAAA to C widths), and at
the ends will be men's and women's clothes by designers like Jil
Sander, Gucci, Balenciaga, Helmut Lang and Courreges.
</P>
<P>
   Kalinsky says he is paying less for a square foot in Chelsea
than he does in Atlanta. He is buoyant about high-fashion
retailing, despite the demise of stores like Charivari. ``It's like
they said in that movie: `If you build it, they will come,''' he
said. ``I'm a believer.''
</P>
<P>
   VISIONAIRE MEETS THE BIBLE
</P>
<P>
   ``When people first heard about the idea, they wondered if we
were going to be ironic,'' said Cecilia Dean, an editor of
Visionaire, whose 28th number, due out in early August, will be
based on the Bible. ``But it really was about taking the greatest
story ever told and giving it a beautiful and modern
interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Printed on the glossy cardboard stock used by children's book
publishers and edged in gold, the magazine has the weight and
thickness of an oversize Bible. Inside, on double-page spreads,
artists and photographers like Raymond Meier, David Levinthal and
Mario Sorrenti interpret scenes from biblical books like Exodus and
Revelations. For instance, in an image inspired by Exodus, Andreas
Gursky, a London-based photographer, shows a crowd writhing toward
a celestial light. It was taken at a rave in England.
</P>
<P>
   Visionaire 28, which sells for $150, will be enclosed in a
translucent plastic shell designed by Philippe Starck. The idea,
Ms. Dean said, was to make it look as if it were suspended inside,
with the gold glowing through.

JETS COULD SUFFER IF BARROOM BRAWL RESULTS IN SUSPENSION FOR
ELLIOTT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mass., Washington, D.C., Colo.)   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Jumbo Elliott's arrest on misdemeanor charges
stemming from a barroom brawl results in a suspension by the
National Football League, the Jets' chances of continuing their
remarkable surge could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 34, the Jets' left tackle and a key member of the
offensive unit, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges Monday in
Long Beach, N.Y., City Court, as did offensive lineman Jason
Fabini, 24, the Jets' top rookie last season, and Matt O'Dwyer, 26,
a former Jet guard now with the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott and Fabini are scheduled to appear at a hearing on July
26, three days before they are to report for the start of Jets
training camp. O'Dwyer also faces a felony charge of second-degree
assault against two police officers who say he kicked out the
window of a patrol car when placed inside it, sending glass into
their faces. O'Dwyer will have a court appearance on that charge
July 26 in Nassau County Court.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets have to start the season without Elliott at left
tackle, three-fifths of their offensive line would be new, because
they do not have players at either right or left guard with any NFL
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the units on a team, the offensive line is generally
recognized as the one requiring the most work and the most
familiarity among its individual members. Behind Elliott at left
tackle there is only Kerry Jenkins, whom the Jets acquired as a
free agent several years ago and who did not have one play at
offensive tackle last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets expect to to go into training camp without any guard
who has NFL experience. The club recently lost O'Dwyer to free
agency and dropped left guard Todd Burger.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are coming off one of their best seasons since winning
the Super Bowl in 1969. They finished 12-4 and won the American
Football Conference East Division, getting all the way to the
conference championship game. The line was pivotal in protecting
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who produced his finest season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have some difficult games early in the season. They
face a division rival, the New England Patriots, in the opener on
Sept. 12, followed by a Sunday night game at Buffalo. A week after
that the Jets are host to the Washington Redskins, then go to
Denver to face the Broncos, the team that defeated them in the
conference championship game last January and went on to win the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, Fabini and O'Dwyer were arrested about midnight Friday
at Bogart's, a Long Beach restaurant and bar frequented by Jets
players. According to the police, Elliott urinated in a wash basin
in the women's restroom. A woman told the police that Elliott, 6
feet 7 inches and 300 pounds, punched her in the stomach when she
confronted him. According to the police, Elliott then hit a male
patron when he returned from the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elliott's second run-in with the legal system in 10
months. He is believed to have undergone league-mandated counseling
after being convicted of driving while impaired last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott is likely to be contacted soon by the league's vice
president for player and employee development, Lem Burnham, who
oversees counseling for players charged with violent crimes.
Historically, the league has dealt with alcohol-related incidents
with a fine. There have been no suspensions under the year-old
policy dealing with charges of violent crime, but there have been
fines and mandatory counseling. Once charged with a violent crime,
a player is subject to counseling and discipline by Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue, regardless of whether the player is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two elements working against Elliott: the possible
involvement with alcohol (although the police did not mention
alcohol) and a charge of assault. So if Elliott is convicted of any
of the charges, a suspension could follow in view of his previous
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' coach, Bill Parcells, is on vacation, as is his entire
staff, his secretary said Monday, and they were not available for
comment. &QL;

 &HT;    IBM Corp. interns invent telepathy over the Internet
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A group of IBM Corp. interns sits in a hotel
room on the third floor of the Renaissance Hotel, and, using
lunchtime fajitas and Dr Pepper as creative fuel, they're making
the first neural network translating binary code into synaptic
pulses.
</P>
<P>
   In English: They're inventing telepathy over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By 2025, according to their business plan, everybody will have
one _ a tiny device worn on the ear that lets you retrieve
information and communicate with others just by thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   They'll call it ``Mindware.''
</P>
<P>
   This is your brain. This is your brain on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (will) become as accepted as the cell phone today,'' says
Chris Simoes, an intern from the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But surely there's a downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're networked, people could get into your head,'' Simoes
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Any other liabilities? ``It could fry your brain,'' points out
Timothy Weiand, a Tivoli intern from Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 3,500 IBM interns and engineers got together at IBM
sites around the world for a day of brainstorming.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, home to one of the company's major research sites,
more than 300 summer workers created their own imaginary companies
with unlimited money. The companies were to launch next year and to
continue through 2025, with a global Depression thrown in for fun.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``fantasy startup camp'' for the interns, and a way for IBM
to open its gates to new ideas while putting out feelers for
potential hires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brainpower of these students is the future of technology
and the future of our company,'' said Alison Barnes, a human
resources staffer for IBM in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Students from about 60 high schools and colleges came up with
ideas for new companies that ranged from the highly probable _
custom music CDs sold on the Web to the highly dubious. One of
Weiand's group's early efforts, for instance, was ``Bubba's Custom
Cow Co.,'' which would genetically engineer meat or dairy cows for
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll create a cow and Fed-Ex it to you,'' he said during
one of the initial pitches. ``Just like you'd say I want a blue car
with leather interior, you can get a brown-spotted cow with leather
exterior.''
</P>
<P>
   They're versed as much on pop culture and science fiction as on
quantum physics and math. When Weiand's and Simoes' group came up
with a brain implant _ the precursor to the telepathic ear device _
one group member asked, ``Is this a 'Johnny Mnemonic' implant or an
implant like in 'The Matrix?''' referring to sci-fi movies with
similar conventions. Derrick Chubbs, an IBM product engineer who
worked as a kind of tech-camp counselor for the students, said much
of the early discussion for the Mindware group veered away from
science and toward how technology will be used by real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started by talking about what a dream job would be and they
all agreed that they want technology to help them spend more time
with their family and less time working,'' Chubbs said. ``And they
have a social conscience. They say, 'let's not forget everybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   Group Mindware began the day by coming up with ideas for new
companies. As the session went on, the group focused on a single
company idea, product, and marketing strategy. By lunchtime, the
group brainstormed on a name, slogan and future. Then the students
thought ahead to 2010, through the Depression of 2020 and finally
to the company's annual meeting in 2025.
</P>
<P>
   With about 15 other groups, Mindware then presented itself in
true Silicon Valley startup fashion: with a timed two-minute pitch
aimed at conveying what the company had done and what its post-2025
plans were. The premise _ the annual shareholder's meeting of the
future _ brought out a grab-bag of ideas clearly inspired by
today's initial public offering fever and the proliferation of
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: don't ask your stock broker about these future
IPOs.They don't exist yet.
</P>
<P>
   GlobalTalk introduced a universal language translator, while
E-Grub created an all-in-one food pill that cured global hunger in
2020. SmartHomes allowed users to customize their living rooms with
moveable walls and voice recognition. HouseCall.com eliminated HMOs
with virtual medical consultation and I'm-gonna-take-your-money.com
brought (what else?) online gambling to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   But while one virtual company boasted it made so much money it
caused a global economic collapse, another, the fictitious
Alternavista.com, admitted it had succumbed to hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went bankrupt,'' Alternavista's chief executive-for-a-day
announced, to thunderous applause from his virtual shareholders.

WHITMAN PICK TURNS DOWN TROOPER JOB 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman's attempt to overhaul the
New Jersey State Police suffered a setback Monday when the leading
candidate for the superintendent's position told her he is no
longer interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months New Jersey officials have reluctantly concluded
that the state police force has tolerated a culture of racial
discrimination, and they had hoped that Col. Andre Parker of the
Illinois State Police would be the man to transform the department.
Aides to the governor were particularly impressed with how he had
revamped the troubled police force in East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But when word of Parker's negotiations was leaked to reporters
last month, the governor encountered unexpectedly intense
opposition from legislators, who would have had to approve the
nomination. After a furious lobbying campaign led by state police
supporters, many senators began publicly insisting that the
governor promote someone from within the ranks of the department.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who will become acting
governor in January 2001 if Whitman wins her bid for the U.S.
Senate, also complicated the negotiations by refusing to guarantee
that he would allow Parker to serve at least a three-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Had he accepted the job, Parker, 43, would have become the first
black to command the 2,700-member force.
</P>
<P>
   Parker did not return calls for comment, but his letter cited
``personal and professional'' considerations, the governor said. A
leading supporter, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, said Parker
withdrew his name because it was clear that legislators were
unwilling to give him enough time or the necessary political
support to effectively reform the state police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a position he really wanted; he looked forward to the
challenge,'' said Jackson, executive director of the Black
Ministers Council of New Jersey. ``But this process has carried on
so long, it wasn't fair for him to leave the Illinois police
wondering what he was going to do, so he thought it was time to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she was disappointed that Parker is no longer a
candidate, but insisted that the state is also talking with several
other qualified candidates, from both inside and outside the force,
and expects to name a nominee soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although she did not criticize legislators, the governor did
indicate that the search was being hampered by her inability to
offer job security beyond next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got two, two and a half years left on my term,'' she
said. ``To ask somebody to make a career change based on that kind
of career longevity is problematic at best.''

CSUN FOOTBALL FATE IN QUESTIONABLE HANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge is expected to conclude a
month-long investigation into its football program today.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, we should know if Ron Ponciano stays on for a
second season as head coach or if investigators found probable
cause to either ask him to resign or attempt to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   The belief here is that Ponciano will be asked to step down, as
CSUN offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie was last week.
</P>
<P>
   Phenicie resigned last Wednesday, the first casualty of the
school's internal probe that was prompted by an anonymous letter
detailing possible NCAA-rules infractions. Phenicie had turned down
two jobs during the offseason to stay at Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   To justify ousting Ponciano, investigators must discover he has
broken NCAA rules. To experienced observers, these transgressions
seem minor, the type that at most schools bring a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   To get around that, CSUN says it operates a zero-tolerance
program. And after being embarrassed by an athletic director, a
basketball coach and an assistant athletic director in the last
eight months, that policy sounds reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   But don't believe it. It goes deeper than wanting to present a
pristine image to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Ponciano is likely caught in the crossfire of a
campus civil war. At stake is the football program, which some at
the university would like to see disappear. The anonymous letter is
a convenient silver bullet, one they can use to kill the program.
</P>
<P>
   First they ask Ponciano to resign, then they say the program is
out of control, costs too much money and is more trouble than its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Then they say they have no choice but to discontinue it,
probably after next year.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a clean, efficient murder.
</P>
<P>
   The motive? There are two.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the school envisions a major fight over the
proposed new football stadium. Chances are that for most of the
next decade, CSUN will be stymied by lawsuits filed by residents
near campus who oppose the project. You don't need a football
stadium if you don't have a football team.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, CSUN hasn't met the requirements of an agreement
with Cal-NOW regarding gender equity. By eliminating football, the
school eliminates the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Ponciano might just be in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   How can this happen, and who is in charge? Good questions. There
is a power vacuum at Northridge, and perhaps that has created the
necessary space for the anti-football group within the
administration to assume control for the moment. Interim president
Luanne Kennedy is expected to make final judgment, but she'll lean
heavily on the investigation team headed by Peter Dinauer.
</P>
<P>
   Dinauer didn't return calls last week, and he's guarded when he
does talk. That's his job; he's an investigator. The question is,
to whom does he answer?
</P>
<P>
   Dick Dull, the new athletic director, is being briefed but is
being kept out of the loop to avoid sullying his image.
</P>
<P>
   If the agenda is to rid CSUN of football, those behind it forgot
one thing. Ponciano won't go softly into the night. The Fourth of
July was last week, but the real fireworks will go off when CSUN
tries to force Ponciano out.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano has maintained his innocence throughout this whole
messy affair, and that conviction was only strengthened after
investigators presented him with the 20 or so allegations contained
in the anonymous letter. Ponciano said he shot down all but two of
the claims, and he submitted a written explanation on Monday that
he believes will clear those.
</P>
<P>
   He left the five-hour meeting feeling good about his job. But
Ponciano also knows that when somebody wants to get you, they can.
So he's prepared to fight, if that's what it comes to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could be Ponciano and Phenicie are actually
guilty. If so, then the university is justified by its course of
action.
</P>
<P>
   We'll reserve final judgement until CSUN discloses its findings.
Some who have seen the allegations say it reads like a sitcom
script. All that's missing is the laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano and Phenicie aren't the only victims. An entire
football team anxiously awaits word on its coaches' fate and its
own future.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley sits by and watches, wondering if CSUN
will finally do the right thing for the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's history makes us believe otherwise.

TIMES CO. REPLACES PUBLISHER AT BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Times Co. announced Monday that one of its
key executives had moved to Boston to succeed the publisher of The
Boston Globe, a member of the family that had run that paper for
126 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new publisher, Richard Gilman, headed The Times' circulation
department in New York with the title of senior vice president for
operations. He succeeds Benjamin Taylor, whose family sold The
Globe five and a half years ago to New York Times Co., parent of
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier assignments, Gilman, 48, was responsible for
circulation, production and the development of operations like the
new color printing plant in the New York City borough of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 52, will remain chairman of The Globe Newspaper Co.
board. The directors of The Globe Co. advise the management of The
Globe newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At meetings with top managers and the newsroom staff on Monday,
Gilman and Taylor did not specifically address questions about why
the change was made, people at the meetings said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office on Monday, Taylor said that the
hardest question he was asked was, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an easy question to answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in top management at The Globe was effective
immediately. It came several months after Sunday circulation and
the high-margin help-wanted advertising revenue experienced
declines.
</P>
<P>
   It also came a year after newsroom turmoil surrounding the
departure of two columnists: one who acknowledged fabricating
material and another who was accused of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of The
Times Co., said Taylor's ``commitment to the newspaper, service to
the community and dedication to quality journalism are
unquestioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same statement, Sulzberger said, ``I know Rich Gilman
will bring vision and leadership in the strongest traditions of The
Globe and will be an outstanding publisher during a time of rapid
change in the news industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman joined The Times in 1983 and has held his current post
since 1993. He earned an MBA from Harvard Business School and spent
the first 10 years of his career as a reporter and editor at The
Arizona Daily Star in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with Taylor in the publisher's office here, Gilman said
that all decisions about The Globe's future would be generated
locally. ``Where we go from here _ all that needs to be developed
in Boston,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the newsroom, the prevailing reactions were surprise and
sorrow. ``I wasn't totally surprised that they would make a
significant move, but I didn't expect Ben to be gone,'' said the
newspaper's editor, Matthew Storin.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen McNamara, a local columnist who has worked for The Globe
for about two decades, said: ``It's an especially sad day to me
when the man sitting in the front office is no longer connected to
the city in the way the Taylor family always has been.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of local family control over community newspapers is a
trend that has marked the industry for a generation or more, as
large newspaper chains have bought out newspaper-owning families.
When The Times Co. purchased The Globe in 1993, it agreed to make
no management changes for five years _ a period that ended last
year. Benjamin Taylor's cousin, William Taylor, was publisher at
the time of the sale, and Arthur Sulzberger Jr.'s father, Arthur
Ochs Sulzberger, was chairman and chief executive of The Times Co.
This year, William Taylor announced he was retiring from The Times
Co. board.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of local control is felt particularly hard in this
center of New England, a city whose prickly sense of self and
pugnacious attitude toward New York City are reflected in rivalries
in spheres from sports to scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lydon, a former writer at both The Times and The
Globe, who is now host of a radio call-in program on WBUR-FM in
Boston, said: ``Boston is a franchise town now, as most American
cities are. We don't own our own village conversation anymore. All
the commercial media in Boston are owned or controlled by distant
emperors.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's reaction to the management change was muted, if
not negative. Times Co. stock closed at $38.75, down 93.75 cents,
or 2.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gruneich, a senior managing director at Bear, Stearns who
follows the newspaper industry, described Monday's developments as
``just an evolution in the relationship that the parent company has
with The Boston Globe.'' He added, ``I think that the integration
of The Boston Globe into The New York Times Company will be
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, advertising revenues at The Globe rose to $449 million,
an increase of just 1.8 percent over the previous year, while
valuable help-wanted advertising declined _ as it did in markets
like Los Angeles; San Jose, Calif., and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, advertising revenues at The Times in New York
increased by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of 1999, advertising revenues at The Globe
were down 2.5 percent from the previous year, while The Times' were
up by 5.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest concerns at The Globe in recent months has
been the loss of Sunday circulation, which stands at 730,000. It
declined 18,306, or 2.4 percent, between March 31, 1998, and March
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said he planned no cutbacks in the news budget. ``The
Globe is a great newspaper,'' he said. ``One of the best in
America. The challenge for us is to find a way to preserve that.''

RETIREMENT? GRAF LOOKS TO MAHWAH EVENT FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steffi Graf would not say it definitely, but the most successful
women's tennis player of the 1990s strongly indicated Monday that
she would retire from the tour by year's end. But Graf said she
would continue to play a few exhibition tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   One of those exhibition tournaments is the A&AMP;P Tennis Classic in
Mahwah, N.J. She won the event for the first time when she was 14
and for the sixth time last year. This week, at age 30, she will
play there again when she faces Jennifer Capriati on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Graf arrived Monday from her native Germany. Hours later, she
took the court for the first time since losing the Wimbledon final
10 days ago to Lindsay Davenport. Before the practice, however,
Graf more or less defined her tennis future.
</P>
<P>
   She is scheduled to play several tournaments this year,
including the U.S. Open. Graf previously said that she would no
longer play Wimbledon and the French Open, two of the four Grand
Slam tournaments, and she reiterated that Monday saying it was
unlikely she would change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   But while acknowledging that she would probably retire from the
tour, she also said: ``I'm not going to stop playing tennis for
myself. Tennis will always be a big part of my life. I enjoy it. I
still love it very, very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf has played enough tennis to deserve a long rest. Since she
turned professional at age 13, she has won 107 singles titles on
tour, including 22 Grand Slam events, the second-highest total
ever, and has earned almost $22 million in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she won the French Open, a notable achievement
because for three years she had been fighting off injuries to her
hamstring, ankle, shoulder, wrist and knee. She is ranked third in
the world behind Davenport and Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Graf said. ``I have no injuries, but I haven't
been playing. Mentally, I'm not so tired yet. But it's very
demanding traveling to tournaments. And with every day the
questions: `When are you going to retire? When are you going to
retire?' I haven't been able to go out and play matches and enjoy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the physical part is still willing, the mental part may not
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always given as much as I have to tennis,'' Graf said.
``If you like it enough, that's the key thing. If it gets to a
point where you realize your mind isn't always 100 percent on the
court, that's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to leave the sport when you're on top. That's
never really easy because when you're doing well it's difficult to
stop. The last three years all the injuries I've been having came
very close to making this decision. I feel fortunate I've been able
to do this on my own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   For Graf, retirement will not mean idleness. She owns a sports
management company that represents two junior girls from Germany.
The company has done organizational work for the Federation Cup
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Her tournament schedule this summer and fall includes events in
San Diego and Toronto, the U.S. Open and stops in Europe. She said
she had not decided whether to play in the season-ending tour
championship Nov. 15-21 in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, she said, will be different. But she added, ``I'm not
going to be disappearing at all.''

SECOND AGENCY DOWNGRADES NASSAU COUNTY BONDS RATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ A second major bond-rating agency on Monday
downgraded Nassau County's credit to near-junk status, prompting
the county's budget director to accuse Democrats in Albany of
blocking a bailout of Nassau ``for partisan political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a booming economy and one of the nation's wealthiest
populations, Nassau is confronted with a budget deficit of more
than $200 million after years of growth in spending that was not
matched by tax increases. Its bonds were steeply downgraded by
Standard &AMP; Poor's on June 29. Moody's Investors Service on Monday
lowered Nassau's rating to an equivalent level, Baa2, just two
notches above junk, and threatened another downgrade if the county
does not obtain new sources of revenue soon.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the downgrade, Moody's faulted Nassau for delays
in obtaining state legislative approval for a new 1 percent tax on
property sales. ``It just doesn't seem like a great deal of
progress is being made, or a significant amount of positive
discussions are taking place between the county and the state,''
said Helen Cregger, of Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats led by Thomas P. DiNapoli, of Great Neck, in
Nassau County, last week demanded that the county give the state
comptroller extensive oversight powers in exchange for such a
bailout. The comptroller, H. Carl McCall, is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released on Monday evening, Michael Fabiano, the
Nassau County budget director, blamed DiNapoli and his colleagues
for the latest downgrade. ``The county has formulated a fiscal plan
which addresses the issues raised by Moody's,'' Fabiano said.
``Unfortunately, key elements of the plan, which require state
legislative approval, have been blocked by Assembly Democrats for
partisan political reasons. The action announced Monday by Moody's
is not unexpected in view of the State Assembly's failure to act on
the county's fiscal plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Fabiano's statement, DiNapoli said, ``Now's not the time
for a blame game.'' But he quickly added that it was County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, who was guilty of
inaction, for ignoring the Democrats' call for oversight by the
Comptroller and other reforms. ``We haven't heard back, except that
they feel we're asking for too much,'' he said. ``We give them a
20-page document, and they give a one-sentence response. They're
just not dealing in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lowering the rating on Nassau's $2.7 billion in
long-term bonds, Moody's lowered Nassau's short-term credit rating
from the highest to the second of three rating levels. Ms. Cregger
said the lower rating would reduce the number of investors bidding
for Nassau's short-term notes and increase the county's costs. The
county expects to borrow a record $430 million in this way to pay
its bills this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's also said the county's plan to borrow against
anticipated future income from its share of a nationwide tobacco
settlement by the end of the year seemed ``increasingly remote.''

DISNEY TO EXPAND ONLINE OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Walt Disney Co. got serious about the
Internet, pulling the trigger on two major deals it has been
pondering for the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant announced Monday a major expansion of
its Internet business by agreeing to buy the 57 percent of Web
partner Infoseek Corp. that it does not already own for an
undisclosed price estimated to be about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Disney will then spin off its Internet assets, valued at $7
billion without Infoseek, and its catalog operations into a
publicly traded tracking stock called Go.com. That could enable
Disney, which did not disclose how much the public will own, to
receive a boost from the booming market for Web stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a great move from a strategic standpoint to buy
Infoseek and separate the assets,'' said Linda Bannister, an
analyst with Edward Jones. ``It will make it easier to attract
quality people and give them a currency for making acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   By making the announcement, Disney also underscored its strong
commitment to the concept of Go.com as a general-purpose portal to
the Internet. That indicates Disney will engage in what has turned
out to be an uphill battle with America Online, Yahoo! and
Microsoft in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Disney launched its Internet operations in 1995 and stepped up
as a major player a year ago by buying 43 percent of Infoseek, the
Web's fourth largest search directory. In a news conference Monday
in New York, Disney and Infoseek chief executives fleshed out
details of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   --Disney will own 72 percent of Go.com, which will combine the
550 employees at Buena Vista Internet Group, 850 Infoseek employees
and 800 Disney catalog employees.
</P>
<P>
   --The deals should be completed by the end of this year.
Infoseek shareholders must approve the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   --The combined businesses should generate $350 million during
the current fiscal year, through Sept. 30, and could double that in
the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   --Go.com will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol GO, replacing shares of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   --Infoseek's chief executive officer, Harry Motro, will depart
once the deal is concluded. Jake Winebaum left as Disney's Internet
chief last month, and there was no indication of who will head
Go.com.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came when Wall Street has been punishing
Disney's share price over disappointing earnings and a sagging
outlook in several key businesses. The announcement had little
impact as shares edged up 18.75 cents to $27.8125 after touching
their 1999 low on Friday, while Infoseek shares were off $5.5625 at
$45.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have predicted, however, that the Internet assets will
increase in value, particularly given the worth of such popular
sites as Disney.com, ESPN.com, ABCNews.com, Family.com and Disney
Stores Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining Disney's Internet assets with Infoseek takes our
online strategy to the next level,'' said Disney Chairman Michael
Eisner. ``Go.com will unlock the value and potential of our
combined Internet assets and position them to ignite the
marketplace with new products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   But Disney trackers have complained that while the
Disney-Infoseek partnership may make sense, the alliance has
operated clumsily compared to Internet rivals and not delivered a
compelling product since Disney and Infoseek launched the Go.com
portal _ a hub for entering the Internet _ in January. Some
question the basic strategy of trying to compete as a portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is going to wind up spending a ton of money to fight a
battle that's already been lost to AOL, Yahoo! and MSN,'' said
Joseph Butt Jr., an analyst with Forrester Research. ``This is not
a way to win friends and influence people.''
</P>
<P>
   David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said Disney
should not be dismissed. ``The whole Go.com strategy has been only
modestly successful, but what they've announced is a very logical
next step,'' he noted. ``You can't write them off in terms of power
of media properties and cross-promotion. They're still a contender
with strong cards to play.''

GROUP PICKED TO RUN NEW YORK CHARTER SCHOOL WAS OUSTED IN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill)  (dw) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New York officials selected the first eight charter schools
for the state last month, they did so knowing that the school to
open in Flushing, Queens, would be run by a Middle Eastern company
that recently lost its contract to operate two charter schools in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Some education officials in New York knew of the company's
dismissal, but neither investigated it nor informed the public
about it before giving preliminary approval to the Flushing school,
according to interviews with officials in New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Educators in Chicago say that the company, Sabis, was criticized
by a number of teachers and parents concerned about the company's
teaching methods and management style.
</P>
<P>
   Several said that English and math tests _ faxed weekly from Abu
Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates _ often came in at the last
minute, had questions unrelated to classroom instruction and used
British rather than American spellings (``realising'' instead of
``realizing,'' for instance).
</P>
<P>
   Other teachers and parents said the intensive tutoring that was
supposed to be the core of Sabis' program took more than a year to
set up at one school and never had enough staff at either school.
Parents complained that they were discouraged from meeting
privately with teachers.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the State University of New York, which oversees
part of the charter school system, said that some trustees were
aware of Sabis' dismissal, but also said that Sabis had a good
record in Massachusetts. He said the trustees accepted the
company's explanation that the problems in Chicago were unrelated
to education issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sabis maintains that it lost its Chicago contract because of
administrative and personality clashes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and elsewhere, charter schools are financed by
taxpayer money, but largely escape the restrictions imposed on
public schools, and scrutiny from school administrators and
teachers unions.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times examined the two other private companies that
have received preliminary approval to run three of New York's eight
initial charter schools and found no major problems or contract
disputes in their backgrounds. The other four schools are to be run
by nonprofit foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Scott W. Steffey, a SUNY vice chancellor who supervises the
charter school process, said it was not the state's responsibility
to evaluate Sabis' record. He said the community group that
selected Sabis was supposed to check its references.
</P>
<P>
   The Flushing group, a coalition of parents, educators and
volunteers, said it did not do so because it was busy putting
together its application to the state, inspecting sites and
gathering support for the charter school.
</P>
<P>
   Piero A. Tozzi, a lawyer who led the Flushing effort, said the
group continued to support the selection of Sabis to run the
Flushing school.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and legal papers, company officials have
characterized their dismissal last December as a dispute over
contractual issues like building repairs, fund-raising and
management of future schools.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's directors have refused to comment publicly or
to release a detailed termination letter because the matter is in
court.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago education official who has seen the termination letter
said the foundation's directors felt that Sabis had failed to
deliver the education program it had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Sabis also operates 3 charter schools in Massachusetts that have
had no major problems, one private school in Minnesota and 14
others in the Middle East, England and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Sabis' director is Ralph Bistany, a citizen of Lebanon and
France who received master's degrees in math and physics from the
American University of Beirut. In a telephone interview from
Juniye, Lebanon, Bistany suggested that the company's problems in
Chicago stemmed from clashes with the foundation over
administrative and contractual matters.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, Sabis _ which began with a private school
just outside Beirut _ has also won approval to open charter schools
in Michigan, North Carolina and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've learned a lesson,'' Bistany said of his
experience in Chicago, conceding that the company had hired poor
administrators. ``But whenever we are under pressure, we
concentrate on the education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flushing International Charter School plans to enroll 249
students the first year, and eventually expand to 1,400 students.
Sabis would pay $1.3 million in start-up and operating costs for
five years, according to its application with a community group in
Flushing. The school would also receive an estimated $29.1 million
in public money during that time. Sabis _ the name is a hybrid of
Bistany's and that of his partner, Leila Saad _ is a family-run
company that includes the network of charter schools and private
schools, real estate holdings and a computer business in Beirut.
Bistany declined to give more specific information about the
company's activities.
</P>
<P>
   The company branch that manages charter schools, Sabis
Educational Systems, is a business name for the International
School of Minnesota, the private school founded by Sabis in 1985.
The school is owned by an offshore company, which in turn is owned
by the Sabis Foundation in Liechtenstein, Bistany said.

ADVERTISING: UNSOLD SPACE ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Advertising Council, the nonprofit organization that
produces and distributes public-service announcements, has risen in
the last four months from 23rd to 9th place in rankings of the most
visible advertisers on the Internet, according to Nielsen/Net
Ratings, an Internet measurement service.
</P>
<P>
   That is not because the council has increased its advertising
budget. It has no such budget. As it does in other media, on the
Internet the council relies on the benevolence of Web sites to run
its advertisements in unsold space.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, banner advertisements that the council created on
behalf of nonprofit groups on recycling, drunken driving, crime
prevention and nearly 20 other public-service causes appeared 133
million times on the Web last month. Such messages reached 16.2
percent of all people who surf from home, according to Nielsen/Net
Ratings.
</P>
<P>
   This puts the organization in the ranks of such other highly
visible online advertisers as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The council's increased visibility represents a gesture of good
will on the part of Web publishers. But what does it say about the
medium that so much advertising space is being given away?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another indication that there's a ton of unsold inventory
on the Web, as if we needed any more,'' said Jim Nail, an analyst
who covers Internet advertising for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 40 percent to 70 percent of the ad space on even the
most highly trafficked Web sites goes unsold, said Rich LeFurgy,
chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry trade
organization. For what LeFurgy calls second- or third-tier sites,
the proportion of unsold space is even higher.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the unsold space is that the Web offers
practically infinite publishing opportunities. Thus it has
exponentially more advertising capacity than do television, radio
and print media, which have limited space and air time.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to have space allotted for advertising appear empty _
the digital equivalent of dead air time in broadcast media _ Web
sites often plug in ads promoting their own services to take up the
space. But a site can use just so many of those ads without looking
tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why not plug in some public service, be a good guy?'' Nail
suggested as the reason for the widespread use of the public
service banners. ``When people see that, they say, `Hey, this site
is good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides perceiving that the Web site at hand has a social
conscience, the public is also exposed to messages intended to
improve society and public safety and to promote the nonprofit
groups that advocate these causes.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of mobilizing communities is what propelled the
advertising industry to create the War Advertising Council 57 years
ago. Then, the group's focus was to rally the nation in support of
World War II. One of its first initiatives was a campaign featuring
Rosie the Riveter, the character that motivated women to enter the
work force during the war. Now, the organization is known as both
the Advertising Council and the Ad Council.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the council added an online component to its public
service campaigns. The banners are created by advertising agencies
that volunteer staff time, and are available on the council's Web
site (http://www.adcouncil.org) to anyone who wishes to display
them.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Conlon, president of the Ad Council, likens the increasing
use of council banners online to the early days of television, when
public-service commercials helped fill air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more stations that went on the air, and the more hours
they programmed, the more space there was to fill,'' she said.
``We're being brought along on the Internet by the phenomenal
growth of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the council has grown significantly: In 1998,
the group received $1.2 billion in donated space from all media.
Donated space on the Internet soared from $5 million in 1997, based
on cost estimates given the council by the contributing sites, to
$28 million in 1998. That makes the medium an even bigger supporter
of public-service campaigns than newspapers, which contributed
$21.2 million in space in 1998. Even so, the sacrifice is a bit
different: Web publishers have a lot of unsold space to give away,
while traditional media companies often donate space they could
have used for paid advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Crime Prevention Council was the
top-ranked media campaign for the Ad Council, receiving $128.1
million in donated media space. Jacqueline Aker, media director for
the National Crime Prevention Council, said the Internet played an
important role in helping her organization achieve its mission of
educating the public about crime prevention, with 5,000 people a
day visiting its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-crime campaign aimed at teen-agers has received what Ms.
Aker described as exceptional placement online because many
teen-age-themed Web sites are wary of accepting excessive paid
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sites like the Cartoon Network use our banners all the
time,'' she said. ``The creative makes a big difference, too. Our
banners are really cool.'' They were fashioned by Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, along with its interactive agency Darwin Digital, both of
which are New York units of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   For all the good that such public-service advertisements do,
some people still suggest that the incredible reach the Ad Council
has achieved is a sign of a sluggish climate for advertisers on the
Web. Wenda Millard, a council board member who is executive vice
president of the online advertising network Doubleclick Inc.,
called that view cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all inventory on the Internet is going to be valued by
advertisers,'' she said. ``Some of the top sites may be top sites
based on traffic, but it might not all be desirable space. I think
it's very natural that you'll have tons of open space. The barriers
to entry for the Web are so phenomenally low that literally your
grandmother can create a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Grandma wants to put a public-service ad for the
council-created character Smokey Bear on it, all the better.

JUDGE AFFIRMS RAISE FOR DAILY NEWS DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge Monday upheld a labor arbitrator's
decision to award retroactive wages to members of the drivers'
union at The New York Daily News, a move that could eventually cost
the newspaper tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator's ruling, issued on March 8, determined that
members of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union should receive a
16.9 percent wage increase retroactive to Jan. 1, 1997, to bring
their pay in line with the wages of drivers at The New York Times.
Because the six other craft unions at The Daily News may be
entitled to any raises won by the drivers' union, the paper
suddenly faces unexpected costs of $18.5 million in 1999 alone,
executives said, a figure that could escalate to millions more in
future years. The Daily News' management appealed, but U.S.
District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan upheld it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents the 418 drivers who transport more than
700,000 copies of the paper to the five boroughs of the city and
into the suburbs every day.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the co-publisher and owner of The Daily
News, did not return phone calls Monday. But Martin D. Krall, the
executive vice president and chief legal officer of The News, said
the newspaper would appeal Griesa's reaffirmation of the
arbitrator's award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the award issued today confirmed the previous
award,'' he said. ``It gives us a fair amount of time to pay the
retroactive portion. But we are now going to move to the next
phase, and we are going to pursue the case vigorously in federal
court.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the drivers' union and Daily News management
arose when drivers contested a 1993 agreement with Zuckerman, who
had just purchased the bankrupt paper. He asked at that time that
The News not be asked to match craft wages at The New York Times.
During wage negotiations in 1997, The News again asked the unions
not to ask for parity with The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman now faces a difficult road. An appeal would be heard
by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It
is unusual for an arbitration case to be overturned by that court,
a lawyer involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Top News officials met with drivers' union leaders last week and
made an offer to settle the dispute, but the union rejected the
offer, a person close to the discussions said Monday.

 &HT;    Griffey HR king; Mac puts on show
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Someway this city must raze venerable Fenway Park, and
a new method of demolition was recommended Monday night. Let Ken
Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire homer the thing into a heap.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey homered three times in three swings in the final round,
enough to defeat surprise finalist Jeromy Burnitz and win his third
Home Run Derby. That came in conclusion to a wicked long-ball
display in the earlier rounds that made Fenway look like a playpen.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, launching a record 13 homers in the first round, swung
himself into exhaustion and failed to make the finals. He and
Houston's Jeff Bagwell (1) were eliminated in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sit-and-wait tired. It happens,'' said McGwire, whose
lone contest win came in 1992. ``I probably tried too hard. I was
more relaxed in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's first-round total surpassed the previous record of 12
hit by Cal Ripken Jr. in 1991. McGwire cleared the light tower with
a 470-foot shot and knocked out six more in eight pitches before
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez, having had enough, ran to the plate
and made off with his bat.
</P>
<P>
   After retrieving the wood, McGwire connected with four straight
swings that had the entire park standing. His last blast was his
longest, a 482-foot shot to left-center. Those 13 alone outmatched
the entire five-man AL team's 10.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Sammy Sosa, the major-league leader with 32 home runs,
bowed out in the first round with just one homer. Oakland's John
Jaha was easily the night's least inspired performer, whiffing
twice on consecutive swings in the first round before being
eliminated with just one homer.
</P>
<P>
   The NL out-homered the AL 27-10 in the first round, Griffey the
only AL player to advance to the second round.

MCGWIRE SETS DERBY RECORD, BUT GRIFFEY JR. IS THE CHAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Mark McGwire, forever to be remembered for the record
70 home runs he hit in the refular season in 1998, took the art of
the long ball to another level Monday night by pounding out a
record 13 home runs _ in one of his two plate appearances _ in the
All-Star home run-hitting contest at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac thrilled the packed house in the Back Bay with his 13
bombs, breaking the record of 12 set by Cal Ripken Jr. in '91. The
13 shots, strung together, traveled 5,692 feet _ more than a mile _
each shot averaging 438 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire banged out only three homers in the second round and
failed to advance to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. and the Milwaukee Brewers' Jeromy
Burnitz met head-to-head in the final and Griffey, last year's
winner, successfully defended his title. Burnitz hit two homers in
his appearance, and then Griffey sent three deep into the night,
ending his stellar performance by flipping his black bat into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The final brought two lefthanded hitters together, ironic for a
park known to favor righthanded hitters.
</P>
<P>
   With the baker's dozen, McGwire advanced to Round 2 of the
long-ball contest, along with Jeff Bagwell, Burnitz, and Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to McGwire returning for his second tour de force, Griffey
put on a stunning performance of his own. After a slow start, he
finished with 10 homers, sending repeated shots over the bullpens
and into the right-field bleachers. The most impressive of the
shots was No. 5, which Griffey sent soaring to the back of Conig's
Corner in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway was abuzz when Big Mac stepped up again, but he couldn't
get back the form he showed in Round 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably tried a little too hard,'' said McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The rock band Smashmouth, set up on a stage erected in the Red
Sox bullpen, played a couple of songs in an attempt to get the
crowd jumping before the long-ball contest. Rock music and Fenway
Park are strange bedfellows. For decades, the only tunes heard in
the Fens came from John Kiley's keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado outfielder Larry Walker led off for the National League
and he pounded a pair out of the park. He launched a 385-footer
into the right-field grandstand with his second pitch and later
drilled a 405-footer over the visiting bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN went immediately to its first of many protracted breaks
after Walker's appearance, allowing on-field announcer Sean
McDonough some extra time to get the crowd charged up over the next
hitter, Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling you might like the guy who's coming up
next,'' said McDonough, as Garciaparra slowly strode to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the Boston lineup for nearly two weeks with an injured
groin, Garciaparra looked comfortable and fluid at the plate. With
his first cut, he sent a liner rocketing into the screen. Two
swings later, he sent a 414-footer over the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look out, Mass. Pike!'' shouted McDonough, as Garciaparra's
second bomb headed into the Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra finished with two homers in the opening round, going
0 for 8 after sending his shot to Lansdowne Street.
</P>
<P>
   The first surprise of the night was the outstanding performance
by Burnitz. The 30-year-old lefthanded hitter sent no fewer than
six balls over the fence, the majority into the right-field
grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous,'' Burnitz said after his impressive
outing. The jitters didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-born Jeff Bagwell, the power-hitter the Sox let get away,
also put on an impressive show, after the A's John Jaha managed to
poke only one out of the park. Bagwell jumped out early with five
homers, the last two soared over the screen. ``Look out, Medford,''
McDonough said after the first of two. But Bagwell got stuck at
five. Sox fans in the sellout crowd had to be wondering the
obvious: How many would Bagwell have hit in a Sox uniform if Lou
Gorman hadn't dealt him for Larry Andersen?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, hitting seventh on the night, stole the show with his
seemingly endless stream of long bombs over the Wall. They were
prodigious shots, the third hitting off the top of the light tower
in straight-away left. The fourth zoomed over the Coke bottles
strapped halfway up the same tower. On and on he went. San Diego
coach Tim Flannery, the pitcher, tossed in the creampuffs and
McGwire effortlessly ripped them out.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire's ninth drive cleared the screen _ it was taking
on the proportions of ``The Natural'' at this point _ Sox pitcher
Pedro Martinez shuffled to the batter's box and politely wrested
the bat away from Big Mac. It was Martinez's way of saying,
``Enough!''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough. McGwire got the bat back in his hands and
promptly pounded out Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. It was big man's tee
ball. No. 13 was the longest of all, a high drive that went just to
the left of the light tower in left-center. It traveled 488 feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit only four homers in last year's competition and said
he felt he had to make up for that performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim got me in a groove,'' said McGwire, referring to
Flannery's batting practice tosses. ``I broke my bat about halfway
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, leading the NL with 32 homers, managed to bang out
only one homer. Griffey, who won last year's event, muscled only
three out of the park, two into the bleachers, but it was enough
for him to make it into the second round.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, Monday
warned that the protracted state budget stalemate could soon play
havoc with annual property tax bills and would likely result in
unnecessary tax increases in suburbs and small towns.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a Democrat, said at a news conference that the decision
of the Republican-controlled Senate not to return to Albany until
Tuesday to pass the latest in a series of emergency spending bills
would mean that many state workers will be paid a day later than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials contended that the Senate had chosen not to
return Monday to avoid a scheduling conflict with a key senator's
fund-raising event. Republican officials denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling came as the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, nursing a broken collarbone suffered in a softball game
Sunday, resumed budget negotiations with Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, agreed with McCall's
warning on local school districts, but the governor's office
disputed it.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, the budget will be 104 days late, tying the
second-latest ever, in 1996. In 1997, the state budget was 126 days
overdue, a modern record for futility in any state.
</P>
<P>
   Except for New York and a handful of other cities, the state's
nearly 700 school districts assess property taxes that account, on
average, for about 60 percent of their budgets, with the rest
coming from the state. (In the cities, the school systems have no
taxing power, but rely on money from city governments.) By law,
school districts must send out annual tax bills in August.
</P>
<P>
   Districts must obtain voter approval in spring elections for
their budgets, but they do not need voter approval to set tax
rates. As they draft their budgets, districts estimate property tax
rates. If the state provides more money than expected, the tax
bills are lower than those estimates; if the state provides less,
the tax bills are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those school districts around the state don't have very
definitive information in the next couple of weeks about what they
will receive in state aid for education,'' they will be forced to
guess and to base their tax bills on those guesses, McCall, the
state's chief financial officer, said. The Assembly convened Monday
to pass another batch of two-week emergency spending bills to keep
the government running. This year, as in years past when the budget
ran late, the bills are usually passed on Monday to enable state
workers to receive their twice-monthly paychecks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate decided, instead, to return on Tuesday this week,
and McCall said that it would be impossible for his office to issue
checks to all state employees by the following day.
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said:
``They shouldn't be paid late. He should have plenty of time to
process the checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic legislators and some Republican Senate aides,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Senate was
returning a day late because of a fund-raising event for Sen. Dean
Skelos, R- Nassau, who is the deputy majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Bogardus, a spokesman for Skelos, and McArdle denied that
the event had anything to do with the Senate's Tuesday return.

PATAKI REMAINS NONCOMMITTAL ON A CANDIDATE FOR THE SENATE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a time when national Republicans are increasingly
nervous about the party's failure to unite behind an opponent to
run against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the U.S. Senate race from New
York next year, Gov. George E. Pataki is still refusing to go along
with his party's leaders and support Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over
other potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has said time and again that he doesn't believe
that anyone should be anointed,'' said Zenia Mucha, the governor's
director of communications and his most powerful aide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha made her comments a day after Pataki criticized Mrs.
Clinton's candidacy as ``cockamamie'' in an interview on CNN,
saying that the first lady was running only to get ``national
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same interview, the governor praised Giuliani, with whom
he often fights, as ``an outstanding mayor who would be an
outstanding senator.'' But the governor also said in the interview
that two other possible Republican candidates, Reps. Rick Lazio and
Peter King, both of Long Island, are ``tremendous leaders in
Congress'' and would be ``great candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday in Philadelphia, Republicans at the party's summer
convention had what several officials described as passionate
discussions in closed meetings about whether they should try to
force Lazio out of the race. In the end, they decided to leave the
New York race and possible primary to New Yorkers _ a decision that
clearly pleased Ms. Mucha.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has made it perfectly clear that this is an
election that is 18 months away and that we have a number of
extraordinarily qualified candidates who need to go out there and
make a case to the people as to why they can beat Hillary
Clinton,'' Ms. Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``no one in Washington has ever called the
governor and told him how he should or should not deal with the
current situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actions of the governor, who has his own ambitions for
national office, possibly as a vice-presidential candidate, have
puzzled and angered national Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio has been actively courting Pataki, who has
never forgiven Giuliani for supporting the incumbent Democrat,
Mario Cuomo, over Pataki in the race for governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Monday that he planned to announce his candidacy for
Senate before Labor Day, and that the only reaction he had to the
Republican consternation over his candidacy in Philadelphia was
``all's well that ends well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides said Monday that he has raised more than $3
million for the race. Giuliani has reported raising $744,000, but
that does not include money not yet reported from a large
fund-raising dinner in May and other recent events.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, are concerned about the enormous
media attention that Mrs. Clinton received on a three-day visit to
New York last week, her first since announcing the formation of a
Senate exploratory committee. ``The television coverage of her has
been like Mother Teresa's visit to New York,'' complained one
leading Republican strategist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was in New York City Monday for what her press
secretary, Howard Wolfson, said were private meetings. She was to
meet in the evening with a small group of New Yorkers at a home in
southern Westchester County as part of her summer ``listening
tour,'' which her aides closed to the media. Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton
is to go to Westchester Community College and then Long Island. She
is to be in Long Island again on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton is to be in New York City for what
Wolfson called an organizational meeting with a core group of
fund-raisers, among them Alan and Susan Patricof, Patty Kenner,
Roger Altman and Erskine Bowles, the former White House chief of
staff.

FENWAY PARK WILL BE ONE OF THE TV STARS DURING ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a television stage, Fenway Park, now age 87, is as
recognizable as Ralph Kramden's barren kitchen, the bustling police
station in ``Hill Street Blues'' or the coffee bar in ``Friends.''
Tune in, and you know in an instant exactly where you are.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Monster in left field is Fenway's leading man, but
more of a weathered character actor like Spencer Tracy. The quirky
outfield dimensions, the fans' proximity to the players, the Citgo
sign and the hand-operated scoreboard make up the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us see Fenway and have certain memories,'' said Mike
Weisman, the producer of Tuesday night's All-Star Game for Fox
Sports. ``We don't have Bank One Ballpark memories. Bank One is a
great stadium, but the All-Star Game at the end of the millennium
wouldn't have the same feel in a modern ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenway is a perennial star, the edifice as matinee idol, much
like Ted Williams or Carl Yastrzemski, Tony Conigliaro or Pedro
Martinez. ``Well, maybe not as much as Ted,'' said the Fox analyst
Tim McCarver.
</P>
<P>
   Purists get weepy about old joints like Fenway, which is the
reason for the opposition to replacing the ancient Boston baseball
gem. There is a charm to watching games at a place that looks as it
did when television first focused on it more than 50 years ago. Had
television been around in 1933, viewers would not have seen the
Green Monster, which was added by the owner Tom Yawkey in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are amazed, when they come in, to see how high the wall
is and how close it seems,'' said Sean McDonough, a Red Sox
announcer. ``You feel you can reach out and touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a capacity of 33,871, Fenway is baseball's smallest ball
park, but it is larger than the late Ebbets Field by more than
2,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, makes it nearly perfect for television's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intimacy works so well for television,'' Weisman said.
``The sound seems to crackle there. The dark green of Fenway looks
so good at night. The field sparkles. It's everything you want in a
ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everything. Weisman said that Wrigley Field in Chicago
wins the slight nod as the better place for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrigley has a slight edge because of the ivy and the
bleachers,'' he said. ``Little things like better sight lines and
camera angles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox will give Fenway, which hasn't been the site of an All-Star
Game since 1961, a star turn. Cameras will be atop the Green
Monster (imagine watching Carlton Fisk's home run in the 1975 World
Series from that angle); footage of Fenway oddities will be on tap
(if a ball rattles into one of its nooks or crannies, a flashback
will be summoned); 3-D graphics of old Fenway and the planned new
one are available, and an estimated 40 baseball legends will walk
in from center field in a ``Field of Dreams'' motif, followed in a
golf cart by Williams, who will toss the first pitch to Fisk from
in front of home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great if Ted tips his cap to the fans?'' said
Weisman, who watched Fisk's home run from an NBC production truck.
</P>
<P>
   That would certainly be memorable given Williams' aversion to
cap tipping. But would such an event eclipse in importance
McCarver's indelible memory of his first trip to Fenway as the St.
Louis Cardinals' catcher for the 1967 World Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting blown out in Game 6, and Red Schoendienst
asked Alex Johnson to pinch-hit,'' he said. ``Alex was in the
clubhouse and said he couldn't pinch-hit because he was eating a
bologna sandwich. So Phil Gagliano pinch-hit. Imagine telling that
to your grandchildren.''  &QL; 
When Good Toys Go Bad  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, it was defensible during Fox's broadcast of the Yankees-Mets
game Saturday to employ a split screen (or double box) to show
Sammy Sosa's at-bat during the Cubs-White Sox game. After all, who
was more apt to hit a home run, Sosa or the Yankees' Ricky Ledee?
So Ledee homered, but Fox did not shift back to New York's full
screen or restore the audio from Shea Stadium. Thus, Fox remained
in the double box when Jorge Posada followed Ledee with another
home run. A Fox spokesman said there were no technical problems.  &QL; 
World Cup Wrap-Up  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The enormous, unexpected 13.3 overnight rating for the Women's
World Cup final does not obscure the serious deficiencies of ABC's
broadcast. In addition to xenophobically treating the Chinese team
like an afterthought (we learned more about the star Sun Wen from
an Adidas commercial), ABC did not help newcomers understand the
rules of soccer, explain the dimensions of the field or even what
``caps'' are.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-game show was inadequate and the halftime show lacked
analysis (but had those key highlights from the Greater Milwaukee
Open). More important, ABC should have quickly replayed the notable
achievement of the United States goalkeeper Briana Scurry for her
penalty-kick save, which is rarer than any successful penalty kick,
even one as crucial as Brandi Chastain's.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the United States team make the rounds of the morning
talk shows Monday, one was struck by the gushfest on ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' by Robin Roberts (``Whoo Whoo!'' ``You da
women!'') and Charlie Gibson, and the controlled enthusiasm of
Katie Couric during her smart interview with the players on NBC's
``Today'' show. Mark McEwen's taped interview with the team on
``CBS This Morning'' showed intelligence without fawning.

WHITE HOUSE ENTERS AIRPORT RADAR DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (md) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has moved in to try to settle a
dispute between two federal agencies over plans to build a radar
system that would detect deadly wind shear at Kennedy and La
Guardia airports.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the U. S. Department of
the Interior have been negotiating fruitlessly for months over the
aviation agency's plan to build the radar system at Floyd Bennett
Field in Brooklyn, which is part of the Gateway National Recreation
Area. The aviation agency contends that it can build the radar
installation _ it resembles a 37-foot ball atop an 82-foot tower _
without the approval of the Interior Department. The Interior
Department, which includes the National Park Service, which in turn
is responsible for Gateway, maintains that it must give its assent,
and will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a definite recognition here that this can't be
allowed to linger,'' a White House official said. ``People are
working to nail it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both agencies said the Council for
Environmental Quality, part of the Executive Office of the
President, was reviewing the dispute. A White House official said a
decision was expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency has been trying since the early 90s to build
the radar system in New York, and Kennedy International and La
Guardia Airports are the last major airports in the country not
served by a wind-shear detection radar. The system was invented in
part in response to a crash at Kennedy in 1975 that killed 113
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Floyd Bennett site is the best available for the system,
aviation agency officials say. The agency, which owns a 1.8-acre
parcel there, has promised the Interior Department to use the radar
for only 20 years and then tear it down, but the Interior
Department has remained adamant that it does not want a radar tower
in a national park.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which
has only advisory powers, has called for approval of the Floyd
Bennett site, pointing out that 500 people have died in the last 25
years in accidents caused by wind shear, a sudden shift from a
headwind to a tailwind that can cause a loss of airspeed and knock
a plane out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is further complicated by a lawsuit brought against
the aviation agency by several community groups in Brooklyn and
Queens, arguing that the law that established the Gateway National
Recreation Area bars development there without the permission of
the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency has already begun preliminary work at the
site and could build the radar while the suit is pending, unless
the plaintiffs win an injunction.

EARL FOELL, 69, MONITOR EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Calif., N.C.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earl Foell, a longtime senior editor of The Christian Science
Monitor with a romantic attachment to precision and clarity, died
on Saturday at the MIT Medical Department Inpatient Unit in
Cambridge, Mass. He was 69 and lived in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Foell (pronounced fell) died after what his wife, Cordelia,
would describe only as a brief illness.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning half a century at The Monitor, Foell rose
from copy boy to reporter, foreign correspondent, U.N. bureau chief
and, from 1970 to 1983, successively, managing editor, editor and
editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1999, he was chief editorial writer and editor of
the editorial page. Last month, he was named contributing editor.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Science Monitor, an international daily newspaper
published Monday through Friday, is owned by the Church of Christ,
Scientist, in Boston. Foell was a member of the church, as are
about half of the staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, The Monitor was to serve as
an antidote to the practices of yellow journalism rampant at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Each day of the week The Monitor publishes a clearly designated
article consistent with the religious beliefs of Mary Baker Eddy,
but apart from that the religious society exercises no control.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the publishers ventured into television
programming, but the effort failed, and in 1992 the society
retrenched its media operations. ``We're beyond that now,'' said
Faye Bowers, a spokesperson for The Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Its circulation today is about 80,000, down from more than
200,000 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   As an editor, Foell was obsessed with comprehensibility. Writing
an appreciation in The Monitor on Monday, a colleague, Roderick
Nordell, said: ``As in E.B. White's advice to writers who see
readers floundering in a swamp, he was always throwing ropes of
clarity. He suffered puns gladly, but no cliche except to turn it
on its head. ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Foell became editor of a new publication, World Monitor
Magazine, a monthly magazine published by Christian Science
Publishing Society. He had high hopes for the magazine which, he
said in an opening editorial, would have a global perspective and
``throw a life preserver'' to readers wallowing in `'a vast glut of
information.'' The publication was discontinued in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Foell served several terms as a Pulitzer prize juror, most
recently this year. ``I was enormously impressed by the breadth of
his knowledge,'' said Seymour Topping, administrator of the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Foell, who was born in Houston on Sept. 21, 1929, graduated from
Principia College in Elsah, Ill., in 1949 with a degree in
mathematics, and immediately joined The Monitor staff as a copy
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he joined the Army but was not sent overseas
because his degree in mathematics was considered an essential
wartime skill on the homefront. In 1953, he was discharged and
returned to The Monitor as a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years with The Los Angeles Times, he returned
to The Monitor as a senior editor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Cordelia, Foell is survived by three
sons, David of Manhattan; Jonathan Kane of Alamo, Calif., and
Hayden Treanor of Oakland, Calif; a sister, Ruth Hill of Charlotte,
N.C., and three grandchildren.

OF COURSE, THESE FIVE MISS BRITISH OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoot Mon! Carnoustie Golf Links here. There has been a wee
misunderstanding I must clear up before I host the British Open
this week. It's the first time since 1975 the ``greatest major of
the four'' _ those are Yank Mark O'Meara's words, not mine _ has
called on me and I'm over the moon.
</P>
<P>
   I want to put on a grand show. It's a terribly personal thing.
I'm on a comeback of sorts after letting myself go to sod three
years ago. I was shaggy and unkempt, but I'm feeling dapper now. My
grooming never has been better.
</P>
<P>
   I want the world to see the resplendent new me. I realize it's
going to be tough, topping Tom Watson's 25-foot birdie on the 72nd
hole in 1975, which delivered him into an 18-hole playoff with
Aussie Jack Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Watson beat Newton by one stroke the following day to win the
first of his five British Opens. I want this year's event to be one
for the ages, as well, and that's why I had to make some difficult
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A golf tournament can only be as grand as its guest list and,
frankly, some of the U.S. entries reminded me of doddering members
of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. They were
dynamic once, but now they're just cantankerous.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, I'm talking about Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw, John
Daly, Steve Jones and Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   You might have heard last week that they all pulled out of the
tournament. Well, I'm here to tell you it didn't exactly happen
like that.
</P>
<P>
   Let them say their bad back couldn't take the trans-Atlantic
plane flight. Let them gripe that it costs too much to come and see
me.
</P>
<P>
   Let them go off on the traffic tie-ups trying to get into my
village or the paucity of decent accommodations near me. Let them
blame their sore shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   They're trying to save face, every last one of them. The truth
is, I rescinded their invitations. Aye, they gave me no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Kite. The guy will be eligible for the British Senior
Open next year and his game is starting to betray his age. He
already has carded three rounds in the 80s in 15 events this year.
If Bay Hill, Torrey Pines Golf Club and Pinehurst No. 2 can
discombobulate him like that, Kite would have been putty in my
fairways (provided he could have found them).
</P>
<P>
   Kites are supposed to be made for the wind, but it would have
been Tom's scores, not his spirits, that soared in the switching
gales that pass for sea breezes in this quaint little city a few
miles north of Dundee.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, I did him a favor by pulling his entry. I sent him
some nice marmalade from Dundee, just to smooth things over.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, who succeeded Kite as the U.S. Ryder Cup captain, is a
historian of the game and I respect that. But facts are facts. He
has missed the cut in all 11 events he has entered this year and he
has only one sub-70 round, at Riviera Country Club in the first
round of the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   My rough-strewn links would have unhinged his game but good.
'Tis better, I decided, that he stay at home and ponder who to name
as his two captain's picks for the upcoming Ryder Cup matches in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   As for Daly, no way do I want a guest of mine leaving early and
he already has withdrawn in mid-tournament three times this year. I
hated like heather to exclude him, because Daly did win the British
Open in 1995 in a playoff with Constantino Rocca at my sister
course in St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the grief Pinehurst's upside-down-Pyrex-bowl
greens gave him and the scurrilous disrespect he showed for the
game by stroking a second putt before the first one had stopped
rolling, my conscience was clear. If you're not going to honor the
game, why bother participating in it?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I figured Daly, a recovering alcoholic, has worse
hazards to try to steer clear of than my fairway bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former U.S. Open winner, says he has only one good
shoulder. So what? Tommy Armour had only one eye (he lost his left
one during World War I), but that didn't prevent him from playing
and winning the British Open when I hosted the event in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Three years removed from his U.S. Open title at Michigan's
Oakland Hills, Jones posted an 82 in the second round at Pinehurst.
If Jones couldn't hack the wind along Tobacco Road, he'd have been
an empty cigarette box swirling in Carnoustie's gray skies.
</P>
<P>
   I would have smoked him. For his health more than mine, I
suggested he stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, I really wanted to come. In 1995 he was the first
American in 22 years to record back-to-back victories on the PGA
European Tour. In Scotland, where I dwell, that means something.
</P>
<P>
   He has two top-eight finishes to show for his past three trips
to the British Open, which isn't shabby. But I'm the toughest
layout in the British Open rotation. I can break the backs of the
sturdiest souls. I didn't want to be responsible for what might
happen to Couples' degenerative discs.
</P>
<P>
   So I sent him a note. `` `Stay the Course' is on the banner that
greets all my guests,'' it read. ``And if that doesn't stir you,
then just stay away.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: LESSONS FROM THE BLACKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   Last week's blackout in northern Manhattan and power shortages
in New Jersey provided timely reminders that the New York
metropolitan region's power supply is not inexhaustible. On the
contrary, a robust economy, combined with the increasingly
widespread use of computers, fax machines and other high-tech
devices, has created an appetite for electricity that could someday
exceed the region's capacity to generate it. One answer is to build
more power plants and transmission capacity. But that should be
only one element in a broader strategy that seeks as well to
conserve energy and exploit newer, more efficient technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the post-blackout criticism has focused on Consolidated
Edison and its delivery problems uptown. Though Con Ed has one of
the lowest rates of power failure in the industry, it clearly needs
to upgrade old feeder cables like those that failed in Washington
Heights and Inwood. But pressure must also be brought to bear on
Albany. Inspired by utility deregulation, Gov. George Pataki has
opened New York's doors to new power plants that can deliver
electricity more efficiently, and there are now six applications
before the state to build or expand plants. Yet because of a
bizarre legislative foul-up, there is no state agency authorized to
grant siting permits. Until that regulatory catch is resolved,
nothing will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Even then it will take several years to build new plants, which
means that other strategies must be explored. One such strategy,
familiar but vital, is energy conservation. Consumers should be
encouraged to buy air-conditioners and other appliances that do
more but consume less power, through incentive programs offered by
the utilities. In the early 1990s power companies spent $300
million statewide on conservation programs, a figure that has
dwindled to $66 million. Albany can revive the program. Meanwhile,
businesses should take advantage of new efficiencies in equipment
and building design, and Congress should think about targeted tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel strategy would involve the aggressive application of
newer technologies, chiefly the ``on-site'' generation of power
from photovoltaics and fuel cells. Such devices, attached to
buildings and homes, will reduce the burden on utilities like Con
Ed and, equally important, provide a reliable source of power
during emergencies. For example, the blackout may have damaged or
delayed hundreds of experiments that medical researchers from
Columbia University were conducting at laboratories in Washington
Heights. Reliable on-site power could have provided a margin of
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although the long-term solution will involve building new plants
and upgrading transmission lines, as well as replacing unreliable
components of the existing system, energy efficiency and on-site
power are of major importance. They are also environmentally
desirable. Conservation, by definition, produces no pollution,
indeed reduces it. Fuel cells are also relatively clean sources of
power.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout inconvenienced many New Yorkers. But it may also
have forced the city, the state and industry to think creatively
about how to address the needs of all New Yorkers.

HELEN FORREST, 82, BIG-BAND SINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helen Forrest, the big-band singer whose dreamy hits with the
Harry James orchestra distilled the nostalgic spirit of World War
II pop, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture Country Home and
Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``the voice of the name bands,'' Ms. Forrest became a
leading vocalist in 1938 when she replaced Billie Holiday as the
singer with Artie Shaw's orchestra. She also worked with Benny
Goodman (1939-41) and James (1941-43) before going solo in 1944. In
1940 Ms. Forrest, who was white, broke precedent to record a single
(``I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You'') with the black
band leader Lionel Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Forrest's recordings with Shaw included ``Any Old Time,''
``I'm in Love With the Honorable So and So,'' ``They Say,''
``Thanks for Everything'' and ``All the Things You Are.'' Among her
recordings with Goodman were ``The Man I Love,'' ``Taking a Chance
on Love'' and ``More Than You Know.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 she reached a peak of popularity with James, singing the
No. 1 wartime hits ``I've Heard That Song Before,'' ``I Don't Want
to Walk Without You'' and her signature song, ``I Had the Craziest
Dream'' (the title of her 1982 autobiography).
</P>
<P>
   Born Helen Fogel in Atlantic City, N.J., Ms. Forrest performed
regularly as a young girl on the New York City radio station WNEW.
That led to a job on CBS Radio singing with the trumpeter Bunny
Berigan. Shaw heard her one night at the Madrillon Club in
Washington and invited her to replace Holiday, who, weary of racial
indignities suffered on the road, had decided to quit the band.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Forrest recorded 38 singles for Shaw, and when he briefly
disbanded his orchestra in 1939, she moved to Goodman's band, which
was not known for being hospitable to vocalists.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting in 1941, she got in touch with James, who gave her a
larger-than-usual role in his band and even had his arrangers beef
up the orchestrations with violins. The result was a creamy
voice-and-trumpet sound, at once spunky and wistful, that captured
the wartime longing of women separated from their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Forrest's relationship with James, which was romantic as
well as professional, disintegrated when he met Betty Grable, whom
he later married, while making the movie ``Springtime in the
Rockies.''
</P>
<P>
   Married and divorced three times, Ms. Forrest is survived by a
son, Forrest Feinman.
</P>
<P>
   Going solo in 1944, Ms. Forrest teamed up with the crooner Dick
Haymes to record a series of Top 10 duets that included ``Long Ago
and Far Away,'' ``It Had to Be You,'' ``Together,'' ``I'll Buy That
Dream,'' ``Some Sunday Morning,'' ``I'm Always Chasing Rainbows''
and ``Oh! What it Seemed to Be.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recording and touring, Ms. Forrest made several
film shorts with Shaw and appeared in several features with James,
including ``Private Buckaroo'' (in which she sang ``You Made Me
Love You''), ``Bathing Beauty'' and ``Best Foot Forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As the big band era waned, she sang in supper clubs and on the
radio, and from 1944 to 1948 she and Haymes starred together in a
popular weekly radio show. But unlike Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day,
Peggy Lee and other big-band singers who developed solo careers in
the late '40s and '50s, Ms. Forrest was unable to make the
transition in changing times, and after the 1950s remained a
much-loved vocal touchstone to an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 she toured the United States with Frank Sinatra Jr. and
the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, and in the late '60s she was reunited
with James for an album. A decade later, she joined James, Haymes,
the Pied Pipers and the Ink Spots in a touring nostalgia revue,
``The Big Broadcast of 1944.'' Her last album was released on the
Stash label in 1983.

COMMENTARY: CONSIDERING THE VIEW FROM SUMMER'S ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sign of full summer is a child's bicycle _ the kind with a
pastel frame, white tires and a white wicker basket on the
handlebars _ strapped to the rear end of a minivan. The van, with
out-of-state plates, is parked at a pullout at Bryce Canyon
National Park in southern Utah. With his free hand, a father is
trying to wave his family closer to a wooden sign that marks the
altitude. On the sign a raven sits, wise to the ways of tourists.
The man's other hand holds a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   For a few seconds, the family smiles together into the lens.
Behind them, beyond the hoodoos and the bristlecone pines, lies an
unintelligible vastness. The family packs back into the car and
drives on, to the next pullout, the next vista, the next motel or
campground. The raven blinks.
</P>
<P>
   This is the traveling time of year, vacation time. The
campgrounds are full at all the national parks. At the major
interchanges on the major transcontinental routes, the motels fill
up by midafternoon. A brisk trade is being done all across the
nation in plastic tomahawks and beaded coin purses, in
cheeseburgers and Sno-Kones, in postcards and shrink-wrapped
firewood. At the truck stops, there is a sudden perplexing infusion
of white-legged people who pull up to the wrong pumps and wander,
uninvited, into the truckers' lounge. At every mountain pass a
subdivision of white recreational vehicles inches its way uphill,
vehicles with names like ``Conquest,'' ``Chieftain'' and ``Eagle,''
but with satellite dishes and microwaves too.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, this looks less like the quest for difference than the
diffusion of sameness. Though travel gets easier all the time, it
gets harder every year to distance yourself from the web of
familiarity that has been thrown over the approaches to scenic
America _ the web of A.T.M.'s, chain restaurants, chain motels and
chain experiences. Beneath the convenience of it all lurks a hidden
fear of disappointment and strangeness, of feeling displaced, of
coming to the limits of a known world.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the scenery itself has been changed by so much
familiarity. A vista is no longer the point of departure for an
experience, the view from the trailhead, so to speak. It has become
the experience. Long ago, America set out to democratize the
sublime, to provide motorized access to the great natural vistas
across the country. The effect has been to downsize the sublime, if
only because there is no longer a sense of approach, of discovery.
The trail is all too well marked with souvenir shops and
soft-ice-cream purveyors.
</P>
<P>
   There is still an unknown country out there, somewhere. But it
cannot be seen through a video camera. You cannot get there in an
RV.

CARLOS RAMIREZ, 52, PUBLISHER OF EL DIARIO/LA PRENSA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carlos Ramirez, the publisher of the oldest and one
of the largest Spanish-language newspapers in the United States, El
Diario/La Prensa, died on Sunday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was
52 and lived in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Rossana Rosado, the editor
in chief of the newspaper, which is based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez joined El Diario in 1981 as a controller, hired by
Gannett Co., which had just bought the paper. He later became
president and publisher, and in 1989 led a partnership that bought
the newspaper for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the purchase, he made the improvement of El Diario's
technology, profitability and journalistic standards top
priorities, and the paper won several awards as Best Hispanic Daily
from the National Hispanic Publishers Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership in the Hispanic press providing a community
with insightful and complete coverage of events in Spanish will be
deeply missed,'' said Andres Tobar, executive director and chief
executive officer of the Hispanic publishers association.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosado noted that before Ramirez took over, El Diario/La
Prensa was often billed as the oldest Hispanic paper in the
country. Now, she said, it is equally if not better known for being
on the cutting edge of Hispanic publications and civic journalism.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Ramirez's most important achievement may have
been changing the color of the newspaper's balance sheet, to black
from red.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned the paper around and made it profitable,'' Ms.
Rosado said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day-a-week paper has a circulation of 68,000, mostly
in the New York metropolitan region, according to the publishers
association. Only La Opinion in Los Angeles and two Miami-based
newspapers, El Nuevo Herald and Diario de las Americas, are larger
Spanish-language newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Aug. 19, 1946. He
later moved to Queens, and graduated from Baruch College in New
York with a degree in accounting and finance.
</P>
<P>
   After Ramirez took over El Diario/La Prensa, he often said that
the purchase was his way of paying tribute to his parents and his
heritage and fulfilling a dream to give something back to his
community.
</P>
<P>
   The paper had been bought by Gannett for $9 million near the end
of a decadelong decline from its position as the dominant
Spanish-language publication in the United States. Its circulation
had fallen to less than 40,000 from a high of more than 100,000 in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   El Diario/La Prensa was created in 1968 by the merger of New
York's original Spanish-language newspapers. La Prensa began
publication in 1913 to provide news to Spanish immigrants. El
Diario appeared in 1948 to serve the city's growing Puerto Rican
population.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ramirez's partnership, El Diario Associates, became
part of the Latin Communications Group in San Jose, Calif., which
also owns 18 radio stations. Ramirez served on the company's board
and was president of its print division.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is survived by his fiancee, Pamela Merlo-Balfour; his
parents, Carlos and Maria Ramirez of Queens; two children, David
Ramirez of Manhattan and Christine Ramirez of Long Island, N.Y.; a
sister, Magdalena Ramirez of Queens, and a granddaughter.

The embryos of about 50 donors are stored in 35-liter metal
containers in a stark white room at the clinic. Unless their donors
are located by July 31, they will be destroyed, along with

EDITORIAL: MISCHIEF IN THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be chief
American representative to the United Nations has hit yet another
snag. By now, questions about Holbrooke's ethics and approach to
policy have been thoroughly vetted. The latest problem concerns the
judgment of Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader,
and his chamber's dubious practice of letting individual senators
freeze a nomination to gain leverage on an unrelated matter.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Lott has placed a hold
on the Holbrooke nomination to pressure President Clinton to
approve the Republicans' flawed candidate for a seat on the Federal
Election Commission, Bradley Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the pressing business awaiting Holbrooke at the U.N.,
Lott's performance is troubling on two counts. First, by initially
trying to hide his role in blocking Holbrooke, Lott violated the
spirit of a reform measure he negotiated in March with the
Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of S.D. The reform was supposed to
require senators to make their identity known when they put a
nomination on hold. Previously they could do so anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is right to resist naming Smith, an Ohio law professor,
to the Election Commission. Smith's writings make plain that his
agenda as a commission member would be a further dismantling of
reasonable campaign limits intended to curb the corrupting
influence of big money rather than serious enforcement of current
campaign finance laws. Both the agency and the laws need
strengthening, not further evisceration. In any case, squabbling
over the FEC job should not mean a further delay in Holbrooke's
arrival at the U.N.

PHOENIX KIDS LIVE IN TWO CITIES, TWO WORLDS

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

   PHOENIX _ They're all Phoenix kids.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn, Antoinette, Ray, Carson. They're all growing up together
in the same big, bright city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they're worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gangs. They shoot by my house,'' complains Ray Gamez, 10,
who will be a fifth-grader at J.B Sutton Elementary School in
southwest Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Scala, 10, has his worries, too: ``Our next-door neighbor
built this thing really close to the wall, like a ramada. It blocks
the view of the mountain.'' Jeff is a fifth-grader at Copper Canyon
Elementary School in northeast Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and Ray both live in America's fastest-growing big city,
with low unemployment, surging population and a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the hometown they will all remember.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhoods surrounding Sutton and Copper Canyon schools
reflect the differences that tear Phoenix into two distinct worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Differences that show up next door, across the street, around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   What children encounter there, day after day, shapes their
lives. Research shows that it can help root them in peace, trust
and stability _ or help shatter their security, destroy their joy
and derail their futures.
</P>
<P>
   The two different Phoenixes don't have clear boundaries. Many
children grow up in areas that contain elements of both. Kids of
all colors struggle to grow up in impoverished, crime-ridden
neighborhoods scattered throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Copper Canyon is at one extreme, surrounded by airy, multistory
homes with red-tile roofs, manicured, flowery front yards and
mountain views.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton is at the other, surrounded by a far more crowded
neighborhood thick with children who live in apartments and small
houses, some with families struggling to keep them maintained and
others that have surrendered to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the neighborhoods also shows up in
statistics. In the past 12 months, for example, police arrested
2,152 adults within a 2-mile radius of Copper Canyon for domestic
violence, violent crimes and property crimes.
</P>
<P>
   For the same area around Sutton, that number is 12,375.
</P>
<P>
   Children arrested for those same offenses _ domestic violence,
violent crimes and property crime _ in the Copper Canyon
neighborhood over the past 12 months total 197.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sutton neighborhood, the total is 932.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are gangs around it,'' Ray says of his street near
Sutton. ``They kill too much and smoke too much.``
</P>
<P>
   The Sutton students will tell you about the neighbors who shoot
off guns _ sometimes into the air, sometimes at each other. Mean
dogs run in their alleys, their homes are violated by break-ins,
their pets killed, their walls smeared with graffiti or damaged
when speeding cars crash into them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There lives some gang members there and drunk people drive
there,'' says Marco Anguiano, 10, complaining about his busy road.
``One time one crashed into a wall _ my wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Patino, 10, says his street doesn't have as many cars;
it's the foot traffic that bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They throw stuff. People. Like sodas and cans and coffee,''
explains Tomas. ``It's nasty. If you have grass in the front yard,
it gets messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they break into your house and steal stuff. Bikes,
money, jewelry. They take good stuff and it's hard to replace it,''
says Juan Abreo, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many gang members, and they tag on your wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting to the core, Marco says, ``I don't like nothing about my
street. I stay inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The children up north, in the other Phoenix, have complaints
about their neighborhood, too.
</P>
<P>
   What irritates Copper Canyon student Bryce Sirrine, 11, are
those big hills that stand between him and his dirt bike trails and
force him to get off his bike and walk.
</P>
<P>
   The noise on Bell Road was so intense that 9-year-old Carson
Park's parents had to install a waterfall in their pool to block it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzy Johnson, 11, lives just a block from Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night there was an accident. I heard the siren and
saw the red and blue lights. That bothered me and I couldn't
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody denies that even small worries can loom large in any
child's life. But officials like state Superintendent of Public
Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan say they're tired of trying to cope
with the large worries, trying to shape schools for devastated
neighborhoods instead of reshaping neighborhoods into safe,
nurturing places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have to come up with a way to teach children who
live in that environment,'' Keegan says. ``We should solve the
problem of bullets flying through back yards.''
</P>
<P>
   People with power and money have to make a ``huge'' shift in
policy, Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've had a child look you in the eye and say, `I
don't want to die,' you'll never understand,'' Keegan says.
``They'd see these old, old eyes in children. They've (the
children) seen much, much more than you or I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian Cuspard is 23 now, an assistant to a Phoenix City Council
member, father of two, a homeowner. He wishes every Phoenix child
could live on peaceful streets with mountain views.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on West Buckeye Road, a giant of a child who followed
his older brothers into gang life. He lived with streets filled
with crackheads and drug dealers. He was mugged in an alley at age
12; at 13 he saw his first dead man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never really home because you never feel safe,'' Cuspard
recalls. ``When you're in bed and you hear gunshots, how can you
feel safe if one of those bullets hits someone you know, or comes
through and hits someone in your house?''
</P>
<P>
   You stop thinking about the future, Cuspard says, and survive
day to day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Mom and Grandma can eat today,'' he says, ``that's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   John Loredo, 31, also grew up in the meaner Phoenix. Every day,
around the corner or across the street, lurked a decision that
could have changed his life forever, Loredo says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deck is stacked against them,'' says Loredo, now a state
legislator, about the children who live in the other Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   These desperate, violent neighborhoods are filled with good
people and children, he says. ``But the opportunity to deviate from
the straight path is increased by 100 percent over those other
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Phoenix's children have fears about the streets where
they live. But some are easier to survive than others.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live near Copper Canyon say they fear mostly what
MIGHT happen, and far less about what does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really, really huge snake, like 3 feet long,'' Bryce
begins. ``One day it crossed the street and Dad said to watch it
and I didn't hear him and we don't know where it went.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't Bryce's only story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had troublemakers on our street and they egged our cars,
but they only had two eggs, and we thought it was them. But the
next day their house was (toilet-papered).''
</P>
<P>
   For the kids from Sutton, it's not snakes and eggs, it's
burglaries and gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear gunshots,'' Antoinette Ordaz, 10, says about what
scares her. She's a talkative little girl who continually adjusts a
tiny shoulder bag. ``Last time it scared me when my grandma's house
got robbed. I thought they'd get my house. They got away because
the police took forever.``
</P>
<P>
   Juan says, ``Nothing scares me, except when they shoot a lot in
the night. Sometimes they do it for fun, but it might hit someone.
They might end up killing someone I know, like my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Children like Juan who live with violence risk becoming numb to
it, reports Michael Kelley, an Arizona State University professor
in child development.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley worked for Issac School District, which includes Sutton,
and saw preschool children come in with ``a gleam of life in their
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. ``You interview them at 8 or 9 and that gleam is
gone. They build a core or crust around their bodies to survive,''
Kelley says. ``They do become very different human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are beginning to track anti-social behaviors in
children as young as 4 who live in impoverished areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about survival,'' he says, ``not the pursuit of
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Phoenix children _ in Copper Canyon and Sutton _ remain
alike in many ways. They say their parents make them do homework
before they can play. They have big plans.
</P>
<P>
   At Sutton, Marco wants to be a NASCAR driver or a scientist,
while Tomas is thinking about becoming a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either a teacher, a nurse or an astronaut to go to Mars or the
moon,'' Antoinette says.
</P>
<P>
   The kids at Copper Canyon are a little more detailed in their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Keith, 10, expects to have two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my early life, I'll probably be an engineer,'' she says,
but noted that her family also owns a hardware store. ``So, in my
30s or 40s, I'll probably take over the company with my cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizzy wants to be a news reporter or manage a clothing store or
be a fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed with Nordstrom,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce thinks he'll go into construction contract management,
like his dad. ``If not that, I want to work for a monopoly,'' Bryce
explains. ``Some corporation that has a nice monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the neighborhoods' deep differences never disappear, and the
sadness of everyday heartbreak seems to haunt some streets more
than others.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is only 10, but when he talks about his neighborhood he
watches the floor, his arms folded across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best friend's brother grabbed a little cat I liked so much
and gave it to dogs,'' says Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering his dead pets, his soft voice suddenly fills with
sarcasm: ``Oh, that was so funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's voice softened again. ``Sometimes they take dogs I like,''
he said. ``I like animals too much.'' &QL;
