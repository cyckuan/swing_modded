<HEADLINE> As Dollar Falls, Consumers May Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the price of buying a car starts rising in  
the United States, consumers may need to look no further than the 
dollar's recent slide against major foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, economically depressed Midwestern farmers may  
find it easier to sell their surplus grain overseas if a weak 
dollar makes it cheaper for foreigners to buy American goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar spent much of last week on the skids, flirting with  
its lowest level of the year against the Japanese yen, representing 
a 12 percent tumble since May. It has also lost ground to the euro, 
the single European currency that was introduced Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the dollar's retreat reflects optimism for resurging  
economies in both Asia and Europe, combined with fears of 
additional interest rate increases in the United States. The 
prospect that growth is shifting outside the United States has led 
currency traders and international money managers to sell their 
dollar-based stocks and bonds in favor of assets tied to the yen 
and the euro, which in turn strengthens those currencies against 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	An extended slide by the dollar will eventually hit U.S  
consumers where it counts -- in their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	When the value of the dollar does down, the price of shoes, toys  
and other goods imported into the United States goes up because it 
takes more U.S. dollars to purchase those items, said Sung Won 
Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. So cars 
imported from Japan, for example, become more expensive to buy in 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	American automakers, determined to keep their prices in line  
with the Japanese, could then be expected to raise their car 
prices, Sohn speculated. ``When imports cost more, U.S. goods 
competing with those imports generally raise their prices in 
tandem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to tell what's going to happen, but we've been  
in this box before,'' said Al Young, president of Dan Young 
Chevrolet-Honda in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	When the dollar hit a similar skid a decade ago and it became  
more expensive to buy a Japanese car, U.S. automakers were quick to 
boost their prices, Young recalled. He disagrees with the policy. 
``If I was the president of one of these (U.S.) companies, I'd take 
the opportunity to maybe get some market share back. But they must 
see it as a way to increase their profits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel abroad, which enabled Americans to stretch their vacation  
budgets when the dollar was stronger, has become more expensive 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar last week fell below 110 yen for the first time since  
January, and only the second time in three years. That's well below 
its May high for the year of more than 124 yen to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rebound Friday, a day when U.S. stocks and bonds rallied on  
a noninflationary report on the American labor market, the dollar 
ended New York trading at 110.05 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But that still was nearly 25 percent below the eight-year high  
of 146.57 yen to the dollar reached as recently as June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has also slid against the euro, as confidence has  
emerged in Europe's fledgling unified economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro had been on a tailspin for much of this year, after  
rising as high as $1.1886 during its first day of trading on Jan. 
4. By July, there was widespread speculation the euro would fall 
below $1. But it has staged a significant rebound in recent weeks, 
and Friday's close of $1.0612 was 5 percent above the low it 
reached seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo's Sohn said the dollar's decline has resulted from a  
recovery in Asian economies since the financial meltdown that 
started spreading across Asia two years ago, when currency 
devaluations rippled across the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, fears that the powerful economic expansion of the  
1990s in the United States might be hobbled by rising inflation and 
interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve has led some 
international investors to take their money out of the United 
States and seek more profitable investments overseas. Higher 
interest rates reduce profits of U.S. corporations, hurting the 
value of stocks, and also lower the value of fixed-income 
investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sohn said its hard to say how much lower the dollar may fall  
against the major foreign currencies. He noted, however, that 
Japanese officials have hinted they may intervene to prop up the 
dollar against the yen by selling yen for dollars. Such a policy 
would prevent the yen from getting too strong, which could hurt 
Japan's economic rebound by making Japanese products too expensive 
in many foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, U.S. exporters stand to benefit from the decline  
because a weak dollar lowers the price of American goods overseas. 
For instance, many farmers see the current market as ``a window of 
opportunity'' to sell surplus grain supplies overseas at 
competitive prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tends to help us out,'' said Jim Hanson, with the Farmers  
Cooperative Association in Lawrence, Kan. ``It has a trickle-down 
effect because major purchasers of our grain overseas can now buy 
large quantities with less money.''

<HEADLINE> Dennis Washes Ashore in N. Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. (AP) -- Once a feared hurricane, Dennis was  
further downgraded early Sunday from a tropical system to a 
tropical depression as it continued to bring strong rain to much of 
eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, which had meandered off the state's coast for a  
week, caused flooding in several coastal counties as it came ashore 
on Saturday, and nearly 5,000 customers lost power. But there were 
no reports of significant damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The center of Dennis' huge eye crossed the Core Banks shortly  
before 5 p.m. Saturday just south of Cedar Island, the National 
Weather Service reported. Sustained winds were clocked at 70 mph, 
just short of hurricane force. By early Sunday, winds dropped to 35 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 5 a.m., Dennis was centered about 20 miles southwest of  
Rocky Mount and moving northwest at about 10 mph. The system was 
expected to weaken continually while gradually turning north 
throughout Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis began sprinting toward the coast Saturday morning after  
sweeping past most of the North Carolina coast Monday, stalling and 
then backtracking. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents on the Cedar Island peninsula, where heavy rains and  
windswept Core Sound left U.S. 70 under three feet of water, said 
flooding from Dennis was the worst since that caused by a 1933 
hurricane that killed 21 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The most severe flooding appeared to be in low-lying areas along  
U.S. 70 and N.C. 12 north in Carteret County, and along two state 
highways in Pamlico County. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who are stranded, and they're going to have  
to stay there until the floodwater goes down,'' said Carteret 
County fire marshal Al Hadley. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of Pamlico County received more than 5 inches of rain and  
floodwaters were up to four feet deep in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Addertion, emergency management coordinator for Carteret  
County, said it appeared the worst was over once the system made 
landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's under control, I believe,'' Addertion said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dennis' behavior has been anything but typical, said Stacy  
Stewart of the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said tropical storm force or stronger winds usually  
affect a single area for 12 hours or less on average. ``That 
includes the approach, the center passing over, and retreating,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``North Carolina has been getting battered for pretty close to a  
week,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado  
touched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment 
buildings and an assisted living center, and injuring more than a 
dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby  
Chesapeake, Va., police said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Dennis headed inland, emergency management officials opened  
18 shelters in nine coastal counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last  
weekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when 
the rising wind from the approaching system disrupted ferry service 
to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	A few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the  
first ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to 
Hatteras and Ocracoke Island.

<HEADLINE>  Reds Set HR Mark With 14 in 2 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds set a major league  
record with 14 homers in two consecutive games, adding five Sunday 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds, who set the National League record with nine homers  
Saturday night, continued their onslaught Sunday with two homers by 
Jeffrey Hammonds, and one each by Greg Vaughn, Eddie Taubensee and 
Dmitri Young. 
</P>
<P>
	They hit four homers off starter Robert Person, who left after  
giving up Hammonds' second homer leading off the fourth, walking 
pitcher Denny Neagle and allowing a double off the left-center 
field wall to Pokey Reese. Young hit a leadoff homer on Steve 
Schrenk's first pitch of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds surpassed the 1939 New York Yankees and 1961 San  
Francisco Giants, who had 13 homers in two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which had one homer Friday night, also broke the NL  
record with 15 homers in three games.

<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesia militiamen shot and burned  
their way through East Timor's capital unchallenged today, forcing 
thousands of civilians to flee from violence prompted by a vote 
favoring independence from Indonesia. The U.N. compound in Dili was 
under siege today, with militiamen circling outside, shooting 
assault rifles and menacing the several hundred people inside the 
compound. Food and water shortages loomed when 1,000 civilians 
taking refuge in a school next door fled into the compound after 
they were threatened.

``AKUT Arif,'' read the headline of the daily Star today, likening 
striker Arif Erdem to a member of Turkey's volunteer rescue team 
AKUT. The team is widely admired by Turks for rescuing more than 
200 survivors from quake rubble. Erdem scored three goals within 
four minutes yesterday, leading Turkey to a 3-0 win over Northern 
Ireland in a Group 3 Euro 2000 qualifier at Windsor Park. Media 
hailed him for boosting morale of the nation, which takes its 
soccer seriously, following the Aug. 17 quake that killed more than 
15,000 people.

<HEADLINE> TR, FDR, JFK, LBJ, and Now W? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Republican George W. Bush wins next year's  
presidential horserace he may become the first chief executive ever 
to be branded in the public mind with a single initial. 
</P>
<P>
	If the nickname holds, he'll be no FDR or JFK or LBJ. He'll be  
portrayed as writing the history of his time as just plain W. 
</P>
<P>
	Several newspaper columnists and editorial cartoonists, perhaps  
with just a dash of sardonic humor, have attached the 'W' or 
``double-U'' to George Walker Bush ever since the Texas governor 
began showing significant strength in national opinion polls months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, it's an effort to separate him from George Bush, his  
father. The Connecticut-born George Bush was the 41st president. 
This George Bush wants to be the 43rd. 
</P>
<P>
	The full name of the first George Bush is George Herbert Walker  
Bush, resulting in a string of initials so long -- GHWB -- that no 
one ever tried to wring political brand identification out of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential initials have had their day ever since blustery  
Theodore Roosevelt stormed the ramparts of the American 20th 
century as ``TR.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TR, who actively disliked the nickname ``Teddy,'' wasn't quite  
the first president to be identified with his initials. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulysses Simpson Grant may have started the initialization of  
presidential history during the Civil War, in part because his 
initials, USG, could also be read as an acronym for U. S. 
Government. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grant burned the initials into the American mind when,  
replying to a Confederate general's note asking his terms for the 
surrender of Fort Donelson in Tennessee, he replied: ``No terms 
except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That and his ``USG'' initials quickly earned him the nickname,  
``Unconditional Surrender Grant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also earned him the attention of President Abraham Lincoln,  
who at that point of the war wasn't much used to generals winning 
battles, much less being in position to demand anyone's 
unconditional surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	After USG and TR, presidential initials dropped out of favor for  
a while. Then Franklin Delano Roosevelt began following in his 
fifth cousin's footsteps under the initials FDR. 
</P>
<P>
	TR's trail led Franklin Roosevelt to the New York state  
legislature, to service as assistant secretary of the Navy, to the 
governorship of New York and to the White House. He left a paper 
trail of ``FDRs'' all along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	After Roosevelt's experiences in battling the Great Depression  
and directing U.S. forces in World War II, the FDR initials loomed 
so large in history that all of his immediate White House 
successors felt the need of a set of snappy initials of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	FDR was followed in Washington by Harry S. Truman who used the  
initials HST even though he didn't have a middle name and the ``S'' 
stood for nothing in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Truman's successor, Dwight David Eisenhower, the Army general  
who had led U.S. troops to victory in the ETO (European Theater of 
Operations) signed off as DDE even as his friends and voters called 
him Ike. 
</P>
<P>
	DDE, a retired five-star general, was followed in the Oval  
office by a former Navy lieutenant. And John F. Kennedy stamped his 
own initials -- JFK -- on his ``New Frontier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then came a president who really, really liked his initials.  
</P>
<P>
	Lyndon Baines Johnson used the LBJ brand on practically  
everything, including his ranch and members of his immediate 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, the former Claudia Alta Taylor, was known to friends  
as Lady Bird Johnson. One daughter was Linda Baines Johnson. The 
other, Luci Baines Johnson. LBJs all. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, three-initial handles took a rest. Richard Milhous  
Nixon preferred the simpler, ``RN.'' He entitled his 1978 
autobiography, ``RN, The Memoirs of Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald R. Ford didn't use his initials and friends called him  
``Gerry.'' Jimmy Carter's full name was James Earl Carter but never 
pushed the case for JEC. Ronald Reagan, the next president, used a 
crisp ``RR.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Bill Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton to be formal, has  
never rested on his initials, although his middle name might 
translate to a simple ``J.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But depending on his political staying power, the ``W'' of  
George Bush the younger might last for a while, at least in 
journalistic shorthand. 
</P>
<P>
	As in this sentence written last month by New York Times  
columnist Maureen Dowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``W understands that the arc of a presidential campaign follows  
the arc of a heroic adventure ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, ``W's myth (potent because it offers the classic plot line  
of succeeding his father as ruler) has been much written about of 
late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bush himself, this follower of classic plot lines appears  
to prefer a three-initial stamp to just the lonely single letter 
being pressed on him. 
</P>
<P>
	The initials engraved on what Dowd describes as his  
``custom-made ostrich-leather black cowboy boots'' are ``G.W.B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And his belt buckle spells it all out: ``Gov. George W. Bush.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Another Manning in College Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Eli Manning's transition to college  
football consists of more than learning complex offenses and 
adjusting to life away from home. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Mississippi freshman, it also means dealing with the  
constant references and comparisons to two great Southeastern 
Conference quarterbacks -- father Archie and older brother Peyton. 
</P>
<P>
	And that seemingly daily routine comes even before the younger  
Manning, No. 3 on the Ole Miss depth chart, has played a college 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess there is pressure on me coming up here the son of  
Archie and the brother of Peyton. But I can't really look at myself 
that way,'' Eli said. ``I just have got to come in here and be an 
Ole Miss quarterback, work hard and just learn the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Manning made his debut in an Ole Miss uniform Saturday  
night, wearing No. 10 instead of the retired No. 18 worn by his 
father three decades ago. But he didn't play in the Rebels' 3-0 
victory at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good talk before he went up there. We tried to tell  
him there would be some attention to come his way and for him not 
to get involved with it,'' Archie Manning said. ``People might try 
to make a bigger deal of it, but he has to keep his place and work 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a cue from his brother's own college experience,  
18-year-old Eli also knows to be ready to play at any minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people expect Eli to redshirt, but the same was expected of  
Peyton when he started his first year at Tennessee in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Peyton also began his first college season as the No. 3  
quarterback. But after early-season injuries to Jerry Colquitt and 
Todd Helton, Peyton took snaps in his first game and was the 
starter by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told him that he should be able to redshirt, but I was  
thinking the same thing. You've got to be ready any time,'' Peyton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting his early chance, Peyton went on to set numerous  
SEC passing records. He was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy 
his senior season and then was the first pick in the 1998 NFL draft 
by the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	His offensive coordinator at Tennessee was David Cutcliffe, who  
became the Ole Miss coach last December, just before Eli decided to 
attend the school where his father is still regarded as one of the 
greatest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in a very friendly quarterback system,'' Peyton said.  
``If Eli can get real comfortable with it, he can have a real 
successful college career. However, it's not a system you learn in 
one month or two, or a season. But I know that he's in good hands 
with his coach.''

<P>
	Cutcliffe says that the situation remains ``game-to-game and  
day-to-day as to exactly what happens to Eli Manning'' as far as 
redshirting or playing this season. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-5, Eli is slightly taller than his NFL-playing brother  
but needs to develop his lanky frame. 
</P>
<P>
	In college, as he did at Newman High in the New Orleans area,  
Eli will play more in the shadow of his brother than his father. 
During his three years as Newman's starter, Eli threw for 7,389 
yards and 89 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Peyton years at Tennessee were recent and productive, and  
now he's a pro player,'' Archie said. ``There are a whole of bunch 
of, not only college kids, but young adults who don't remember 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But father Manning was one of the best college quarterbacks of  
his time, finishing fourth in the 1969 Heisman voting and a spot 
higher in 1970. He accounted for 5,576 total yards and 56 TDs in 
three seasons at Ole Miss before being the first-round pick of the 
New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli is actually the second Manning son to go to Ole Miss.  
Cooper, the oldest of the three Manning sons, dressed for one game 
with the Rebels in 1993. But a congenital neck injury forced him to 
quit football without ever playing a game for the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	With Cooper out of football and no opportunity for a  
Manning-to-Manning combination at Ole Miss, Peyton chose Tennessee. 
While it was a decision taken hard by Ole Miss fans, it wasn't for 
a proud father. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't understand. Your son's out there playing. I had  
people come up to me and say it must be hard to pull for Tennessee. 
It wasn't,'' Archie said. ``Your child is out there playing, you 
are for them 100 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Bacon on Path to Career Bliss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bombing out at the box office a few times put  
Kevin Bacon on the path to career bliss. 
</P>
<P>
	``After getting early fame in `Footloose,' I starred in a series  
of pictures that failed,'' Bacon says in Sunday's Daily News. ``So 
I just decided that I couldn't `open' a movie like certain other 
movie stars. It was an economic fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat down with my wife (actress Kyra Sedgwick), and she  
encouraged me to take some of the really terrific supporting roles 
that were out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What resulted was as string of memorable parts in films  
including ``Apollo 13,'' ``JFK,'' ``A Few Good Men'' and ``The 
River Wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bacon couldn't keep the same low profile for long, directing  
the cable movie ``Losing Chase'' and coproducing ``Wild Things,'' 
which he also appeared in. Now he's starring in the upcoming ``Stir 
of Echoes'' and a film in production, ``Hollow Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute you decide on a plan in this business, it'll go up  
in smoke,'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Titans Cut Veteran Darryll Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Tennessee Titans may have done Darryll Lewis a favor on  
Sunday. They cut the veteran defensive back, making him one of the 
NFL's most sought-after players, at least for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, whose has 25 interceptions over the last five years, was  
cut because he lost his starting job and the $2 million he's due to 
make is too much to pay a nickel back. Six teams immediately called 
his agent with more to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was cutdown day in the NFL, with most teams getting down  
to the 53-man limit by getting rid of rookies and free agents who 
basically served as practice players. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver made a notable technical cut -- John Elway, who officially  
retired in April but was kept on the roster as insurance if he 
changed his mind and in a move to save salary cap money. And San 
Diego made a notable non-cut by keeping Ryan Leaf on the roster 
instead of placing him on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, a nine-year veteran, was beaten out for the starting job  
by second-year Samari Rolle and then cut in what looks like a 
difference of opinion between coach Jeff Fisher and Jeff Diamond, 
the new team president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere in this did we ever expect not to have Darryll back,''  
Fisher said. ``I believe he can still play a number of years, if 
not as a starter, as a premier third-down nickel back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' agent, Ken Zuckerman, said he had received calls from San  
Francisco, Dallas, San Diego, the New York Jets, Carolina and 
Buffalo as soon as they saw Lewis' name on the waiver wire. He said 
his client would sign with the team that gave him the best chance 
to be a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be mad,'' Lewis said. ``I'm not the first guy to go  
through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, whose may not be able to play until November after  
undergoing surgery on his right shoulder, could have been put on 
injured reserve, which would have required him to miss the entire 
season. Instead, the Chargers cut Craig Whelihan, who started last 
year when Leaf was benched, and will start the season with veterans 
Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like I got drafted again,'' said Leaf, who had  
monumental problems both on and off the field after being the 
second overall pick in the 1998 draft. ``Now we get the perfect 
situation where I come into and you've got the two veteran 
quarterbacks there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other veterans released Sunday were: linebacker James  
Francis, oft-injured offensive tackle Kevin Sargent and center Rod 
Payne, a third-round draft pick in 1997, by Cincinnati; eight-year 
running back Bernie Parmalee by Miami; kick returner Eric Metcalf 
by Baltimore; and 38-year-old long snapper Mike Morris by 
Minnesota, which also cut tight end Eric Moss, Randy's older 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets cut special teams player Corwin Brown, a favorite of  
coach Bill Parcells in New York and New England. New Orleans cut 
Danan Hughes, a free agent wide receiver who spent seven seasons 
with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, meanwhile, put wide receiver Lamar Thomas, a  
starter last season, on injured reserve. The New York Giants did 
the same with left guard Lance Scott, meaning Luke Petitgout, the 
team's first-round draft choice, will start. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona did the unusual by keeping both its kickers, Joe Nedney  
and Chris Jacke. The Cardinals hope to trade one to a team looking 
for a veteran placekicker.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Gore, Bradley in Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore are  
running neck and neck in New Hampshire in the race for the 
Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Boston 
Globe/WBZ-TV poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that many voters in the first-primary state  
are eager for political change despite the economically prosperous 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 400 likely Democratic primary voters, Gore led Bradley,  
the former New Jersey senator, by 40 percent to 36 percent, the 
Globe reported Sunday. That amounts to a statistical dead heat 
because it falls within the poll's margin of error of 5 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush held a solid  
lead over his GOP rivals, winning the support of 44 percent of 
those surveyed. Trailing was Elizabeth Dole, former transportation 
secretary and Red Cross director, with 14 percent, and Sen. John 
McCain, an Arizona senator, with 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, who spent millions of dollars from his personal  
fortune to pay for television advertisements, was in fourth place 
with 7 percent, while commentator Patrick J. Buchanan and former 
Vice President Dan Quayle each had 4 percent, and a former Reagan 
aide, Gary Bauer, had 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk show host Alan Keyes was inadvertently left out of the  
Globe-WBZ-TV poll, but according to a Franklin Pierce poll last 
week, his support is about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic primary race really appears to be a race that  
could go either way,'' said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC 
Communications Research, which conducted the survey of 800 likely 
voters for the Globe and WBZ-TV from Aug. 27 to 31. ``Gore has an 
unfavorable rating that is higher than one would expect. It is 
partly due to the fact that people simply want a change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The primary is five months away.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore was popular among a wide range of likely Democratic primary  
voters, about 65 percent of them rating him favorably or very 
favorably. But he was viewed unfavorably by 19 percent of 
Democrats, and by 32 percent by the key constituency of 
independents who say they plan on voting in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley drew a favorable rating of 66 percent. Only 11 percent  
of Democrats and none of the independent voters surveyed rated him 
unfavorably. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurting Gore was his strong support for President Clinton  
throughout the impeachment scandal and questions about allegations 
of his role in aggressive campaign fund-raising tactics of the 1996 
Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Democratic primary voters indicated they were restless  
with the present political leadership. The poll found 21 percent of 
Democrats saying they wanted to keep current government officials, 
while 39 percent said it was time for a change.

	Three Die in Israeli Car Blasts  
</P>
<P>
	TIBERIAS, Israel (AP) -- Two car blasts in northern Israeli  
cities killed three people on Sunday -- probably the bombers 
themselves -- and left a fourth person in critical condition in 
attacks likely aimed at halting the newly revived peace process, 
police said. The explosions in the cities of Tiberias and Haifa 
came hours after a signing ceremony for the first 
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement negotiated since the new 
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, took office. Israel's Cabinet 
ratified the pact by a 21-2 vote Sunday. But hardline opponents to 
the peace process and even Barak's chief peace negotiator said 
attacks could derail the deal.

	CEDAR ISLAND, N.C. (AP) -- A tornado and storm watch was in  
effect for much of Maryland and Virginia on Sunday as rain and wind 
from tropical depression Dennis swept across the region. Dennis 
turned its back Sunday on North Carolina after pounding the coast 
for a week and finally coming ashore to flood lowland towns with 
half a foot of rain. At midday, it was drifting northwest toward 
southwestern Virginia amid a flurry of flash flood warnings and 
watches after spinning off a tornado Saturday night in Hampton, 
Va., that injured more than a dozen people.

siege to the structure and set fire to homes belonging to people 
who support independence for the province. Tens of thousands of 
Indonesians were cramming aboard ferries and planes to flee the 
island. Casualty reports were impossible to verify, though 
witnesses said scores were killed Sunday in the former Portuguese 
colony. In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, President B.J. Habibie

left six party activists dead Sunday in the first phase of India's 
parliamentary election, a contest where key social issues were 
largely ignored and mud-slinging between the ruling coalition and 
supporters of Sonia Gandhi took center stage. Despite the deaths, 
the country's election commissioner announced a fairly low 55 
percent turnout in voting for 145 legislators, more than a quarter 
of the 543 seats to be elected to the lower house of parliament. At 
least 605 million Indians are eligible to vote in the world's

asked why Reno should be held responsible for FBI mistakes. Two 
Republican presidential candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and 
businessman Steve Forbes, said that if they were in the White House

<HEADLINE> Study: Dolly Isn't a Total Clone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A study confirms what scientists had always  
thought about Dolly the sheep: If you want to be really picky, you 
can say she's not completely identical genetically to the ewe she 
was cloned from. 
</P>
<P>
	No need to rewrite the textbooks: The finding doesn't change  
Dolly's status as the first animal to be cloned from an adult 
mammal. 
</P>
<P>
	When most people think about genes, they think of the DNA in the  
nucleus of the cell. The genes there control a wide variety of 
characteristics like eye color. And for this DNA, Dolly is indeed a 
clone. 
</P>
<P>
	But cells contain a much smaller amount of DNA outside the  
nucleus, in features called mitochondria. The mitochondria are the 
power plants of cells, and their DNA -- called mtDNA -- controls 
their functioning. 
</P>
<P>
	This mtDNA accounts for about 1 percent of a typical cell's DNA  
and a much smaller percentage of its genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists always thought that Dolly's mtDNA would differ from  
the mtDNA in the ewe she was cloned from. Dolly was cloned by 
fusing a body cell from the ewe to an egg that had its nucleus 
removed. A body cell has far less mtDNA than an egg does, so when 
they mixed, the vast majority of the result would be from the egg. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, scientists have inspected Dolly's mtDNA and found no trace  
of the ewe's contribution at all. That's a surprise, and it 
suggests the egg destroyed the ewe's mtDNA, said Eric Schon of the 
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He and colleagues present the results in the September issue of  
the journal Nature Genetics. Co-authors include Dolly cloner Ian 
Wilmut of the Roslin Institute in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	They got the same result with the mtDNA of nine sheep cloned  
from fetal cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Schon said the work has a big implication for attempts to study  
diseases caused by flaws in mtDNA. Only a small minority of genetic 
diseases are caused by such flaws, with far more stemming from 
defects in nucleus DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	But defects in mtDNA cause a variety of devastating diseases,  
most of them very rare, with such outcomes as blindness, deafness, 
mental retardation and difficulty walking. Defective mtDNA may also 
cause some 2 percent of adult-onset diabetes, Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists now have trouble studying mtDNA diseases because they  
can't reproduce the human disorders in animals, Schon said. One 
idea has been to grow mitochondria with defective mtDNA in the 
laboratory and inject them into egg cells, with the idea of 
producing mice that carry the defective mtDNA. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new work suggests that might not succeed, because the  
egg might destroy the foreign mitochondria, Schon said. The new 
report is ``a wake-up call to us'' to figure out ways to block that 
destruction, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iron Disorder Common Among Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A genetic defect that causes iron overload disease is the most  
common inherited disorder among whites, affecting one in 188 people 
of northern European descent, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in the New England Journal of Medicine is the first to  
look at the prevalence of the genetic defect in a broad population 
of whites. It also found that a simple test caught 94 percent of 
people with the inherited flaw. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the defect in the HLE gene does not account for all  
inherited forms of the disease, known as hemochromatosis, according 
to another study in the Sept. 2 issue of the journal. Other flawed 
genes apparently cause the disease in other ethnic groups, the 
second study found. 
</P>
<P>
	In hemochromatosis, the body is unable to get rid of excess  
iron. Over time, iron accumulation in the organs can cause skin 
discoloration, arthritis, diabetes, liver disease and heart 
failure. The only effective treatment is bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
	If untreated, men generally start suffering permanent liver  
damage and other problems in their mid-40s; women usually don't get 
sick until a decade later, probably because they have lost blood 
regularly through menstruation and childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers led by Dr. John Olynyk of the University of Western  
Australia tested 3,011 unrelated adults in Busseltown, Australia, a 
small city inhabited by whites of Anglo-Celtic descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen carried the genetic defect, and all but one of them had  
an abnormally high level of iron in their blood, according to a 
test known as serum transferrin saturation. 
</P>
<P>
	That patient had a high level of iron accumulation in her liver,  
measured indirectly by a different blood test known as serum 
ferritin and confirmed by a liver biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows the test for serum transferrin saturation is an  
excellent first step in screening, said Dr. Anthony Tavill, a liver 
specialist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine 
who wrote an accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	That test should be accompanied by the serum ferritin test and  
followed by testing for the defective gene, he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to diagnose it before 40,'' so treatment can  
begin in time to prevent permanent liver damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, led by Dr. Antonello Pietrangelo of the  
University of Modena, Italy, looked at three generations of a 
southern Italian family with an inherited form of hemochromatosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of 53 family members had abnormally high serum  
transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels, but none had the 
characteristic defect in the HLE gene. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beauty of the Italian study is it shows ... there could be  
one or more other genes floating around'' that cause the disease, 
Tavill said. A previous study also found evidence of inherited 
hemochromatosis in South African blacks that was not linked to the 
defect in the HLE gene, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Thrashers Take Ice in Mickey Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The scene pointed to anything but hockey:  
palm trees, 90-degree heat, guys showing up for work in shorts, 
T-shirts and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	So it began for the Atlanta Thrashers, who held their first  
practice Sunday in the land of Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was young, I always wanted to play somewhere that was  
nice and hot,'' said goalie Norm Maracle, who played with the 
Detroit Red Wings last season. ``My dream has come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maracle and nearly all his teammates took advantage of training  
camp being in steamy central Florida, showing up at the sprawling 
RDV Sportsplex wearing attire usually reserved for a trip to the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of jeans and jackets and winter boots,'' Maracle said,  
grinning, ``I get to wear sandals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But don't get the impression this is a summer vacation. The  
NHL's newest team had only six days of practice before its first 
exhibition game, Saturday night against the Nashville Predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Curt Fraser established ground rules to keep  
players focused. Among his edicts: The golf course is off limits, 
curfew is 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the looks at that first meeting when he dropped the  
bomb: no golf,'' general manager Don Waddell said. ``About six guys 
wanted to crawl under the table because they brought their clubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they'll spend their free time trying to learn the names  
of everyone else. Even Fraser found it difficult to tell his 
players apart as they whizzed around the ice in a flurry of 
shooting, passing and skating drills, or when they gathered around 
him during breaks, a bunch of strange faces looking to a coach they 
barely know for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to evaluate these guys the first couple  
of days,'' said Fraser, who used jersey numbers to I.D. them. 
``They look a heck of a lot different off the ice than they do on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser was familiar with the surroundings, having coached the  
minor league Orlando Solar Bears the last four years, but he seemed 
a bit relieved when Day 1 was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty nervous about getting on the ice,'' he admitted.  
``Coaches need training camp just as much as the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One player managed to catch the coach's eye. Right wing Kelly  
Buchberger, the third-oldest player on the roster at 32, was first 
on the ice for the morning workout and never slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser has yet to name a captain, but Buchberger is the  
overwhelming favorite after playing on three Stanley Cup-winning 
teams in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was terrific during every part of practice,'' Fraser said.  
``He was talking and leading the guys. He's just what we're looking 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchberger, known for his work ethic and physical style, intends  
to play the same way in Atlanta that he did for 13 years with the 
Oilers.

	``It's just habit,'' he said with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen-year-old center Patrik Stefan, the top overall pick in

<HEADLINE>  Thrashers Take Ice in Mickey Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The scene pointed to anything but hockey:  
palm trees, 90-degree heat, guys showing up for work in shorts, 
T-shirts and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	So it began for the Atlanta Thrashers, who held their first  
practice Sunday in the land of Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was young, I always wanted to play somewhere that was  
nice and hot,'' said goalie Norm Maracle, who played with the 
Detroit Red Wings last season. ``My dream has come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maracle and nearly all his teammates took advantage of training  
camp being in steamy central Florida, showing up at the sprawling 
RDV Sportsplex wearing attire usually reserved for a trip to the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of jeans and jackets and winter boots,'' Maracle said,  
grinning, ``I get to wear sandals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But don't get the impression this is a summer vacation. The  
NHL's newest team had only six days of practice before its first 
exhibition game, Saturday night against the Nashville Predators. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Curt Fraser established ground rules to keep  
players focused. Among his edicts: The golf course is off limits, 
curfew is 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the looks at that first meeting when he dropped the

	Instead, they'll spend their free time trying to learn the names

him during breaks, a bunch of strange faces looking to a coach they

	``It's going to be tough to evaluate these guys the first couple

``They look a heck of a lot different off the ice than they do on 
it.''

minor league Orlando Solar Bears the last four years, but he seemed 
a bit relieved when Day 1 was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty nervous about getting on the ice,'' he admitted.  
``Coaches need training camp just as much as the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One player managed to catch the coach's eye. Right wing Kelly  
Buchberger, the third-oldest player on the roster at 32, was first 
on the ice for the morning workout and never slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser has yet to name a captain, but Buchberger is the

<HEADLINE> Iron Disorder Common Among Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A genetic defect that causes iron overload disease is the most  
common inherited disorder among whites, affecting one in 188 people 
of northern European descent, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in the New England Journal of Medicine is the first to  
look at the prevalence of the genetic defect in a broad population 
of whites. It also found that a simple test caught 94 percent of 
people with the inherited flaw. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the defect in the HLE gene does not account for all  
inherited forms of the disease, known as hemochromatosis, according 
to another study in the Sept. 2 issue of the journal. Other flawed 
genes apparently cause the disease in other ethnic groups, the 
second study found. 
</P>
<P>
	In hemochromatosis, the body is unable to get rid of excess  
iron. Over time, iron accumulation in the organs can cause skin 
discoloration, arthritis, diabetes, liver disease and heart 
failure. The only effective treatment is bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
	If untreated, men generally start suffering permanent liver  
damage and other problems in their mid-40s; women usually don't get 
sick until a decade later, probably because they have lost blood 
regularly through menstruation and childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers led by Dr. John Olynyk of the University of Western  
Australia tested 3,011 unrelated adults in Busseltown, Australia, a 
small city inhabited by whites of Anglo-Celtic descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen carried the genetic defect, and all but one of them had  
an abnormally high level of iron in their blood, according to a 
test known as serum transferrin saturation. 
</P>
<P>
	That patient had a high level of iron accumulation in her liver,  
measured indirectly by a different blood test known as serum 
ferritin and confirmed by a liver biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows the test for serum transferrin saturation is an  
excellent first step in screening, said Dr. Anthony Tavill, a liver 
specialist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine 
who wrote an accompanying editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	That test should be accompanied by the serum ferritin test and  
followed by testing for the defective gene, he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to diagnose it before 40,'' so treatment can  
begin in time to prevent permanent liver damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, led by Dr. Antonello Pietrangelo of the  
University of Modena, Italy, looked at three generations of a 
southern Italian family with an inherited form of hemochromatosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of 53 family members had abnormally high serum  
transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels, but none had the 
characteristic defect in the HLE gene. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beauty of the Italian study is it shows ... there could be  
one or more other genes floating around'' that cause the disease, 
Tavill said. A previous study also found evidence of inherited 
hemochromatosis in South African blacks that was not linked to the 
defect in the HLE gene, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Clothing Industry Suffering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Exports by China's major clothing industry  
plunged 25 percent in the first half of 1999, hurt by economic 
slumps in key Asian markets, a state newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has tried to encourage exports by increasing  
export tax rebates and trying to hold down fees on producers, the 
Business Weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's garment industry is one of its biggest exporters,  
averaging 14 percent-a-year growth in 1979-97, the newspaper said. 
The country became the world's biggest clothing exporter in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports were down 37.2 percent for knitted goods and 14.5  
percent for woven goods in the January-June period, the report said 
without giving specific sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	It said better sales in new, non-Asian markets had failed to  
make up for declines in sales to Hong Kong and South Korea, major 
customers for Chinese clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	China blames its recent economic problems on the Asian financial  
crisis that began in 1997, but many producers suffer from inferior 
technology and high or arbitrary taxes and fees. 
</P>
<P>
	High Chinese costs drove producers of such goods as athletic  
shoes to Indonesia and other cheaper countries even before the 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	China has banned ``arbitrary charges and fees'' as well as  
raised export tax rebates to 17 percent from 13 percent, the 
Business Weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also is investing in trying to upgrade the  
industry, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Place Galloway On Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks on Sunday placed holdout  
wide receiver Joey Galloway on the reserve-did not report list. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway, who has held out all of training camp, can be  
activated when his holdout ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway, 27, is in the final year of a five-year contract he  
signed after the Seahawks made him their first-round draft choice 
in 1995. He is being fined $5,000 a day during his holdout by new 
coach and general manager Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks initiated the renegotiation process with Galloway  
and offered him a $35 million contract for seven years. Galloway is 
seeking a contract similar to the one signed by Antonio Freeman of 
Green Bay, a $42 million, seven-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also announced the retirement of Pro Bowl offensive  
tackle Howard Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard, 35, a 12-year veteran, hasn't been able to practice or  
play since Seattle's exhibition opener Aug. 14 because of arthritis 
in his right knee. Ballard has played for the Seahawks for the past 
five seasons, after going to the Pro Bowl with Buffalo from 
1991-1993. He started all 16 games last year.

<HEADLINE> Movie Industry Sets Summer Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's been a busy summer of Jedis and witches,  
reluctant brides and randy spies, raunchy teens and a kid who chats 
up dead folks -- a cast of characters that helped set a second 
straight record summer at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	From Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day, the take at U.S.  
theaters was estimated at just under $3 billion, shattering the 
previous high of $2.6 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A record 11 movies have taken in more than $100 million each,  
and a 12th is expected to join the club. 
</P>
<P>
	All this comes at a time when the Internet, video rentals and  
cable and satellite television offer more alternative diversions 
than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a culture that likes to get out of the house,'' said  
Tom Sherak, head of distribution for 20th Century Fox. ``We like to 
get away from our problems. Movies give us the opportunity for two 
hours to get out and get away and just let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, blistering heat in much of the nation sent  
people to the air-conditioned comfort of theaters, and the films 
were good enough to keep them going back for more. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's films also have had staying power. In summer 1998,  
movies on average took in 27 percent of their total gross in the 
opening weekend, said Wayne Lewellen, distribution president for 
Paramount. This summer, that average was down to 24 percent, 
indicating films are lasting longer in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The year started slowly, with movie revenues last winter down  
compared to the previous year, when ``Titanic'' was sinking records 
at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	But summer has more than made up for it, pushing ticket sales  
for the year up 6 percent over last year at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The season started with a bang. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace'' opened May 19 and became the fastest movie ever to 
gross $100 million, hitting that in five days. Now, the movie from 
20th Century Fox has taken in about $420 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks before ``Phantom Menace,'' audiences got a preseason  
warmup with Universal's ``The Mummy,'' an unexpected horror smash. 
And over Memorial Day weekend, Universal slipped in ``Notting 
Hill,'' the Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant romance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookending those movies around ``Phantom Menace'' paid off for  
Universal. ``Mummy'' kept going to gross $155 million and ``Notting 
Hill'' collected $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Star Wars' didn't scare us off,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of  
distribution for Universal. ``We knew we had two big hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then things got crowded. Between ``Phantom Menace'' and current  
box-office champ ``The Sixth Sense'' came a rare period when a 
different movie opened atop the box office in each of nine straight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so competitive that no matter how good you were, you  
got knocked out the next weekend by another movie,'' said Paul 
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which 
tracks movie attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom Menace'' was followed by New Line's ``Austin Powers:  
The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' The Mike Myers spy spoof has grossed 
about $205 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The string of high-grossing wonders also included ``Tarzan,''  
``Big Daddy,'' ``Wild, Wild West,'' ``The General's Daughter,'' and 
``Runaway Bride,'' Roberts' second comedy of the summer to top $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The usual late-summer doldrums, when movie attendance usually  
trails off, never materialized, largely because of ``Sixth Sense'' 
and the surprise hit ``The Blair Witch Project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget ``Blair Witch'' is on track to gross about $140  
million. ``Sixth Sense,'' about a boy who communicates with the 
dead, has been No. 1 the last four weekends and should finish well 
above $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bawdy teen comedy ``American Pie'' also topped the box  
office in July and should pass $100 million this fall, making it 
the 12th summer film to hit that mark. 
</P>
<P>
	There's still a solid slate of films for fall and the holidays,  
and 1999 could break the full-year record of $6.95 billion set last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the fall begin,'' said Fox's Sherak.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With unemployment at a 29-year low, work is  
relatively easy to find this Labor Day, but the U.S. job market is 
hardly a placid place. 
</P>

<P>
	Charles Goldman, for one, is sick and tired of being told, every  
time he turns on the television or picks up a newspaper, about how 
there's a good job for everyone in the miraculous 1990s economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Phoenix resident has been looking for full-time  
work as a mechanical engineer since he got his degree in 1995. It's 
not that he can't find work. Goldman toils on and off as a 
telemarketer or selling computer equipment. But those jobs are part 
time, lack benefits, and don't make use of his hard-earned 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very frustrated,'' said Goldman.  
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturing industry, where Goldman's education would be  
most relevant, is a dark spot in today's bright economy, losing 
946,000 jobs in the past decade. No one seems to want to help the 
inexperienced young engineer make a start. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could maybe train and help us along a little bit,''  
wishes Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the booming construction industry, which has added  
more than a million jobs since 1989, is rolling out the red carpet 
for inexperienced job seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Edgington, president of Edgewel Electric Inc. in Des  
Moines, Iowa, is investing in a new onsite training program, using 
computer CD-ROM's, in order to widen the pool of potential workers 
he can recruit from and get them trained more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can look at a lesser qualified, but capable person,'' said  
Edgington. ``We need people to get into this field and get 
trained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the U.S. economy generated more than 21 million  
non-farm jobs between July 1989 and July 1999, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest job gains have been in the service sector, with more  
than 12 million employees added. There are also more than 4 million 
more Americans working in retail and wholesale jobs. Jobs in 
finance, insurance and real estate have grown by nearly 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Job losses during the 10-year period have been confined mainly  
to manufacturing and mining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department estimates that about three-quarters of the  
jobs created since President Clinton took office in 1993 pay more 
than $11 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not low-wage, low-skill jobs,'' said Labor Secretary  
Alexis Herman. ``You've got good jobs being created at the high end 
of the wage scale, but the critical factor here is skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, the Labor Department predicts that many of the  
fastest-growing jobs will require, if not a college degree, at 
least some special training. These include computer engineers, 
database administrators, desktop publishers, medical assistants, 
and securities and financial sales people. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders, however, worry that those without education and  
training will be worse off as traditionally unionized manufacturing 
jobs, with high pay and good benefits, dry up. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobs on the low-skill end that are expected to be among the  
most plentiful in coming years? Cashiers and retail sales positions 
that pay an average of less than $300 a week -- below the poverty 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in the market now for jobs, especially young people, are  
encountering other disquieting trends, says AFL-CIO president John 
Sweeney, who believes a growing malaise will boost union membership 
in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young workers see fundamental inequities that education alone  
won't solve,'' Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among these is erosion in benefits offered by employers. Recent  
studies show: 
</P>
<P>
	--The percentage of workers with a high school diploma who are  
covered by employer-sponsored health insurance fell from 72 percent 
in 1989 to 69.5 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Overall, the annual growth in what employers spend on employee  
benefits has slowed during the 1990s to 4.2 percent from 8 percent 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	--Meanwhile, pay for top executives, including stock options, has  
more than quadrupled since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that nontraditional work arrangements, such  
as temping and independent contractor status, are beginning to 
raise serious questions about who is legally responsible for the 
fair treatment of a growing number of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the business community, however, bristle at any  
suggestion that American workers are worse off. They note that 
wages have grown at about the same rate as productivity during the 
1990s and in the past few years wages have been rising faster than 
inflation, $612 billion is spent annually on employee benefits and 
jobs are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber  
of Commerce: ``The most frequent sign seen these days is 'Help 
Wanted.'''

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech Freshman Lives Up to Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The hype leading into Virginia Tech's  
first game only figures to intensify after quarterback Michael 
Vick's scintillating debut showcased his passing and tailback-like 
elusiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Vick's performance as the 11th-ranked Hokies' signal-caller on  
Saturday was better than anyone could have expected, even against a 
Division I-AA opponent that was young, learning a new system and 
coming off a 3-8 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations were what most of the nearly 52,000 fans brought to  
Lane Stadium for the season-opener against James Madison. At No. 
11, Virginia Tech never started a season so highly regarded 
nationally, and fans clad in maroon and orange came to see for 
themselves what role Vick would play in the Hokies' fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-0 victory provided more than enough to leave them  
buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
	They groaned when Vick's first pass, a 20-yard out to Jarrett  
Ferguson, bounced well short, and then when his second effort went 
for only a yard to Shyrone Stith, forcing a punt after a 
three-and-out series. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second series, Vick started to show them the future.  
</P>
<P>
	A quick-hitter to Ricky Hall went for 23 yards, only to be  
nullified by a holding flag. A long throw to wide open speedster 
Andre Davis would have gone for 79 yards and a touchdown had Vick's 
pass not been off-target, forcing Davis to adjust on the fly. 
Instead, Davis caught it and fell after gaining 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Two runs by Stith, including one for 32 yards, brought the ball  
to the three, and from there Vick took the snap, bolted left and 
into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that first possession I got comfortable and things just  
started clicking,'' the redshirt freshman said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the beginning, and the highlights got much better:  
</P>
<P>
	--A 54-yard scoring run when he couldn't find an open receiver.  
</P>
<P>
	--A 60-yard pass to Hall that hit him in stride, just out of  
reach of the defender running stride for stride with him, to set up 
a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 7-yard run for a third touchdown. Hit on the play as he  
dived, Vick somersaulted into the end zone. The impact left him 
with a lower left leg contusion and the rest of the day off, but 
his 1 1/2 quarters of work were more than enough to leave his 
teammates and coaching staff buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't play like a rookie,'' Hall said. ``He played like a  
veteran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vick said he was satisfied but watching from the sidelines hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I did a good job,'' he said after completing 4 of 6  
passes for 110 yards and rushing for another 54 yards. ``I took 
what thay gave me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Head coach Frank Beamer was beaming afterward, despite the  
injury, as if he could finally say, `I told you so' to those who 
doubted Vick's hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what he can bring to the table,'' Beamer said. ``He's a  
guy that was impressive early and if we can keep on the field, 
he'll be impressive a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies' training staff said Vick's status for Saturday's  
game against Alabama-Birmingham is day-to-day, but Vick said he'll 
be ready by game time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what I've been waiting for for a long time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kent State Dedicating Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Ohio (AP) -- The promise of young lives shattered. Tear gas  
wafting across a place of learning. A nation at its most divided 
and chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths of four Kent State University students shot by  
National Guardsmen during a 1970 Vietnam War protest seemed to 
crystallize the turmoil of an unsettled and tragic era. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional power of the shootings lingers, even among  
students who weren't born when they happened. This week, new 
markers are to be dedicated in the parking lot where the students 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an emotional subject,'' said Kent State senior Kim  
Larson, 24, her voice choked. ``It's such a shame that it had to 
happen. Every one of those people had a great future ahead of them. 
They were caring people. To me, it was just a terrible tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the student-run May 4 Task Force, Larson helped  
collect petition signatures last year to press the university to 
mark the parking spaces where Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, 
Sandra Scheuer and William Schroeder fell dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorials are to be dedicated Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the spirit of those four students lives today in these  
Kent State students who fight to keep their memories alive,'' said 
50-year-old Alan Canfora, who was a junior when he was shot in the 
wrist that day. He was one of nine who were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Guardsmen were sent to the campus on May 2, 1970, after days of  
student protests and the burning of the campus Army ROTC building. 
On May 4, they used tear gas to disperse taunting, rock-throwing 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	About midday, 28 Guardsmen fired at least 61 shots in a  
13-second burst, hitting protesters, bystanders and students 
walking to class. Some Guardsmen said they felt their lives were in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings sent shock waves across a country growing weary of  
the war. Demonstrations and class boycotts spread to hundreds of 
campuses as the Kent State shootings highlighted domestic fallout 
from the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Gov. James A. Rhodes, the state and guardsmen in 1978  
settled a lawsuit filed by wounded students and the parents of the 
dead. The state agreed to pay $675,000 and several Guardsmen 
expressed their regret. 
</P>
<P>
	While every campus instills memories of times gone by, the  
shootings have given Kent State a unique and painful legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the sculpture marked by Guard gunfire and the hill the  
Guardsmen climbed to pursue protesters. A granite plaza stands as a 
memorial to the victims, while 51,175 daffodils have been planted 
in honor of the nation's Vietnam War dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has offered a course about the shootings for  
years and, with an eye toward drawing something positive from the 
tragedy, has institutes that study peacemaking and conflict 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The four parking spaces have been roped off each May 3 for an  
overnight vigil, with a single student holding a lighted candle at 
each spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Semon, 22, felt little emotional connection to the  
shootings -- even though her father was a Guardsman elsewhere on 
campus during the shooting. Her feelings changed when she stood 
vigil in 1995 at the spot where Miller was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really taken aback by all the emotions,'' she said. ``I  
felt myself becoming an activist at Kent State, just realizing all 
that happened here, all the tension. I really felt a connection, 
not only to the students but to that time, that something like that 
could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the parking space markers took three weeks and cost  
about $100,000, from private sources. Each memorial has a 
rough-edge granite border and six waist-high lamp posts. A polished 
triangle of granite in each space has the date May 4, 1970, and the 
name of a slain student. 
</P>
<P>
	Semon said the petitions and letters of endorsement from the  
parents of the dead students helped get the idea moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the university acted pretty quickly after we put the  
force on them,'' she said. ``But in our minds, it will always be 
belated. They should have been here years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University president Carol A. Cartwright, who endorsed the idea,  
said, ``Until recently, there wasn't unanimity among the families 
about doing it.'' She added, ``I see this as a bit of unfinished 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's mother, Elaine Holstein, 75, of New York, said she has  
mixed feelings about the markers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time I couldn't even step into Ohio. It's been 30  
years now and, over time, I've gotten a little more rational about 
it,'' Mrs. Holstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she added, it will be good to have the spots marked off.  
</P>
<P>
	``It always bothered me,'' she said, ``to think that the spot  
where Jeff was killed was being parked over by cars.''

<HEADLINE> Appendix of Rangers Center Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- New York Rangers center Tim Taylor had  
his appendix removed Sunday, the team's first day of skating during 
training camp at the University of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who signed a four-year, $5.8 million contract with the  
Rangers in July, complained of pain in his side Sunday morning and 
the team took him to a local hospital, a Rangers spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 30, underwent successful surgery to remove the appendix,  
and was to remain in the hospital overnight. Taylor, who is listed 
as day-to-day, will be re-evaluated on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor had four goals and seven assists in 49 games with the  
Boston Bruins last season. The six-year veteran has 39 goals and 40 
assists in 267 NHL games with Detroit and Boston, and was a member 
of the Red Wings' 1997 Stanley Cup championship team.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Retains WBC Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- South Korea's Cho In-joo knocked down Japan's Keiji  
Yamaguchi twice in the 12th and final round Sunday and retained his 
WBC super flyweight title with a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho was making his third defense of the title he wrested from  
Gerry Penalosa of the Philippines on Aug. 29, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Cervantes of Mexico scored it 114-110 for Cho. The two  
U.S. judges also favored the South Korean -- Henry Elespuru had it 
117-107 and Barbara Perez scored it 117-108. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a crowd of 8,000 at Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena, Cho  
landed sharp, accurate punches in dominating the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	Yamaguchi, ranked No. 9, often was forced into the corner in the  
early rounds. Cho said he had to rely more on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I could win in the sixth round because I knew my left  
blows were effective,'' Cho said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho improved his record to 16-0, including seven knockouts.  
Yamaguchi is 28-5, with 11 KOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters weighed 112 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Cut RB Rashaan Salaam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Running back Rashaan Salaam, the 1994  
Heisman Trophy winner, was among 17 players cut Sunday by the 
Oakland Raiders as the team reduced its roster to the 
season-opening 53-man limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam, who didn't play last season after three injury-plagued  
seasons in Chicago, had a solid training camp and preseason. But 
Tyrone Wheatley was even more productive and wound up with a spot 
on the Raiders' roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played well,'' Oakland coach Jon Gruden said of Salaam.  
``We gave him a long look, but Wheatley has really caught our eye 
over the last two weeks, both in practice and games. Special teams 
play also was a major factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, a former Michigan star selected by the New York Giants  
in the first round of the 1995 draft, finished the preseason with 
117 yards on 23 carries. He averaged 5.1 yards and ran for three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam also was a first-round pick by Chicago in 1995. He won  
the Heisman after rushing for 2,055 yards and 24 touchdowns as a 
junior at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	He enjoyed success in a rookie campaign that saw him gain 1,074  
yards but he was slowed by injuries the next two seasons, appearing 
in just three games during in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	After sitting out last season, Salaam signed with the Raiders as  
a free agent. He had 145 yards on 39 carries during the preseason, 
an average of 3.7 yards per carry.

<HEADLINE> Perrot's Memory Honored by Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- As the Houston Comets cemented their third WNBA  
championship Sunday, they fulfilled a promise to a fallen teammate 
and continued to build a dynasty in a year dominated by Texas 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The only team to win a title in WNBA history, Houston kept  
strong the memory of point guard Kim Perrot, who died Aug. 19 from 
a rare form of lung cancer that strikes non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Comets sealed the 59-47 victory over the New York  
Liberty, Perrot's picture and the phrase ``No. 3 for No. 10'' 
immediately went up on the Compaq Center's jumbo TV screens. 
</P>
<P>
	Championship MVP Cynthia Cooper held up Perrot's No. 10 jersey,  
later donning it and hugging members of Perrot's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say we really wanted to win it for Kim. This is in  
memory of Kim; this is in tribute to Kim,'' Cooper told the crowd. 
``And this is in tribute to all the sacrifices that you the fans 
and we the players have made this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stickers and signs reading ``3 for 10,'' abounded, and it seemed  
every fan wore a pin, a button or a ribbon in memory of Perrot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim is here, right now, while we're celebrating,'' fan Debbie  
Loya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot's family was brought down to the floor to celebrate along  
with the Comets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team, the fans, everybody did it for her,'' said Lorreta  
Perrot, Kim's sister. ``Regardless of Kim being gone, in a better 
place, we're all still family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That family includes thousands of fans for a sport that  
naysayers had said would never hold the public's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not missed a game in three years,'' said Willie  
Burley, who attended the game with two of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are part of a group of 50 retired city and county  
employees who have been to every home game since the Comets started 
playing in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Another fan who has not missed a home game, Judy Moore, said  
this year's championship was all the more sweet because of the 
adversity the Comets faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Kim being the backbone of this team, it pushed us to play  
harder and overcome,'' said Moore, who wore a Perrot jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena was sold out for a second straight day, following  
Saturday's last-second Game 2 victory by the Liberty on Teresa 
Weatherspoon's 52-footer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets' run comes in a year rich in championships for Texas  
teams as the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and NHL's Dallas Stars both 
won titles.

<P>
	Ridden by Gary Stevens, Hollycombe covered one mile in 1:35 2-5

<HEADLINE> Burning Man Festival Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The party was over for thousands of free  
spirits Sunday as the 14th annual Burning Man counterculture 
festival ended a weeklong run on the northern Nevada high desert. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the event ended late Saturday with the traditional  
torching of a 50-foot-high wooden effigy of a man, only about half 
of a record crowd of 24,500 had managed to leave by Sunday night, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants faced gridlock as they left the Black Rock Desert  
120 miles north of Reno, the remote scene of the festival billed as 
the ultimate celebration of free expression. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a major traffic jam all day and we expect the  
same thing Monday,'' said Washoe County sheriff's Lt. Will McHardy. 
``The problem is everybody has to leave the desert single file and 
there's a two-hour delay just to get to the highway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the traffic problems, law enforcement authorities were  
pleased with the overall conduct of participants during the 
anything-goes event known for art, dancing, concerts, nudity and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Six arrests were made, about half of last year's number. Four of  
the arrests were for drug sales. Personal drug use is tolerated at 
the event, but not drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival's biggest problem was the 70 to 90 people who  
required emergency medical treatment each day after taking LSD or 
Ecstasy, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's festival drew about 15,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad Gets U.S.-Style Gas Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- It's a mecca for gawkers,  
patriots and fans of convenient consumption: the glittery prototype 
for a chain of gas stations that Trinidad's government is counting 
on to beat all comers. 
</P>
<P>
	While its counterparts are taken for granted in the United  
States, the state-owned National Petroleum mart in Port-of-Spain 
heralds a fast-paced lifestyle unfamiliar on these tropical shores. 
</P>
<P>
	Oreo cookies, Kraft Cheez Whiz, onion skins and rum bottles  
adorn the brightly lit aisles at the new service station and Quik 
Shoppe on Richmond Street. There is ample parking and a granite 
commemorative plaque bearing Prime Minister Basdeo Panday's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidadians have flocked to the store since it opened six weeks  
ago, and it has become something of a place to see and be seen. 
Sales are up 30 percent compared to the time of its less-glamorous 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything already here,'' said Tico, a wide-eyed teen-ager,  
as he browsed the aisles with two friends. ``We have nothing like 
this here in Trinidad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign companies have long searched for and produced petroleum  
and natural gas in Trinidad. They just couldn't sell gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about to change. Trinidad's $88 million retail gas market  
will be opened to foreign firms by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	National Petroleum chairman Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan expects  
plenty of retail competition, although she did not know of any 
specific plans by foreign companies to open gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.2 million service station is the first of 80 stations to  
be built over five years under a $32.7 million modernization by 
National Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
	Seepersad-Bachan says the Richmond Street station is ``an  
example that we citizens of Trinidad and Tobago are as good as any 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been hitches. Workers spent months cleaning up  
gasoline-soaked soil from the old station before erecting the new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	National Petroleum followed Canadian regulations to build the  
station, reflecting a growing environmental awareness by the 
government, Seepersad-Bachan noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a learning experience for all of us,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Panday's government has been among the most aggressive in the  
Caribbean in privatizing state-owned companies and soliciting 
foreign investment to wean the country off its dependence on oil 
and natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad earned $622 million from its gas-based sector in 1997,  
the latest year figures are available. The figure is expected to 
grow dramatically following the opening of the $1 billion Atlantic 
Liquefied Natural gas plant earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That plant, built by Amoco Trinidad, British Gas Trinidad,  
Repsol of Spain, Cabot LNG of Boston and Trinidad's state gas 
company, made tiny Trinidad the world's 11th-largest liquefied 
natural gas-producing nation. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are plans to privatize part of National Petroleum,  
which gets its fuel from the government's Petrotrin refinery in 
Point-a-Pierre. How much will be divested hasn't been decided. 
</P>
<P>
	As in other Caribbean islands, Trinidad and Tobago's retail  
gasoline market is expanding. In 1996, the country of 1.2 million 
had 226,390 registered vehicles. There are close to 300,000 now -- 
and Seepersad-Bachan said she hoped they'll continue filling up at 
National Petroleum stations and Quik Shoppes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NP stations must be able to get on a commercial footing,''  
she said. ``You cannot accomplish this in a company that is a 
monopoly and demonstrates monopolistic behavior.''

<HEADLINE> Edwards' Little Bro Has Big Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Terrence Edwards didn't seem all that  
surprised when his first college game turned out to be one of the 
greatest performances for a Georgia receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did anyone else, for that matter.  
</P>
<P>
	Before ever playing a game, Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan already  
was comparing his super freshman to former Florida great Jacquez 
Green. Edwards' teammates have gotten a firsthand look at his 
unique combination of speed and strength in practice. And Edwards 
has long set his sights on following the path set by his older 
brother, Robert. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been pressure my whole life with Robert as my big  
brother,'' the younger Edwards said. ``It's a little bothersome, 
but not so much that it makes me drop a pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With big brother looking on Saturday night, Edwards made an  
electrifying debut, catching 10 passes for 196 yards and two long 
touchdowns as No. 12 Georgia rolled over Utah State 38-7 in the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Edwards, the former Georgia running back who had a superb  
rookie season with the Patriots, sustained a career-threatening 
knee injury in February while playing flag football. He bought a 
home in Athens a few months ago and is doing his rehabilitation on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was injured was so he could be sent here to watch  
over me,'' Terrence Edwards said. ``He was giving me tips as the 
game was going on. I'm blessed to have a big brother watching over 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs are blessed to have a receiver like Edwards, who  
stepped right in when expected starter Michael Greer was held out 
of the game because of lingering headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing close to having Robert Edwards out there,''  
Donnan said, ``is having his brother out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terrence was supposed to play at Georgia last year, but didn't  
receive a qualifying score on his college entrance exam soon enough 
to enroll for fall semester. He entered school in January, playing 
on the basketball team and looking forward to getting back on the 
gridiron. 
</P>
<P>
	``To look up and see 80,000 people in the stands, there's  
nothing like this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A season ago, while Edwards awaited his chance, Champ Bailey  
became a two-way star for the Bulldogs, filling a hole at receiver 
while remaining one of the best defensive backs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bailey gave up his final year of eligibility to enter the  
NFL draft, and the Bulldogs were once again looking for a big-play 
threat. It took only one game to find one. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom always tells me that everything happens for a reason,''  
Edwards said. ``By sitting out, it gave Champ a year to shine. Now 
it's my year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards caught touchdown passes of 47 and 53 yards, finishing  
just two yards shy of the school receiving record of 198 yards held 
by Lamar Davis since 1942. The 10 receptions also were the 
second-most in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	His final reception came with over six minutes remaining, but he  
didn't get a chance to break the yardage record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about records as much as most people,'' Donnan  
said. ``In a game like that, it would have been ridiculous to throw 
him another pass just to break a record. Besides, I'm sure he'll 
break that record pretty soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Quincy Carter got his Heisman Trophy campaign off to a  
good start by throwing for 320 yards and two touchdowns and running 
for 58 yards and another score. 
</P>
<P>
	But the night belonged to Edwards.  
</P>
<P>
	``We see him do this in practice every day,'' said fellow  
receiver and roommate Thad Parker, whose six-catch, 99-yard 
performance was hardly noticed. ``He has good hands, good feet and 
he's very quick. What he did is not surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only slipup by Edwards was a fumble at the Utah State 10  
after hauling in a 29-yard pass on the second play of the fourth 
quarter. Hardly sounding like a freshman, he didn't let that play 
bother him for long. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a minute I was angry about it,'' Edwards said. ``Then it  
was time to go on to the next play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't know if he'll remain a starter for next Saturday's  
Southeastern Conference opener against South Carolina. Donnan 
wavered on the question, noting that four receivers usually get 
extensive playing time in his offensive system, and Edwards doesn't 
seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the coach,'' he said. ``If I start, good. If not,  
that's OK. As long as I'm able to play some and help the team.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Americans Work Longest Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Americans work the longest hours in the  
industrialized world, overtaking the Japanese, according to a 
United Nations study released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. lead in productivity is being whittled away by  
their European and Japanese rivals, who are working less while 
Americans stay on the job more, said the report by the 
International Labor Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-working Americans run a risk of burning out, said the ILO's  
Lawrence Jeff Johnson, co-author of the 600-page ``Key Indicators 
of the Labor Market'' report. The report was based on figures 
covering the years 1980-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, U.S. workers clocked up 1,966 hours at work in the  
most recent year, the ILO study said. In 1980, the average was 
1,883 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese were their nearest rivals. They worked an average  
1,889 hours in the most recent year measured there, 1995, but have 
been spending less and less time on the job since clocking up more 
than 2,100 hours in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, the first such comparison made by the ILO, found that  
U.S. workers first surpassed the Japanese in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. labor productivity surged 20 percent from 1980 to  
1996, Japan moved ahead by 38 percent, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the benefits of hard work are clear, it is not at all  
clear that working more is the same thing as working better,'' ILO 
Director-General Juan Somavia noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Europe also saw a significant fall in hours worked, the  
report said, with Norway producing the shortest hours among the 
industrial nations studied -- 1,399 hours, according to latest 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	French and German workers labored for 1,656 and 1,574 hours  
respectively in 1997. In 1980, they worked 1,809 hours and 1,742 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But that trend toward less work was accompanied by a faster  
increase in productivity than in the United States. France 
progressed by 30 percent and Germany by 31 percent, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an American myself, working long hours is part of the  
culture,'' Johnson said. ``Whether it's correct, whether it's 
value-added, in the long haul, who knows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People do burn out,'' he said. ``If they keep working this  
hard for these long hours there is burnout and there is diminishing 
returns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the report noted ``very little productivity  
improvement'' in Latin America over the past two decades, while 
working hours -- between 1,800 and 2,000 hours annually -- fell only 
slightly.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Don't Have Primeau Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARY, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Hurricanes will start training  
camp without Keith Primeau as the two parties remain in a stalemate 
over a new contract for the team's captain. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-star center was a no-show Sunday morning as players went  
through physicals and fitness tests, then boarded a plane for 
training camp in Fort Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have been at odds over a new contract since  
Primeau became a restricted free agent July 1. Carolina has offered 
the 6-foot-5, 220-pound center about $4 million a season -- double 
his 1998-99 salary -- while Primeau and agent Don Reynolds are 
asking for at least $5 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been little movement between the sides during the last  
two months leading up to the start of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, coach Paul Maurice and players from the defending  
Southeast Division champs will sit and wait patiently for Primeau's 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly he's a fine player and we would love to have him in  
our lineup and I'm sure he would love to be there, but our focus in 
camp is the team game,'' Maurice said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice said he won't address Primeau's situation with the 42  
players invited to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be discussed openly at camp,'' Maurice said. ``It's  
really not that big a deal because it is happening all over the 
league. It becomes a bigger deal as we approach the first game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Rutherford added last week that there will  
be no comment on Primeau once camp begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to move forward as if that player is not with  
us,'' Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being the team's captain, Primeau led the  
Hurricanes in goals (30) and points (62) last season. He also led 
the team with nine power-play goals and his size makes him a 
physical presence on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it's in the back of your mind,'' defenseman Glen  
Wesley said of Primeau. ``Let's not forget, he's a big part of our 
team. He plays in every different situation that we have on the 
ice, special teams or even strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice and Rutherford made it clear neither is worried about a  
lack of leadership with Primeau out of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the leadership we have on this team, in my mind, we have  
about four or five captains, or certainly guys who are capable of 
being captains,'' Rutherford said. ``They will step up their 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One such player is probable future Hall of Famer Ron Francis,  
one of the team's assistant captains. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't really worry about things you can't control,''  
Francis said of Primeau's situation. ``You have to maintain your 
focus on the task at hand -- anything outside of your ability to 
control -- just let it go. It shouldn't be a distraction or an 
excuse. Anybody can sit there and make excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes hope Primeau's contract squabble doesn't filter  
into the start of the season, when the team begins with nine 
straight road games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it doesn't get resolved it's going to be an issue at some  
point because you can only have so much patience as a general 
manager and as players,'' Wesley said. ``We're going to be going on 
the road for nine straight games and it would be nice to have a 
full lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau remained in Canada all summer and away from the  
negotiations. However, Wesley said he talked to Primeau on the 
telephone a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him how he was doing and he just said he was patiently  
waiting and hoping both sides could get it worked out,'' Wesley 
said. ``He didn't say (he was optimistic) but that can change with 
one phone call.''

<HEADLINE>  Holtz Says He Needs More Intensity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz thinks it might be time for him  
to get intense. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's first effort to revive last year's 1-10 South Carolina  
Gamecocks ended Saturday night with a 10-0 loss at No. 24 N.C State 
amid heavy rain and wind from Tropical Storm Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've been as intense as I used to be, and I  
think maybe I need to be,'' he said, pondering his attitude toward 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, then the Gamecocks' offense is in for a wakeup call.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not very good on offense. We played pretty well on  
defense,'' he said in a quick team evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Holtz's first game as coach since taking a two-year  
hiatus after heading Notre Dame's program for 11 years and 
producing a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina held N.C. State to just six first downs and 96  
yards of offense. However, the offense was less than stellar, 
losing four of eight fumbles, while unable to capitalize on good 
field position. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina's seventh fumble seemed to end one of its best  
chances. Trailing 3-0 at the beginning of the second half, Derek 
Watson had a 46-yard gain but coughed up the ball at the Wolfpacks' 
11-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain beating down, we couldn't protect the passer, we  
couldn't get open, we couldn't sustain anything on the ground. And 
penalties hurt us,'' Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fumbled the ball, turned it over, couldn't do well under  
goal line, couldn't control the line of scrimmage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as is Holtz's way, he didn't make the rain an excuse. ``It  
was wet on both sides of the field,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was disappointing, he said, but he wasn't surprised by  
the miscues and was quick to add the team will improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way it's been since I've been here. ... It will  
even out over the long run. There's no doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina fans who sat through the rain seemed willing to  
be patient and give Holtz time to turn the team around. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year will be an improvement just because the players will  
be coached better,'' South Carolina alumnus Matt Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore linebacker Kenny Harney said he likes what he's seen  
so far of Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, so good. I haven't really had any negative things. ...  
He knows his stuff,'' Harney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz was hired as South Carolina coach in December after Brad  
Scott was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's coaching career goes back to 1969 when he started at  
William &AMP; Mary. He then went to N.C. State, the New York Jets for 
one season, Arkansas, Minnesota and Notre Dame. At Minnesota, he 
also took over a 1-10 team after the 1983 season.

<HEADLINE> States Spruce Up Capitol Domes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Steel scaffolding rises along the granite  
walls of Maine's 167-year-old Statehouse. Yellow tubes snake up 
four stories, draining demolition debris from the gutted interior. 
</P>
<P>
	Just beyond the fences surrounding the construction zone,  
trailers line up like military barracks to offer temporary work 
space for displaced legislative staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	This scene, in Maine's Capitol Complex, appears in dozens of  
state capitals, where roughly $1 billion has been committed or 
already spent to re-gild golden domes, restore lawmaking chambers 
to earlier glory and make aging structures safe again for visitors 
and workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfort, saplings sprouted in cracks in the terra cotta of  
Kentucky's long-neglected capitol dome, prompting a $1.8 million 
patch-up. But state officials say $100 million is needed to bring 
the building up to code. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana is spending $4.5 million to repair the Capitol's  
crumbling sandstone exterior and leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really comes out of this project is the saving of a  
building that was on the verge of having to be shut down,'' says 
Mike Cooney, Montana's secretary of state who chairs the Capitol 
Restoration Commission. ``There were parts of this building that 
were beginning to become very unsafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin imported a German team to restore prized glass-tile  
murals as part of a decade of renovation. The cost so far? $75 
million.

<P>
	These projects have brought some surprises, as in North  
Carolina, where workers peeling away layers of paint in the Capitol 
galleries found rats' nests filled with tobacco wrappers from the 
1840s. ``It was trash then, but now they are artifacts,'' says 
Andrea Bogart, the building's programs officer. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, workers found two skylights that had been  
painted over and ornate marble floors under old carpeting in 
Columbia's 150-year-old Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, contractors stripped the outer shell of the  
tarnished dome in Trenton, shipped it to Alabama for repairs and 
recoated it with thousands of small squares of 23.5-karat gold leaf 
imported from Italy. The new covering is expected to keep the dome 
gleaming for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa has nearly completed regilding the nation's only five-domed  
capitol, a process that cost $80,000 three decades ago. West 
Virginians are still looking for estimates to replace the Capitol 
dome's 24-karat gold, which has become badly discolored since it 
was applied 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the states are in the midst of renovating their  
capitols, governors' mansions or state office buildings. Several 
others have completed major restorations. Ohio spent $121 million 
and Texas $187 million in a 7-year effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of ongoing projects across the country and those just  
completed this summer is in the $1 billion range. Most of the money 
is coming from bonds, supplemented with a mix of legislative 
appropriations and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey schoolchildren raised $48,000 with ``Dimes for the  
Dome,'' and North Dakota businesses chipped in much of the $200,000 
needed to refurbish the governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states seized fat budget surpluses to finance their  
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lawrence, president of Maine's senate, cites low interest  
rates -- cheap borrowing -- as a factor in deciding on a $50 million 
upgrade of state facilities. But other forces are also prompting 
states to fix up their most prized buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are beginning to focus on how we preserve their  
historical landmarks,'' said Lawrence, who heads the Legislative 
Council that is overseeing the Statehouse work. ``It's like a 
family. During good economic times, they fix the roof. They make 
sure the house is in shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Architect Nancy Stark succinctly assesses why Minnesota is  
spending $60 million to renovate its Capitol as it approaches the 
century mark.

<P>
	``It needs to be done,'' she says. ``It can't be maintained  
efficiently. The parts and pieces are beginning to fall out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster, it made more sense to float $400  
million in bonds to renovate and expand the Capitol Complex in 
Baton Rouge than to pay more rent for offices around the city. 
That, he says, saves $290 million over 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year project means demolishing old state offices and  
building new ones with parking garages. The 34-story Capitol 
itself, which was completed in 1932 and built mostly with federal 
funds gathered by then-Sen. Huey Long, has been updated over the 
years and is not included in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states, such as Maryland, say extra cash in their tills has  
nothing to do with the timing of their projects. A $114 million 
renovation has been proposed for Washington's overcrowded, leaky 
Capitol in Olympia. But a roughly $1 billion surplus is off-limits 
and may have to be returned to taxpayers under a proposed 
initiative going before voters in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Major projects are also planned for states prone to earthquakes.  
After the 2002 Winter Olympics, Utah may spend $300 million in Salt 
Lake City. South Carolina, located on a fault, has already 
installed a $13 million suspension system to help its 150-year-old 
Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southwest, New Mexico will create more office space for  
legislators in Santa Fe. The state paid $34 million for a major 
renovation in 1992. This project, due to be completed in January, 
will cost $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``A senator or representative ought to have a private space to  
sit down with constituents,'' says Sen. Bill McKibben, R-Hobbs. 
``The lowliest clerk in the Highway Department has a desk and some 
space to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, in Arizona's copper-domed Old Capitol, now a museum, is  
getting its roof fixed, new sprinklers and new air conditioning in 
time for its centennial in 2001.

	Upgrades are piecemeal in states such as Colorado, New York,  
Pennsylvania and Rhode Island -- a tiny state with the world's 
fourth-largest self-supporting dome on its Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states have been forced to upgrade to accommodate the  
physically disabled. Massachusetts did this last year, after its 
Statehouse was rehabbed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mistakes prompted action in Nebraska. In the 1970s, sandblasters  
removed a layer of stone from the home of the nation's only 
unicameral legislature, allowing water to penetrate and algae to 
bloom. The repair bill is expected to be $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma's $1.1 million House renovation caused a problem when  
Gov. Frank Keating called a special legislative session this 
summer. Senators and the 101 representatives took turns using the 
48-desk Senate chamber. Folding chairs were brought in to handle 
the overflow. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore is in temporary quarters until  
October. The governor's mansion is undergoing a $5 million 
renovation. TV crews are capturing the day-to-day for a program on 
home improvements.

<HEADLINE> Robosubs Could Speed Searches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Underwater ROVs -- remotely  
operated vehicles -- that found John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane and 
wreckage from the TWA and Swissair crashes may be replaced by robot 
submarines in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy and civilian researchers are developing small, low-cost  
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, or AUVs, that could be deployed in 
greater numbers to search larger areas of ocean bottom and do it 
faster than ROVs. They also could be used to hunt for mines, map 
oceans and other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	ROVs must be tethered to ships, which supply power and human  
control. The new robosubs would operate with their own battery 
power and get their guidance from onboard computers and sensing 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once it leaves the dock, there's no more interaction,'' said  
Daryl Davidson, executive director of the Association for Unmanned 
Vehicle Systems International, a trade group based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to use the JFK scenario, instead of having a  
couple ships that are towing ROVs or towing sonars, you could have 
one ship that could dump numerous autonomous underwater systems, 
and they could each kind of track their own preprogrammed 
missions,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aircraft even could drop the small subs by parachute, said Tom  
Curtin, program manager for the Office of Naval Research in 
Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could get them out there very quickly. You don't have to  
wait for a ship coming from Florida three days away,'' Curtin said. 
``They'll work in all weather. They'll work at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy is primarily interested in AUVs to hunt for sea mines  
and obstacles. The autonomous subs could do the job while sailors 
and Marines stay out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
	A mine-hunting AUV is expected to join the fleet in three to  
five years, said Barry Dillon, chief of science and technology for 
the Navy's Coastal Systems Station near Panama City Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	It would ride near the surface with an antenna sticking out of  
the water to transmit real-time data from sonar devices and 
electro-optics that would plumb the depths with sound waves and 
laser light. These sensors also are a significant advancement and 
got their first real-world test last year in the Swissair search in 
Canadian waters aboard a platform towed behind a ship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a violent accident they needed something with  
better resolution that can go deeper,'' Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first operational AUV would find mines so they could be  
neutralized by existing weapons, but the Navy also is working on a 
version that could do that job itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if you are going to neutralize, you might lose the  
vehicle, so you want to be able to build it cheap enough that you 
can afford to do that,'' Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potential tasks include finding shipwrecks, surveillance,  
intelligence collection and harbor security as well as ocean 
mapping and exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spend a lot of time going to outer space,'' Dillon said.  
``But the ocean is probably less understood. These type of systems 
are going to open up that world for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AUV technology, however, is in its infancy.  
</P>
<P>
	To generate new ideas and create a talent pool of potential  
researchers, the Navy and Davidson's association sponsored the 
second annual International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle 
Competition on Aug. 8 at the Coastal Systems Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Five teams of college students participated. The Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology repeated as champion with its sleek, black 
Orca. The University of Florida's boxy orange and blue SubjuGator 
was second, followed by entries from Florida Atlantic University, 
the U.S. Naval Academy and Stevens Institute of Technology of 
Hoboken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement of hands-on learning matched the thrill of  
victory for MIT graduate student Ara Knaian, of Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can go ahead and build all the circuits and boxes you want  
and that can be very exciting if you are of a certain persuasion,'' 
the electrical engineering major said. ``But it's a lot of fun to 
go and build things that actually cause motion to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most innovative design was Florida Atlantic's SQUID,  
short for Submersible Quiet Underwater Intelligent Driver. It looks 
like a small artillery shell and weighs a little over 20 pounds, 
about a tenth as much as other entries. 
</P>
<P>
	SQUID has no propeller, fins or rudders, using a vectored  
thruster to steer as well as propel the tiny sub. Similar devices 
are being used to give fighter planes greater maneuverability by 
changing the direction of their engine exhaust nozzles. 
</P>
<P>
	What really sets AUVs apart, however, is the computer software  
that makes them true robots, freeing them from the constraints of 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you break that tether,'' said Navy researcher Curtin,  
``it's not just a little step.''

<HEADLINE> States Spruce Up Capitol Domes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Steel scaffolding rises along the granite  
walls of Maine's 167-year-old Statehouse. Yellow tubes snake up 
four stories, draining demolition debris from the gutted interior. 
</P>
<P>
	Just beyond the fences surrounding the construction zone,  
trailers line up like military barracks to offer temporary work 
space for displaced legislative staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	This scene, in Maine's Capitol Complex, appears in dozens of  
state capitals, where roughly $1 billion has been committed or 
already spent to re-gild golden domes, restore lawmaking chambers 
to earlier glory and make aging structures safe again for visitors 
and workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfort, saplings sprouted in cracks in the terra cotta of  
Kentucky's long-neglected capitol dome, prompting a $1.8 million 
patch-up. But state officials say $100 million is needed to bring 
the building up to code. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana is spending $4.5 million to repair the Capitol's  
crumbling sandstone exterior and leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really comes out of this project is the saving of a  
building that was on the verge of having to be shut down,'' says 
Mike Cooney, Montana's secretary of state who chairs the Capitol 
Restoration Commission. ``There were parts of this building that 
were beginning to become very unsafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin imported a German team to restore prized glass-tile  
murals as part of a decade of renovation. The cost so far? $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	These projects have brought some surprises, as in North  
Carolina, where workers peeling away layers of paint in the Capitol 
galleries found rats' nests filled with tobacco wrappers from the

<HEADLINE> Food Can't Hold Medvedev Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andrei Medvedev never has done well with the  
cuisine at the U.S. Open. On Monday, his tennis menu includes one 
of the tournament's remaining favorites, old pal Yevgeny 
Kafelnikov. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Medvedev who decided in 1993 that food services at the  
National Tennis Center was supplying poisoned pasta to the players. 
His stomach was doing flip-flops again Saturday during a 3-6, 6-3, 
3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Lleyton Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, he was blaming himself, not the chef at the  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens when you don't watch what you eat,'' he said.  
``That was my case. I paid the price, almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev decided the culprit was an energy bar he gulped down  
before playing Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it gave me less energy than it was supposed to,'' he  
said. ``Believe me, I will not take it for my next match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be against third-seeded Kafelnikov, who advanced  
Saturday with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Jonas Bjorkman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can play him with my eyes closed,'' Medvedev said. ``He can  
do the same. We practice every day here. We know where we are 
hitting the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has won their last two meetings after Medvedev won  
five of the first six. 
</P>
<P>
	They often spice their matches with friendly wagers. They can be  
playing for $50,000 in prize money but the bets for pocket change 
are more motivating. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we put $20 before the match on the side, the match will be  
more interesting,'' Medvedev explained. ``I still have his money in 
the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have bets every day, every single day. Sometimes I win,  
sometimes he wins. At the moment, I've got his money. The next 
week, it can turn around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev is looking forward to Monday's match. He even knows who  
will win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is who is hitting the ball better and whose hand is not  
shaking when you are going for the passing shot or the winner,'' he 
said. ``The one who is better prepared for that day will win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Medvedev probably will pass on most of the  
all-day, all-night items available in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that I love this city,'' he said. ``You can do  
anything 24 hours a day. You have a 1-800 number for every need you 
need. Everything is toll-free, fat-free. It's the best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a feeling you can be walking naked on the street and  
still nobody will look at you. You can drive a super modern tank, 
shooting left and right, and people wouldn't pay attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev is fascinated by the bustle of the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``You walk out on the street, just down from my apartment, I'm  
in the middle of everything,'' he said. ``You get straight into 
life. If you don't watch your head, the people will take you with 
the way they move. They will force you in the direction they're 
moving. It's great 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 11 p.m. in Central Park, you will see thousands of  
people running, jogging. Maybe they don't like to stay home. I 
don't know. Maybe they have problems with their girlfriends or 
boyfriends, and they like to run. I don't have this problem. I stay 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend at the moment is Anke Huber, who defeated No. 15  
Amelie Mauresmo 6-4, 6-4 Sunday to reach the quarterfinals of the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Would they be getting married soon? Medvedev, who turned 25 last  
week, seemed astounded at the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Married? No,'' he said. ``Too young. I win a couple of rounds  
and you think I should get married. Really, come on. I've won a 
couple of rounds before and I never got married, so why should I 
now?''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Financier's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- U.S. authorities prepared an extradition  
request to return fugitive money manager Martin Frankel to 
Connecticut to face charges of embezzling millions of dollars, a 
U.S. official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frankel -- who was nabbed this weekend in a luxurious  
waterfront hotel in Germany -- could be in Germany for months before 
he is returned, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Anne Chermak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's Saturday arrest brought an anticlimactic end to a  
four-month international manhunt. Using a duplicate key, U.S. and 
German authorities entered his room and found him inside. The 
44-year-old Frankel, who is accused of taking hundreds of millions 
of dollars -- some estimates say billions -- from insurance companies 
and other victims, offered no resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got me,'' Frankel said as the FBI and German police  
arrested him, FBI Special Agent Michael Wolf said in Greenwich, 
Conn., where Frankel lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very unspectacular,'' Hamburg police spokesman  
Hans-Juergen Petersen said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why Frankel had come to Germany, or  
how long he had been hiding out in the lavish Prem hotel on the 
banks of the Alster River in the heart of this northern German 
port. 
</P>
<P>
	But it appeared he was planning on an extended period abroad.  
</P>
<P>
	``A number of passports were found with Frankel,'' Petersen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also seized an unspecified sum of cash, diamonds and  
a computer, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said a tip led authorities to Frankel. He did not  
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was accompanied by a young woman, identified by the FBI  
in Connecticut as Cynthia Allison, 35. The bureau did not elaborate 
on her relationship to Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	German authorities said the woman was taken into custody but was  
later released. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was being held in investigative custody at Hamburg's  
Holstenglacis jail, a tough holding pen filled mainly with 
suspected drug dealers and junkies. He was expected to be brought 
before a judge for arraignment on Monday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chermak said an extradition request was ``in process'' in  
Washington, but it could take months to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the United States issued an arrest warrant for  
Frankel on July 14. He has been missing since May 5, when a fire 
alarm alerted firefighters to an emergency at his mansion in 
Greenwich. They found a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces 
stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance company regulators said Frankel's unlicensed brokerage  
-- apparently run out of the $3 million Greenwich mansion -- had 
siphoned huge sums of money from several insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel stole at least $218 million from the  
insurers, but a lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the 
loss at $915 million. Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from 
the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was 
established by Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel allegedly controlled Thunor Trust, set up in 1991 by  
businessman John Hackney to buy small, struggling insurance 
companies. Through his lawyer, Hackney has denied any wrongdoing 
and said he also was a victim of Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies believed their policyholder money was  
being invested through Frankel's brokerage firm, Liberty National 
Securities. But apparently, no trades were ever made. Instead, 
prosecutors say, Frankel stole the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel may have been financing his run with more than $10  
million in diamonds and gold he bought before disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials have said Frankel used several aliases  
after being barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1992, including David Rosse, the name of his personal 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has been described by some investors as the Hugh Hefner  
of high finance, keeping a live-in retinue of young women he met 
through personal ads. Frankel said some were ``ex-girlfriends.'' At 
least some of the women performed office work at his unlicensed 
securities brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors described Frankel as neurotic, but said he offered an  
impressive biography and dedication, and that charmed them into 
trusting him with their money.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Gore, Bradley in Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore are  
running neck and neck in New Hampshire in the race for the 
Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Boston 
Globe/WBZ-TV poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that many voters in the first-primary state  
are eager for political change despite the economically prosperous 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 400 likely Democratic primary voters, Gore led Bradley,  
the former New Jersey senator, by 40 percent to 36 percent, the 
Globe reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush held a solid  
lead over his GOP rivals, winning the support of 44 percent of 
those surveyed. Trailing was Elizabeth Dole, former transportation 
secretary and Red Cross director, with 14 percent, and Sen. John 
McCain, an Arizona senator, with 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, who spent millions of dollars from his personal  
fortune to pay for television advertisements, was in fourth place 
with 7 percent, while commentator Patrick J. Buchanan and former 
Vice President Dan Quayle each had 4 percent, and a former Reagan 
aide, Gary Bauer, had 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk show host Alan Keyes was inadvertently left out of the  
Globe-WBZ-TV poll, but according to a Franklin Pierce poll last 
week, his support is about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic primary race really appears to be a race that  
could go either way,'' said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC 
Communications Research, which conducted the survey of 800 likely 
voters for the Globe and WBZ-TV from Aug. 27 to 31. ``Gore has an 
unfavorable rating that is higher than one would expect. It is 
partly due to the fact that people simply want a change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The primary is five months away.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore was popular among a wide range of likely Democratic primary  
voters, about 65 percent of them rating him favorably or very 
favorably. But he was viewed unfavorably by 19 percent of 
Democrats, and by 32 percent by the key constituency of 
independents who say they plan on voting in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley drew a favorable rating of 66 percent. Only 11 percent  
of Democrats and none of the independent voters surveyed rated him 
unfavorably. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurting Gore was his strong support for President Clinton  
throughout the impeachment scandal and questions about allegations 
of his role in aggressive campaign fund-raising tactics of the 1996 
Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Democratic primary voters indicated they were restless  
with the present political leadership. The poll found 21 percent of 
Democrats saying they wanted to keep current government officials, 
while 39 percent said it was time for a change.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gifts to IOC Not Stated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic organizers' first report to the  
U.S. House Commerce Committee left out a few gifts offered to 
International Olympic Committee members during the bid process, 
such as 50 used MARTA buses. 
</P>
<P>
	The buses offered to Olympic committee member Ivan Dibos, a city  
councilman in Lima, Peru, never actually were presented to the 
Peruvian capital. But the offer came the night before Dibos was to 
cast his vote for the host of the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer is documented in materials contained in three dozen  
boxes which federal investigators are currently poring through, The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was among a number of expensive gifts that went unreported in  
the bid committee's June report to federal authorities. The gifts -- 
such as college assistance, jobs and excursions to Atlanta with 
side visits to Disney World and Augusta National Golf Club -- are 
now being included in a report lawyers for the Atlanta bid 
committee are in the process of preparing, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a spokesman for Atlanta's bid committee, said the  
June report was an initial attempt to answer the government's 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did the best job we could,'' he said. ``Now, given more  
time for a complete review, we believe that our supplemental report 
will do the job thoroughly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King &AMP; Spalding, the law firm representing Atlanta's Olympic bid  
committee, allowed the newspaper to look at 29 of the 36 boxes that 
have been turned over to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,500 boxes of records pertaining to the 1996 games have  
been released to the public. However, the 36 boxes currently being 
reviewed by federal authorities have not. 
</P>
<P>
	During the newspaper's review of the 29 unreleased boxes last  
week, it discovered thousands of letters, memos, invoices and 
canceled checks. 
</P>
<P>
	In its initial report, the Atlanta bid committee admitted to  
giving out 38 gifts that exceeded the IOC's $200 limit. Those gifts 
included a $318 set of surgical instruments for the IOC member from 
Cameroon and an $875 English bulldog for the member from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The new records, however, show that those 38 gifts weren't the  
only ones in excess of the IOC's limit, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shopping sprees in Atlanta netted a $222 Chanel scarf for one of  
the two wives of the Swaziland voter and a $265 camera for the 
Algerian voter. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest documents show that the Atlanta bid committee  
circumvented the limit by buying numerous gifts each within the 
allowable range during shopping sprees at malls, the paper 
reported.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalist Seek Ocean Ranch / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YARMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- A Cape Cod environmentalist is trying to  
promote his plan for a so-called ``ocean ranch,'' a $30 million 
proposal that weds wind power and aquaculture to create sustainable 
energy and a food source. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan by Conservation Consortium Foundation director Brian  
Braginton-Smith involves building an ocean platform where ocean 
ranchers would generate electricity for 10,000 users with 250 foot 
high wind towers, while raising fish in giant pens. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is in the early stages of development, and would likely  
face heavy opposition from neighbors objecting to unsightly wind 
towers, and the waste created by fish farms. 
</P>
<P>
	But Braginton-Smith said now is the time to start building an  
ocean ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do this, 20 years from now our kids are going to  
be suffering from higher and higher costs for imported energy and 
imported seafood,'' Braginton-Smith told The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Braginton-Smith met last week with James Baker, administrator of  
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency that 
supports offshore aquaculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes at a time when fishermen are hurting from  
tougher fishing restrictions designed to boost dwindling stocks. 
The plan is also in line with the Clinton administration's goal of 
encouraging nonpolluting energy sources. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Area farmers are shipping about 500 tons of  
hay to their counterparts on the East Coast whose farms have been 
decimated by some of the worst droughts on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipping the hay out of Wisconsin helps state farmers who have  
struggled to find room for this year's record crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a good hay year, and prices are depressed, so a lot  
say they might as well donate it,'' Dane County Extension Agent Jim 
Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer  
Protection and officials from other states organized the relief 
effort through the University of Wisconsin-Extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the hay will be directed to farmers in hard-hit parts of  
Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island. States accepting 
the donated hay will provide the trucks to transport it. 
</P>
<P>
	The haylift will begin Sept. 25, Gov. Tommy Thompson said in a  
written statement.

<HEADLINE> White Sox-Rangers Rained Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Jeff Fassero's debut as a starter for  
the Texas Rangers will have to wait a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassero, trying to work his way into the Texas rotation, had his  
first start for the Rangers postponed by rain on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been looking forward to it, so it doesn't matter if it's  
put back another day,'' Fassero said. ``You can't control the 
weather. I just want to get things going in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night's first pitch was delayed for 1 hour, 58 minutes  
before the game was called. It will be made up Monday as part as 
part of a twi-night doubleheader beginning at 5:05 p.m CDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainstorms hit the drought-stricken area Sunday afternoon and  
with steady rain forecast through the night, the umpires called the 
game at 9:03 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Helling (12-7) will start the first game for Texas against  
Jim Parque (9-11). Chicago will send John Snyder (9-10) against 
Fassero (4-14) in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has not had a left-hander in its rotation. The Rangers  
acquired Fassero from the Seattle Mariners on Aug. 27 for a player 
to be named later as a possible answer to that void. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers would like to at least consider having a left-handed  
starter for the playoffs, especially if they meet the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassero has a 7.60 ERA and hasn't won since July 5. He leads the  
league in earned runs allowed and his 14 losses are tied with 
Detroit's Brian Mohler for the most in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	In two relief appearances for the Rangers, Fassero has allowed  
five runs and seven hits in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been able to keep the ball down (in his two relief stints  
for the Rangers), so that's a good sign,'' Fassero said. ``Now I've 
got to get the groundballs to be hit at our fielders. I know we 
need a (left-handed) starter if we play the Yankees. I've got three 
or four starts to do well and then we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fassero has a career record of 91-83 with a 3.81 ERA and was  
Seattle's opening-day starter. But he opened the season 0-3 with a 
6.87 ERA in his first six starts before recording his first victory 
on May 5, and by mid-June he had been sent to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile on Sunday night, White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said  
the extra day might allow DH Frank Thomas to be back in the lineup. 
Thomas wasn't in Manuel's Sunday night lineup with tendinitis in 
his right ankle, and he also missed Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the rainout) is part of the game,'' Manuel said. ``It will  
give us an extra day for Frank.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The White Sox are 5-3 against the Rangers this season.  
Texas is 25-11 against the rest of the AL Central. ... Chicago has 
had four doubleheaders this season, winning five games. ... The 
White Sox swept the Rangers on Aug. 13 in Chicago. ... Texas has 
lost four of its last six; Chicago has dropped five of six.

	Car Blasts Kill Three in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	TIBERIAS, Israel (AP) -- Car explosions in the northern Israeli  
cities of Tiberias and Haifa killed three people today, hours after 
a signing ceremony for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. The 
land-for-security pact hinges on the Palestinians agreeing to fight 
terror attacks. The bombings left a fourth person in critical 
condition. The explosions likely were aimed at halting the newly 
revived peace process, police said. The three dead were all inside 
the cars, officials said, suggesting those killed were the 
attackers. Police said the almost-simultaneous explosions in the 
two towns 60 miles apart indicated a coordinated attack.

	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people crammed  
aboard ferries and planes to flee East Timor today, as 
pro-Indonesian militias besieged a U.N. compound and set fire to 
homes belonging to people who support independence for the 
province. Casualty reports were impossible to verify, though 
witnesses said scores were killed in the former Portuguese colony. 
Staff at two hospitals said they had treated about a dozen patients 
for machete wounds.

a new offensive in southern Russia today, just hours after a bomb 
smashed a building housing Russian military families, leaving at 
least 30 dead and 110 injured. First Deputy Interior Minister 
Vladimir Kolesnikov said the bomb blast in the southern republic of 
Dagestan was directly linked to an incursion today by militants who 
crossed the border from Chechnya and seized four villages. An 
estimated 1,500 federal troops were sent to the Novolaksky region, 
located 40 miles northwest of Buinaksk, to counter the incursion.

Dennis turned its back today on North Carolina after pounding the 
coast for a week and finally coming ashore to flood lowland towns 
with half a foot of rain. The storm seemed to be drifting northwest 
toward southwestern Virginia amid a flurry of flash flood warnings 
and watches after spinning off a tornado last night in Hampton, 
Va., that injured more than a dozen people. Formed Aug. 24, Dennis

O'Connor, who became spiritual leader to 2.2 million Catholics in

presidential candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and businessman 
Steve Forbes, said that if they were in the White House they would 
fire Reno for her handling of Waco and other Justice Department 
matters. But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he saw a double 
standard in Republican attacks on Reno, long a target of GOP 
criticism, while no one is demanding the resignation of FBI 
director Louis Freeh, whose organization is at the center of the

<HEADLINE> Car Donations Draw IRS Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donating that old clunker to charity can mean  
a hefty tax deduction, but the Internal Revenue Service is warning 
people not to overvalue used cars and trucks -- and keep an eye out 
for scam artists. 
</P>
<P>
	With ads soliciting car contributions everywhere in newspapers,  
on radio and on the Internet, taxpayers should be aware of fake 
charity rip-offs and take care that for-profit car haulers aren't 
skimming most of the money in a charity's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to use common sense,'' said Marc Owens, who  
oversees regulation of tax-exempt organizations at the IRS. ``You 
need to ask yourself what the vehicle is really worth. If you're 
giving something to a charity, don't you want to know it is 
actually going to a charity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tax laws permit people to deduct the ``fair market value'' of a  
vehicle, but there's no conclusive way to determine what that is. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials say people should use auto Blue Books and other  
valuation guides as a starting point -- charities often advertise 
that the vehicles can be deducted to the ``full Blue Book'' price -- 
but should not claim full value unless the car is in perfect 
working order with low mileage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is, the charity implies that you'll be able to  
deduct the full Blue Book value, but that's a misstatement,'' said 
Alan Feld, a Boston University law professor who has written 
extensively on tax-exempt organizations. ``The charity is relying 
on that little bit of larceny in everybody's heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All sorts of vehicles are given away, from inoperable heaps  
worth a few dollars for the parts to a classic 1964 Corvette 
Stringray that fetched $17,500 at a recent auction held by Davis 
Memorial Goodwill Industries of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	No exact estimates are available on how many cars are donated  
each year, but experts say the number has grown leaps and bounds 
during the 1990s. The National Kidney Foundation, for example, 
accepted 56,000 vehicles in 1998 -- a 39 percent increase in 
``Kidney Cars'' over the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Reasons for the popularity are many: Charities are always  
searching for novel ways to raise money, and many people simply 
don't want the hassle of selling a car themselves or getting stuck 
with a low trade-in value when buying a new car or truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to make a donation and this is an easy way to do  
it,'' said Rusty Burwell, associate director of fund-raising at the 
American Lung Association. ``Maybe it has something to do with the 
fact that they just want to get rid of a car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid an IRS headache, taxpayers should document their  
donated vehicle's mileage, condition and features, including 
photographs, Owens said. IRS Form 8283 must be completed for a 
non-cash charitable deduction of more than $500, and above $5,000 
the form must be signed by someone who has independently appraised 
the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Donated vehicles are usually auctioned or sold to salvage yards,  
depending on their condition. Some sales are targeted at low-income 
people, such as a Goodwill Industries International ``Wheels to 
Work'' program aimed at former welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Big charities like the Lung Association and Goodwill contract  
with towing companies and auctioneers to handle the transactions 
for relatively modest fees, ensuring they get the lion's share of 
the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	But as vehicle contributions have risen, for-profit businesses  
have moved in to solicit the donations. Some offer donors a chance 
to earmark car proceeds for a favorite charity, while others 
represent smaller organizations that don't have the resources to 
run a program themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, these companies keep more than half the money, often  
under an agreement in which they pay the charity a flat fee for use 
of the name regardless of how many vehicles they accept and sell. 
In some cases, the charity winds up with only 1 or 2 percent of the 
total proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a lot of car programs, you don't know how the money is  
being spent,'' said Rick Frazier, consultant with Charity Motors 
Inc., a non-profit car donation firm in Detroit that guarantees 70 
percent of proceeds go to a contributor's chosen charity. ``We need 
to weed out the people who are in it just to make a quick buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is stepping up its scrutiny of these arrangements,  
alerting field offices earlier this year that a tax deduction only 
applies when the gift actually goes to a charity and not a 
for-profit business. All parties involved in a violation could be 
subject to a penalty of $1,000 per transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scams use fake charity names that sound legitimate.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this summer, California authorities convicted a  
Sacramento man of illegally raking in nearly $1 million by 
accepting donated cars and selling them with the promise that the 
money would go to a Foundation for Abused Children -- a charity that 
doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago in Michigan, then-Attorney General Frank Kelley  
ordered two California-based unlicensed charities -- they called 
themselves the National Cancer Association and National Lung 
Foundation -- to stop taking donated vehicles. The organizations 
offered to take the vehicles only if people sent a check for $200 
or gave a credit card number to pay towing costs.

<HEADLINE> Fire 2, MetroStars 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Lubos Kubik's goal in the 73rd  
minute Sunday lifted Chicago to a 2-1 victory over New York-New 
Jersey, sending the MetroStars to a Major League Soccer record 12th 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the third straight for the Fire. Despite playing  
without five starters, Chicago improved to 15-11 and moved into 
second place in the Western Conference with 43 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The misery continued for the 5-22 MetroStars, who have not won  
in regulation since May 15. Their last win was a shootout victory 
on June 30. They have won just two of their last 36 matches in 
regulation, are last in the league in goals scored (25), and lead 
in goals allowed (57). 
</P>
<P>
	Kubik tallied the game-winning goal when he took a backheel pass  
from Ante Razov at the top of the box, sidestepped defender Mark 
Semioli and rolled a shot to the right of MetroStars goalkeeper Tim 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Hurtado got the MetroStars on the scoreboard in the 60th  
minute, placing a shot between Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton and 
the right post after taking a cross from Mark Chung. The goal was 
Hurtado's fifth on the season and snapped a 1,294-minute scoreless 
streak for the MetroStars' scoring leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire tied the score nine minutes later when Dema Kovalenko  
volleyed in a long corner kick by Jerzy Podbrozny. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams had several good chances in the first half, which saw  
the MetroStars finish with an 8-7 edge in shots. 
</P>
<P>
	A header by Hurtado in the 37th minute was headed over the bar  
by Fire defender C.J. Brown. Then in the 44th minute, an apparent 
goal by Podbrozny was nullified by an offside call.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- In a thinly veiled attack on rival George  
W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore used the Labor Day weekend to rip 
Republicans for what he called ``paycheck deception'' designed to 
cut into the power of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Washington and elsewhere are pushing a proposal  
they call ``paycheck protection,'' which would require unions 
annually to seek authorization from individual workers to use dues 
for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore singled no one out by name, but his campaign distributed  
complaints by Texas labor leaders that that Bush, their state's 
governor, backs such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said they are ``designed to bust unions. It's probably the  
single most notorious union-busting proposal to come along in 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way out of the mainstream of the country,'' Gore told a  
Labor Day weekend rally. ``Most moderate Republicans have really 
stayed away from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also vowed to push for laws preventing striking workers  
from being replaced and demanded another increase in the minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always believed we need to close the loopholes that  
have allowed some of the union-busting tactics that began with the 
Reagan-Bush crowd,'' Gore told about 200 people at a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in Detroit, Gore was accompanied by AFL-CIO President  
John Sweeney as the vice president shared the message that labor 
and management need to share power. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the principle known as checks and balances,  
which has helped to guarantee our freedom in our Constitution, 
should also apply to the workplace,'' Gore told about 200 people 
attending an interfaith breakfast at the Central United Methodist 
Church. He drew cheers when he said he favors banning the practice 
of replacing striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also attended Mass at Sacred Heart Church in Detroit,  
saying ``when we look at locked-out workers and their families and 
the injustices that are perpetrated in workplaces throughout 
America, we are reminded that faith is the bedrock for so many of 
us in our understanding of the way things should be in our 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gore has supported abortion rights, his views did not  
prevent the congregation at this Roman Catholic church from 
welcoming his remarks with a standing ovation and frequent 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly disagree with the vice president on some  
things,'' said the Rev. Norman Thomas, pastor at Sacred Heart. 
``He's the vice president. The people in the parish are very proud 
to have him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's appearance prompted criticism from Republican  
presidential candidate Steve Forbes, who issued a statement calling 
the vice president ``the nation's number two defender of abortion 
on demand.''

<HEADLINE> Dad Charged in Killing Kid's Suitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APOPKA, Fla. (AP) -- A father enraged by his 13-year-old  
daughter's romance with a 10th-grade dropout fatally shot the boy 
as he tried to jump a fence on the family's lawn, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after midnight Saturday, 16-year-old Bernardo Barragan  
sneaked into Fabiola Gonzalez's yard and coaxed the girl outside to 
talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	He lived a few houses away and had just returned home for the  
holiday weekend. He and his father had been working on a 
construction crew in southern Florida, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabiola's father burst through the door, rifle in hand, and  
confronted the boy, said Orange County Sheriff's Office spokesman 
Angelo Nieves. Rhe two exchanged words, then Jose Carmen Gonzalez 
shot Bernardo in the chest and stomach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 44, turned himself in Sunday and was charged with  
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show the run-in wasn't the first. Bernardo was  
arrested June 29 on charges of trespassing at the Gonzalez home. 
And on July 26, a judge ordered the teen-ager to stay away from the 
girl's house.

<HEADLINE> Rams Coach To Receive Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams will seek counseling for  
offensive line coach Jim Hanifan, who was arrested on drunken 
driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It breaks my heart, and that's about all I can say,'' coach  
Dick Vermeil said Sunday. ``We are as an organization very 
disappointed in Jim's conduct. I have met with Jim and he is 
extremely distraught and emotionally down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan, 65, was stopped about 3 a.m. Saturday in St. Charles  
for a traffic violation. Hanifan took a breath test at the police 
station, was charged and then released. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan joined the Rams in 1997 after six years of coaching the  
offensive line of the Washington Redskins. He was head coach of the 
St. Louis Cardinals from 1980-85. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan has coached for five NFL teams, and won a Super Bowl  
ring as the offensive line coach with the Washington Redskins in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a member of our family, and I care for him a lot,''  
Vermeil said. ``I will seek the help I need to help Jim solve his 
problem, if there is a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Chad Hermansen To Join Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Chad Hermansen, Pittsburgh's top outfield  
prospect since Barry Bonds, will join the Pirates on Tuesday and 
will make his first major league start that night against the San 
Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have been waiting for Triple-A Nashville's playoff  
status to be determined before calling up Hermansen, who has 32 
homers despite sitting out nearly two weeks recently with 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville's regular season ends Monday and the 21-year-old  
Hermansen won't stay with the Sounds even if they qualify for the 
Pacific Coast League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to see him,'' Pirates manager Gene Lamont said.  
``A team like the Pirates, we have to use the minor league system. 
I want to see him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed hitting Hermansen will start Tuesday because  
San Diego will start left-hander Sterling Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have given him a day or two off, but with Hitchcock  
going, he'll definitely play Tuesday if he is here,'' Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Cam Bonifay, in Mexico over the weekend watching  
Pirates affiliate in Mexico City win the Mexican League playoffs, 
said Hermansen would join the Pirates as soon as Nashville's 
playoff fate is decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermansen won't start all of the Pirates' remaining 24 games  
after he arrives but will start regularly. The question is where. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermansen struggled defensively in the minors at shortstop and  
third base before finding a home in center field, where he has 
developed into an excellent defensive outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	But with center fielder Brian Giles enjoying a career year with  
a .307 average, 35 homers and 104 RBIs, Lamont has no plans to move 
him again. Giles began the year in left and later moved to right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have to show me he's a better defensive center  
fielder than Brian is,'' Lamont said. ``Right now, Brian is our 
best player, and I would be saying that even if Jason Kendall 
hadn't gotten hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has not played there regularly, Hermansen may get  
some of his starts in right field, where the Pirates have gotten 
little production offensively all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has played enough outfield that he should be comfortable  
wherever he is playing,'' Lamont said. ``The coaches and I talked 
about it, and I talked about it to Brian some ... and Brian is 
going to stay in center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hermansen may get some starts in center field when Giles rests,  
and also may start in left when the left-handed hitting Al Martin 
sits against left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermansen, who has 113 homers in 3 1/2 minor league seasons, has  
gotten the biggest buildup of any Pirates prospect since Bonds was 
called up in May 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot more talk now about minor leaguers than there  
used to be, there are newspapers devoted just to that and the fans 
talk about it a lot,'' Lamont said. ``It was totally different 
eight to 10 years ago, when only a few fans might know your minor 
leaguers. It's the system we live under now.''

<HEADLINE> Hart Eyes All American Futurity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- The evidence of jockey Kenny Hart's  
propensity for arriving late at the finish line of quarter horse 
racing's biggest race stretches over four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Hart has won more than 3,200 races and just  
about every major stakes race from California to Oklahoma. All 
except the All American Futurity, the quarter horse's version of 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	He's had plenty of chances. Sixteen since 1968. He'll try again  
Monday, possibly for the last time, when he goes to the post with 
the filly Familiar Faces to chase the $1 million first prize 
awarded to the winner of the 440-yard race that takes less than 20 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Four geldings and five fillies are in the field. Ten horses  
qualified in time trials Aug. 19, but Snappy Dragon chipped a bone 
in his left knee in winning his trial and has been scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	Familiar Faces is a longshot. The filly has had only three  
races, winning two. The favorites will be A Delightful Dasher, a 
gelding with earnings of more than $225,000 and the fastest time in 
the trials -- 21.523 seconds -- and Chicks Call Me, winner of all six 
of his races. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart has lost with both favorites and longshots in past All  
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad things and reasons for Hart's losing streak date back to  
his first ride in the All American -- a 20-year-old jockey aboard 
Quincy Rocket in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Quincy Rocket was in the No. 1 post position in the straightaway  
race. When the gates opened, Quincy Rocket hesitated, and by the 
time Hart got him out of the gate, the rest of the field was 50 
yards down the track. Quincy Rocket finished last. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's next ride in the All American was in 1977 and this time  
he had the 2-1 favorite, Town Policy. The gelding would go on to 
have a brilliant career, but on that day, heavy rainfall had left 
the Ruidoso Downs track muddy, especially near the rail, where Town 
Policy was sitting in the No. 2 post. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a drying out track, I had the two hole and it (the  
track) was terrible,'' Hart said. ``When I got to the old paddock, 
I was a length and a half in front and 110 yards left. I end up 
getting beat by a length and a half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The horse that beat Town Policy was Hot Idea, a filly, who broke  
from the No. 9 post and ran down the outside of the straightaway, 
where the track wasn't as muddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see she was kicking up dirt in the lane she ran  
in,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Hart finished second again, this time on a horse called  
Digging For Gold, beaten a half-length by Mr Trucka Jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stumbled bad leaving the gate, but he got up and made a big  
run,'' Hart said. ``Mr Trucka Jet still beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart hasn't come that close again. Effortless Dream finished  
third in 1989 despite getting hit by another horse halfway through 
the race. In 1992, Hart rode First Down and Ten for trainer Jack 
Brooks -- whose seven All American wins is the most by any trainer. 
Again he came up short, finishing third behind another of Brooks' 
horses, Dash Thru Traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart quit riding fulltime two years ago and became a trainer,  
although he continues to ride occasionally in the bigger races. 
This summer, he started as the trainer for Familiar Faces, and the 
filly was ridden in the All American trials by Jacky Martin. But 
Martin also rode Chicks Call Me in the trials, and chose to ride 
the unbeaten grey gelding in the futurity. 
</P>
<P>
	Familiar Faces' owner, Joe Fulton, asked Hart if he'd like to  
ride the filly. He agreed, knowing it was one more shot for him in 
the race he admits he craves to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This probably will be the last time I get to ride the All  
American,'' he said, but then left the door open. ``I've rode it in 
four decades and maybe I'll try it one more time in 2000. I love 
records.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Costner Has No Regrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After huge hits like ``The Untouchables'' and  
``Dances With Wolves'' gave way to big flops like ``The Postman'' 
and ``Waterworld,'' Kevin Costner knows that whatever he does, he 
does it in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
	He also knows that trait makes some vocal critics see him as the  
perfect example of everything they hate about Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear things,'' Costner says in Sunday's Daily News. ``I'm  
not immune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his failures, the Academy Award-winner has no regrets.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I don't see myself clearly, I don't know,'' Costner  
said. ``Maybe there's an arrogance about me or whatever. But I know 
the way I feel about movies is really pure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy about the things I've done. I'm not always happy  
about the results, but I'm happy about the choices I've made, 
because I've made them myself. I love `Wyatt Earp,' and I really 
love `The Postman,' and I loved making `The War,''' he said, 
referring to three box office bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would stack my movies up with anybody's movies, all the  
sequels included.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his latest film, ``For Love of the Game,'' Costner returns to  
the baseball diamond, where he has succeeded with ``Bull Durham'' 
and ``Field of Dreams.'' The actor who played baseball in college 
portrays a once-great pitcher trying to go out in style.

<HEADLINE> Coaching Debuts Dot College Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As far as coaching debuts go, it was a day to remember for some,  
a day to forget for others. 
</P>
<P>
	In the state of South Carolina, fans are dealing with a double  
dose of reality: Lou Holtz's first game as South Carolina's coach 
turned into a soaked 10-0 loss at No. 24 North Carolina State; and 
Marshall survived Death Valley for a 13-10 win over Clemson in 
Tommy Bowden's debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing, but it's a start,'' the 62-year-old Holtz  
said after the game, played in a driving rainstorm and gusty winds 
caused by Tropical Storm Dennis. ``I'm proud of my team. Right down 
to the last second, we felt we could win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson did, too, but Chris Campbell was wide left on a 34-yard  
field goal attempt with 10 seconds left that would have forced 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Gary Barnett also received a gut check in Denver. In  
Saturday's biggest stunner, rival Colorado State shocked the 
14th-ranked Buffaloes 41-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't make plays. We couldn't run the ball. Field position  
really hurt us,'' Barnett said after his Buffs committed six 
turnovers and allowed nine sacks. ``They got the momentum and we 
never really got it back. But there's a lot of football left to 
play this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debuts of Iowa's Kirk Ferentz and Hawaii's June Jones went  
as expected -- both lost to Top 25 teams. No. 5 Nebraska beat the 
Hawkeyes 42-7 and No. 21 Southern California routed Hawaii 62-7, 
extending the Rainbows' losing streak to 19 games, longest in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor's Kevin Steele had the toughest debut, though, when his  
Bears lost 30-29 at Boston College after Kyle Atteberry missed an 
extra point in OT. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was Auburn's Tommy Tuberville, who sweated out  
his opening game until Ben Leard's 33-yard TD pass with 38 seconds 
left lifted the Tigers over I-AA Appalachian State 22-15. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, 14 of this year's 20 new I-A coaches were in action  
Saturday -- five won, nine lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Tuberville in the winner's circle were: Miami, Ohio's  
Terry Hoeppner (28-3 over Northwestern; Mississippi's David 
Cutcliffe (3-0 over of Memphis); Northeast Louisiana's Bobby 
Keasler (27-10 over Nicholls State); and Oregon State's Dennis 
Erickson (28-13 over Nevada). 
</P>
<P>
	Other losers were: Middle Tennessee State's Andy McCollum (40-7  
to Mississippi State); Northwestern's Randy Walker (28-3 to Miamii, 
Ohio); and Southwestern Louisiana's Jerry Baldwin (24-7 to Oklahoma 
State). 
</P>
<P>
	While most of the Top 25 teams beat up on weaker, nonconference  
foes, No. 7 Michigan defeated No. 16 Notre Dame 26-22 in one of the 
most exciting games in their storied rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 22-19 with 4:08 to play, the Wolverines staged a final  
drive that ended in Anthony Thomas' 1-yard TD run with 1:38 to go. 
Notre Dame (1-1) moved the ball to the Michigan 12, but the clock 
ran out on quarterback Jarious Jackson and the Wolverines 
celebrated in front of an NCAA-record crowd of 111,523. 
</P>
<P>
	``You beat Notre Dame in the Big House and it doesn't get much  
better than that,'' said Tom Brady, who was 17 of 24 for 197 yards, 
including clutch completions of 15 and 20 yards on the winning 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The great Michigan quarterback controversy seemed to ease after  
a poised Brady played the entire second half. The fifth-year senior 
started and sophomore sensation Drew Henson played the second 
quarter, as planned. Coach Lloyd Carr says he'll continue to rotate

</P>
<P>
	At State College, Pa., Rashard Casey scored his first two TDs --

	At Gainesville, Fla., even with a 29-point win, the Gators have  
a few problems. Doug Johnson threw for four TDs, but Broncos 
quarterback Tim Lester passed for 405 yards against a defense with 
all new starters. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Gators led only 31-26 early in the third  
quarter after they fumbled the kickoff and the Broncos scored three 
plays later. Florida added three TDs before the fourth quarter to 
put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
                       *No. 5 Nebraska 42, Iowa 7    	
</P>
<P>
	At Iowa City, Iowa, a quarterback tag team hit the Huskers, too.  
Backup Eric Crouch scored three TDs and starter Bobby Newcombe 
returned after an ineffective first half to run for two TDs and 
pass for another.

<HEADLINE> ABC Affiliate Miffed at Philbin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- ABC's affiliate in Honolulu is miffed that Regis  
Philbin can't make its viewers millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
	Philbin is host of ABC's new ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,''  
the prime-time quiz show that was one of the most popular 
television programs of this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	KITV general manager Michael Rosenberg is upset that the show's  
producers limit prospective contestants to residents of the 48 
contiguous states. 
</P>
<P>
	He said those who qualify are expected to be in New York the  
following day for the show's taping. The procedure leaves Hawaii 
and Alaska residents out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around the station here, we referred to the show as 'You Can't  
Become a Millionaire,''' Rosenberg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Sewell, the show's publicist, said that's just the way the  
show was set up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just an issue of trying to get people from  
Honolulu to New York in the time limit,'' Sewell said. ``That's 
kind of a key thing there.''

<HEADLINE> Pro-Union Sentiment Growth Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AFL-CIO president John J. Sweeney said that  
despite the strong economy, dissatisfaction among young American 
workers is increasing support for labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, 54 percent of young workers say they would vote to form  
a union, up from 47 percent just three years ago,'' said Sweeney, 
citing a recent poll commissioned by the labor federation. 
</P>
<P>
	In his traditional Labor Day message, Sweeney said that union  
membership increased by 100,000 people in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young workers don't see employers meeting their end of the  
deal,'' Sweeney said in the written statement. ``Corporations show 
too much concern for the bottom line and not enough for employees, 
they say, and employers fall short when it comes to sharing profits 
and investing in workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think it's time for new rules to hold corporations to a  
higher standard in the way they treat their employees,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in the way, Sweeney said, are corporations that ``use  
every weapon and tactic available -- legal or otherwise'' to resist 
the formation of unions by their employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it stands, too many workers who want to form unions to  
improve their lives will never get the chance,'' Sweeney said. ``If 
working families are to thrive and prosper in the new economy, one 
of our priorities as a nation must be to restore the basic American 
freedom to choose to form a union.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Tracing Fatal E. coli Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A contaminated underground water source is  
believed to be the origin of an E. coli outbreak at a county fair 
that killed a 3-year-old girl and sickened 118 others, state Health 
Department officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests on water in an aquifer supplying the Washington County  
fairgrounds turned up high levels of the E. coli bacteria. It 
remained unclear how the water became contaminated, but officials 
said runoff from animals or another contaminant may have been to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 118 people -- mostly children -- were treated at  
hospitals in five counties and Vermont since Friday and at least 41 
remained hospitalized Sunday evening, according to state Health 
Department spokeswoman Kristine A. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	All had visited the Washington County Fair about 35 miles north  
of Albany on either Aug. 28 or 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Aldrich, 3, of Clifton Park, died Saturday at Albany  
Medical Center Hospital. She had been in critical condition with E. 
coli contamination since Friday, according to hospital spokesman 
Richard Puff. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldrich died after developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS,  
as a result of the E. coli contamination, Smith said. HUS attacks 
the blood cells and can result in kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday evening, a 4-year-old boy had developed HUS. He was  
being treated at Albany Medical Center Hospital, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli bacteria normally live in the intestines of humans and  
other warm-blooded animals. Most strains are harmless but some -- 
like this one identified as O157:H7 -- can be deadly. Symptoms of 
the infection include abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	E. coli bacteria must be ingested to cause infection. Illness  
can be caused by exposure to an infected person, or by ingesting 
tainted food or liquids.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Finally Leaves North Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR ISLAND, N.C. (AP) -- Demoted to a tropical depression,  
Dennis turned its back Sunday on North Carolina after pounding the 
coast for a week and finally coming ashore to flood lowland towns 
with half a foot of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're finally going to get rid of it for a change,''  
Clay Benton of the state emergency management division said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Cedar Island, sideswiped by Dennis on its way up  
the coast on Aug. 30 and clobbered again Saturday when its eye 
passed directly overhead, weren't sorry to see Dennis go, either, 
as they watched floodwaters recede Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that I remember that a hurricane hit us  
directly and then turned around and came back and hit us again,'' 
said Henry ``Farmer'' Styron. ``It was a double whammy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this comes around for a third time, I don't think even we  
could take it,'' said his wife Sue. Both she and her husband are 
retired from the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis appeared to be leaving for good. At midday, it was  
drifting northwest toward southwestern Virginia amid a flurry of 
flash flood warnings and watches after spinning off a tornado 
Saturday night in Hampton, Va., that injured more than a dozen 
people. Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore asked President Clinton to 
provide federal disaster assistance to people displaced by the 
tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado and storm watch was in effect for much of Maryland and  
Virginia on Sunday as rain and wind from Dennis swept across the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Beach patrols along the Maryland and Delaware coasts warned  
people to stay in shallow water because the surf remained rough. 
Sporadic power outages were also reported. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday night in North Carolina, 6.01 inches of rain had  
fallen in the Raleigh/Durham area, 2.28 inches in Greensboro, 5.31 
inches in Goldsboro, 4.25 inches at Roanoke Rapids, 4.31 inches in 
Burlington, 2.82 inches in Winston-Salem, and 5.68 inches in Chapel 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis came ashore at Cedar Island northeast of Morehead City  
late Saturday afternoon. Overnight, it flooded 100 homes and 
businesses in Craven County and forced 150 Pamlico County residents 
to spend Saturday night in shelter. The Pamlico River community of 
Lowland remained cut off by floodwaters Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hobucken, 10 miles from Lowland, a fishing boat sat in the  
middle of the road Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belhaven's streets were underwater once again Sunday. Nearly 6  
feet of water surged from nearby creeks into the community of 2,400 
that lies 6 feet above sea level on the Pongo River. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had five storms in the last four years that have hit  
us,'' Town Manager Tim Johnson said Sunday. ``And we thought we had 
finally missed one. But darned if it didn't come back and get us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formed Aug. 24, Dennis skirted North Carolina's coast Aug. 30,  
went seaward 165 miles, stalled and then backtracked. All week 
long, it assailed North Carolina's coast with 14-foot waves and 
gale-force winds as forecasters tried to guess where it would go 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dennis dawdled off Cape Hatteras, it chewed up Hatteras  
Island's main road, N.C. 12, with thundering surf and buried it in 
drifted beach sand. Only Sunday was it reopened to all traffic, 
although only four-wheel-drive vehicles still were permitted on the 
southern end of the island, where state highway crews spent Sunday 
laying a new asphalt road. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddy Gaskill, a Cedar Island fisherman who lives with his wife  
Gerri in a house built in 1921, said Dennis' 9-foot floodwaters 
swept away 600 of his crab pots, washed out a couple hundred feet 
of his dock and sent water into his home for the first time since a 
1933 hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``All week long, it was like I could either cry or get mad,''  
said Mrs. Gaskill, ``but you have to keep on going.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Financier's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- U.S. authorities prepared an extradition  
request to return fugitive money manager Martin Frankel to 
Connecticut to face charges of embezzling millions of dollars, a 
U.S. official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frankel -- who was nabbed this weekend in a luxurious  
waterfront hotel in Germany -- could be in Germany for months before 
he is returned, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Anne Chermak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's Saturday arrest brought an anticlimactic end to a  
four-month international manhunt. Using a duplicate key, U.S. and 
German authorities entered his room and found him inside. The 
44-year-old Frankel, who is accused of taking hundreds of millions 
of dollars -- some estimates say billions -- from insurance companies 
and other victims, offered no resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got me,'' Frankel said as the FBI and German police  
arrested him, FBI Special Agent Michael Wolf said in Greenwich, 
Conn., where Frankel lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very unspectacular,'' Hamburg police spokesman  
Hans-Juergen Petersen said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why Frankel had come to Germany, or  
how long he had been hiding out in the lavish Prem hotel on the 
banks of the Alster River in the heart of this northern German 
port. 
</P>
<P>
	But it appeared he was planning on an extended period abroad.  
</P>
<P>
	``A number of passports were found with Frankel,'' Petersen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also seized an unspecified sum of cash, diamonds and  
a computer, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said a tip led authorities to Frankel. He did not  
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was accompanied by a young woman, identified by the FBI  
in Connecticut as Cynthia Allison, 35. The bureau did not elaborate 
on her relationship to Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	German authorities said the woman was taken into custody but was  
later released. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was arraigned Sunday on charges of possessing a fake  
British passport, said Hugh Keefe, his U.S. lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	He was being held at Hamburg's Holstenglacis jail, a tough  
holding pen filled mainly with suspected drug dealers and junkies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chermak said an extradition request was ``in process'' in  
Washington, but it could take months to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. attorney said he has spoken to Frankel's German lawyer,  
who says ``under the circumstances, Marty seemed to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said he had spoken to Ms. Allison, the woman arrested with  
Frankel. He said she disputes authorities' version of the arrest, 
saying that no FBI agent was present and that Frankel never said 
``You got me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the United States issued an arrest warrant for  
Frankel on July 14. He has been missing since May 5, when a fire 
alarm alerted firefighters to an emergency at his mansion in 
Greenwich. They found a blazing file cabinet and two fireplaces 
stuffed with burning documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance company regulators said Frankel's unlicensed brokerage  
-- apparently run out of the $3 million Greenwich mansion -- had 
siphoned huge sums of money from several insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel stole at least $218 million from the  
insurers, but a lawsuit filed by some of the companies puts the 
loss at $915 million. Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from 
the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was 
established by Frankel in the British Virgin Islands last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel allegedly controlled Thunor Trust, set up in 1991 by  
businessman John Hackney to buy small, struggling insurance 
companies. Through his lawyer, Hackney has denied any wrongdoing 
and said he also was a victim of Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies believed their policyholder money was  
being invested through Frankel's brokerage firm, Liberty National 
Securities. But apparently, no trades were ever made. Instead, 
prosecutors say, Frankel stole the money.	   Frankel may have been financing his run with more than $10 
million in diamonds and gold he bought before disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials have said Frankel used several aliases  
after being barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1992, including David Rosse, the name of his personal 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has been described by some investors as the Hugh Hefner  
of high finance, keeping a live-in retinue of young women he met 
through personal ads. Frankel said some were ``ex-girlfriends.'' At 
least some of the women performed office work at his unlicensed 
securities brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors described Frankel as neurotic, but said he offered an  
impressive biography and dedication, and that charmed them into 
trusting him with their money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied that he has finally been caught,'' said Ted  
Bitter, a tool-and-die maker who hired Frankel as his broker 14 
years ago in Toledo, Ohio. He says he lost $65,000 that he let 
Frankel invest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's injured a lot of people,'' Bitter said. ``He needs to  
make that right.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Fernandez Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Marlins right-handed pitcher Alex Fernandez cut  
short his comeback season Sunday, preferring to strengthen his 
surgically repaired right shoulder for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, 30, missed the entire 1998 season while recovering  
from rotator cuff surgery that was performed Oct. 29, 1997, 
following the Marlins run to the World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez finished this season on a high note Saturday night,  
tossing allowing two hits and four runs in 7 2-3 innings of a 6-4 
win over the San Diego Padres. Fernandez also hit his third home 
run of the season Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He winds up 7-8 with a 3.38 ERA. In 24 starts, he pitched 141  
innings, allowing 41 walks and striking out 91. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of my season,'' Fernandez said. ``and of the  
organization for supporting me in my comeback. This will help me 
come back stronger for next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez has been on a 100-pitch count all season. He spent two  
separate stints on the disabled list, once with soreness in the 
shoulder and the other time because of a pulled groin. 
</P>
<P>
	He will remain with the team and not be placed on the DL. He  
missed one start in early August after getting a cortisone shot in 
his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez and Marlins' management mutually agreed to shut him  
down at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alex has accomplished quite a bit in his comeback this year  
and our team doctors feel it's best he rest his shoulder,'' Marlins 
manager John Boles said. ``He's had soreness after every start 
which is normal from what the doctors tell us about this type of 
rehabilitation process. We want Alex to be ready to go for next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the Marlins place in the standings and being out of the  
playoff picture played a part in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no need to hurt myself,'' Fernandez said. ``I could  
pitch but it's better for me to rehab and get ready for next 
season. It was frustrating not having my best stuff day in and day 
out and having to put three hours of work in just to go out there 
and pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think it made me a better pitcher.''

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Threat Hits Calif. Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Fire crews on Sunday smothered  
scattered flare-ups left by a wildfire that charred 63,000 acres in 
the San Bernardino Mountains and cut deeply into Labor Day weekend 
business in this alpine resort. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Willow fire started Aug. 28 near Lake Arrowhead.  
Some 2,700 firefighters were brought in from around the nation, but 
fire lines weren't completed around the blaze until late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hoped to have ``every spark within 400 feet of the  
fire lines'' out by Monday, said Steve Jennison, an information 
officer with the Washington state Department of Natural Resources, 
one of the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was one of seven California wildfires that burned more  
than 130,000 acres of forest and desert land. Six other significant 
wildfires in Montana, Utah and Idaho were contained last week. 
</P>
<P>
	No flames ever reached the town of Big Bear Lake, but the threat  
led many would-be vacationers to cancel their trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad because this is a totally tourist-driven town,'' said  
Linda Goldsmith, co-owner of Goldsmith Ski &AMP; Snowboard Rental. 
``This is an important weekend for this valley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldsmith hadn't added up sales receipts from her shop's big  
holiday sidewalk sale, but said the number of customers and traffic 
on the road out front were definitely down. 
</P>
<P>
	On the west side of town, the Fireside Lodge was only 80 percent  
occupied Sunday, instead of full as it is on most Labor Day 
weekends, owner Lee Budd said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some people stuck it out.  
</P>
<P>
	``We rented a cabin a few weeks ago and kept checking with the  
place to make sure everything was OK,'' said Chris Hager, 32, as he 
relaxed next to Big Bear Lake with his 13-year-old son, Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been perfect,'' Hager said, although they hadn't caught  
any fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed all trails and roads in San Bernardino National  
Forest on the north side of the lake for safety reasons and 13 
campgrounds were closed. Only of the campgrounds reopened for the 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On the south side of town, many visitors headed for slopes where  
miles of mountain bike trails weave through the tall pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that business was slow at first, said David Coker, 19, an  
employee at Snow Summit Mountain Resort's mountain bike rental 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire scared away all of our business,'' Coker said. But  
although the center rented only six bikes on Friday, all 50 were 
rented out by midmorning on Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> High-Scoring 'Huskers Have D Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Nebraska has been the nation's  
highest-scoring Division I-A football team in the 1990s. The 
Cornhuskers want to be remembered as a good defensive team, too. 
</P>
<P>
	They made a strong statement in their opener, manhandling Iowa's  
offense from start to finish in a 42-7 victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawkeyes, playing their first game under coach Kirk Ferentz,  
never came close to scoring on offense. They got on the board with 
a blocked punt for a touchdown late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of fun out there,'' cornerback Ralph Brown said.  
``We came out and made a little statement about how hungry we are. 
We don't want to leave anything about last year in people's 
minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 5 Cornhuskers, coming off what for them was a  
disappointing 9-4 season, held Iowa without a first down until just 
3:36 remained in the first half and limited the Hawkeyes to 169 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	With a strong pass rush, Nebraska sacked quarterback Kyle McCann  
three times and drove him to the ground countless other times as he 
was releasing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought defensively our players really played some good  
ball,'' Nebraska coach Frank Solich said. ``I feel a little badly 
for them because they really played shutout defense, but we had the 
one kick block. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the second unit that was in there for the most part,  
but you expect to protect and get the ball off and cover better 
than what we did in that situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Miller, a reserve running back, broke through and blocked  
the kick. Tim Dodge, a sprinter on the track team, scooped up the 
ball and zipped 10 yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's defensive play was especially important in the first  
half because the offense sputtered. Iowa made some big hits while 
twice stopping the Cornhuskers on downs, and quarterback Bobby 
Newcombe threw an interception and lost two fumbles. It was just 
7-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Newcombe alternating with Eric Crouch, and DeAngelo  
Evans and Dan Alexander taking turns at I-back, the Cornhuskers 
eventually wore down the Hawkeyes in the 90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to Sean Applegate and  
scored on two short runs. Crouch scored on runs of 28, 6 and 21 
yards, the last two coming against an Iowa defense that clearly was 
fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Their performances will do nothing to quell the debate over  
which quarterback is better, though there's no question in Solich's 
mind. Newcombe won the starting job in preseason camp and he'll 
stay there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that certainly Eric played tremendous and that's  
what we expect from Eric, or if Bobby would come in second,'' 
Solich said. ``That's what we expect from whoever comes in at 
I-back, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get into, after every practice and every  
game, who's our starting quarterback. We'll let you know when we 
make a quarterback or an I-back change or really any position 
change.''

<HEADLINE> Maestro Performing at MTV Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert Bass, conductor of the 100-voice  
Collegiate Chorale, didn't know just how cool he was. 
</P>
<P>
	When MTV asked his group to perform at the cable music channel's  
annual awards show this week, Bass thought it somebody's idea of a 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not dream my 20th anniversary season with the Collegiate  
Chorale would be celebrated in the presence of the Backstreet Boys, 
Ricky Martin, Madonna, David Bowie, Jennifer Lopez, Lauryn Hill, 
Britney Spears, Chris Rock and Sean 'Puffy' Combs,'' Bass said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chorale will do a rendition of Carl Orff's 1937 cantata  
``Carmina burana.'' The rapper NAS and Combs had a hit recently 
with ``Hate Me Now,'' which is based on ``Carmina burana,'' hence 
the invitation to be opening act on the awards show at the 
Metropolitan Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I presume millions of TV viewers will think Carl Orff is a  
hip-hop artist and Bob Bass and the Collegiate Chorale is a rap 
group,'' Bass said. ``What a great way to reach a new audience!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Collegiate Chorale was founded in 1941 by Robert Shaw at the  
Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Diana's Ex-Lover Serializing Memoir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Princess Diana's former lover James Hewitt is  
still cashing in on the affair. His latest sale is a new memoir 
compiled after retrieving dozens of stolen love letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Hewitt,'' ``Cad in a Cravat'' and ``Lowest of Low,''  
rival newspapers declared Sunday in near-unanimous condemnation of 
Hewitt's deal with The Mail on Sunday to serialize his memoir for 
the equivalent of $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Publication may start next week. The Mail on Sunday avoided the  
subject, but rival publications said the book includes notes from 
the late princess' two sons written to Hewitt when the boys were 
ages 8 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewitt will also draw on 63 letters from Diana, mostly written  
between 1990 and 1991 when the former army officer was serving in 
the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, he successfully sued to recover the letters stolen  
by another girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana was killed in a Paris car crash in August 1997. She was  
36.

<HEADLINE> China Steel Imports Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's steel imports soared 46.7 percent to 8.7  
million tons in the first half of 1999, driven by massive 
government infrastructure spending, a state newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Contractors also are increasingly using foreign steel because  
inefficient Chinese producers have been ordered to cut output to 
hold down losses, the Business Weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand is spurred by construction of highways and other  
steel-intensive projects meant to stimulate China's slowing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign suppliers, especially Russia and the former Soviet  
republics, are offering prices much lower than Chinese producers, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese steel makers have been ordered to cut production by 10  
percent to 104 million tons this year, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how accurately the statistics reflect growth in  
imports. Numbers could be skewed by an ongoing crackdown on 
smuggling, under which previously unreported imports now appear on 
official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Film a Hit at Italy Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Italian critics gave a big thumbs-up Sunday  
to a little film from a virtually unknown Belgian director, calling 
it a contender for the Golden Lion, the Venice Film Festival's top 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Pornographic Liaison'' got a solid 10 minutes of applause at  
its premiere screening Saturday. Critics at the film festival said 
it eclipsed another early favorite -- ``Holy Smoke,'' by Australian 
Jane Campion, director of ``The Piano,'' which garnered a best 
actress Oscar in 1993 for Holly Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Pornographic Liaison,'' starring France's Nathalie Baye, is  
a modest film directed by 31-year-old Frederic Fonteyne. 
</P>
<P>
	It centers on a couple who remain nameless throughout the movie.  
They meet once a week in a hotel to realize a mutual erotic 
fantasy. The audience never sees beyond the closed door of their 
hotel room, and the precise nature of the fantasy remains a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holy Smoke,'' with ``Titanic'' star Kate Winslet, Harvey  
Keitel and Pam Grier, centers around a beautiful young woman who 
follows her guru to India. Keitel plays a cult ``deprogrammer'' who 
catches up with her. Italian critics professed disappointment at 
Campion's eagerly awaited film, one of 18 in competition for the 
Golden Lion. 
</P>
<P>
	Premiering at the festival, but not in competition, was Woody  
Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' a cinematic valentine to jazz in the 
1930s. Allen has a soft spot for the venerable film festival and 
often premieres there, although he never attends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sweet and Lowdown,'' starring Sean Penn, Uma Thurman, Samantha  
Morton and Anthony LaPaglia, follows jazz guitarist Emmet Ray, who 
enjoyed a brief stint of success in the 1930s. The movie follows 
him through encounters with girlfriends, gangsters and other 
musicians and documents his life through a series of ``interviews'' 
with people, including Allen playing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In real life, Allen is a jazz musician as well as a director. He  
plays the clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56th annual Venice Film Festival opened Sept. 1. It will end  
Sept. 11 with a special lifetime achievement award for comedian 
Jerry Lewis.

<HEADLINE> Reds Power Their Way to Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- All the elements were in place for a record.  
The wind was blowing out, Phillies pitchers were on the mound and 
the Cincinnati Reds just wanted to have fun again. 
</P>
<P>
	That they did.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds, not exactly an incarnation of Murderers' Row, set the  
National League record with nine homers Saturday night in a 22-3 
annihilation of Philadelphia. It was the most homers hit in a game 
in 12 years, since Toronto set the major league record with 10 
against Baltimore on Sept. 14, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds manager Jack McKeon, who's been in professional baseball  
for 50 years, had never seen anything like it. He thought he had a 
good explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all goes back to pitching,'' McKeon said. ``Pitching's what  
counts. We had better pitching than they did. Boy, the ball was 
flying out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Taubensee had four hits, two homers and three RBIs. Greg  
Vaughn hit his 30th homer and Jeffrey Hammonds hit a solo shot into 
the left-field upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	The fireworks were far from over. Aaron Boone, Dmitri Young,  
Pokey Reese, Brian Johnson and Mark Lewis also went deep against 
the Phillies' battered staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``And none of them were cheap,'' McKeon said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds entered the game seventh in the league with 156 homers.  
By the time this onslaught was over, they had moved all the way up 
to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds added four more Sunday, tying the major league record  
with 13 homers in two games. They share the record with the 1939 
New York Yankees and 1961 San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Cincinnati had its most homers since  
connecting seven times at Atlanta on Sept. 15, 1987. The Reds hit 
eight homers on Aug. 18, 1956 at Milwaukee and had shared the NL 
record with Milwaukee, San Francisco and Montreal, which did it 
last, against Atlanta on July 30, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those special nights,'' said Taubensee, who  
had four hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Better yet, the Reds stopped a three-game losing streak and  
shook off a recent slide in which they had lost eight of 11. There 
could not have been a more convincing way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to see everybody swinging the bat and having a  
good time again,'' Hammonds said. ``Those are the games that you 
cherish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies were jolted back to reality one night after Curt  
Schilling returned from the disabled list and stopped their 
seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Byrd allowed three homers, putting him among the NL leaders  
with 27. Billy Brewer gave up Taubensee's first homer, and Cliff 
Politte managed to allow six runs in one-third of an inning without 
giving up a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Ogea regained the league lead from Colorado's Pedro  
Astacio, giving up homers to Vaughn, Reese and Taubensee. Amaury 
Telemaco served up homers by Johnson and Lewis, the latter breaking 
the NL record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds also set the major league record with eight different  
players going deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like they were swinging aluminum bats,'' Byrd said.  
``It was out of hand. It was like slow-pitch softball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As McKeon pointed out, there were no wall-scrapers in the bunch.  
The shortest distance was Boone's 365-foot shot. Both of 
Taubensee's homers were estimated at more than 400 feet, and Reese 
-- the diminutive second baseman who has nine homers this season -- 
checked in at 418 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammonds, whose mammoth shot off Byrd leading off the fourth  
landed in the second row of the upper deck, took the distance title 
at 435 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that all 25 of us remember that we have a game  
tomorrow,'' Hammonds said. 
</P>
<P>
	The home-run derby immediately followed a players-only meeting  
in which Vaughn, Barry Larkin and Denny Neagle told their teammates 
to stop pressing and just have fun with the pennant race. 
Cincinnati entered Sunday 2 1/2 games behind Houston in the NL Central 
and four games behind the Mets for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big guys talked a bit,'' Taubensee said. ``It was very  
productive, very positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon was as dumbfounded as anyone by the results.  
</P>
<P>
	``They can have as many meetings as they want if they keep  
hitting like that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Praises Mideast Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) -- Pope John Paul II met with Yasser  
Arafat on Sunday, calling the accord the Palestinian leader signed 
with Israel a ``ray of light'' in a troubled world. 
</P>
<P>
	The comment came at a Mass at the pope's summer retreat outside  
Rome shortly before the meeting, their eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the faithful, John Paul said that the ``panorama  
before our eyes at the close of this century has not a few

the Middle East peace process, is a ``comforting ray of light.'' 
</P>

	After his meeting with Arafat, the Vatican issued a statement  
saying the Palestinian leader had briefed the pontiff on the 
agreement signed earlier in the day with Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also said the Vatican was eager to sign an accord  
of its own with Arafat on the activities of the Roman Catholic 
church in areas administered by the Palestinian Authority. Several 
important sites for Christian pilgrims, including Bethlehem, are 
under the authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat was also in Rome on Saturday for a round of high-level  
meetings with the Italian president and the prime minister, who 
promised economic and political support to help assure a stable 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meetings, Arafat flew to the Egyptian resort of Sharm  
el-Sheikh to meet with Barak and sign the accord. He returned to 
Italy for his papal audience on Sunday.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A little bit of this, a little bit of that --  
that's how Queen Latifah describes her new TV talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be sort of Oprah-meets-Rosie-meets-Chris

``We'll deal with news events, issues and celebrities just doing 
their own thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Queen Latifah, whose real name is Dana Owens, has had a lot on  
her plate this year. Her book ``Ladies First: Revelations of a

thriller ``The Bone Collector'' with Denzel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of Washington, the 28-year-old Latifah says she'd like  
to have him as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denzel is way cooler than people perceive him to be,'' she  
said. ``I'd love to let him freestyle and rap like he can do.''

	``Latifah,'' is scheduled to debut this fall.

<HEADLINE> Aluminum Prices Should Hold Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Consumers take note: the pending merger  
between Alcoa Inc. and Reynolds Metals Inc. should have little 
effect on the price and availability of Reynolds Wrap, that 
versatile foil used to wrap everything from baked potatoes to 
grilled fish filets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor will the merger between Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum  
maker, and Reynolds, which is No. 3, affect the supply or price of 
fancy car wheels, engine blocks or cans for food and beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	Even figuring in the other big aluminum merger, Zurich-based  
Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup), Pechiney of France and Alcan Aluminum of 
Canada, there's little danger of aluminum prices spiking up, as 
might be expected when suppliers combine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup combination will command about $21.6  
billion in revenue, compared to the Alcoa-Reynolds grouping's 
approximately $21 billion. Together the two groups will control 
about 25 percent to 30 percent of world 's aluminum production, 
said Robin Adams, president of Resource Strategies in suburban 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing that will happen is prices will go down for  
consumers as these big giants slug it out for market share in the 
big markets. And that's probably why we won't have a lot of 
consumers screaming about this in the short term,'' said Jim 
Southwood a consultant with Pittsburgh-based Commodity Metals 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a longer period of time, say five years, Southwood thinks  
aluminum prices could well rise a bit, but not enough to affect 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've established market share, you want profits. But  
the limit on that is competing materials,'' Southwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	New plastics, carbon fibers and other metal alloys all conspire  
to mute any desire of the huge aluminum companies to operate as 
traditional monopolies, setting prices as they wish and limiting 
supply to suit their bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are other materials to choose from, the General  
Motors Co., which recently completed a 10-year deal with Alcan to 
ensure stable prices and supply of aluminum, is not worried about 
the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The automotive industry is increasing the use of aluminum in  
vehicles based on the expectations that aluminum will remain 
competitive with other materials. As long as this is recognized by 
the merging companies, the merger may be a good thing for the 
industry,'' said John Stiles, a GM purchasing manager for metal 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides competing materials, the aluminum companies would have  
another big problem if they tried to use their market muscle to fix 
higher prices: the price of bauxite, the base material from which 
alumina comes, has changed little over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher prices would just encourage other aluminum suppliers to  
enter the market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire continent of Australia is bauxite. They just  
started 50 years ago mining in the western part of Australia,'' 
Southwood said. ``You could mine all the way across the continent -- 
it would be 500 years before they would mine it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flat raw materials prices have spurred merger talks in the  
copper industry as well. Since the price of the basic commodity is 
not rising, companies can increase profits one of two ways: cut 
costs or develop new products. 
</P>
<P>
	Metals producer Phelps Dodge Corp. is trying to horn on a merger  
between leading copper producers Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. and 
Asarco Inc., offering both $2.7 billion to form a three-way 
grouping. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger cuts costs by eliminating redundant workers.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't need two treasurers; you don't need two marketing  
guys serving the auto industry,'' New York-based metals analyst 
Chuck Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa also is going the new product route, developing with Audi  
an all-aluminum car, from the frame through the engine to the body 
panels, as well. Last week, Alcoa agreed to buy the Golden Aluminum 
Co. for $41 million, mainly to continue developing the firm's 
continuous casting technology for aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at that as more of an R&AMP;D process than an  
acquisition,'' Bradford said.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Clemency View Draws Barbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans contended Sunday  
that Hillary Rodham Clinton disavowed her husband's offer of 
clemency to Puerto Rican terrorists to get out of an election 
gimmick that backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an effort by the president, by the first lady, to  
manipulate politics in New York,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said. 
``I think it blew up in their face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton offered conditional clemency last month to 16  
imprisoned Puerto Rican members of the FALN terrorist group. To be 
freed, the inmates had to renounce terrorism, which their advocates 
insist they have done. The 16 were convicted on charges of 
seditious conspiracy and possession of weapons and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrat who asked Clinton to make the offer, Rep. Luis  
Gutierrez of Illinois, insisted the president acted to ameliorate 
judicial overkill that has put the Puerto Ricans behind bars for an 
average of 19 years each. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that 10 Nobel Peace  
Prize laureates, former President Carter and others supported 
clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners have not signed off on the offer because of  
requirements such as they must agree not to associate on the 
outside and to avoid any political activity advocating Puerto Rican 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Saturday, Mrs. Clinton, a probable Senate  
candidate from New York, said: ``It's been three weeks, and their 
silence speaks volumes. I believe the offer of clemency should be 
withdrawn.'' Aides said she told the president of her position 
before she issued the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even her distancing I don't think works,'' Gramm said on ABC's  
``This Week.'' ``Her position is, `You can let these criminals go 
if they say they won't do it again.' If you set that standard, you 
wouldn't have anybody in any prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They took a gamble here and got burned and decided to back  
up,'' Gramm's GOP colleague, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said 
on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't help her, and obviously they figured out they better  
withdraw this clemency offer, which is potentially a big problem 
for her ... in New York,'' McConnell added. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. As soon as the offer  
was made, Republicans accused the president of playing politics in 
his wife's behalf. Law enforcement officials and even some 
Democrats opposed it, including the man whose Senate seat Mrs. 
Clinton is expected to seek, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House notified the prisoners last week the clemency  
offer would be withdrawn if they have not acted by Friday at 5 p.m. 
EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., appearing on NBC, characterized that  
as ``a bizarre situation where the terrorists in prison are setting 
the terms and the condition of their release with the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing Sunday with McConnell on Fox, Democrat Joe Biden of  
Delaware agreed that Clinton should not have made the offer and 
said it's ``my instinct'' that the offer should be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	As a former prosecutor, Sen. Patrick Leahy said he is struck by  
the prisoners' lack of remorse. ``Without some sign of remorse, I 
would not have extended it in the first place,'' Leahy, D-Vt., said 
on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On NBC, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., defended the offer. He said  
none of those who would be affected were convicted of violent 
crimes, and they were sentenced to consecutive sentences only 
because they offered no defense at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez, the Illinois Democrat who instigated the offer,  
decried that the episode ``has been now put in the quagmire of 
partisan politics and the (Senate) race for New York. ... I think 
it is time for them to sign and to get out of jail.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Warns of Bank Rumor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Relations between Russia and the United States  
must not be damaged by allegations of money laundering by Russian 
organized crime through a New York bank, Prime Minister Vladimir 
Putin said in an interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said Russian law enforcement was working with U.S.  
officials on the allegations that up to $10 billion was laundered 
through the Bank of New York, but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for calm to avoid a deterioration in U.S.-Russian  
ties, already strained in recent months by the conflict in Kosovo 
and other international disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The reputations of Russia and its businessmen were being  
unfairly tarnished, Putin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This campaign should not damage Russian-American relations and  
Russia's business reputation,'' Putin said in an interview on ORT 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every Russian businessman should not be considered ... a  
Mafioso or connected with the mafia,'' he said in his first public 
reaction to the matter, which surfaced more than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegal capital flight is a problem in Russia, but the claims  
about the Bank of New York case have been exaggerated and 
manipulated by politicians in both nations, Putin said in the 
interview. The case has become an issue in early U.S. and Russian 
presidential election campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will keep on working, try to solve the problem, but we  
should do it without dramatizing the situation, although we cannot 
ignore it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged with a crime, and the Russian government  
has not been accused of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Russian officials have rejected the Bank of New York  
allegations as a Western attack designed to discredit and weaken 
Russia, but the government has shown little desire to discuss the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin dismissed separate allegations that President Boris  
Yeltsin, his family and entourage received kickbacks from Mabetex, 
a Swiss company that won Kremlin construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not likely,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have denied a report published last month by  
the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, which said that Mabetex 
deposited more than $1 million in a Swiss bank account. The report 
said a top Kremlin aide allegedly made the money available to 
Yeltsin and his daughters, Tatyana Dyachenko and Yelena Okulova, 
through credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Mabetex chief executive Behgjet Pacolli has denied paying any  
bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin said Sunday  
the government should consider filing charges if the Mabetex 
allegations are false. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a lie, it should be considered in court,'' Stepashin  
said in an interview with the television news program Itogi. ``The 
rumor has appeared, and it undermines the stability of power.''

<HEADLINE> Study Says Creatine Builds Muscle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New research gives biological support to  
athletes' perceptions that they get stronger when they take 
creatine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-week study found that muscle fibers change in athletes  
who use creatine, and these athletes can lift more weight than 
athletes who don't. The athletes may be getting a training edge 
from the supplement's ability to let muscles keep drawing energy, 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are being able to increase the intensity of the individual  
training session,'' researcher Jeff S. Volek of Ball State 
University, Muncie, Ind., said. ``Over 12 weeks, those extra couple 
of reps every workout add up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, done while Volek was at Penn State, was published in  
the August issue of the American College of Sports Medicine journal 
Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Creatine supplements work by helping the body replenish  
adenosine triphosphate, known as ATP, which is a key source of 
energy for muscle. The body makes creatine, although it also can be 
found in meat. To try to ensure their cells are saturated with 
creatine, however, many athletes use supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Volek and his colleagues looked at 19 men, all about 25 years of  
age and similar in weight, lean body mass and capacity to lift 
weights. Ten were given creatine -- 25 grams a day for the first 
week, followed by 5 grams a day for the rest of the study. The rest 
were given a fake preparation. No one was told what they were 
getting. All the men worked out under the guidance of the same 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the training, all the men were bigger than they  
were at the start. But the men on creatine registered an average 
6.3 percent gain in fat-free mass, compared with 3.1 percent in 
those on the placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-sectional samples of muscle fiber showed increases of  
about 35 percent in fiber size in men on creatine, compared with 
gains ranging from 6 percent to 15 percent in non-creatine group, 
depending on the type of muscle sampled. And men on creatine showed 
a 24 percent increase in their bench press, compared with 16 
percent for the men not on creatine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were blasting the placebo group just as hard, and we are  
still seeing these effects,'' Volek said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are in line with some other recent research that  
extended creatine's apparent benefits. In a study of sedentary 
young women in Belgium, 10 weeks of resistance training on creatine 
resulted in greater strength gains than 10 weeks of similar 
training by women without it. Initial studies on creatine had found 
only short bursts of performance gains. 
</P>
<P>
	In Volek's study, he said, the supplement itself probably did  
not make the muscles more powerful but did let the athletes who 
used it keep training while their non-using colleagues flagged. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on that, creatine apparently can provide a base on which  
to build strength, but this is not the same as a chemical margin of 
victory, Volek said. Too many other factors go into sports for that 
to be the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, athletes may expect too much of the supplement -- athletes  
who don't use it still make gains, and athletes who use illegal 
steroids make bigger ones, Volek said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many athletes do expect their performance to improve because  
of the supplement. And a researcher unconnected to the study thinks 
they have a right to. ``We have seen 14 to 20 pounds of muscle and 
huge amounts of strength,'' said Richard B. Kreider of the 
University of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, another expert wonders how much of the strength  
improvement in the new study can be attributed without doubt to the 
creatine. Athletes know when they are bulking up, and the ones in 
Volek's study could reasonably have suspected they were getting 
creatine, said Ron Terjung of the University of Missouri, Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	This suspicion that they were getting a training-improving drug  
may have been enough, even without any physiological change, to 
spur them to train harder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Belief is important in sports, Terjung said: ``It's why people  
of apparently equal physical endowment will beat others in a long 
jump or a sprint,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychological effect can't be ruled out, but it does seem  
unlikely, Volek said. Most of the athletes who got creatine said 
after the study that they had suspected they were getting it, but 
so did about half of the control group, he said.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Affiliates Seek Court Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Three companies affiliated with Daewoo  
Group have filed for court receivership in a new sign of trouble 
for South Korea's second largest conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock trading for Segye Corp., Shinhan Engineering &AMP;  
Construction Co. and Shinsung Tong Sang will be halted Monday 
following their application Friday for court receivership, the 
Korea Stock Exchange said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies, which are engaged in construction or  
apparel trading, have been reeling under a severe cash crunch since 
Daewoo Group narrowly avoided becoming the country's largest 
bankruptcy in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, creditor banks agreed to keep the conglomerate  
afloat by rolling over short-term debt and providing new loans in 
return for a sweeping restructuring plan that will divest the 
conglomerate of all but six auto-related subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	That cast doubt on the rest of Daewoo's 25 affiliates. Daewoo  
also was slow to sell off its assets and invite foreign investment, 
intensifying doubt over the entire conglomerate and making banks 
increasingly reluctant to provide new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash strains caused Daewoo's key auto and electronics  
subsidiaries to have difficulty importing parts from foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Daewoo Motor Co. and Daewoo Electronics Co. planned  
to cut down its operating hours next week barring quick 
improvements in cash flow, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit banks met Saturday to discuss expanding financing for  
Daewoo's imports and exports as well as its debt repayments. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies applying for court receivership had been  
officially spun off from Daewoo years ago, but they still were 
considered affiliates of Daewoo because they depended on the 
conglomerate for most of their business and financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo had $48 billion in total debt, or 5.8 times its equity.  
</P>
<P>
	South Korea accepted a $58 billion bailout from the  
International Monetary Fund in late 1997 to save its faltering 
economy. In return, it promised to restructure its conglomerates, 
whose reckless expansion has been largely blamed for the nation's 
economic woes.

<HEADLINE> Study: Dolly Isn't a Total Clone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A study confirms what scientists had always  
thought about Dolly the sheep: If you want to be really picky, you 
can say she's not completely identical genetically to the ewe she 
was cloned from. 
</P>
<P>
	No need to rewrite the textbooks: The finding doesn't change  
Dolly's status as the first animal to be cloned from an adult 
mammal. 
</P>
<P>
	When most people think about genes, they think of the DNA in the  
nucleus of the cell. The genes there control a wide variety of 
characteristics like eye color. And for this DNA, Dolly is indeed a 
clone. 
</P>
<P>
	But cells contain a much smaller amount of DNA outside the  
nucleus, in features called mitochondria. The mitochondria are the 
power plants of cells, and their DNA -- called mtDNA -- controls 
their functioning. 
</P>
<P>
	This mtDNA accounts for about 1 percent of a typical cell's DNA  
and a much smaller percentage of its genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists always thought that Dolly's mtDNA would differ from  
the mtDNA in the ewe she was cloned from. Dolly was cloned by 
fusing a body cell from the ewe to an egg that had its nucleus 
removed. A body cell has far less mtDNA than an egg does, so when 
they mixed, the vast majority of the result would be from the egg. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, scientists have inspected Dolly's mtDNA and found no trace  
of the ewe's contribution at all. That's a surprise, and it 
suggests the egg destroyed the ewe's mtDNA, said Eric Schon of the 
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He and colleagues present the results in the September issue of  
the journal Nature Genetics. Co-authors include Dolly cloner Ian 
Wilmut of the Roslin Institute in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	They got the same result with the mtDNA of nine sheep cloned  
from fetal cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Schon said the work has a big implication for attempts to study  
diseases caused by flaws in mtDNA. Only a small minority of genetic 
diseases are caused by such flaws, with far more stemming from 
defects in nucleus DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	But defects in mtDNA cause a variety of devastating diseases,  
most of them very rare, with such outcomes as blindness, deafness, 
mental retardation and difficulty walking. Defective mtDNA may also 
cause some 2 percent of adult-onset diabetes, Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists now have trouble studying mtDNA diseases because they  
can't reproduce the human disorders in animals, Schon said. One 
idea has been to grow mitochondria with defective mtDNA in the 
laboratory and inject them into egg cells, with the idea of 
producing mice that carry the defective mtDNA. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new work suggests that might not succeed, because the  
egg might destroy the foreign mitochondria, Schon said. The new 
report is ``a wake-up call to us'' to figure out ways to block that 
destruction, he said.

<HEADLINE> Actor Bacon on Path to Career Bliss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bombing out at the box office a few times put  
Kevin Bacon on the path to career bliss. 
</P>
<P>
	``After getting early fame in `Footloose,' I starred in a series  
of pictures that failed,'' Bacon says in Sunday's Daily News. ``So 
I just decided that I couldn't `open' a movie like certain other 
movie stars. It was an economic fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat down with my wife (actress Kyra Sedgwick), and she  
encouraged me to take some of the really terrific supporting roles 
that were out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What resulted was as string of memorable parts in films  
including ``Apollo 13,'' ``JFK,'' ``A Few Good Men'' and ``The 
River Wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bacon couldn't keep the same low profile for long, directing  
the cable movie ``Losing Chase'' and coproducing ``Wild Things,'' 
which he also appeared in. Now he's starring in the upcoming ``Stir 
of Echoes'' and a film in production, ``Hollow Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute you decide on a plan in this business, it'll go up  
in smoke,'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Titans Cut Veteran Darryll Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Tennessee Titans may have done Darryll Lewis a favor on  
Sunday. They cut the veteran defensive back, making him one of the 
NFL's most sought-after players, at least for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, whose has 25 interceptions over the last five years, was  
cut because he lost his starting job and the $2 million he's due to 
make is too much to pay a nickel back. Six teams immediately called 
his agent with more to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was cutdown day in the NFL, with most teams getting down  
to the 53-man limit by getting rid of rookies and free agents who 
basically served as practice players. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver made a notable technical cut -- John Elway, who officially  
retired in April but was kept on the roster as insurance if he 
changed his mind and in a move to save salary cap money. And San 
Diego made a notable non-cut by keeping Ryan Leaf on the roster 
instead of placing him on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, a nine-year veteran, was beaten out for the starting job  
by second-year Samari Rolle and then cut in what looks like a 
difference of opinion between coach Jeff Fisher and Jeff Diamond, 
the new team president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere in this did we ever expect not to have Darryll back,''  
Fisher said. ``I believe he can still play a number of years, if 
not as a starter, as a premier third-down nickel back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' agent, Ken Zuckerman, said he had received calls from San  
Francisco, Dallas, San Diego, the New York Jets, Carolina and 
Buffalo as soon as they saw Lewis' name on the waiver wire. He said 
his client would sign with the team that gave him the best chance 
to be a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be mad,'' Lewis said. ``I'm not the first guy to go  
through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, whose may not be able to play until November after  
undergoing surgery on his right shoulder, could have been put on 
injured reserve, which would have required him to miss the entire 
season. Instead, the Chargers cut Craig Whelihan, who started last 
year when Leaf was benched, and will start the season with veterans 
Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like I got drafted again,'' said Leaf, who had  
monumental problems both on and off the field after being the 
second overall pick in the 1998 draft. ``Now we get the perfect 
situation where I come into and you've got the two veteran 
quarterbacks there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another casualty was former Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan  
Salaam, let go by the Raiders, who kept former New York Giant 
Tyrone Wheatley instead. Wheatley had been cut earlier in the 
preseason by Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave him a long look but Wheatley has really caught our eye  
over the last two weeks, both in practice and games. Special teams 
play also was a major factor,'' coach Jon Gruden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other veterans released Sunday were: punter Louie  
Aguiar of Kansas City; linebacker James Francis, oft-injured 
offensive tackle Kevin Sargent and center Rod Payne, a third-round 
draft pick in 1997, by Cincinnati; eight-year running back Bernie 
Parmalee by Miami; kick returner Eric Metcalf by Baltimore; and 
38-year-old long snapper Mike Morris by Minnesota, which also cut 
tight end Eric Moss, Randy's older brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets cut special teams player Corwin Brown, a favorite of  
coach Bill Parcells in New York and New England. New Orleans cut 
Danan Hughes, a free agent wide receiver who spent seven seasons 
with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, meanwhile, put wide receiver Lamar Thomas, a  
starter last season, on injured reserve. The New York Giants did 
the same with left guard Lance Scott, meaning Luke Petitgout, the 
team's first-round draft choice, will start. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona did the unusual by keeping both its kickers, Joe Nedney  
and Chris Jacke. The Cardinals hope to trade one to a team looking 
for a veteran placekicker.

<HEADLINE> Jackson: Bush in 'Poor Man's Trap' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is ``a rich man's son  
caught in a poor man's trap'' on the subject of answering questions 
about whether he used illegal drugs in his younger days, Rev. Jesse 
Jackson said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking with reporters after giving a sermon at a Manhattan  
church, Jackson said the Republican presidential candidate and 
Texas governor had failed to show leadership on the drug issue in a 
state whose ``No. 1 growth economy ... is jails, based upon 
drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson claimed that 80 percent of a Texas prison population of  
140,000 are under drug sentences, while Bush himself refuses to say 
whether he did or did not use narcotics in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say, free George Bush. And also a generation of youth  
trapped in that same trap, because above all we must not sacrifice 
equal protection under the law. And there is no category called 
`youthful indiscretion' on cocaine,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that drug policy is a President's business,''  
Jackson said, adding that being ``a rich man's son ... caught in a 
poor man's trap,'' had forced Bush to modify his own strict 
position on the drug issue. 
</P>
<P>
	During his sermon at Manhattan's interdenominational Riverside  
Church, Jackson also mentioned in passing that Bush had not 
attended or sent a representative to the funeral of James Byrd, the 
black man who was dragged to his death behind a truck by two avowed 
white supremacists in Jasper, Texas, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson criticized Bush for ignoring the Byrd funeral and not  
supporting hate crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Karen Hughes, Gov. Bush's spokeswoman in Austin, said Bush  
called Byrd's family to express his deepest sympathy ``at what he 
called a barbaric act that would not be tolerated in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps Rev. Jackson is unaware that Gov. Bush was respecting  
the wishes of the Byrd family and local officials in the community 
who had asked people not to attend (the funeral),'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Texas has a hate crimes law which Gov. Bush signed tougher  
penalties for two years ago,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Joins Holiday Crowd at Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDY HOOK, N.J. (AP) -- Neither a national campaign nor the side  
effects of a one-time hurricane could keep Democrat Bill Bradley 
from his appointed Labor Day rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator hit the sand Sunday for his 19th  
Labor Day weekend beach walk in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous years, he was peppered with questions about when he  
would run for president. This year, many people wished him luck in 
his campaign against Vice President Al Gore for the party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to be at the Jersey shore, which is my good luck  
charm,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was kicking off a new stage of his campaign, one in  
which he will elaborate his ideas for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The beaches were less than mobbed, swimming was restricted and  
some vacationers grumbled about the lingering effects of what was 
Hurricane Dennis. But Bradley was lucky, encountering no rain and 
some peeks of sunshine on his stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to compare himself and Vice President Al Gore, Bradley  
said, ``Well, I'm having more fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camera crews were so plentiful that the campaign rotated them in  
for 5-minute intervals around the candidate, lest the walking mob 
trample an unsuspecting vacationer. It nearly happened, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``How was your summer? Was the water good?'' Bradley asked  
swimsuit-clad vacationers on the beach in Spring Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Costell fought through the crowd to introduce his  
2-year-old son Justin to ``the next president of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costell, of Monmouth Beach, said he is a Republican but would  
cross party lines to support his former senator for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he brings integrity, and I believe he'll be a  
pragmatic president,'' Costell said. ``He'll get things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Jones shook Bradley's hand and said, ``I'm a Republican from  
Pennsylvania. Good luck to you.'' Jones, of Gettysburg, Pa., said 
he would vote for Bradley because ``he's real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Hennessy, of Point Pleasant, offered not just her vote,  
but several of her french fries -- a nicety she said she would not 
extend to other politicians, least of all President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you kidding? With the stiffs we've had?'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Not all the reviews were positive. ``Vote Bush!'' shouted Rick  
Vanglahn of Denville, whose anti-Clinton animosity extends to 
Bradley and other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these (Democrats) stick up for Bill Clinton,'' Vanglahn  
said. ``Nobody will go face-to-face with Bill Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is spending a few days in his adopted home state before  
launching the next phase of his campaign in his native state, 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous years, Bradley visited beaches along most of New  
Jersey's 127 miles of shore over two or three full days. This year, 
his three-hour shore tour stopped only in Spring Lake and Point 
Pleasant Beach -- and to fuel up on hot dogs at an annual 
destination, Max's restaurant in Long Branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing the day at the Gateway National Recreation Area at  
Sandy Hook to join supporters at a $100-per-person barbecue 
fundraiser. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were touches of tradition, like Bradley's socks:  
orange and blue striped, New York Knicks-issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Bradley retired from basketball in 1977, that would make  
them ... 22 years old? 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, about that,'' Bradley said while touring the beach in  
Spring Lake. ``My lucky socks.''

<HEADLINE> Another NY Death From Encephalitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials have confirmed that a second  
elderly Queens resident has died from an outbreak of St. Louis 
encephalitis, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had suspected that the infection was what caused the  
87-year-old woman's death last week, but had not known for sure 
until Saturday, said Sandra Mullin, spokeswoman for the city 
Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	An 80-year-old man died last week from the virus, officials  
said. Five others believed to be infected were receiving medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The viral infection is transmitted into the victim's blood  
stream by a mosquito bite. Most people recover from the ailment but 
it can be fatal to those with compromised immune systems, such as 
the elderly, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Defends Venezuelan Oil Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's president on Sunday  
defended a shakeup at the powerful state oil monopoly and dismissed 
suggestions that its new head isn't qualified for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez said the new leader of Petroleos de  
Venezuela, Hector Ciavaldini, is an ``eminent Venezuelan, highly 
capable and with a high moral condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ciavaldini was named to the post Monday after Roberto Mandini  
resigned, apparently in a dispute over production policies at 
Petroleos de Venezuela, the world's third largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have suggested that Ciavaldini got the job mainly  
because he is a political ally of Chavez rather than for his 
merits, noting that he was a mid-level manager before Chavez named 
him vice president in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciavaldini, a trained chemical engineer with a doctorate from  
the University of London, told The Associated Press that his career 
was sidetracked partly because he was fired from the company in 
1995 -- allegedly because he was promoting Chavez's proposals for 
radical political reform in the corruption-riddled country. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a former army paratrooper who spent two years in jail  
for leading a 1992 coup attempt, was elected president last 
December. Speaking Sunday to reporters, he backed up Ciavaldini's 
allegation about the firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciavaldini later filed a lawsuit against Petroleos de Venezuela  
for the dismissal, claiming it was unjust. The lawsuit is still 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandini's resignation has prompted five other top-level  
executives to leave the company, but government officials have 
played down the departures. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez said Sunday that Ciavaldini will help carry out a reform  
of the oil company, which Chavez has said suffers from a ``gold 
culture'' of extravagant spending. Many industry analysts say the 
company is generally well run. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez has reversed a Petroleos de Venezuela plan to expand  
production, opting instead to reduce output to raise prices. 
Mandini apparently disagreed with Chavez's policy.

<HEADLINE> Tulane Begins Impossible Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- New Tulane coach Chris Scelfo faces an  
impossible task. No matter how good the Green Wave do, they can't 
better last year's perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people outside the program don't even wonder if the Green  
Wave will repeat a 12-0 season and No. 7 ranking in the final 
Associated Press poll. They instead wonder how far Tulane will 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel like we have to gain respect,'' said receiver  
JuJuan Johnson, who caught 68 passes for 947 yards and a team-high 
12 touchdowns in 1998. ``We like being the underdog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is exactly what the defending Conference USA champion Green  
Wave are in their season opener at Southern Mississippi, despite a 
13-game winning streak that is the second-longest in the nation to 
defending national champion Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Miss, the 1997 Conference USA champion, is a 10-point  
favorite in the Labor Day Monday opener. The last time Tulane was 
an underdog was Oct. 25, 1997, at Southern Miss, a span of 16 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Record-setting quarterback Shaun King (36 touchdown passes and  
six interceptions last year) now is in the NFL. On defense, Tulane 
had to replace eight starters on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we don't have the same team,'' said Scelfo, a  
Georgia assistant the past three seasons who grew up in the New 
Orleans area a Tulane fan. ``This is a new challenge. We are not 
sneaking up on anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially Southern Miss.  
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Eagles had six turnovers in a 21-7 loss at Tulane in  
their 1998 league opener. They overcame a 1-3 overall record to 
have their fifth straight winning season, but still finished a game 
behind Tulane, going to the Humanitarian Bowl, instead of the 
Liberty Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple phrase ``9-6-99,'' signifying the date of the opener,  
has been posted throughout Hattiesburg for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Miss coach Jeff Bower didn't need the summer-long  
promotion campaign to know the importance of the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing a team that knows how to win,'' he said. ``There  
is probably a tremendous amount of confidence there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Tulane, Southern Miss has a new quarterback. But the Golden  
Eagles have long been settled on their new starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable Davis, a junior college transfer who redshirted a year ago  
while record-breaking quarterback Lee Roberts completed his career, 
takes over for Southern Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis threw for more than 4,800 yards and 47 touchdowns in two  
seasons at Butte Community College in California. At Southern Miss, 
he's surrounded by one of the best receiving combinations in the 
country and has 1,000-yard rusher Derrick Nix. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrod Gideon is Southern Miss' career receiving leader, after  
record-setting numbers (66 catches, 1,186 yards, 13 touchdowns) a 
year ago. Todd Pinkston also caught 52 passes for 848 yards and 
seven TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	It may take two distinctly different quarterbacks to replace  
King at Tulane. Patrick Ramsey (a classic dropback passer) or 
redshirt freshman Derrick Joseph (more athletic and mobile) will 
both see time in the opener.

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Flee As East Timor Burns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Pro-Indonesia militiamen shot and burned  
their way through East Timor's capital unchallenged Sunday, forcing 
thousands of terrified civilians to flee from violence set in 
motion by a vote overwhelmingly in favor of independence from 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	With waves of gunfire echoing across the city and militiamen  
wielding machetes and guns, fears of civil war have heightened 
since the United Nations announced Saturday that 78.5 percent of 
East Timor's voters chose independence in Monday's referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. compound in Dili was under siege Sunday, with  
militiamen circling outside, shooting assault rifles and menacing 
the several hundred people inside the compound. Food and water 
shortages loomed when 1,000 civilians taking refuge in a school 
next door fled into the compound after they were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	The unarmed U.N. mission is completely dependent on Indonesian  
security forces for protection. But many in the Indonesian army are 
believed to be allied with the militias. 
</P>
<P>
	Casualty reports were impossible to verify, though witness  
accounts said scores were killed Sunday in the former Portuguese 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is every indication that a massacre is taking place,  
staged by (Indonesian) military forces,'' Ana Gomes, who is 
Lisbon's diplomatic envoy to Jakarta, told Portugal's TSF radio. 
``Over 100 dead would be a conservative estimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto said Sunday that the army will  
dispatch about 1,400 troops to maintain order. Wiranto was part of 
a high-level delegation rushed from Jakarta to meet local 
authorities and U.N. officials who organized the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	People fled however they could, part of an exodus from the  
province that threatened to reach tens of thousands. Some 2,000 
huddled at the Dili residence of Bishop Carlos Belo, East Timor's 
spiritual leader and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize. His 
diocese office elsewhere was set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5,000 terrified civilians fled from Dili's seaport on  
ferries bound for nearby islands, while exasperated police said 
15,000 people had crowded into the police compound to stay out of 
harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
	At the airport, civilians clutching their dearest possessions  
dashed across the runway, scrambling aboard an air force cargo 
plane to fly to safety through skies filled with smoke from burning 
buildings. Journalists and other foreigners were also evacuating. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Ali Alatas claimed the violence was a result of  
anti-independence forces not understanding how the complaints 
process against alleged elections irregularities worked, a U.N. 
official said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But doubts about the government's commitment to security  
remained. Thousands of Indonesian soldiers and police made no 
apparent attempt to rein in the rampaging militias, who lit the 
night skies orange with fires. No one ventured outside except to 
flee. 
</P>
<P>
	Leandro Isaac, a spokesman for the pro-independence forces, said  
he had a report that up to a dozen people had been killed in the 
turbulent Becora district. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, a witness told The Associated Press that  
members of a notorious militia were shooting at people -- apparently 
settlers from Java, Indonesia's most populous island -- trying to 
flee aboard ferries. The witness said two people were killed.

<HEADLINE> Worshippers Pray for Cardinal's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Worshippers crowded St. Patrick's Cathedral on  
Sunday to pray for Cardinal John O'Connor as he recovers from brain 
surgery and prepares to undergo radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, who became spiritual leader to 2.2 million Catholics  
in 1984, celebrated Mass in his private residence adjacent to the 
cathedral, his spokesman Joe Zwilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling good,'' Zwilling said. ``He's up, he's talking to  
people, doing some work. ... He's very calm about everything, he's 
in very good and positive spirits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 79, was hospitalized for 11 days after experiencing  
nausea and weakness. He was released Saturday after a small tumor 
discovered on the surface of his brain was removed, according to 
the Archdiocese of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese would not say whether the tumor was malignant,  
but announced that O'Connor would undergo radiation therapy, 
typically used to treat cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials released no futher information about his condition.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Tavuzzi said O'Connor was grateful for the  
public's prayers and support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cardinal is delighted to be back home and expects to begin  
his regular Mass schedule ... next Sunday,'' Tavuzzi told 
worshippers.

<HEADLINE> Ngeny Breaks Record for 1,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIETI, Italy (AP) -- Noah Ngeny broke the world record for the  
men's 1,000 meters Sunday at the Rieti Grand Prix II meet, clocking 
2 minutes, 11.96 seconds to erase a mark that had stood for 18 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan, silver medalist in the 1,500 at last month's World  
Championships, sliced .22 seconds off the previous record of 
2:12.18, set by Sebastian Coe at Oslo, Norway, on July 11, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny looked at his time on the clock as he crossed the finish  
line and raised his left fist. He kept his arm aloft almost 
throughout a victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
	The warm day, altitude and excellent pacesetting made for ideal  
conditions for the 20-year-old Ngeny, who persuaded the meet's 
organizers on Thursday to add the rarely-contested 1,000 to the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kiptoo, another Kenyan, led Ngeny through the first 600  
meters at a brisk clip, two seconds under Coe's pace. After Kiptoo 
dropped out, with 300 meters to go, Ngeny slowed somewhat, but a 
powerful finish carried him to the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny finished about 10 meters ahead of runner-up William Yampoy  
of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiptoo, sixth in the 800 meters at the 1996 Olympics, was a late  
addition to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny previously had run the second-fastest 1,000, missing Coe's  
record by .48 seconds at a meet in Nice, France, in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's record was the latest sign that the Kenyan is capable  
of threatening Hicham El Guerrouj's stranglehold on middle-distance 
running. Ngeny pushed El Guerrouj to the world record for the mile 
at the Golden Gala in Rome in July, and battled the Moroccan down 
the final straightaway in a thrilling 1,500 final at the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the year 2000 will be my year,'' Ngeny said. ``I'm  
going to concentrate on the 1,500 and the mile, and I think I can 
beat El Guerrouj. I've had a lot of problems (beating him) this 
year, but El Guerrouj will have many problems next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen-ager, Ngeny broke world junior records for the mile  
and 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The world record was the seventh set at this town nestled in the  
mountains about 40 miles northeast of Rome, and fourth in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Komen set the 3,000-meter record, which still stands,  
here in 1996, while Algerian Noureddine Morceli ran since-broken 
records for the 1,500 in 1992 and the mile in 1993.

	Cars Explode in Northern Israel  
</P>
<P>
	TIBERIAS, Israel (AP) -- Police said two car blasts in northern  
Israeli cities likely aimed at halting the newly revived peace 
process killed three people today -- probably the bombers 
themselves. The explosions in the cities of Tiberias and Haifa came 
hours after a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians was 
signed. Haifa police Commander Dor Schecter said the 
almost-simultaneous explosions in the two towns 60 miles apart 
indicated a coordinated attack. There was no immediate claim of 
responsibility for the blasts. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's 
aides said he remained committed to the new agreement.

	Militias Besiege E. Timor Capital  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people crammed  
aboard ferries and planes to flee East Timor on Sunday, as 
pro-Indonesian militias besieged a U.N. compound and set fire to 
homes belonging to people who support independence for the 
province. Staff at two hospitals said they had treated about a 
dozen patients for machete wounds. U.N. officials said Monday that 
they were evacuating the compound and the Australian air force 
would fly between 100 and 150 workers out of East Timor.

	Blair Urges 'National Moral Purpose'  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair called for a ``new  
national moral purpose'' in an interview published today, 
expressing shock at reports that two 12-year-old girls had become 
pregnant. The stories of the English girls, one of whom has already 
given birth, have renewed a national debate on Britain's high 
teen-age pregnancy rate -- the highest in Western Europe. ``I think 
it's appalling, and it should be a matter of anxiety and concern to 
anyone who believes in the future of the country,'' Blair said in 
the interview published in The Observer, a liberal weekly.

	Jesse Jackson Chides Bush on Drug Issue  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is ``a rich man's son  
caught in a poor man's trap'' on the question of whether he should 
admit to having used drugs in his younger days, Rev. Jesse Jackson 
said today. Jackson said Bush, a Republican presidential candidate, 
had failed to show leadership on the drug issue in a state whose 
``No. 1 growth economy ... is jails, based upon drugs.'' Jackson 
claimed that 80 percent of the Texas prison population is under 
drug sentences, while Bush himself refuses to say whether he did or 
did not use narcotics in his youth.

	Study: Americans Work Longest Hours  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Americans work the longest hours in the  
industrialized world, overtaking the Japanese, according to a new 
United Nations study. But the U.S. lead in productivity is being 
whittled away by its European and Japanese rivals, who are working 
less while Americans stay on the job more, said the report by the 
International Labor Organization. Hard-working Americans run a risk 
of burning out, said the ILO's Lawrence Jeff Johnson, co-author of 
the 600-page ``Key Indicators of the Labor Market'' report. The 
report was based on figures covering the years 1980-1997.

	N.Y. Tracing Fatal E. coli Bacteria  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An outbreak of E. coli bacteria at a county  
fair is believed to have killed a 3-year-old girl and sickened at 
least 85 other people in northern New York. State Health Department 
officials were still trying to pinpoint the source of the bacteria 
today. All the victims had visited the Washington County Fair on 
its last weekend, Aug. 28-29, department spokeswoman Kristine Smith 
said. ``We are scrambling to find the origin because 27,000 were at 
the fair on its last day,'' she said.

	Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese Stocks rose Monday, following Friday's  
sharp rally on Wall Street. The Nikkei gained 142.15 points to 
17,772.14 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Friday, the Dow 
closed at 11,078.45, buoyed by slowing U.S. job growth in August, 
which eased market worries about inflationary pressure.

<P>
	V. Williams Advances at U.S. Open  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Venus Williams escaped an upset today at the  
U.S. Open after Mary Joe Fernandez strained a leg muscle skidding 
on a slippery court. A rainy, blustery fringe of tropical storm 
Dennis delayed the start of play, interrupted every match and 
caused the postponement of eight others. Williams, seeded No. 3, 
reached the quarterfinals with a 2-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory that stemmed 
entirely from a fall by Fernandez when she slipped on a wet spot 
chasing a shot behind the baseline.

<HEADLINE> Bush Makes 'Call to Conscience' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush  
addressed conservatives Sunday with what he said was ``a call to 
conscience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons I seek the presidency is to help usher in  
an era of personal responsibility, an era in which every person 
understands that they are responsible for the decisions they make 
in life,'' Bush said in a five-minute videotaped speech. 
</P>
<P>
	He was addressing Republicans, pundits and cultural figures at  
the close of ``The Weekend,'' an annual retreat that is a 
conservative counterpoint to ``The Renaissance Weekend,'' attended 
by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today Americans are rich in possessions. We also must be rich  
in our ideals,'' he said. ``There must be a purpose to our 
prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential  
nomination, told his audience that Americans today are relearning 
that public interest depends on pride and that standards and 
commitments produce integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't all meet ideals or perfectly symbolize them,'' he  
said. But ``this is not a search for scapegoats. It's a call to 
conscience.''

<HEADLINE>  Nuns Mark Mother Teresa's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- Hundreds of nuns of the Missionaries of  
Charity, founded by Mother Teresa, held hourly prayers Sunday on 
the second anniversary of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of admirers made a pilgrimage to her tomb to lay  
wreaths and conduct interfaith prayer services as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The order also organized a Mass in the chapel inside Mother  
Teresa's former home and a feeding program at centers for the poor 
throughout the city where she had lived for six decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother Teresa, born in the former Yugoslavia, died Sept. 6, 1997  
at the age of 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoolchildren, the state governor, a Muslim organization, and  
people from all walks of life brought flowers to the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's successor as head of the order,  
said, ``Let us keep alive the light that mother has lit in the 
heart for love of God and love of our brother and sister, 
especially the poorest of the poor in our home, neighborhood and 
wherever we meet them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the nuns were ``working for'' a declaration by the  
Roman Catholic Church that Mother Teresa was a saint. ``Although we 
are eagerly waiting for the declaration, it is not likely to be 
done before the year 2000.''

<HEADLINE> Another NY Death From Encephalitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials have confirmed that a second  
elderly Queens resident has died from an outbreak of St. Louis 
encephalitis, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had suspected that the infection was what caused the  
87-year-old woman's death last week, but had not known for sure 
until Saturday, said Sandra Mullin, spokeswoman for the city 
Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	An 80-year-old man died last week from the virus, officials  
said. Five others believed to be infected were receiving medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The viral infection is transmitted into the victim's blood  
stream by a mosquito bite. Most people recover from the ailment but 
it can be fatal to those with compromised immune systems, such as 
the elderly, authorities said.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Baseball Hall of Famer Willie Stargell has  
returned to his Wilmington, N.C., home after being hospitalized in 
Pittsburgh for more than three weeks with an undisclosed illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell, who has required kidney dialysis for several years,  
underwent dialysis and blood work during his stay in two Pittsburgh 
hospitals. Dialysis eliminates impurities from the blood during 
kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	At Stargell's request, the Pirates have released no other  
details of his illness. Stargell, 58, is the Pirates' career leader 
with 475 home runs and is an assistant to general manager Cam 
Bonifay. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Miss America Companion Loves Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- After Miss America 1999 Nicole  
Johnson relinquishes her rhinestone crown later this month, she 
gets to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bonnie Sirgany the reign never stops, it only pauses long  
enough for her to catch up on her own personal life before resuming 
her responsibilities as aide, confidante, road manager, mother and 
24-hour adviser to the world-famous beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
	She is one of two women who alternate each month as Miss  
America's official travel companion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best job,'' said former companion Ellie Taylor, 72,  
who held the job for 17 years. ``You get paid to see the world and 
go to all these wonderful places and meet all these celebrities. 
But it's a hectic month. You need a month off to recuperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sirgany -- who temporarily gives up her duties to Michele  
Brennan next month -- sometimes logs as many as 20,000 miles in a 
month accompanying Miss America on her yearlong national speaking 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	While Miss America gives speeches, poses for pictures and signs  
autographs, Ms. Sirgany tips the porters, writes expense reports, 
runs interference and provides a shoulder to cry on when Miss 
America gets homesick. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of tears have been shed on these shoulders,'' she said.  
``She gives the speeches, I handle the problems. If someone has to 
be a bad guy, it has to be the traveling companion: `I'm sorry, but 
there will be no more autographs.' She can't say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sirgany will take another winner under her wing Sept. 18,  
when a new Miss America is crowned. Contestants for the 79th annual 
pageant begin arriving in Atlantic City today. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, Miss America makes one or two appearances a day, but  
the travel never ends. In July, Miss Johnson visited 14 states -- 
some twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsoring group that requests Miss America's appearance is  
responsible for providing two first-class airline tickets, a 
two-bedroom hotel suite, three meals a day for two people and 
transportation in a vehicle with $1 million worth of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the accommodations are posh, but not always.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've slept everywhere from a $15,000-a-night suite at the  
Plaza Hotel in New York to a cardboard box at a college campus in 
Oskaloosa, Iowa, and everywhere in between,'' Ms. Sirgany said. 
</P>
<P>
	After each appearance, Ms. Sirgany reports to pageant officials  
on how Miss America performed and how well she was prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a touch of mothering involved, such as when Miss  
America wants to go on a date. Miss America can go out without her 
traveling companion, but only if the companion knows where she's 
going and with whom. And the traveling companion waits up for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``You worry more about them than you do about your own kids,''  
Ms. Sirgany said. ``It's somebody else's child and you're 
responsible for them 24 hours a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sirgany, who is divorced, started her career with the  
pageant as a volunteer in 1972. She began traveling with Miss 
America 10 years ago, after her three children all were out of 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	She keeps her personal life simple -- plants that thrive on  
neglect, like cactus and yucca, and no pets. Relatives pick up her 
mail, pay her bills, water the plants and keep an eye on her house 
when she is out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a job for a married woman,'' Ms. Sirgany said.  
</P>
<P>
	Her job has taken her everywhere from classrooms, state capitols  
and amusement parks to homeless shelters, AIDS hospices and 
juvenile detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once, we were locked on death row with five inmates who killed  
their husbands,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the perks?  
</P>
<P>
	``I've met four presidents: Ford, Carter, Bush and Clinton. And  
I went to Clinton's inaugural,'' she said. ``I've been to the Super 
Bowl four times, the World Series once, the Rose Bowl, the Grand 
Prix, the Belmont Stakes and the America's Cup.''

<HEADLINE>  Ngeny Breaks Record for 1,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIETI, Italy (AP) -- Noah Ngeny finally made the move from  
runner-up to record-setter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan, who has helped Hicham El Guerrouj shatter records in  
the mile and 1,500 meters, put himself into the record books Sunday 
by eclipsing the 18-year-old standard for 1,000 meters at the Rieti 
Grand Prix II meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Paced perfectly by countryman David Kiptoo on a sunny afternoon,  
Ngeny glided around the track nestled in majestic mountains 
northeast of Rome in 2 minutes, 11.96 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	That broke former great Sebastian Coe's mark of 2:12.18, set at  
Oslo, Norway, on July 11, 1981 -- when Ngeny was 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing this record has been around 18 years,'' said  
Ngeny, the silver medalist in the 1,500 at the World Championships 
in Seville, Spain, last month. ``I always wanted to be a world 
champion or an Olympic champion. At least now I am a world 
record-holder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny persuaded meet organizers on Thursday to add the rarely  
contested 1,000 to the schedule, and he earned a $25,000 bonus by 
bettering the record. 
</P>
<P>
	He had come within .48 seconds of Coe's mark in a race at Nice,  
France, in July, and chose the right spot for another assault on 
the record. Rieti's track has been the setting for seven world 
records, including four this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny was one of a dozen World Championships medalists competing  
Sunday, including Michael Johnson, who closed his season by winning 
the 200 meters in 20.02. Johnson broke Butch Reynolds' 11-year-old 
world record for the 400 at Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Fiona May, who left Seville contemplating retirement  
after a controversial loss, won the women's long jump Sunday at 22 
feet, 1 1/2 inches. The 1995 world champion said she has not decided 
yet whether to quit the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny has been involved in a series of record attempts during  
his brief career. 
</P>
<P>
	After abandoning his first love, volleyball, because, he said  
Sunday, ``in Kenya, it's the runners who become national heroes,'' 
Ngeny only started competing on the track in 1996. The next year, 
he shattered two world junior records, including Jim Ryun's mile 
mark, which had stood since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Ngeny set the pace as El Guerrouj broke the world  
record for the mile at Rome. Ngeny also pushed the Moroccan to a 
record for the 1,500 at Rome in July 1998. The two also engaged in 
a thrilling duel in the 1,500 at the World Championships, with El 
Guerrouj taking the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny doesn't plan on settling for second on a regular basis.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the year 2000 will be my year,'' he said. ``I'm  
going to concentrate on the 1,500 and the mile, and I think I can 
beat El Guerrouj. I've had a lot of problems (beating him) this 
year, but El Guerrouj will have many problems next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiptoo led Ngeny through the first 400 meters in 49.66, nearly  
1.5 seconds under Coe's pace, and they were 2 seconds faster than 
Coe was through 600. After Kiptoo dropped out, with 300 meters 
left, Ngeny slowed somewhat, but a powerful finish carried him to 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked Kiptoo to run very fast for the first 400 meters, and  
when that went well, I knew I was on for the world record,'' said 
Ngeny, who took a slow victory lap, waving to the capacity crowd of 
nearly 7,000 at Raul Guidobaldi Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson will now fly back to the United States to rest before  
starting preparations for the 2000 Olympics, where he'll defend his 
unprecedented 200-400 double from the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He stumbled at the start of Sunday's race and was well off his  
200 world record of 19.32, but celebrated nonetheless by tossing 
his purple-and-black shoes into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	World bronze medalist Svetlana Krivelyova of Russia won the  
women's shot put at 64-6, a meet record and the sixth-best of the 
year. Konstantinos Gatsioudis of Greece also set a meet record, 
tossing the javelin 276-3. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia easily won the  
women's 1,500 at 4:09.34. Stephane Diagana, the 1997 world champion 
and second at Seville, won the men's 400 hurdles at 48.27. World 
champion Fabrizio Mori of Italy was third at 48.74.

<HEADLINE> Time Barely on Michigan's Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Jarious Jackson was giving Lloyd Carr  
that uneasy feeling coaches often get in the fourth quarter. All 
the Michigan coach could do was hope for the clock to tick faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was driving No. 16 Notre Dame downfield for what would  
have been the winning touchdown. The Irish, starting with 1:38 
remaining, drove from their own 20 to Michigan's 12 before time 
expired Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 Wolverines escaped with a 26-22 victory, and Carr felt  
every bit of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a sick feeling,'' he said. ``I was here for the  
Colorado game. I've seen a lot of bad things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that 1994 game, Kordell Stewart threw a 64-yard pass that  
Michael Westbrook hauled in for a touchdown as time expired and the 
Buffaloes upset Michigan 27-26. With a quarterback as dangerous as 
Jackson, Carr could see it perhaps happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the Irish were heading through the growing shadows  
toward the very same end zone -- at the south end of Michigan 
Stadium -- made it even more painful for Carr to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the defense, `They've got one timeout left. Keep them  
in bounds,''' Carr recalled. ``But in college football, the clock 
stops for every first down. It seemed to last forever. I wouldn't 
want to go through that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, of course, would like to have a situation like that  
every Saturday. He thrives on such challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan had taken the lead on the second touchdown of the day  
by Anthony Thomas, the bruising tailback who rushed for 138 yards 
on 32 carries in intense heat before an NCAA-record crowd of 
111,523. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish quickly spent their last timeout, yet Jackson was  
unfazed, even when things appeared to go against him. His first 
pass was incomplete and the option magician was stopped for no gain 
on second down. No problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson rifled consecutive strikes of 36, eight and 15 yards to  
put the Irish on Michigan's 21-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jarious Jackson has the heart of a lion,'' Carr said. ``He's  
some kind of great football player. There's no quit in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jackson was now fighting the clock as well as the  
Wolverines. He threw incomple on first down, then was sacked for a 
10-yard loss by Dhani Jones to the 31. No problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson sent the ball over the middle that Raki Nelson caught on  
a slant pattern. But safety Tommy Hendricks slammed Nelson to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the crowd could get to its feet, the clock read 0:00 and  
the celebration was on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we could score,'' Jackson said. ``We had two minutes  
left and that's an eternity with two great teams like Michigan and 
Notre Dame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson completed 18 of 28 passes for 302 yards with one  
interception. He had a 19-yard touchdown pass to Jabari Holloway 
and he also rushed for 47 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown 
romp, but a series of sacks caused Jackson to finish with negative 
yardage in that department. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey Getherall got Notre Dame's other TD on a 4-yard run.

	``Momentum changes in a game, and you have to roll with the  
punches,'' Jackson said. ``In the end, time just ran out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Brady, the fifth-year senior who guided Michigan to a 10-3  
record and a share of the Big Ten title a year ago, was almost as 
cool as Jackson -- especially in the fourth quarter when the 
Wolverines needed a touchdown. Brady was 17 of 24 for 197 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Henson, the sophomore who pressed Brady for the starting  
job, played only the second quarter and completed 3 of 8 for 40 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Del Verne kicked field goals of 21, 35, 37 and 27 yards for  
Michigan.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds set a major league  
record with 14 homers in two consecutive games, adding five Sunday 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds, who set the National League record with nine homers  
Saturday night, continued their onslaught Sunday with two homers by 
Jeffrey Hammonds, and one each by Greg Vaughn, Eddie Taubensee and 
Dmitri Young. 
</P>
<P>
	They hit four homers off starter Robert Person, who left after  
giving up Hammonds' second homer leading off the fourth, walking 
pitcher Denny Neagle and allowing a double off the left-center 
field wall to Pokey Reese. Young hit a leadoff homer on Steve 
Schrenk's first pitch of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds surpassed the 1939 New York Yankees and 1961 San  
Francisco Giants, who had 13 homers in two games.

<HEADLINE>  Ngeny Breaks Record for 1,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIETI, Italy (AP) -- Noah Ngeny finally made the move from  
runner-up to record-setter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan, who has helped Hicham El Guerrouj shatter records in  
the mile and 1,500 meters, put himself into the record books Sunday 
by eclipsing the 18-year-old standard for 1,000 meters at the Rieti 
Grand Prix II meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Paced perfectly by countryman David Kiptoo on a sunny afternoon,  
Ngeny glided around the track nestled in majestic mountains 
northeast of Rome in 2 minutes, 11.96 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	That broke former great Sebastian Coe's mark of 2:12.18, set at  
Oslo, Norway, on July 11, 1981 -- when Ngeny was 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing this record has been around 18 years,'' said  
Ngeny, the silver medalist in the 1,500 at the World Championships 
in Seville, Spain, last month. ``I always wanted to be a world 
champion or an Olympic champion. At least now I am a world 
record-holder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny persuaded meet organizers on Thursday to add the rarely  
contested 1,000 to the schedule, and he earned a $25,000 bonus by 
bettering the record. 
</P>
<P>
	He had come within .48 seconds of Coe's mark in a race at Nice,  
France, in July, and chose the right spot for another assault on 
the record. Rieti's track has been the setting for seven world 
records, including four this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny was one of a dozen World Championships medalists competing  
Sunday, including Michael Johnson, who closed his season by winning 
the 200 meters in 20.02. Johnson broke Butch Reynolds' 11-year-old 
world record for the 400 at Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Fiona May, who left Seville contemplating retirement  
after a controversial loss, won the women's long jump Sunday at 22 
feet, 1 1/2 inches. The 1995 world champion said she has not decided 
yet whether to quit the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny has been involved in a series of record attempts during  
his brief career. 
</P>
<P>
	After abandoning his first love, volleyball, because, he said  
Sunday, ``in Kenya, it's the runners who become national heroes,'' 
Ngeny only started competing on the track in 1996. The next year, 
he shattered two world junior records, including Jim Ryun's mile 
mark, which had stood since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Ngeny set the pace as El Guerrouj broke the world  
record for the mile at Rome. Ngeny also pushed the Moroccan to a 
record for the 1,500 at Rome in July 1998. The two also engaged in 
a thrilling duel in the 1,500 at the World Championships, with El 
Guerrouj taking the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngeny doesn't plan on settling for second on a regular basis.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the year 2000 will be my year,'' he said. ``I'm  
going to concentrate on the 1,500 and the mile, and I think I can 
beat El Guerrouj. I've had a lot of problems (beating him) this 
year, but El Guerrouj will have many problems next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiptoo led Ngeny through the first 400 meters in 49.66, nearly  
1.5 seconds under Coe's pace, and they were 2 seconds faster than 
Coe was through 600. After Kiptoo dropped out, with 300 meters 
left, Ngeny slowed somewhat, but a powerful finish carried him to 
the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked Kiptoo to run very fast for the first 400 meters, and  
when that went well, I knew I was on for the world record,'' said 
Ngeny, who took a slow victory lap, waving to the capacity crowd of 
nearly 7,000 at Raul Guidobaldi Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson will now fly back to the United States to rest before  
starting preparations for the 2000 Olympics, where he'll defend his 
unprecedented 200-400 double from the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He stumbled at the start of Sunday's race and was well off his  
200 world record of 19.32, but celebrated nonetheless by tossing 
his purple-and-black shoes into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	World bronze medalist Svetlana Krivelyova of Russia won the  
women's shot put at 64-6, a meet record and the sixth-best of the 
year. Konstantinos Gatsioudis of Greece also set a meet record, 
tossing the javelin 276-3. 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia easily won the  
women's 1,500 at 4:09.34. Stephane Diagana, the 1997 world champion 
and second at Seville, won the men's 400 hurdles at 48.27. World 
champion Fabrizio Mori of Italy was third at 48.74.

<HEADLINE>  Hart Eyes All American Futurity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- The evidence of jockey Kenny Hart's  
propensity for arriving late at the finish line of quarter horse 
racing's biggest race stretches over four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Hart has won more than 3,200 races and just  
about every major stakes race from California to Oklahoma. All 
except the All American Futurity, the quarter horse's version of 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	He's had plenty of chances. Sixteen since 1968. He'll try again  
Monday, possibly for the last time, when he goes to the post with 
the filly Familiar Faces to chase the $1 million first prize 
awarded to the winner of the 440-yard race that takes less than 20 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Four geldings and five fillies are in the field. Ten horses  
qualified in time trials Aug. 19, but Snappy Dragon chipped a bone 
in his left knee in winning his trial and has been scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	Familiar Faces is a longshot. The filly has had only three  
races, winning two. The favorites will be A Delightful Dasher, a 
gelding with earnings of more than $225,000 and the fastest time in 
the trials -- 21.523 seconds -- and Chicks Call Me, winner of all six 
of his races. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart has lost with both favorites and longshots in past All  
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad things and reasons for Hart's losing streak date back to  
his first ride in the All American -- a 20-year-old jockey aboard 
Quincy Rocket in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Quincy Rocket was in the No. 1 post position in the straightaway  
race. When the gates opened, Quincy Rocket hesitated, and by the 
time Hart got him out of the gate, the rest of the field was 50 
yards down the track. Quincy Rocket finished last. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's next ride in the All American was in 1977 and this time  
he had the 2-1 favorite, Town Policy. The gelding would go on to 
have a brilliant career, but on that day, heavy rainfall had left 
the Ruidoso Downs track muddy, especially near the rail, where Town 
Policy was sitting in the No. 2 post. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a drying out track, I had the two hole and it (the  
track) was terrible,'' Hart said. ``When I got to the old paddock, 
I was a length and a half in front and 110 yards left. I end up 
getting beat by a length and a half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The horse that beat Town Policy was Hot Idea, a filly, who broke  
from the No. 9 post and ran down the outside of the straightaway, 
where the track wasn't as muddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see she was kicking up dirt in the lane she ran  
in,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Hart finished second again, this time on a horse called  
Digging For Gold, beaten a half-length by Mr Trucka Jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stumbled bad leaving the gate, but he got up and made a big  
run,'' Hart said. ``Mr Trucka Jet still beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart hasn't come that close again. Effortless Dream finished  
third in 1989 despite getting hit by another horse halfway through 
the race. In 1992, Hart rode First Down and Ten for trainer Jack 
Brooks -- whose seven All American wins is the most by any trainer. 
Again he came up short, finishing third behind another of Brooks' 
horses, Dash Thru Traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart quit riding fulltime two years ago and became a trainer,  
although he continues to ride occasionally in the bigger races. 
This summer, he started as the trainer for Familiar Faces, and the 
filly was ridden in the All American trials by Jacky Martin. But 
Martin also rode Chicks Call Me in the trials, and chose to ride 
the unbeaten grey gelding in the futurity. 
</P>
<P>
	Familiar Faces' owner, Joe Fulton, asked Hart if he'd like to  
ride the filly. He agreed, knowing it was one more shot for him in 
the race he admits he craves to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This probably will be the last time I get to ride the All  
American,'' he said, but then left the door open. ``I've rode it in 
four decades and maybe I'll try it one more time in 2000. I love 
records.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen early Monday  
in light trading as U.S. financial markets were closed for a 
national holiday. Japanese stocks rose following Friday's sharp 
rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.68 yen, down 0.06 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 110.05 yen on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 142.15  
points, or 0.81 percent, to 17,772.14 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 1.26 points, or 0.01 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved slightly lower against  
the yen as some traders retreated to the sidelines because 
financial markets in the United States were closed Monday for the 
Labor Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders in Tokyo were expecting activity to remain light, partly  
because of fears of possible Bank of Japan dollar-buying 
intervention to stem the yen's rapid rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have repeatedly said a premature  
strengthening of the yen is not desirable amid signs that Japan is 
recovering from its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.80 yen, down  
from 117.65 late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started higher following  
Friday's rise of 235.34 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow index closed at 11,078.45, buoyed by slowing  
U.S. job growth in August, which eased market worries about 
inflationary pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tokyo stocks are basically taking their lead from what  
happened in the U.S. Friday,'' said Garry Evans, a strategist at 
HSBC Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 12.72 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,509.72. 
The TOPIX closed up 0.01 points, insignificant in percentage terms, 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 215 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8000 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8400 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.84 yen from 100.50 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Food Can't Hold Medvedev Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andrei Medvedev never has done well with the  
cuisine at the U.S. Open. On Monday, his tennis menu includes one 
of the tournament's remaining favorites, old pal Yevgeny 
Kafelnikov. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Medvedev who decided in 1993 that food services at the  
National Tennis Center was supplying poisoned pasta to the players. 
His stomach was doing flip-flops again Saturday during a 3-6, 6-3, 
3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Lleyton Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, he was blaming himself, not the chef at the  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens when you don't watch what you eat,'' he said.  
``That was my case. I paid the price, almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev decided the culprit was an energy bar he gulped down  
before playing Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it gave me less energy than it was supposed to,'' he  
said. ``Believe me, I will not take it for my next match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be against third-seeded Kafelnikov, who advanced  
Saturday with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Jonas Bjorkman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can play him with my eyes closed,'' Medvedev said. ``He can  
do the same. We practice every day here. We know where we are 
hitting the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has won their last two meetings after Medvedev won  
five of the first six. 
</P>
<P>
	They often spice their matches with friendly wagers. They can be  
playing for $50,000 in prize money but the bets for pocket change 
are more motivating. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we put $20 before the match on the side, the match will be  
more interesting,'' Medvedev explained. ``I still have his money in 
the pocket. 
</P>

shaking when you are going for the passing shot or the winner,'' he 
said. ``The one who is better prepared for that day will win.''

</P>
<P>
	``I have a feeling you can be walking naked on the street and  
still nobody will look at you. You can drive a super modern tank,

<P>
	Medvedev is fascinated by the bustle of the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``You walk out on the street, just down from my apartment, I'm  
in the middle of everything,'' he said. ``You get straight into 
life. If you don't watch your head, the people will take you with 
the way they move. They will force you in the direction they're 
moving. It's great 
</P>
<P>
	``I think 11 p.m. in Central Park, you will see thousands of  
people running, jogging. Maybe they don't like to stay home. I 
don't know. Maybe they have problems with their girlfriends or 
boyfriends, and they like to run. I don't have this problem. I stay 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend at the moment is Anke Huber, who defeated No. 15  
Amelie Mauresmo 6-4, 6-4 Sunday to reach the quarterfinals of the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Would they be getting married soon? Medvedev, who turned 25 last  
week, seemed astounded at the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Married? No,'' he said. ``Too young. I win a couple of rounds  
and you think I should get married. Really, come on. I've won a 
couple of rounds before and I never got married, so why should I 
now?''

<HEADLINE>  Food Can't Hold Medvedev Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andrei Medvedev never has done well with the  
cuisine at the U.S. Open. On Monday, his tennis menu includes one 
of the tournament's remaining favorites, old pal Yevgeny 
Kafelnikov. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Medvedev who decided in 1993 that food services at the  
National Tennis Center was supplying poisoned pasta to the players. 
His stomach was doing flip-flops again Saturday during a 3-6, 6-3, 
3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Lleyton Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, he was blaming himself, not the chef at the  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens when you don't watch what you eat,'' he said.  
``That was my case. I paid the price, almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev decided the culprit was an energy bar he gulped down  
before playing Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it gave me less energy than it was supposed to,'' he  
said. ``Believe me, I will not take it for my next match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be against third-seeded Kafelnikov, who advanced  
Saturday with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Jonas Bjorkman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can play him with my eyes closed,'' Medvedev said. ``He can  
do the same. We practice every day here. We know where we are 
hitting the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov has won their last two meetings after Medvedev won  
five of the first six. 
</P>
<P>
	They often spice their matches with friendly wagers. They can be  
playing for $50,000 in prize money but the bets for pocket change 
are more motivating. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we put $20 before the match on the side, the match will be  
more interesting,'' Medvedev explained. ``I still have his money in 
the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have bets every day, every single day. Sometimes I win,  
sometimes he wins. At the moment, I've got his money. The next 
week, it can turn around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev is looking forward to Monday's match. He even knows who  
will win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is who is hitting the ball better and whose hand is not  
shaking when you are going for the passing shot or the winner,'' he 
said. ``The one who is better prepared for that day will win.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 11-Year-Old Driver Crashes, Kills 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RONAN, Mont. (AP) -- An 11-year-old girl driving her mother's  
car, apparently with permission, lost control of the vehicle and 
crashed, killing a 9-year-old girl who was a passenger, authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger was thrown from the car when it crashed Saturday  
night, Montana Highway Patrolman Tim Wyckoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three girls were in the car, which overturned twice and came to  
rest on its top. The driver and a 13-year-old passenger were taken 
to a hospital and released with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyckoff said the driver told him she lost control of the car  
when she reached down to pick up something on the floor. The car 
was traveling about 45 mph and went down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the girls wore a seat belt.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Polices Seeking Tommy Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Guilford County authorities have  
arrested one Motley Crue member and have another one in their 
sights -- drummer Tommy Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassist Nikki Sixx was nabbed Friday night at a show in Raleigh  
on charges of inciting a riot at a Greensboro concert in October 
1997. Sixx was charged with felony rioting and three misdemeanor 
charges of inciting a riot, assault and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Former heavy metal bandmate Lee wasn't arrested with Sixx  
because he didn't perform at the Raleigh show. Sixx posted a $7,500 
bond early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff B.J. Barnes has threatened to list Lee on a national  
wanted list if he doesn't turn himself in. If that happens, Lee 
could be arrested anywhere in the country and hauled back to 
Guilford County, where he faces the same charges as Sixx. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1997 concert, Sixx allegedly directed racial slurs at  
a guard and encouraged the crowd of 2,500 to attack the guard. 
Witnesses said Sixx and Lee also poured a drink onto the guard's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard and his employer sued Sixx and Lee last year. That  
civil trial is scheduled for November.

<HEADLINE> Old Habits Wins All American Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- Old Habits ran such an impressive  
race Sunday, he had time to celebrate even before reaching the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful-striding 3-year-old quarter horse had a two-length  
win in the 440-yard, $237,871 All American Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Habits, who finished second behind Falling In Loveagain in  
last year's $2 million All American Derby, avenged that loss with a 
nearly flawless sprint from the starting gate to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	The longshot Okey Dokey Dale was a neck in front of Falling In  
Loveagain for second. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was worth $118,935 for the owners of Old Habits, a  
syndicate of 10 women from California who each invested $1,850 to 
buy the horse as a yearling two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Habits has proven to be a terrific investment. His win  
Sunday was his seventh in 13 races over two seasons and boosted his 
career earnings to just over $522,525. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Habits broke alertly from the No. 10 post position, took the  
lead almost immediately while drifting in toward the middle of the 
track and then put on a burst of speed. He was still pulling away 
at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He broke super today,'' jockey Dusty Stimpson said. ``He  
really hasn't been leaving that good, but today he was on his 
toes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stimpson said just short of the finish line, Old Habits knew he  
was a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right at the end, he started pricking his ears up a little  
bit, just playing around a little, but we had them beat far enough 
it didn't matter,'' Stimpson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Habits covered the 440 yards in 21.38 seconds and paid  
$12.40, $7.00 and $4.40. Okey Dokey Dale paid $17.80 and $7.20 to 
place and Falling In Loveagain returned $3.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Habits' trainer, Danny Cardoza, is a former jockey who was  
the winning rider in the All American Derby in 1975 with Vim and 
Vigor and in 1984 with Dashs Dream.

<HEADLINE> Chips, Fries Big Part of Kids' Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Kids aren't fat just because they're couch  
potatoes, but because they stuff themselves with mountains of 
potatoes cooked the least healthy way, a researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	Potato chips and French fries make up more than one-quarter of  
the vegetable servings eaten by children, and nearly one-third of 
the veggies eaten by teen-agers, according to a survey compiled by 
Catherine Champagne of LSU's Pennington Biomedical Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not surprising, considering the number of people who jam  
mall food courts and burger joints, said Champagne, who calculated 
the information from USDA annual surveys for 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just sort of confirmed what I suspected -- that for some  
people the only way they get vegetables might be in this form. And 
that's really sad,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Champagne, an associate research professor at Pennington and a  
registered dietitian, used the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	That survey's database translates each kind of food into food  
pyramid servings. For instance, French fries are both vegetable and 
fat. A superdeluxe pizza includes bread, fat, cheese, meat, and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA defines a serving of vegetables as 1 cup of raw leafy  
vegetables, a half- cup of other vegetables, or 3/4 cup of vegetable 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Champagne looked at the total figures for vegetables, then  
checked for fries and chips, and worked out what percentage they 
made up of the total. She presented her findings at a conference 
sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and others at Emory 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	She found that even children younger than 7 years old got 27.3  
percent of their vegetables as fries and chips. The figure rose to 
28.9 percent for children aged 7 to 12, 31.2 percent for those aged 
13 to 18 -- and 40 percent for black teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do I find that not surprising, when one-fourth of the  
breakfasts eaten by adults in the United States are eaten at 
McDonalds?'' said Dr. Harold Solomon, a childhood obesity 
specialist at Beth Israel-Deaconess Hospital and an associate 
professor at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Liebman of the Center for Science in the Public Interest  
uses snacks to get her own three children to eat more fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the late afternoon, they're starving. I'll cut up carrots,  
red peppers, maybe give them a little dressing to dip it in, and 
put it next to them while they're doing their homework. It's 
usually gone by dinner,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad our culture says you should eat junk between  
meals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA's data is solid and Champagne's approach sounds  
reasonable, said Michael Goran, a professor of preventive medicine 
at the University of Southern California and a specialist in 
childhood obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very sound,'' said American Dietetic Association  
spokeswoman Jackie Berning, an assistant professor at the 
University of Colorado in Colorado Springs.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs Cut Veteran Punter Aguiar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Veteran punter Louie Aguiar was among 18  
players released Sunday as the Kansas City Chiefs trimmed their 
roster to 53 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar, 33, averaged 42.6 yards per punt in his five-year stint  
with the Chiefs. He came back from an offseason battle with 
testicular cancer to average 43 yards in 1998, but struggled in the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Daniel Pope, acquired on waivers from Detroit after  
Kansas City cut Sean Fleming in the third week of the preseason, 
replaces Aguiar. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguiar averaged almost a yard more per punt than Pope, but  
Pope's net average of 33 yards was far better than Aguiar's 20.2 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came down to Danny Pope and his hang time,'' Chiefs coach  
Gunther Cunningham said. ``I feel like we can get the ball in our 
hands off the punt. He hung the ball 4.8, 4.9 (seconds), and I 
think he'll average around 44 (yards).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs also settled on Todd Collins over undrafted rookie  
Ted White as their third-string quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who did not play as the Chiefs' third quarterback last  
year, solidified his spot with his performance in Kansas City's 
final exhibition game on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He completed 6-of-7 passes for 82 yards and led Kansas City on  
two late scoring drives in a 34-27 win over San Diego.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- English actress Kate Beckinsale is in another  
world since the birth of her daughter, Lily. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, it's brilliant,'' she said. ``I think you're in

<HEADLINE> Actor Costner Has No Regrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After huge hits like ``The Untouchables'' and  
``Dances With Wolves'' gave way to big flops like ``The Postman'' 
and ``Waterworld,'' Kevin Costner knows that whatever he does, he 
does it in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
	He also knows that trait makes some vocal critics see him as the  
perfect example of everything they hate about Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear things,'' Costner says in Sunday's Daily News. ``I'm  
not immune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his failures, the Academy Award-winner has no regrets.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I don't see myself clearly, I don't know,'' Costner  
said. ``Maybe there's an arrogance about me or whatever. But I know 
the way I feel about movies is really pure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy about the things I've done. I'm not always happy  
about the results, but I'm happy about the choices I've made, 
because I've made them myself. I love `Wyatt Earp,' and I really 
love `The Postman,' and I loved making `The War,''' he said, 
referring to three box office bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would stack my movies up with anybody's movies, all the  
sequels included.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his latest film, ``For Love of the Game,'' Costner returns to  
the baseball diamond, where he has succeeded with ``Bull Durham'' 
and ``Field of Dreams.'' The actor who played baseball in college 
portrays a once-great pitcher trying to go out in style.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Split Over Waco Blame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers split Sunday over who should take  
the blame for foul-ups in the Waco investigation, with Republicans 
demanding that Attorney General Janet Reno resign while Democrats 
asked why Reno should be held responsible for FBI mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Republican presidential candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, and businessman Steve Forbes, said that if they were in the 
White House they would fire Reno for her handling of Waco and other 
Justice Department matters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he saw a double standard  
in Republican attacks on Reno, long a target of GOP criticism, 
while no one is demanding the resignation of FBI director Louis 
Freeh, whose organization is at the center of the latest 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI recently admitted that combustible tear gas was used in  
the 1993 siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, 
reversing six years of Justice and FBI denials that such devices 
were used. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, with backing from Freeh, has promised an independent  
investigation into the contradiction. Both have stressed that the 
flammable canisters were shot at a storm shelter away from the main 
building, and there is no change in the conclusion that the 
Davidians set the fires that killed some 80 of their members. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McNulty, a filmmaker who has questioned those  
conclusions, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that he had new evidence 
that federal operatives were firing ``long streams of automatic 
weapons fire'' at the back of the compound, preventing those inside 
from escaping the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Former FBI agent Richard Schwein, who was at Waco, said that was  
``absolutely false,'' that ``not one round was fired by an FBI 
agent during that tragic day.'' Schwein, on Fox, also denied that 
military officers on the scene as observers had any role in 
operations against David Koresh and the Davidians. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Sunday that the Pentagon's Special  
Operations Command was monitoring the situation virtually from the 
start of the 51-day siege, and was briefing the Defense secretary 
and other senior Defense officials. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, asked by reporters Saturday if he had  
confidence in Reno and Freeh, pointedly supported Reno but not 
Freeh. On Freeh, he said he said there wasn't ``any purpose to 
assign blame until the investigation is concluded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leading Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. John  
Conyers of Michigan, also noted on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that 
``we have an incident here in which Janet Reno is now being blamed 
for what the FBI didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, said Schumer on ABC's ``This Week,'' ``has been an  
independent, down-the-middle person who gets Democrats mad 
sometimes, Republicans mad sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans say the Waco case is only the latest in which  
Reno has stiff-armed congressional inquiries or claimed she wasn't 
getting all the right facts. They have clashed over her decision 
not to name an independent counsel to investigate Democratic 
campaign fund raising, and her handling of alleged Chinese 
espionage at nuclear weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	There's ``a long series of cases where the attorney general  
seems to be always the last person to know,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, on NBC and CNN's ``Late Edition'' said that while the  
Justice Department, which has authority over the FBI, is ``in a 
shambles'' because of poor management, Freeh is the ``single best'' 
FBI director he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
	House Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind.,  
who plans hearings on the Waco question, pointed out on CBS ``Face 
the Nation'' that Freeh was not director at the time of the siege 
and ``Louis Freeh is not a big problem here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's relationship with Freeh has been questioned since he  
differed with her decision not to appoint an independent counsel 
over the fund-raising issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Conyers said he was a ``little bit shaken by the fact that an  
FBI director should second guess an attorney general'' and Sen. 
Joseph Biden said he felt ``overwhelming disappointment'' that the 
FBI had misled Reno on Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very regrettable that people up to and including the  
president are now being asked to choose sides,'' former Attorney 
General Dick Thornburgh said on CNN. ``I've never seen a situation 
like this where there has been this split between the two 
agencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatch also said he had talked to both Reno and Freeh this  
week and had been assured by both that they were on good terms and 
reports of differences between the two were blown out of 
proportion.

<HEADLINE> Heritage of Gold Wins at Saratoga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Heritage of Gold recorded her  
sixth win in eight starts this year when she came from just off the 
pace to register a one-length victory over Khumba Mela in the 
$300,000, Grade II Diana Handicap at Saratoga on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage of Gold had been third on the dirt behind Banshee  
Breeze and Beautiful Pleasure in the Grade I Go For Wand Stakes in 
her previous start at Saratoga on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Mossflower, making her first start on the turf, was another neck  
back in third in the field of nine fillies and mares 3 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Shane Sellers, Heritage of Gold covered 1 1/8 miles on a  
firm turf course in 1:45:4, just 2-5 of a second off the stakes 
record posted by Waya in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage of Gold, a 4-year-old filly by Gold Legend, earned  
$180,000 for Jack Garey and returned $13.80, $7.80 and $4.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Khumba Mela paid $11 and $7.10, while Mossflower was $6.10 to  
show.

	Violence Mars Kosovo Peace Efforts  
</P>
<P>
	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A rocket-propelled grenade  
killed an ethnic Albanian in northern Kosovo today, the latest link 
in a chain of violence bedeviling international efforts to 
establish normality in the province. Officials of the NATO-led 
Kosovo peacekeeping force said the grenade smashed through the 
windshield of a truck driven by the victim, killing him and 
wounding a woman riding in the cab. Also today, U.S. lawmakers said 
peacekeepers might be able to compromise with former rebels who 
don't want to disband their army. The ethnic Albanian Kosovo 
Liberation Army faces a late September deadline to demilitarize.

	Two Cars Explode in Northern Israel  
</P>
<P>
	TIBERIAS, Israel (AP) -- Two car blasts in northern Israeli  
cities killed three people today -- probably the bombers themselves 
-- and left a fourth person in critical condition in attacks likely 
aimed at halting the newly revived peace process, police said. The 
explosions in the cities of Tiberias and Haifa came hours after a 
signing ceremony for the first Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement 
negotiated since Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office. The 
land-for-security pact hinges on the Palestinians agreeing to fight 
terror attacks.

	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Fresh from a diplomatic victory in the  
Middle East, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is next turning 
her sights to challenges of a far different nature in Vietnam. En 
route to the APEC summit in New Zealand, Albright is squeezing in a 
26-hour, two-city stopover packed with protocol activities and 
talks with the communist country's top two leaders and her 
counterpart, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. Albright was 
scheduled to arrive in Vietnam tomorrow.

	Militias Besiege E. Timor Capital  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people crammed  
aboard ferries and planes to flee East Timor today, as 
pro-Indonesian militias besieged a U.N. compound and set fire to 
homes belonging to people who support independence for the 
province. Casualty reports were impossible to verify, though 
witnesses said scores were killed today in the former Portuguese 
colony. Staff at two hospitals said they had treated about a dozen 
patients for machete wounds.

	Dennis Finally Leaves North Carolina  
</P>
<P>
	CEDAR ISLAND, N.C. (AP) -- Demoted to a tropical depression,  
Dennis turned its back today on North Carolina after pounding the 
coast for a week and finally coming ashore to flood lowland towns 
with half a foot of rain. Dennis appeared to be leaving for good, 
drifting northwest toward southwestern Virginia. The storm last 
night spun off a tornado in Hampton, Va., that injured more than a 
dozen people. Formed Aug. 24, Dennis skirted North Carolina's coast 
Aug. 30, went seaward 165 miles, stalled and then backtracked.

	Lawmakers Split Over Waco Blame  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers split today over who should take the  
blame for foul-ups in the Waco investigation, with Republicans 
demanding that Attorney General Janet Reno resign. Two Republican 
presidential candidates, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and businessman 
Steve Forbes, said that if they were in the White House they would 
fire Reno for her handling of Waco and other Justice Department 
matters. But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he saw a double 
standard in Republican attacks on Reno, long a target of GOP 
criticism, while no one is demanding the resignation of FBI 
director Louis Freeh, whose organization is at the center of the 
controversy.

	Belgian Film a Hit at Italy Festival

<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Italian critics gave a big thumbs-up today  
to a little film from a virtually unknown Belgian director, calling 
it a contender for the Golden Lion, the Venice Film Festival's top 
prize. ``A Pornographic Liaison'' got a solid 10 minutes of 
applause at its premiere screening. Critics at the film festival 
said it eclipsed another early favorite -- ``Holy Smoke,'' by 
Australian Jane Campion, director of ``The Piano,'' which garnered 
a best actress Oscar in 1993 for Holly Hunter.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Comets won their third straight WNBA  
championship today, defeating the New York Liberty 59-47. One day 
after playing one of her worst games, Cynthia Cooper played one of 
her toughest, scoring 24 points as the Comets remained the league's 
only champion. Even in the heat of the championship game, thoughts 
were never far from Comets guard Kim Perrot, who died Aug. 19 
following a seven-month battle with cancer. One banner read ``3 for 
10'' imploring the Comets to win their third WNBA title for Perrot, 
who wore No. 10.

<HEADLINE> Study: OSHA Inspections Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal inspections of American workplaces  
have been conducted less frequently during the Clinton 
administration than at any time since the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act was brand new, a study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration responds that it is using its money  
to target the most egregious offenders, and the agency's budget has 
been cut in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health  
Administration conducted 33,697 inspections, according the 
examination of government records by the liberal consumer group 
Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer inspections were conducted in only three previous years:  
1995 and 1996, during Clinton's first term, with 26,396 and 25,850 
inspections respectively, and in 1972, the year after OSHA was 
implemented, when 17,164 inspections were logged. 
</P>
<P>
	More typically during the past three decades inspections have  
ranged from about 40,000 to 80,000 a year, with a high of 89,859 
hit in 1975, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found a decline in the number of serious, willful  
or repeat violations of workplace health and safety laws identified 
during Clinton's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that there's an incredible dearth of inspections,''  
said Public Citizen researcher Peter Lurie. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said that OSHA inspections are  
more effectively targeted than before. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're doing is going after the most egregious employers.  
We are going after the bad actors,'' said Herman. ``In the past, 
what OSHA has done has been random.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more targeted inspection strategy has coincided with OSHA  
budget cuts approved by Congress since Republicans took control 
after the 1994 elections. President Clinton has requested a $35 
million raise for the agency next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``OSHA wants to do more,'' said Charles N. Jeffress, assistant  
secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, in a written 
statement responding to the Public Citizen study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that both random OSHA investigations and those  
triggered by concerns -- such as a complaint or a company's past 
history of OSHA violations -- are down. 
</P>
<P>
	Workplace injuries, illnesses and deaths have declined in recent  
years. The 6,026 job-related deaths in 1998 was the lowest number 
since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping a national 
tally. In 1997, the number of illnesses and injuries fell for the 
fifth straight year, to 6.1 million, or 7.1 per 100 full-time 
workers.

	``The measure of OSHA's success is not told through inspection  
numbers or flawed research. The real measure is in making the 
workplace more safe and healthful,'' said Jeffress. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Public Citizen, in its report, noted that workplace  
inspections are important for reasons that may not show up in 
yearly tallies of on-the-job mishaps and deaths. For example, poor 
working conditions can cause illnesses that may not affect a person 
for years, such as cancer and lung disease.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Signs Goalie Bob Essensa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- In the wake of Nikolai Khabibulin's  
holdout, the Phoenix Coyotes signed goaltender Bob Essensa on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Essensa, an unrestricted free agent, signed a one-year deal.  
Contract terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Khabibulin, a restricted free agent who earned $1.25 million in  
1998, won 32 games last season to tie for fourth-best in the NHL. 
He reportedly is seeking a multiyear deal for up to $4 million per 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Coyotes, who claim they lost $10 million last season  
because of ongoing problems with their lease at America West Arena, 
seem reluctant to pay that kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Smith has not revealed the club's offer to  
Khabibulin, who played in 205 of the Coyotes' 246 games since the 
team relocated from Winnipeg in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 27 days, eight preseason games and 12 quality practice  
days,'' said new Coyotes head coach Bob Francis. ``Whoever is in 
net, the focus is getting that person ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Coyotes signed Essensa, Mikhail Shtalenkov was the  
only goalie they had in camp with NHL experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Essensa, 33, was originally drafted by Winnipeg in 1983 and  
played six seasons with the Jets, winning 116 games and notching 14 
shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to Detroit in 1994 but played only 13 games before  
being dealt to Edmonton in 1996. Essensa compiled a 22-28-7 record 
over three seasons with the Oilers, including a 12-14-6 mark last 
season.

<HEADLINE>  Mike Weir Wins On Native Soil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SURREY, British Columbia (AP) -- Mike Weir, sparked by eagle 2  
from 147 yards on No. 14, won the $2.5 million Air Canada 
Championship on Sunday, becoming the first Canadian to win a PGA 
Tour event on native soil in 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Overcoming a persistent drizzle, Weir recorded his first career  
victory, and earned the first-place purse of $450,000, closing with 
a 7-under-par 64 and 18-under 266 total at the suburban Vancouver 
Northview Golf and Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Funk, the third-round leader who began the day 13 under,  
made a hard charge with four birdies on the back nine, including a 
30-footer on 17, but his 68 left him two strokes behind Weir. 
</P>
<P>
	Funk's last hope to force a playoff ended when his tee shot at  
the par-4 18th landed in the rough, forcing him to lay up in front 
of the pond guarding the green. He eventually settled for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Franco, a two-time winner in his rookie year, closed with  
a 69 and was third at 270. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir, a 29-year-old left-hander, was the first Canadian to win  
on tour since Richard Zokol won the Greater Milwaukee Open in 1992. 
Pat Fletcher is the last Canadian to win on native soil, doing so 
at the 1954 Canadian Open, which was held at Vancouver's Point Grey 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll hit me later on. I'm just in shock, actually,''  
said Weir, who was 14 under over the final two rounds. ``It was an 
unbelievable day for me to have better breaks happen, more putts to 
roll in, it was just an unbelievable day. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my first win, it's really special, especially to do it at  
home here. It's unbelievable, I don't know what to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his eagle, he said, ``That was pretty special. It came off  
perfect. I couldn't have imagined it or visualized it any better. 
For it to go in, it was unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the ninth first-time winner on the PGA Tour this season  
and becomes the sixth left-hander to win, joining Phil Mickelson, 
Bob Charles, Ernie Gonzalez, Sam Adams and Russ Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning the day 11 under and two behind Funk, Weir gained a  
share of the lead by going 3 under on the front nine, capped with a 
25-foot birdie putt on 9. That put him into a brief three-way tie 
atop the leaderboard with Funk and Franco. After a birdie on 12 and 
a bogey on 13, Weir took control on the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
	From the first cut of rough left of the fairway, Weir aimed his  
second shot at the pin of the par-4, 400-yard hole. His shot hopped 
four times on the green before rolling 12 feet to bounce in off the 
flag stick. The shot drew a momentous ovation from the large 
gallery following Weir. 
</P>
<P>
	The eagle vaulted Weir to 17 under, giving him a two-shot lead  
over Funk and Franco, who at the time was struggling to save a 
bogey, making a 25-foot putt on 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir then all but clinched the victory with a 20-foot birdie  
putt on 16 that took him to 18 under, at the time three shots ahead 
of Funk, his nearest contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir, who previously had two fifth-place finishes at the  
Vancouver event, had already enjoyed a solid season, which featured 
four top 10 finishes, including a second-place finish at the 
Motorola Western Open in July. He was also in the final group with 
Tiger Woods at last month's PGA Championship, before shooting a 
final-round 80 to finish 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave Weir just under $1.3 million in earnings this  
season, moving him into the top 20 on the money list for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott McCarron set a course record with a 10-under 71. Opening  
the day tied for 47th in a group of eight at 2 under, McCarron 
began on the back nine, where he shot a 30, and then completed his 
round with a 5 under on the front nine to finish in three-way tie 
for fourth place at 12-under 272 with Phil Tataurangi and Payne 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron's round broke the Northview record of 62 set by Joel  
Edwards, also on the final day, in 1997. It also marked his 
career-low round, breaking his previous best by two strokes, 
recorded at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in 1997.
