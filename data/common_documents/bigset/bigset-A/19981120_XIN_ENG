<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Applauds APEC Leaders Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 19 (Xinhua) -- China's influential People's
Daily has praised this week's APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation) Leaders Informal Meeting in Kuala Lumpur as "a
meeting of important significance" in the forum's development.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, held in the Malaysian capital city on
Tuesday and Wednesday, was convened on a "positive note", and
reached a "fruitful conclusion", the newspaper said in its Friday
editorial.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the focus on the financial crisis, which is still
plaguing many member economies, led to an important consensus
among the leaders to strengthen cooperation so as to check the
crisis, resume economic growth and improve the world financial
system.
</P>
<P>
The leaders came out of their informal meeting, the sixth of
its kind since 1993, with the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, in
addition to two other documents -- the APEC Agenda for Science and
Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st Century, and the
Skills Development Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
The adoption and endorsement of these documents, the paper
said, demonstrated that APEC had withstood the test of the
financial turmoil and was functioning in a constructive manner.
</P>
<P>
These documents would help boost cooperation among APEC members
in fighting the financial crisis, and in promoting common
prosperity, world economic development and stability, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper went on to say that China attached great
importance to the promotion of trade and investment
liberalization, one of APEC's two key pillars, and viewed it as an
important means by which members could strengthen cooperation and
secure common development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the active efforts of APEC members in recent years,
the economies in the Asia-Pacific region had scored positive
achievements in their development, opening-up and cooperation, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
APEC's principle and spirit in pursuing voluntarism,
flexibility and consensus-building was borne out in the Kuala
Lumpur meeting's decision that APEC members should be allowed to
work towards trade and investment liberalization on the basis of
voluntarism.
</P>
<P>
The decision also reflected the diversity and different levels
of development among APEC members.
</P>
<P>
Complementing and reinforcing the bid for trade and investment
liberalization was economic and technical cooperation (Ecotech),
the other pillar of the APEC process, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper hailed the adoption of the APEC Agenda for
Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st Century,
advocated by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at last year's leaders
informal meeting in Vancouver, Canada, as an important step in
strengthening Ecotech.
</P>
<P>
The move, which Jiang wished to become a milestone in the
development of economic and technical cooperation among APEC
members, manifested China's constructive role in APEC, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial finally called on APEC members to join in
strengthening cooperation in the face of the Asian financial
crisis, pointing out that they could surmount the difficulties,
temporarily brought about by the crisis, through their concerted
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the editorial said, APEC members could meet the
challenges of economic globalization and the knowledge economy,
bring into the new century an Asia-Pacific region with broad
prospects for development and make greater contributions to the
region and the world at large.

<HEADLINE> Resignations Calls for Man United's Bosses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Angry shareholders demanded
the resignation of Manchester United's chairman and chief
executive at the annual general meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The calls for chief executive Martin Edwards and chairman Sir
Roland Smith to step down followed a confrontation at Old
Trafford between police and some 1,500 shareholder fans who are
protesting the proposed takeover bid of the football team by
Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
The media magnate's proposed 623 million pounds acquisition of
the club on September 9 has sparked fury among many fans.
</P>
<P>
At Old Trafford, shareholders wanted the board to acknowledge
their opposition to the BSkyB deal and to urge fellow
shareholders not to sell their shares to any pro-takeover groups.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jonathan Michie, of the organization Shareholders
United Against Murdoch, said: "Now the takeover has been referred
to the Monopolies and Merger Commission (MMC) the bid has
formally lapsed, which means BSkyB have to return any acceptances
of their offer to buy shares and it's back to square one.
</P>
<P>
"If the MMC approves the bid it has to be re-submitted to
shareholders and we will be asking the board of directors to act
differently to when they approved the first offer.
</P>
<P>
"They should reject it or at least consider it with an open
mind and take into account the overwhelming weight of public
concern," he added.

ATHENS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Parliament approved
Thursday two U.N. Security Council resolutions which call for the
establishment of two international criminal courts to deal with
the violation of human rights in former Yugoslavia in 1991 and
Rwanda and neighboring countries in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During a parliamentary debate, Greece's Alternate Foreign

proof that mankind did not wish to be an indifferent observer to
barbarity.
</P>
<P>
But he also echoed the dissatisfaction voiced by some Greek
parliamentarians who accused the international community of being
"selective."
</P>
<P>
Some Greek parliamentarians complained that crimes committed by
neighboring Turkey against Hellenism and other peoples, including
Greek Cypriots and the Kurdish people, had gone unpunished.

<HEADLINE> NATO Concerned About Provocation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- NATO expressed on Thursday
its concern over the deteriorating situation in Kosovo, stating
that repeated provocative incidents could destabilize the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the
16-nation western military alliance, said in a written statement
that the alliance is deeply concerned about the deteriorating
security situation in the Yugoslav province where a sharp increase
in tension flared up since the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
The incidents, NATO claimed, risk creating a dangerous cycle of
provocation and response which, if continued, could destabilize
the cease-fire and reverse the recent improvement in the
humanitarian situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The incidents also risk jeopardizing the arrangements being put
into place by NATO and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for verification of the cease-fire
and of compliance with the relevant United Nations Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
NATO is monitoring closely the situation in Kosovo, the
statement said, and has made its concerns clear to both the
authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the leaders
of the ethnic Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
NATO insists that all parties comply fully with the U.N.
resolutions and their other commitments by observing the
cease-fire, avoiding provocation and moving toward negotiations on
a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance is readying an extraction force
that will be put on standby in nearby Macedonia in case that the
OSCE verifiers encounter uncertain and dangerous situations in
Kosovo. The extraction forces will be called in to extract the
verifiers to safety.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Should Look Away From Donor Dependence: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said Thursday that his country should look away from
exclusive donor dependence if its economy has to develop, the
Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Officiating a three-day national convention held here on the
re-vitalization of the Zambian economy, Chiluba said withholding
of funding by donors has given Zambia impetus to look elsewhere
for revenue.
</P>
<P>
The donors have not released their pledged aid of 530 million
U.S. Dollars for this year on the grounds that Zambia has not
completed its privatization of copper mines.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his country has the potential to earn export
revenue and it needs to develop non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
The non-traditional exports, said the president, have in
recent months contributed greatly to national revenue and
outstriped by far the traditional copper revenue, which used to
register more than 80 percent of Zambia's foreign exchange
earnings in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Our survival lies in the non-traditional sector, agriculture
in particular, which has the highest potential to support both
primary and secondary industries," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised the need to boost agricultural productivity,
saying Zambia can not feel proud currently as it is consistently
failing to feed itself.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the country with 9.7 million people and a
vast cultivatable land has the potential to feed the region but
was unable to do so due to poor implementation of its good
policies.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the convention which attracted participants from
a cross-section of the economy to come up with policy
implementation strategies and programs that will enable the
country achieve the dual objective of sufficient food production
and increased export earnings from agricultural exports.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Protest Turkey Over Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece on Thursday
agreed to join forces to protest against Turkey's construction of
a nuclear power plant on its southern coast.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting here between Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and visiting Greek Minister for the
Aegean Elizabeth Papazoi who arrived here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Papazoi said that Turkey aspires
to be a tourist destination, but its intention to construct
thirty nuclear power plants, most of which would be erected on
its southern coast, is "an unjustifiable energy choice."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has announced a plan to construct a nuclear energy
plant in Akkuyu, on Turkey's southern coast, north of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Papazoi noted that the plant would directly affect the
environment and the tourist industry in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister said that Turkey, "with its
anti-environmental profile, can not guarantee that this plant will
operate on modern models," adding that it would only cover two
percent of Turkey's future needs, at a price three times higher
than today's cost of hydroelectric and natural gas power.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Akkuyu plant would be an environmental
hazard, as the location is prone to earthquakes, adding that a
nuclear accident would greatly affect the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
It is for this reason that Greece and Cyprus must cooperate to
prevent the construction of the plant, Papazoi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Referring to her meeting with Clerides, Papazoi said that they
also discussed other matters such as bilateral cooperation, as
well as the multiple pollution caused by Turkey's heavy industries
and their untreated toxic waste that flows into the sea.

<HEADLINE> PQ Has Slight Lead in Upcoming Election, Poll Says </HEADLINE>

<P>
OTTAWA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois
(PQ) is maintaining its narrow lead over the Liberal Party after a
crucial debate between the province's three main party leaders
this week.
</P>
<P>
A new poll on Thursday, coming less than two weeks before the
provincial elections on November 30, shows support for the third
party Action Democratique, leaping from 7.3 percent support last
week to 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new poll, conducted after a two-hour debate between the
three main party leaders on Tuesday, put the PQ support at 44.3
percent, compared with 42.4 percent for the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
This was a slight drop of 2.5 percent for both the PQ and the
Liberals from a poll taken a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey, with a error margin of 3.1 percentage points
questioned a sample of 1,009 voters.

<HEADLINE> Euro, Cape Verde Escudo to be Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
recommended a decision to confirm the future relations between the
euro and the Cape Verde escudo.
</P>
<P>
The decision will finally be made by 15 ministers of the EU
member states. This would ensure that the present arrangement,
under which the convertibility of the Cape Verde escudo into the
Portuguese escudo at a fixed parity is ensured by aid of a limited
credit facility provided by the Portuguese government, should not
be materially affected by the transition to the euro.
</P>
<P>
The fixed parity between the euro and Cape Verde escudo will
follow from the official conversion rate fixed on January 1, 1999
between the euro and Portuguese escudo, the EU commission
proposed.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has concluded an exchange rate cooperation agreement
with Cape Verde, which reflects the historical ties of friendship
and cooperation between the two countries, according to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
The EU will, from next January 1, have exclusive competence for
external exchange rate matters for countries which participate in
the euro, the commission said, this means that an EU decision of
the Council of Ministers is required to confirm the continuation
of the present arrangement concerning the Cape Verde escudo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Construction Surges Briskly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new home and
apartment construction picked up strongly in October, the Commerce
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nationwidely, builders started work on new housing units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.695 million in October, up
7.3 percent from September, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The increase, the largest in 14 months, returned starts nearly
to the 1.704 million rate of July, an 11-year high.
</P>
<P>
In the South, construction starts surged 14.5 percent to an
annual rate of 820,000 units, the most in nearly 13 years. Starts
in the region had sagged 7.7 percent the month before when the
hurricane set back builders in Mississippi, Louisiana and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
New starts jumped 16.5 percent in the Northeast, to a rate of
162,000 units, the most in 11 months, and 6.9 percent in the
Midwest to a rate of 352,000, the highest in eight months.
However, in the West, they dropped 11.1 percent _ the sharpest
decline in almost two years _ to a rate of 361,000.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide low mortgage rates, strong income growth and a
plentiful supply of jobs have contributed to the strongest year
for housing construction since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
In October, much of the strength in housing construction came
in apartment building, up 23.6 percent to a rate of 409,000 units.
The start rate for buildings with at least five units, 371,000,
was the highest in nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
However, single-family construction rose by 3 percent to a
healthy rate of 1.286 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, housing permits, a gauge of future construction,
jumped 9.9 percent in October to a rate of 1.697 million, the most
since January 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Defends Rwanda's Involvement in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Ambassador to Uganda
Sagahutu Murashi Thursday defended his country's involvement in
the nearly four-month-old crisis in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview here with Xinhua, the ambassador
said Rwanda's cause is just and therefore his country will
eventually win.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot lose the war because our cause is justified. The
allied forces are backing killers. They cannot win," he said in
fluent English.
</P>
<P>
When asked why Rwanda sent troops to DRC as its Vice President
and Defense Minister Paul Kagame admitted some days ago, he said
DRC President Laurent Kabila wanted to disturb his country's
security by training Interahamwe militiamen and to commit
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Kabila trained more than 10,000 Tutsi Interahamwe militiamen
and used them against Rwanda, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila declared openly he will kill all Tutsis. He called on
all Congolese to stand up and take whatever arms they find on
their way and kill Tutsis. He told them they would become slaves
otherwise," said Murashi.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also denied that there is any contradiction in
Kagame's admission of his country's military presence in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda did not send troops there until it thought it
necessary. Kagame denied sending troops to DRC in the beginning
because they did not send any. Later, the situation there
required it, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Kabila turned against his supporters like Uganda and
Rwanda who helped him to power, the ambassador said Kabila is a
man of no principle and is now fighting against the cause he had
been fighting for in the seven-month bush war to topple Mobutu
Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces are there for personal interests, the
middle-aged ambassador asserted, adding that Angola and Namibia
were urged by Zimbabwe to fight for Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has no reason to fight the war because it does not
share borders with DRC and its security is by no means threatened
like that of Rwanda and Uganda, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Starts Impeachment Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr on Thursday went before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee
to present his case for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the hearings, Starr testified that the
president had misused the authority and powers of his office to
block the investigation into his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The hearings began with Democratic House member William
Delahunt, of Massachusetts, requesting that White House lawyers
get two hours to question Starr, rather than the designated 30
minutes. Henry Hyde, chairman of the committee, responded by
saying that the time allotments were fair.
</P>
<P>
Hyde said that the White House could "go a long way" toward
helping to uncover the facts, if Clinton could answer the more
than 80 questions submitted to him by the committee.
</P>
<P>
Starr is the lead witness and focal point of nine television
networks covering the hearings live, which are widely expected to
provide a highly partisan start to proceedings aimed at deciding
whether Clinton should be removed from his office by subsequent
votes of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
The hearings are in the same room where the last impeachment
proceedings against Richard Nixon convened a quarter century ago.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to end this threat to Clinton's presidency and prevent
a permanent blot on his legacy, the White House sent Clinton's
private lawyer, David Kendall, to question Starr and make a case
on the president's behalf.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia, Japan Must Sign Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Japan must sign a
peace treaty to settle the dispute over the sovereignty of the
Kuril Islands, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Khabarovsk, in the Russian Far East,
Primakov said Russia and Japan had backed away from their
previously "extreme positions" on the territorial question of the
islands.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the islands, occupied by Soviet forces in 1945
and claimed by Japan ever since, has prevented Russia and Japan
from signing a formal peace treaty ending the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said the two countries should work
together for the economic development of the Kuril islands.
</P>
<P>
Russia has offered Japan some form of joint economic
development of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a Japanese loan to Russia, Primakov said it will
reduce the need for money printing.
</P>
<P>
"We are very grateful that Japan made the decision while the
IMF is stalling," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government will consider the best use for the loan,
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov Thursday made a stop-over in Khabarovsk en route to
Moscow from Malaysia, where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders meeting on behalf of President Boris
Yeltsin.

Bonn, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany's parliament approved
overwhelmingly Thursday the decision of the government to send up
to 250 soldiers of the German Bundeswehr to NATO emergency force
being set up to protect international observers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A total of 555 deputies in the Bundestag voted for the motion.
Thirty-six MPs voted against, and seven MPs abstained.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers of the Bundeswehr armed forces will be stationed

The task of the NATO emergency force is to rescue 2,000 members
from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
from life-threatening situations. They will be at hand in case of
a possible evacuation or airlift of the unarmed observers out of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping stressed that the force had no mandate to
intervene militarily in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Bundeswehr force approved on Thursday consists of 190
infantry and tank reconnaissance personnel, support staff and 22
armored vehicles. France, Britain, the Netherlands and Italy are
sending helicopters as well as troops.

launched by January 1999, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP) on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Besides France, only Finland, Belgium and Spain have begun
their production of the euros, but not as much as France, said AFP
quoting official sources.
</P>
<P>
Germany is in "an advanced stage" of experimenting striking the
euro, while other European nations which will join euro are due to
begin producing the coin next year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 70 billion coins of the single currency should be
issued to replace the national currencies by January 2002.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Banana Trade War Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Friday that it is ready to settle the dispute on EU banana imports
within the World Trade Organization (WTO) system, but rejected any
timetable for the settlement from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Leon Brittan of the European Commission said in
a statement that the EU was willing to cooperate with the United
States, or any other WTO member, in an accelerated WTO dispute
settlement panel on any disagreement about the banana import issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Brittan stressed the United States should not expect
the EU to bend to a timetable that the United States is seeking to
impose by means of "illegal unilateral action".
</P>
<P>
The vice president also voiced the Commission's regret at the
tone of the recent US statements which, he claimed, hardly
suggested a wish to reach a settlement in accordance with
international rules.
</P>
<P>
The United States, many companies of which are doing business
in South America, particularly in Ecuador, claims the new EU
banana import regime fails to comply with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the American allegation that the EU had ignored
its WTO obligations was without foundation.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, if the United States wished to take WTO dispute
settlement procedures against the EU, it would welcome this and
urge them to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the EU had agreed to early consultations with
Ecuador, which, unlike the United States, is a major producer and
exporter of bananas to the EU.

<HEADLINE> Duma Condemns Kalmykia's Separatist Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma (lower
house of parliament) on Friday condemned the separatist tendency
of the Federal Republic of Kalmykia, which recently extended a
claim to remove itself from the Russian federation.
</P>
<P>
The Duma said in a statement that "the Russian constitution
does not give federation members the right to leave the
federation or claim the status of an associated member".
</P>
<P>
The Duma urged Kalmykia to unconditionally observe
constitutional provisions and stop such actions undermining the
unity and integrity of the federal state.
</P>
<P>
Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov recently issued a statement
blaming the federal authorities and the Finance Ministry for
imposing a "blockade" on his republic.
</P>
<P>
"In fact we are not part of Russia. If this is so, we shall
urge Moscow to give us the status of an associated member, or just
secede from Russia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also appealed to President Boris Yeltsin and the
government to make an exhaustive evaluation of Ilyumzhinov's
statements and take "urgent measures to stop unconstitutional
actions threatening to cause the spread of separatism in Russia".
</P>
<P>
According to presidential press secretary Dmitri Yakushkin, the
president was paying close attention to the matter and considered
that "any attempt to question the federal structure of Russia and
to revise the constitution today is wrought with great danger".

<HEADLINE> New Drug Combination Fights Hepatitis C </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- People infected with hepatitis
C may have a better chance of a cure after researchers in Canada
discovered a new combination of drugs to treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to this week's New England Journal of Medicine, six
months after treatment, patients who received the two-drug
combination were more likely to be free of hepatitis C than they
would be if they accepted the traditional drug treatment of
interferon.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major advance in the treatment of hepatitis C," said
Morris Sherman, an assistant professor in medicine at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to these studies the success rate for treatment was
somewhere around 15 to 20 percent. With these drugs, with the
combination, it is now approximately 40 percent."
</P>
<P>
The key drug involved -- known as ribavirin -- has not been
approved for official use in Canada, but it is available
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The traditional drug, interferon, approved in Canada in 1991,
has helped in 40 percent of the cases, but the benefits are
generally not long lasting as less than 15 percent of the patients
achieve complete remission after the treatment.
</P>
<P>
As part of an international group of researchers from the
United States, Australia, Greece and Canada, Dr. Sherman conducted
his study with 832 patients in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Six months after treatment, 43 percent of those who undergone
48 weeks of combination therapy had undetectable levels of the
virus, compared to 19 percent of those on interferon alone.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Canadians are infected with hepatitis C, a
blood-borne virus spread in the same way as AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Aims to Build World-Class Local Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore sub-committee
has said it is critical for Singapore to build a pool of
world-class local companies in the domestic businesses sector to
broaden the base for sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
In its report announced on Friday, the Sub-Committee on
Domestic Businesses under the Committee on Singapore's
Competitiveness proposed to have the retail sector reach the same
level of vibrancy and same standard of retailing as those in the
United States, Belgium and France. It also proposed to have the
construction sector to reach the standards of quality, efficiency
and capability found in developed countries such as Japan, Finland
and the Netherlands within the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
The report defines the domestic businesses as establishments
that are enterprises of small or medium size (SME) and markets
their goods and services primarily to customers in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, close to 90 percent of the total of
68,800 establishments in the domestic businesses sector are SMEs,
employing less than 50 workers and ranging from service-oriented
companies in the retail trade, personal and household services to
companies providing a diverse range of contracting services in the
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that the domestic businesses typically suffer
from low productivity as they only have 36 percent share of the
GDP with half of the total employment.
</P>
<P>
The reports also notes that the GDP per worker level in
domestic businesses was only 72 percent of the average for the
economy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sub-committee's vision for domestic business in Singapore
over the next decade is to be internationally competitive and
generate added value commensurate with the resources consumed and
to upgrade a steady stream of SMEs to the status of world-class
companies.
</P>
<P>
The sub-committee has also identified three broad thrusts to
achieve its vision.
</P>
<P>
The first thrust is to put in place measures to optimize
allocation of scarce resources such as labor and land so as to
alleviate labor shortage in Singapore, boost the skills of the
workers in the domestic sector and to allow for more intensive and
flexible use of land.
</P>
<P>
The second thrust is to strengthen the capabilities of the
domestic businesses through pooling resources to reap economies of
scale, reaching out to more markets, enhancing their management
expertise and harnessing new technology.
</P>
<P>
The third thrust is to create pro-business environment to help
domestic business manage costs and to have government agencies
adopt a more developmental role in addition to their traditional
enforcement role.

TOKYO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill

<P>
"I believe it is clearly not only in the interest of the world

</P>
<P>
Clinton called the Japanese government's new 24 trillion yen
(196.7 billion U.S. dollars) stimulus package "quite good", but
added he did not know whether it was enough.
</P>
<P>
The President said it would be in Japan's interest to support
more open trade and to deregulate its economy.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Protectionism is a no-growth strategy that offers no
way out of the current economic crisis."
</P>

Obuchi described Clinton's visit as a "significant
achievement", saying the two leaders "could reconfirm the
importance of Japan-U.S. relations and could promote cooperation
and policy coordination between the two countries".
</P>
<P>
On his efforts to repair Japan's ailing banking system and
stimulate the sluggish economy, Obuchi said it is based upon
recognition that the economic recovery of his country bears great
importance to Asia as well as the world.

<P>
Obuchi and Clinton also had a substantive exchange of views on
international and regional issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> India's Chief of Navy Staff to Visit Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- India's Chief of Navy Staff
Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat will visit Bangladesh from November 22 to
26 in a move to build mutual security ties with neighboring
nations and the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries, the national BSS news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first ever visit by an Indian navy chief to
Dhaka since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The visit is significant in view of the Indian navy's proposal
to the government for the creation of far-eastern navy command,
based in the island territories of Andaman and Nicobar (India), an
Indian newspaper was quoted by official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his forthcoming visit, Bhagwat is expected to discuss
issues of mutual interest and explore areas of cooperation between
the two neighbors, the Indian newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The key issues on Bhagwat's agenda include anti-narcotics
operations, hydro-surveys, mutual search and rescue missions
during natural calamities in the Bay of Bengal besides
ship-building, ship repairs and warship design, the sources
stated.
</P>
<P>
Issues such as drug-trafficking are of mutual interest, and
Admiral Bhagwat's visit comes at a time when Indian Navy along
with the Indian Army had adopted a pro-active approach towards
tackling the drug-runners operating in the "golden triangle", the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Propose Tougher Laws Against Soccer Hooligan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain is proposing its ever
toughest laws to crack down on soccer hooligans, racist fans and
ticket scalpers, according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
The measures, as reported in British newspapers, are to be
unveiled next week by the Home Office. They include increasing
fines and exclusion orders blocking known troublemakers from
soccer matches in Britain, restrictions on ticket sales to keep
scalpers from obtaining tickets of matches abroad.
</P>
<P>
The measures also will launch moves to make racist chants
criminal offenses and increase powers to bar unconvicted but
known hooligans from traveling to matches abroad.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown, called for in a report earlier this year by
former government minister David Mellor, is also aimed at helping
England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup against competition from
South Africa and Germany.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Home Office official, quoted in Friday's Daily
Mail, said pressure would be put on league officials to crack
down on player violence on the field.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President Against Overreaction to DPRK Nuclear Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Friday said he will stick to his "sunshine policy" toward
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and cautioned
against overreaction on DPRK's suspected nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
There was still no concrete evidence for the alleged nuclear
facility in the DPRK, Kim said here Friday after returning from a
10-day tour to China and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that DPRK had violated the Geneva
Agreement. Our efforts for economic recovery might be undermined
if we exaggerated the danger before we have all the facts," said
President Kim.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy for Korean affairs Charles Kartman said here
Thursday, following a two-day visit to the DPRK, that compelling
evidence showed that an underground nuclear facility in Kumchangni
is under construction.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a high-ranking U.S. official has
accused the DPRK of secretly constructing a facility to develop
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
But President Kim said his government should take steps to
clarify the nature of the suspect facility first.
</P>
<P>
Under the Geneva Agreement, the DPRK is obliged to freeze all
nuclear programs in return for receiving two light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
Asked about an unidentified vessel found by South Korean radar
off its northwest coast Friday, Kim replyed that he had been
briefed about the case and his government was to respond
accordingly after obtaining more details.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to react too sensitively or to panic. We
need to adhere to our basic policy of maintaining national
security while facilitating inter-Korean reconciliation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff issued on Friday morning
a full alert against possible infiltration of DPRK special agents
along the northwest coast after the appearance of the unidentified
vessel.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean military has been conducting a thorough search
of the waters where the vessel appeared, while cordoning off
waterways into its territory.

<HEADLINE> Carlton Pulls out of Arsenal Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Media group Carlton
Communications announced Friday it is to pull out of all
discussions on making an offer for Arsenal football club.
</P>
<P>
Carlton first announced it was in talks with the North London
club on September 10, just 24 hours after satellite broadcaster
BSkyB unveiled its bid for Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB's bid for Manchester United was referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission last month and a report is not
due until March next year.
</P>
<P>
No price for a Carlton bid was ever made public but it had
been reported the group was considering making an offer of 275
million pounds (about 456 million U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
Arsenal is listed on the small Ofex stock market where this
morning it was valued at 162 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Carlton said: "We announced in September that
talks were ongoing between the two companies and that they could
include an offer being made.
</P>
<P>
"Those talks have now been terminated and that is all we are
prepared to say," he added.
</P>
<P>
Carlton owns ITV franchises in London and the Midlands and has
numerous other media interests including a stake in the ONdigital
digital terrestrial channel.

<HEADLINE> G-22 Asked to Be Serious in Overcoming Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA KANGSAR, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday asked
the G-22 to be serious in overcoming problems concerning trading
of foreign currencies following the decision by the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders meeting to refer the matter to
the group.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said here
Friday although G-22 had discussed the issues for almost a year,
there were still no signs of progress.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would however continue to fight for it and
would take follow-up actions as well as undertake a study on the
issue following the decision reached at the two-day 6th informal
meeting of APEC leaders which ended here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said although APEC had not come to any conclusion on
actions to be taken against currency traders, the decision to
refer the matter to G-22 and to undertake a study needed to be
speeded up.
</P>
<P>
He also said that APEC's decision acknowledging that rating
agencies played a part in affecting the economies of a number of
countries, including Malaysia, was a positive step and that
Malaysia would initiate follow-up actions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said at the APEC leaders' informal meeting, Malaysia had
contended that rating agencies needed to look at the economic
fundamentals of a country when issuing a rating and not at other
matters which are not related to the economy of that country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these, the rating agencies should not issue a rating
unless requested by the country concerned, he said, adding this
was because there were quite a number of agencies which issued
ratings without any reasons and which had affected the economic
conditions of the countries.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said Malaysia faced this problem some three months ago
when it wanted to seek loans and rating agencies had downgraded
the country's economy although there was not much difference in
the country's economic strength and position.
</P>
<P>
He said the action by these agencies downgrading the country's
economy had "resulted in the increase of base lending rates and
made it difficult to obtain loans".

<HEADLINE> Germany Shelves Extradition of Kurdish Leader Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany has declined to seek the
extradition of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan from Italy at the
present time, government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, 49, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), has
been in detention in Rome since last Thursday. He has applied for
political asylum in Italy.
</P>
<P>
He has also been wanted by German prosecutors for charges
including murder since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Heye said the German government would not cancel the arrest
warrant for Ocalan as the efforts for Ocalan's extradition were
only being deferred.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government is seeking the extradition of Ocalan to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"In view of these facts and developments the government is
deferring a German extradition bid," Heye said.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Export More Rice due to Bad Crop in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expects to earn 654
million U.S. dollars through rice exports during the current
financial year (July 1-June 30), registering an increase of 100
million dollars over the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Commerce Ministry Friday, during
1997-98 fiscal year, Pakistan exported 2.03 million tons of rice
worth 554.42 million dollars, mainly to the Middle East, Europe,
the United States and African countries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that during the current financial year, Pakistan
would be exporting 2.4 million tons of rice. Pakistan's rice
production now is 4.4 million tons, while the domestic
requirements stand at about two million tons.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that since the rice crop was devastated in
some parts of Bangladesh, China and India, the demand for
Pakistani rice in the world market would significantly go up.
</P>
<P>
There had been a growing demand for Pakistani rice in the
international market over the years. The new rice crop in the
country is ready and its export would begin soon, according to the
sources.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Take Over As Israeli Troops Out by Qi Tandai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QABATIYA, THE WEST BANK (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police took
over total control of the West Bank town of Qabatiya Friday after
Israeli troops began redeployment earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Qabatiya was one of the 28 towns and villages being reverted to
full Palestinian control. From Friday afternoon, the Palestinian
police are responsible for maintaining security in the town.
</P>
<P>
Trucks loaded with Palestinian police entered the town amid
warm welcome by local residents. Overjoyed, some policemen even
fired into the air to celebrate Israeli troop pullout.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local residents danced around the trucks as they
moved slowly into the town. Others stood on top of buildings to
wave welcome to the police.
</P>
<P>
"We are so happy and glad that all Israeli troops left the
town in the morning and now the Palestinian police are here," a
Palestinian youth said.
</P>
<P>
"For us, this is the big event and finally we have peace," he
added, without giving his name.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel
signed Friday in Tel Aviv the protocol of operating the Gaza
airport.
</P>
<P>
PNA announced on Thursday that Royal Air Morocoo, the national
airlines of Morocco, will inaugurate flights to the Gaza airport
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops began withdrawal after the process being held up
for two hours because the Palestinians raised questions about
last-minute Israeli changes in the redeployment map.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment came one day after the hardline government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved, with a blade-thin
margin, the first of the three phase of the 13 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel will in phase one surrender a total of 9.1 percent of
the occupied West Bank territories to exclusive or partial
Palestinian control. The ceded areas amount to 510 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers showed mix reactions to the Israeli
pullback. "We are not surprised at the troop redeployment in the
Jenin area and we want to live in peace with the Palestinians,"
said Safia Zalmenovic, a woman settler in the Kadim settlement.
</P>
<P>
There are 40 Jewish families with total of 180 settlers in the
settlement, about a kilometer east to Jenin, where everything
seems normal despite the Israeli troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
But the settlement leader refused to be interviewed, saying he
was too busy contacting government and political party leaders to
find out what they are actually thinking about the future of this
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Safia's husband, Sam, was also worried. He said this settlement
is so near to the Palestinians and everything could happen with
the absence of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
"If the Palestinians try to do something to us in the future,
we will hit back," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Palestinians welcome Israel's troop
redeployment with enthusiasm. "this is very good," said a
Palestinian university student here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bilal Sheikh Ali, a 28-year-old student of the Jenin
University, said his village of Yabed south of Jenin has been
transferred Friday to the total Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy about that," he said. "We get back more of our land
from the Israelis, and every body here is glad that the Israelis
are leaving from our land," he added.
</P>
<P>
His classmate, who asked not to be identified, agreed with him,
but said that Israel's plan to give back only 1 percent of the
West Bank in the final stage redeployment is "too little."
</P>
<P>
Friday morning Israeli and Palestinian officers met in
al-Shohda, a village south of Jenin, where Israeli-Palestinian
Security Coordination Center is located. They discussed the
details concerning the redeployment and future cooperation between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side showing the maps of redeployment to the
Palestinian side. According to these maps, most of the area
between Jenin and Nablus have been turned into full Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other Palestinian and Israeli military officers
headed towards the transferred areas for demarcation. A total of
130 black-and-yellow markers are to be erected to defining the new
borders between areas controlled by Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian officer said that according to the redeployment
maps provided by Israel, about 28 towns and villages in the Jenin
area will be transferred to the Palestinian side Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the areas are not heavily populated and the
redeployment is relatively easy, said an Israeli military officer.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye peace accord, Israel has to yield 13 percent of
the West Bank territories to the Palestinian side in 12 weeks. The
Israeli cabinet approved the phased withdrawal, but attached a
string of conditions to exact Palestinian compliance.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's withdrawal, 2 percent of the land in the vicinity
of Jenin will go from Israeli control (known as Area C) to joint
Palestinian-Israeli control (Area B), and 7.1 percent will be
turned from Area B to full Palestinian control (Area A).
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was okayed by the Israeli cabinet Thursday
only after it received confirmations that the Palestinians
fulfilled their commitments - publishing a decree to collect
illegal weapons, drafting a decree banning anti-Israeli
incitement, and arresting 10 of the 30 fugitives as demanded by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
But the Palestinian side argued that those are common criminals,
not political prisoners as stipulated by the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Pak, IMF Agree on Fresh Revenue Collection Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) are reported to have reached an
agreement on new revenue target for the current fiscal year (July
1-June 30).
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), the fresh
revenue collection target for 1998-99 fiscal year is 333 billion
rupees (46 rupees equals one U.S. dollar) as against the budgetary
projection of 354 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
APP quoted well-placed sources as saying, the Central Board of
Revenue (CBR) had already requested the government to downwardly
revise the revenue collection target following the changes in
customs duty and tariff.
</P>
<P>
The accord on revenue target between the CBR and IMF was
achieved during the recent talks held as part of overall dialogue
between the government and the visiting IMF team over economic
bail-out package of five billion dollars for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
CBR is pursuing "Common Tax Identifier", a new approach to
improving revenue collection in Pakistan, under which tax payer
will be allocated one tax number which would facilitate the board
in tracing out any evasion committed under income tax, excise
duty, sales tax or customs duty.
</P>
<P>
The report on the new approach for improving revenue collection
will be presented on November 30 which, after approval, would be
enforced in two phases by May 1999, the sources hoped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the latest official figures show that the total
revenue collection during the first four months of 1998-99
(July-October) amounted to 83 billion rupees against the target of
96 billion rupees, reflecting a shortfall of 13 billion rupees on
the basis of budgetary revenue collection of 354 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating shortfall during 1998-99 owing to the present
crumbling economic situation, the CBR will have to move on
war-footing to realize the agreed revenue collection target of 333
billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
Describing the existing economic crisis facing the country as
major factor towards expected shortfall in the revenue collection,
the sources said, fall in customs duty and decline in the
collection of sales tax on imports related goods is an outcome of
declining trend in imports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tax Collectors Facing Tougher Job At Year's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Tax collectors are facing an
even tougher job in the last two months of this year if they want
to reach the central government's goal this year of 100 billion
yuan more in taxes on the basis of last year.
</P>
<P>
The government levied 77.3 billion yuan in industrial and
commercial taxes in October, up 13.6 percent from October of last
year. About 42.2 billion yuan of this went to the central
exchequer and the rest went to local governments, increases of
14.9 percent and 12.1 percent year-on-year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Value-added and consumer goods taxes were both up more than 20
percent, to 31.9 billion yuan and 6.9 billion yuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Import taxes collected by customs offices continued to rise by
21.7 percent to a new high of about 6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to greater scrutiny of delayed payment of business
taxes, unpaid taxes amounted to 37.4 billion yuan by the end of
October, 2.5 billion yuan less than in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The country collected 663.96 billion yuan in industrial and
commercial taxes in the first 10 months of the year, up 9.8
percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Tax bureaus tried hard to maintain a year-on-year increase of
27.6 percent in both August and September, even though devastating
floods hit many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 191 billion yuan has to be handed over by tax
bureaus across the country in the final two months.

<HEADLINE> Two Israelis Charged with Spying on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli arrested here two
weeks ago were charged Friday by a local court with spying against
Cyprus' National Guard (army).
</P>
<P>
Udi Hargov, 37 and Igal Damary, 49, were arrested here on
November 7 for allegedly spying in a sensitive military area near
the southeastern coastal town of Larnaca. They were remanded in
custody for 13 days pending investigation.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutor told Larnaca District Court that the alleged
offenses took place between October 15 and November 6, including
both dates, at the fishing village of Zygi on the southern coast.
</P>
<P>
"With an intent to harm the safety or the interests of the
Cyprus Republic, the accused collected information on the defense
of the Republic and passed this information on to a foreign
country," the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
They were also charged with possession of three scanners
without permit from the Ministry of Communications, with which
they conspired to commit the espionage, the court was told.
</P>
<P>
One of the scanners was tuned into the police radio frequency
when police raided the apartment they rented, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
They were also seen loitering under suspicious circumstances
near National Guard camps.
</P>
<P>
Present at the court was a representative of the Israeli
embassy in Nicosia and the defendants' Israeli lawyer who is
reportedly employed by Israeli secret service Mossad.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis did not reply to the charges. They will
appear before the Assize Court on December 8 for trial.
</P>
<P>
Spying carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment under
Cyprus law.

West Bank in the final stage redeployment is "too little."
</P>
<P>
Friday morning Israeli and Palestinian officers met in
al-Shohda, a village south of Jenin, where Israeli-Palestinian
Security Coordination Center is located. They discussed the
details concerning the redeployment and future cooperation between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side showing the maps of redeployment to the
Palestinian side. According to these maps, most of the area
between Jenin and Nablus have been turned into full Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other Palestinian and Israeli military officers
headed towards the transferred areas for demarcation. A total of
130 black-and-yellow markers are to be erected to defining the new
borders between areas controlled by Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian officer said that according to the redeployment
maps provided by Israel, about 28 towns and villages in the Jenin
area will be transferred to the Palestinian side Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the areas are not heavily populated and the
redeployment is relatively easy, said an Israeli military officer.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye peace accord, Israel has to yield 13 percent of
the West Bank territories to the Palestinian side in 12 weeks. The
Israeli cabinet approved the phased withdrawal, but attached a
string of conditions to exact Palestinian compliance.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's withdrawal, 2 percent of the land in the vicinity
of Jenin will go from Israeli control (known as Area C) to joint
Palestinian-Israeli control (Area B), and 7.1 percent will be
turned from Area B to full Palestinian control (Area A).
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was okayed by the Israeli cabinet Thursday
only after it received confirmations that the Palestinians
fulfilled their commitments - publishing a decree to collect
illegal weapons, drafting a decree banning anti-Israeli
incitement, and arresting 10 of the 30 fugitives as demanded by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
But the Palestinian side argued that those are common criminals,
not political prisoners as stipulated by the agreement.

The New York Times
</P>

fought off Democratic assaults on the conduct of his office
Thursday and repeatedly sought to return attention to what he
described as President Clinton's pattern of obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Cabinet gave final clearance to the first of three
pullbacks under the new peace plan, and Israel is to start
transferring 200 square miles of the northern West Bank to
Palestinian control Friday.

<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Despite international pressure to curtail its missile
program, North Korea is building at least two new launch

production of short-range missiles, according to U.S. intelligence
and diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. monitoring teams went out on inspection missions
Thursday, their second full day back at work since Iraq agreed to

The Wall Street Journal

trade.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lebanese Guerrillas Killed in S.Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese guerrillas were
reportedly killed in south Lebanon on Friday during Israeli air
raids, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Israeli army sources as saying that the three
were members of Lebanon's Shiite Muslim Amal movement led by
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
They were killed as Israeli warplanes staged a series of heavy
raids on suspected guerrilla positions inside and outside the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon as a response to Amal's earlier
mortar attacks, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no immediate confirmation of the
casualties from Amal headquarters in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border attacks
by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israeli occupation. Amal is another active anti-Israeli
militant group of the country.

to work out technical details regarding import of power from
Pakistan, Union Power Minister P. R. Kumaramangalam said here
Friday.
</P>

only got an indication from Pakistan power minister at Houston
that they have about 1,500 to 2,000 MW of surplus power which they
are willing to sell," he said.
</P>
<P>
The team would discuss with Pakistan the quantity and the cost
of power that would be supplied to India. it would also look into
the long-term availability of surplus power from Pakistan, he

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has shut down
100 local cotton markets for buying sub-standard cotton lint

</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Cotton and Seed Board (TCSB), quoted by press
reports here Friday, said it has also closed 15 ginning factories
for processing poor quality cotton in several regions in the west
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Some cotton dealers have been taking good samples to TCSB but
export sub-standard cotton," TCSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
They warned that harsh steps, including suing them or revoking
their licenses, will be taken against those violating the board's
regulations to ensure Tanzania's cotton lint up to the standard
in the world market.
</P>
<P>
TCSB will send its cotton inspectors to all the
cotton-producing districts to stem sub-standard cotton exports.

<P>
Meanwhile, officials said Tanzania's cotton lint output has
dropped from 84,500 tons in the 1996/97 season to 69,970 tons in

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Continues to Fall in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
worsened in October 1998, shrinking by 11.6 per cent compared to
the same period 1997, according to statistics released Friday by
the country's Trade Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The imports and exports contracted by 19.2 percent and 3.6
percent respectively on year-on-year basis mainly due to the
depressed global market conditions for electronic and related
products and fallen demand from Asian economies hit by the
financial crisis which is continuing to take its toll on
Singapore's economy as well.
</P>
<P>
Growth in non-oil domestic exports (NODX) continued to slow
down, increasing marginally by 0.4 percent in October after
expanding by 2.8 percent and 1.4 percent in August and September.
</P>
<P>
Of the top five markets for NODX, all declined except the EU
which continued to expand at 20 percent. The other top markets are
Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong and the United States.
</P>
<P>
October saw a decline for the second consecutive month in NODX
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the month, domestic exports of oil plunged by 16.0 percent
and non-oil re-exports contracted by 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding lumpy items (aircraft and ships), non-oil imports
that is a leading indicator for manufacturing activities continued
to decline by 17.9 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Singapore's external trade contracted by 9.3
percent over a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begin Troop Withdrawal from West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KADIM SETTLEMENT, THE WEST BANK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Jewish
settlers showed mix reaction as Israeli troops began withdrawing
from parts of the West Bank Friday morning, as required by the
latest Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
"We are not surprised at the troop redeployment in the Jenin
area and we want to live in peace with the Palestinians," said
Safia Zalmenovic, a woman settler in the Kadim settlement.
</P>
<P>
There are 40 Jewish families with total of 180 settlers in the
settlement, about a kilometer east to Jenin, where everything
seems normal despite the Israeli troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
But the settlement leader refused to be interviewed, saying he
was too busy contacting government and political party leaders to
find out what they are actually thinking about the future of this
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Safia's husband, Sam, was also worried. He said this settlement
is so near to the Palestinians and everything could happen with
the absence of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
"If the Palestinians try to do something to us in the future,
we will hit back," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Palestinians welcome Israel's troop
redeployment with enthusiasm. "this is very good," said a
Palestinian university student here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bilal Sheikh Ali, a 28-year-old student of the Jenin
University, said his village of Yabed south of Jenin has been
transferred Friday to the total Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops began withdrawal after the process being held up
for two hours because the Palestinians raised questions about
last-minute Israeli changes in the redeployment map.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment came one day after the hardline government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved, with a blade-thin
margin, the first of the three phase of the 13 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel will in phase one surrender a total of 9.1 percent of
the occupied West Bank territories to exclusive or partial
Palestinian control. The ceded areas amount to 510 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"We get back more of our land from the Israelis, and every body
here is glad that the Israelis are leaving from our land," Ali
added.
</P>
<P>
His classmate, who asked not to be identified, agreed with him,
but said that Israel's plan to give back only 1 percent of the
West Bank in the final stage redeployment is "too little."
</P>
<P>
Al-Shohda is village south of Jenin, where Israeli-Palestinian
Security Coordination Center is located. Israeli and Palestinian
military officers have been meeting here since Friday morning to
discuss the details concerning the redeployment and future
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started with the Israeli side showing the maps of
redeployment to the Palestinian side. According to these maps,
most of the area between Jenin and Nablus have been turned into
full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other Palestinian and Israeli military officers
headed towards the transferred areas for demarcation. A total of
130 black-and-yellow markers are to be erected to defining the new
borders between areas controlled by Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police are expected to enter the areas newly
reverted by their control.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian officer said that according to the redeployment
maps provided by Israel, about 28 towns and villages in the Jenin
area will be transferred to the Palestinian side Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the areas are not heavily populated and the
redeployment is relatively easy, said an Israeli military officer.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye peace accord, Israel has to yield 13 percent of
the West Bank territories to the Palestinian side in 12 weeks. The
Israeli cabinet approved the phased withdrawal, but attached a
string of conditions to exact Palestinian compliance.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's withdrawal, 2 percent of the land in the vicinity
of Jenin will go from Israeli control (known as Area C) to joint
Palestinian-Israeli control (Area B), and 7.1 percent will be
turned from Area B to full Palestinian control (Area A).
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was okayed by the Israeli cabinet Thursday
only after it received confirmations that the Palestinians
fulfilled their commitments - publishing a decree to collect
illegal weapons, drafting a decree banning anti-Israeli
incitement, and arresting 10 of the 30 fugitives as demanded by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
But the Palestinian side argued that those are common criminals,
not political prisoners as stipulated by the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker in Quiet Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar drifted
lower Friday in quiet trade as it consolidated from Thursday's
leap of more than 1.5 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Arab Bank foreign exchange dealer Scott Young described the
domestic currency's movement as 'sideways', trapped in a range
roughly between 64.10 and 64.50 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar barreled ahead during trading Wednesday
night and Thursday morning, reaching six-month highs on the back
of apparent hedge fund action and favorable interest rate
differentials.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 64.36 U.S. cents from 64.46 late
Thursday, after trading between 64.10 and 64.38 on the day.
</P>
<P>
Young said volumes had been very thin, but the domestic
currency was not going far, with "sellers on the top and bidders
down below".
</P>
<P>
"Really all we've done off that 64.80 U.S. cents top of the
other night is go sideways," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We came down, we went up again last night, we are off a bit
today, but a lot of the bigger moves do seem to be coming
overnight and we just seem to consolidate it."
</P>
<P>
Young said the strengthened Japanese yen against the U.S.
dollar should be helping the Australian currency.
</P>
<P>
Young also said the absence of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank
of Australia (RBA) was helping keep the Australian dollar fairly
steady at the higher levels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its fed
funds rate for the third time in seven weeks to 4.75 percent from
5.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the RBA has not moved, making the Australian currency
more attractive with the interest rate differential.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was buying 76.91 Japanese yen
from 78.50 and 1.0846 German marks from 1.0805.

BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Residential housing in China
is becoming slightly more expensive, with sale prices and rents
rising by 1.3 percent and 0.9 percent respectively in the third
quarter of the year, compared with the 1997 same period.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by today's Market Daily, the State
Statistics Bureau announced these figures after surveying 35 major
cities recently.
</P>
<P>
Among different types of housing, trading in old houses was
active in the third quarter and registered the highest price
growth rate of 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Villas and other luxurious residential houses saw their prices
actually drop by 1.6 percent from the same quarter last
year.
</P>
<P>
The rental cost of office buildings and other commercial-use
space declined by 4.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively, as
some bankrupt and semi-bankrupt companies entered the rental
market.
</P>
<P>
Prices of hotel rooms dipped by 3.9 percent from the third
quarter last year because of a slowdown in the Chinese economy and
the effects of the severe flooding in southern and northeastern
China this summer.
</P>
<P>
However, the general rise of housing prices helped push up the
prices of land-use rights by 3.1 percent in the third quarter,

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
enacted a decree empowering the private sector to participate in
power generation in the country, according to a Nigerian
minister.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper New Nigerian Friday quoted Minister of Power
and Steel Malam Bello Saleiman as saying that the decree had
broken the monopoly of the National Electric Power Authority
(NEPA) to generate, transmit and distribute power since the
nation's independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The decree was promulgated two weeks ago when he received a
visiting World Bank delegation in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
NEPA has an installed capacity of about 5,000 megawatts with
three hydro and five thermal power stations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many of the power generating units had broken
down while some were in dire need of repairs, resulting in
persistent lack of power supply in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Yaw Ansu, leader of the World Bank delegation and the bank's
country director for Nigeria, said earlier this month that the
World Bank was willing to assist the Nigerian government in
implementing its privatization program.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president Jiang Zemin
spoke highly today of the outstanding contributions late Chairman
Liu Shaoqi made to the cause of China's liberation and socialist
construction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a grand meeting of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee to mark the centenary of the late leader's
birth, Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
called Liu a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, a
great statesman and a great theorist.
</P>
<P>
"Liu Shaoqi was a key member of the first generation of the
group leadership headed by Mao Zedong, and an outstanding state
and Party leader who withstood the test of time," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Liu Shaoqi performed remarkable feats for the
cause of the Chinese people's liberation and national construction
after the founding of New China. In addition to his achievements
on the political, economic, military and diplomatic fronts, in the
fields of culture, education and Party building, he also made
substantial contributions to the formation and development of Mao
Zedong Thought..
</P>
<P>
"Liu Shaoqi's glorious life is closely tied up with our Party
and nation's history. He is loved by the whole Party, the whole
army, and people of all ethnic groups. His name is carved into the
annals of history," Jiang told the meeting which was presided
over by chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, Li Peng, and
attended by other Party and state leaders including Zhu Rongji, Li
Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, along with over
6,000 people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The late leader served as chairman of the Standing Committee of

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Praises Late Leader (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang presented a detailed review of Liu's life, saying that
even through the most difficult time, Liu Shaoqi still had full
confidence in the Party, the people, and the lofty ideals of
communism.
</P>
<P>
He firmly believed that history is after all written by the
people, said Jiang. "Our Party and people will never forget him,
and his remarkable deeds will live forever in the hearts of our
people."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Liu Shaoqi attached great importance to economic
construction by actively exploring ways to build socialism with a
view to China's concrete conditions.
</P>
<P>
For example, he suggested that the socialist economy should
combine rigid planning with diversity and flexibility, and should
make full use of free market principles including the use of the
law of values to regulate production.
</P>
<P>
Also he suggested introducing a responsibility system in rural
areas linking farmers' earnings to their production.
</P>
<P>
"His thoughts and practices provided useful references for our
economic reform which unfolded following the Third Plenary Session
of the 11th Party Central Committee," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The president described Liu Shaoqi as a trail breaker for the
system of the people's congress. As chairman of the first NPC
Standing Committee, Liu guided the promulgation of a series of
major laws and regulations which have become major components of
China's legal system.
</P>
<P>
Jiang concluded his speech by calling on the whole Party and
all the people, and leading officials at all levels in particular,
to learn from and practice Liu Shaoqi's lofty qualities, and
strive to build China into a socialist modern country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), met
here today with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was happy to see Chretien for the third time since
1995. He expressed great appreciation for Chretien's
unremitting efforts to promote Sino-Canadian relations
over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The chairman asked the prime minister to convey his regards to
the speaker of the Canadian Senate, Gildas Molgat, and the speaker
of the House of Commons, Gilbert Parent. He also extended his
invitation to Parent for a visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Li noted the close contacts between the leaders of China and
Canada, saying that practice has proved that this has played an
irreplaceable role in the promotion of friendship and
understanding, and in the expansion of mutually beneficial
cooperation and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to Canada last

cultivation of a 21st century-oriented all-round cooperative
partnership.
</P>
<P>
The chairman stressed that China attaches great significance to
the development of Sino-Canadian relations and has made vigorous

<P>
Cooperation in economic and other areas will grow to a new

know about China in the future, and that legislative
exchanges will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said he was satisfied with the growth of Canada-China

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Welcome Israel's Troop Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AL-SHOHDA, THE WEST BANK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- "We
Palestinians welcome Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank
and this is very good," said a Palestinian university student here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bilal Sheikh Ali, a 28-year-old student of the Jenin
University, said his village of Yabed south of Jenin has been
transferred Friday to the total Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops began withdrawal without fanfare from parts of
the West Bank, as required by the latest Wye accord signed by
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment came one day after the hardline government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved, with a blade-thin
margin, the first of the three phase of the 13 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel will in phase one surrender a total of 9.1 percent of
the occupied West Bank territories to exclusive or partial
Palestinian control. The ceded areas amount to 510 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"We get back more of our land from the Israelis, and every body
here is glad that the Israelis are leaving from our land," Ali
added.
</P>
<P>
His classmate, who asked not to be identified, agreed with him,
but said that Israel's plan to give back only 1 percent of the
West Bank in the final stage redeployment is "too little."
</P>
<P>
Al-Shohda is village south of Jenin, where Israeli-Palestinian
Security Coordination Center is located. Israeli and Palestinian
military officers have been meeting here since Friday morning to
discuss the details concerning the redeployment and future
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started with the Israeli side showing the maps of
redeployment to the Palestinian side. According to these maps,
most of the area between Jenin and Nablus have been turned into
full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other Palestinian and Israeli military officers
headed towards the transferred areas for demarcation. A total of
130 black-and-yellow markers are to be erected to defining the new
borders between areas controlled by Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police are expected to enter the areas newly
reverted by their control.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian officer said that according to the redeployment
maps provided by Israel, about 28 towns and villages in the Jenin
area will be transferred to the Palestinian side Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the areas are not heavily populated and the
redeployment is relatively easy, said an Israeli military officer.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye peace accord, Israel has to yield 13 percent of
the West Bank territories to the Palestinian side in 12 weeks. The
Israeli cabinet approved the phased withdrawal, but attached a
string of conditions to exact Palestinian compliance.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's withdrawal, 2 percent of the land in the vicinity
of Jenin will go from Israeli control (known as Area C) to joint
Palestinian-Israeli control (Area B), and 7.1 percent will be
turned from Area B to full Palestinian control (Area A).
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was okayed by the Israeli cabinet Thursday
only after it received confirmations that the Palestinians
fulfilled their commitments - publishing a decree to collect
illegal weapons, drafting a decree banning anti-Israeli
incitement, and arresting 10 of the 30 fugitives as demanded by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners.
But the Palestinian side argued that those are common criminals,
not political prisoners as stipulated by the agreement.

<P>
MOGADISHU, November 20 (Xinhua) --Somalia's largest river, Jubbar,
has crushed to banks in several points in the past three days
devastating many villages around the Jilib Town where hundreds
of families have started fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the local authorities of Jilib Town, 350
kilometers south of capital Mogadishu, the water level of the
river had since early November been rising dramatically before it
started to overflow its banks mainly in the western side of the
town.
</P>
<P>
Reports received through field radios said that more than
5,000 hectares of farmlands owned by small famers had already
been erased together with the food storages of more than 25 villiages.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities did not tell the fatalities caused by the
floods other than the death of a man in his farm at Gomoleh
village Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahamud Ahmed Gulu, chief of the
telecommunications center of Jilib, hundreds of families are now
on the move without food or water, knowing no where to go.
</P>
<P>
Gulu said it seems that the situation will go even worse
unless an immediate reaction comes from both the local people and
the international community in dealing with the floods.
</P>
<P>
In some worst hit villages, the water level is reportedly as
high as two meters, with the roofs of small huts submerged.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people besieged by the floods in 16 out of those
affected 25 villages had been rescued with the use of boats and
large woods.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have expressed concern over the food
shortage in Middle Jubba region in general.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament to Debate No-confidence Motions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Parliament is to
debate three no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz's minority coalition government next Monday, the Daily News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will vote on the motions next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz administration came to a de facto end when the
parliament accept the motions, made by the Virtue Party (FP), True
Path Party (DYP) and Republican People's Party (CHP), with 311
votes for to 213 against on Thursday's ballot.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming approval of beginning the debate on the
censure motions was a clear indication that the minority
coalition might collapse with Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's constitution, the opposition will need at
least 276 votes to topple the Yilmaz government.
</P>
<P>
The three motions accused the minority coalition government of
corruption and linkage with gangs and mafia, and asked the prime
minister to resign.
</P>
<P>
The crisis emerged after businessman Korkmaz Yigit claimed
that Yilmaz, chairman of the senior coalition partner Motherland
Party, of illegally interfering in the privatization process of
the Turkish Business Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the last-minute appeal to the parliamentarians, Yilmaz said
that he was not involved in any unlawful activities and the
no-confidence motion lodged by the three parties was a plot.
</P>
<P>
However, CHP leader Deniz Baykal, who formerly supported the
coalition government in the legislature, said that all signs had
shown that the Yilmaz administration was over.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a state of law. This government is finished and it
will go," Bayakal said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Yilmaz government faces collapse
as it lost the backing of its main supporter, the CHP.
</P>
<P>
If the government falls with the scheduled vote Wednesday, the
parliamentary parties will have 45 days to form another
coalition. If they fail to do so, President Demirel will appoint a
caretaker government to rule until the next elections on April
18.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Announces Additional Measures to Create Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
decided to make use of an open area within the former Kai Tak
Airport for the operation of a flea market, and to implement three
community building projects which will create some 3,590
temporary jobs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the sixth meeting of the Task Force on
Employment Friday, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said: "The
government is planning to designate a particular site with an
approximate area of 20,000 square meters to the south of the
former Kai Tak Airport Terminal Building for the flea market as a
pilot project during weekends and public holidays for three to six
months, from early January 1999 onwards," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The site will be allocated to a non-government organization,
community organization, voluntary agency or trade union at a
nominal rent of 1 HK dollars (0.13 U.S. dollar), for the purpose
of running the flea market on a strictly non-profit-making basis,"
the financial chief said.
</P>
<P>
For health and environmental reasons, only dry goods and
products will be allowed to be sold in the flea market. The
operator will also be responsible for providing the basic
facilities (including electricity and water supply) and
maintaining the overall cleanliness of the site. The operator may
charge a small fee for vendors using the market, so as to cover
the operating expenses of managing the site.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the three community projects, Tsang said that these
projects would serve the dual purpose of addressing certain
specific needs of the community, and creating meaningful job
opportunities for the unemployed, especially young persons.
</P>
<P>
"The Home Affairs Department is planning to launch three
community building projects at an estimated total cost of 18.34
million HK dollars (2.4 million U.S. dollars), which will generate
some 3,590 vacancies for temporary community organizers.
</P>
<P>
They comprise 1,318 vacancies for the promotion of private
building management, 2,152 vacancies for promotion of fire safety
and 120 vacancies for conducting a survey on the housing condition
of new arrivals in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
These 3,590 temporary community organizers will be employed for
four months from December 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics released on Monday, the
latest unemployment rate, covering the August-October quarter,
rose to 5.3 percent, compared with 5.0 percent for the
July-September period.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary noted: "As Hong Kong is still in the
process of adjusting and adapting to the repercussions of the
regional financial turmoil, the overall unemployment rate
 will likely remain on the high side for quite some time."
</P>
<P>
The Task Force on Employment will continue to spare no efforts
to explore further means of increasing employment and training
opportunities for the unemployed, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Denies Negotiations on Marcos Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada denied here Friday that his government had negotiated with
Former First Lady Imelda Marcos on a possible compromise deal
involving the 12-year government effort to recover the alleged
ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, President Estrada said that
whatever talks certain parties might have initiated with the
family of the late President Ferdinand Marcos are just
"exploratory" in nature.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he has yet to give the go-signal for such
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A press report said earlier that an official of the Estrada
administration had offered a 15.5-billion-U.S.-dollar compromise
deal to the former first lady.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued before Estrada's interview with
reporters, the presidential office said that Estrada is aware of
preliminary talks between the government and Imelda on a proposal
to use the alleged Marcos hidden wealth in funding an array of
pro-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, the two sides have not reached any
agreement yet on the issue in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth to that. I don't know where they got that
idea," Estrada said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there are some talks ... exploratory talks. But there is
no negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that should such a negotiation take place, its
outcome should be for the interests and the welfare of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he would consult various sectors before
approving any compromise deal with the Marcoses.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Bourse Cooperation in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Stock exchanges in west Africa
should set an agenda for collective action in order to enhance
the role of stock markets as catalysts of economic development in
the sub-region, a Nigerian official has said.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Apostle
Haylord Alile made the call at a business luncheon organized by
the West African Enterprise Network in Lagos Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times newspaper Friday quoted Alile as saying that
inter-market cooperation would facilitate the realization of
trade liberalization scheme, the establishment of a single
monetary zone, regional infrastructural network and
interconnection of national electricity grids in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the cooperation and integration of stock markets in
west Africa, Alile stressed that cooperation among regional
exchanges is indispensable and inevitable.
</P>
<P>
In order to enhance the role of stock markets, Alile said, the
governments in the region should promote sound macro-economic
policies and the privatization and liberalization of their
economies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that economic integration in developing
countries has been difficult to realize because its benefits are
not evenly distributed among member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official disclosed that a memorandum of
understanding had been signed between the NSE and Accra Stock
Exchange of Ghana in a bid to strengthen their cooperation while
a similar one is being studied with South Africa.

<HEADLINE> OAU, U.N. Call for Poverty Alleviation Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU), the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and
the U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), in a joint
statement here Friday, called for poverty alleviation in Africa
through its industrialization.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement to mark the annual Africa Industrialization
Day which falls on November 20, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim, ECA Executive Secretary K. y. Amoako and UNIDO Director-General
Carlos Magarinos said that this year's Africa Industrialization Day
focuses on private industry's role in poverty reduction through
employment creation and generation of income for social programs.
</P>
<P>
The statement, read by UNIDO representative Niels Biering
at the National Convention on Revitalizing the Zambian Economy
being held here, said that to realize African industrialization,
industrial policies and strategies will need to be more "pro-poor" --
facilitaing macro and small industrial firms in towns and cities,
helping women to participate as managers and workers and building up
agro-industry in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
They called on African governments, private sector and the
international community to make combined, coherent and sustained
efforts to combat de-industrialization induced by globalization.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the poverty in Africa has changed
little since the Khartoum Declaration called world attention a decade
ago to the falling real incomes, falling per capita food production
and worsening unemployment and underemployment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Experts agree that poverty must ultimately be tackled through
vigorous development of Africa's private sector...expanding income
opportunities, increasing production capacities and strengthening the
role of the private sector are their main means," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
They underlined the need, in the context of globalization, to
create and sustain employment through a vibrant, competitive private
industrial sector in particular.
</P>
<P>
"Assigning low priority to industrialization and sustainable
industrial development is inconsistent with concern for poverty
alleviation, employment creation and private sector development,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It urged the international community to ensure that external
conditions -- from debt arrangements to access to major markets for
Africa's industrial goods -- encourage rather than thwart private
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
It also urged African sub-regional economic groupings to develop
their role in helping industry integrate and make cross-border trade
and intra-Africa investment easier.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker Sentenced to Twenty Year Prison Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
announced that the Intermediate People's Court in Shenzhen,
Guangdong Province, convened a trial of first instance today and
sentenced a Chinese man convicted of hijacking an airliner to
Taiwan on April 6, 1993, to 20 years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen court also convicted Huang Shugang of embezzling
some 273,000 yuan from his employer.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year sentence represented the combined punishment for
the two crimes.
</P>
<P>
Huang was repatriated to the Chinese mainland on July 16, 1997,
following extensive negotiations between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Straits
exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
Huang formerly worked as a purchasing agent for a hotel
operated by the Tangshan Iron and Steel Company in Hebei
Province. Huang was convicted of embezzling company funds and
misappropriating materials valued at 273,000 yuan in the period
between January 1993 and the date of the hijacking. The hijacker
obtained funds by illegally cashing checks with private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Huang and Liu Baocai, a Hebei farmer, purchased handguns,
rifles and ammunition prior to boarding flight 2811 scheduled to
fly from Shenzhen to Beijing on April 6, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers forced the pilot to divert the aircraft to Taipei
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen court sentenced Huang to 15 years imprisonment for
hijacking and nine years for embezzlement. The court decided that
the total term of imprisonment for Huang is 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Deducting the time of detention in Taiwan and on the mainland,
he will have to serve another 14 years and five months in prison.
</P>
<P>
Liu's case will be handled separately.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches first Segment of Int'l Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A Russian rocket brought the
first segment of the international space station into orbit
Friday, thus kicking up the program grounded for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
The three-stage Proton rocket lifted off at 9:40 Moscow time
(6:50 GMT) from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, and boosted
the Zarya cargo block into a low earth orbit 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
From there, minimum 185 kilometers and maximum 254 kilometers
off the ground, the Russian-made functional block will reposition
itself in the coming five days to an orbit of 350 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
At orbital inclination of 51.6 degrees, it will then dock with
Russia's spacelab Mir, in orbit for about 10 years, to begin what
the Itar-Tass news agency hailed as the "program of the century."
</P>
<P>
The second segment of the international space station, a
U.S.-made NODE-1 module, is scheduled for liftoff in space on
December 3 and for building onto Zarya on December 5.
</P>
<P>
The space station was first proposed as a U.S. program in 1984
under the administration of former president Ronald Reagan, and
its blueprint was revised several times under budget constraints.
</P>
<P>
As the cold-war ended in the late 1980s, space race turned into
space cooperation, much out of the needs of both sides, the
United States and Russia, for the survival of their space industry.
</P>
<P>
Now, known as the International Space Station, the program also
groups the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan, who have
helped finance billions of dollars already spent.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Admission to APEC Brings Both challenges, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's admission to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) brought both
challenges and opportunities, said Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Saigon Times Daily Friday, Nguyen
Manh Cam Thursday told a news conference at Tan Son Nhat airport
in Ho Chi Minh city upon his return from the APEC leaders'
informal meeting in Kuala Lumpur that Vietnamese domestic
companies should be aware that the challenges would be big and may
come before opportunities can be seen. He warned that "local
businesses will have to cope with rivals from developed
countries."
</P>
<P>
"Vietnamese products are not yet competitive and local firms
are not dynamic enough," said Cam.
</P>
<P>
Cam said that "Vietnam can industrialize and modernize if it
overcomes difficulties despite APEC's requirements for trade and
investment liberalization."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the benefits of APEC membership, Cam said,
Vietnam can enhance trade, investment and technical cooperation as
most APEC members have higher levels of economic development.
APEC's multilateral cooperative mechanism will bring more
opportunities and favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
To survive competition from other members of APEC, Cam added,
Vietnam must develop an efficient and competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, together with Russia and Peru, became a formal member
of APEC on the ministerial meeting of APEC on November 14, 1998 in
Kuala Lumpur.

JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to issue
licences to two new cellularphone operators next year when they
comply with a new set of operational regulations.

PARIS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government confirmed on Thursday that it would
chase down David Shayler, the former agent of the secret service of
Her Majority who was released by the French authorities on Tuesday
-- to the great discontent of London.
</P>
<P>
A French judge rejected a demand by Britain for his
extradition, saying that the motive of London for arresting him
was ``political.'' Shayler was accused of releasing state secrets.
</P>
<P>
-- After the alarm sounded last week in Washington against Iraq,
the American politicians are still wondering how to definitely get
rid of Saddam Hussein. The Pentagon said that the plan of attack
frozen by President Bill Clinton remains ``operational'' and the
U.S. troops deployed in the Gulf stay on alert and could be
reinforced from next week.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French-Spanish summit is due to be held on Friday in La
Rochelle, southwestern France. In an interview with Le Figaro,

gratitude'' to France for the role Paris played in forcing the
Basque separatist movement ETA to declare a truce with the
government in the Basque region of Spain.
</P>
<P>
-- Less than one month after the signing of the Wye Plantation
agreement, Israel has decided to implement the agreement by
withdrawing from Friday morning some troops from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's CPP, FUNCINPEC Agree on Govt Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's two major
political parties, the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and
FUNCINPEC, Friday agreed on the political platform of the new
government, a senior CPP official announced.
</P>
<P>
Three working groups began on Thursday to work out details of a
new Council of Ministers, a government platform and creating a new
senate. They planned to finish their work before the opening of
the National Assembly on November 25.
</P>
<P>
CPP negotiator Sok An told reporters after Friday's meeting
between the CPP and FUNCINPEC that the working group consisting of
members of the two parties has completed its work and reached
unanimity on the coalition government's political platform.
</P>
<P>
"The National Assembly will be convened on November 25 to elect
Prince Ranariddh, president of FUNCINPEC as the president of the
Assembly. Then the new government will be formed within days,"
said Sok An.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to release any details of the platform. But it
was widely believed that economic development will be the top
priority of the new government. The platform will be announced at
the Assembly by the new prime minister, added Sok An.
</P>
<P>
Sok An, who is also co-minister of the cabinet and a top
adviser to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, expressed optimism on
the formation of the new government before the sixth ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit meeting is held on
December 15-16 in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, whose entry into ASEAN was deferred after the July
1997 bloody factional fighting, is eager to join the regional
group. It is the only Southeast Asian nation that is not a member
of the group.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the months-long post-election stalemate was broken
when King Norodom Sihanouk hosted a summit between the CPP and
FUNCINPEC during which the two parties agreed on a power-sharing
formula.
</P>
<P>
The working group involving in Council of Ministers talks has
made positive progress, according to negotiators. But the talks on
drafting a bill to form the new senate appear to have some
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot make it the best it can be in three or four days. It
will at least take us 10 to 15 days to finish it," the Cambodia
Daily quoted FUNCINPEC Steering Committee member Ahmad Yahya as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Defense Agency Chief Resigns Over Procurement Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Defense Agency
Director-General Fukushiro Nukaga resigned Friday to take
responsibility for the agency's systematic cover-up of evidence
for its involvement in a procurement scandal.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi appointed Hosei Norota, a
former agriculture minister, as successor to Nukaga, who was
censured by the House of Councillors (upper house) last month for
his handling of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Nukaga tendered his resignation to Obuchi after a cabinet
meeting earlier in the day. He became defense chief last July,
only one month before the defense scandal came to light.
</P>
<P>
At the Friday meeting, the cabinet endorsed Nukaga's decision
to accept the resignations of Vice Defense Minister Masahiro
Akiyama, former Defense Agency Secretariat Director Masayuki
Fujishima, and Hiroshi Ishizuki, former deputy head of the
agency's Central Procurement Office.
</P>
<P>
The three had been questioned by prosecutors on their role in
the agency's involvement in the procurement scandal.
</P>
<P>
Nukaga's resignation came a day after the Defense Agency
acknowledged it "systematically" covered up evidence for its
involvement in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
In a final report released Thursday, the agency said employees
at its Central Procurement Office removed scandal-related
documents under instructions from Ishizuki, then the No. 2 man at
the office, shortly before prosecutors raided the agency in
September.
</P>
<P>
The scandal involves two defense contractors, both subsidiaries
of Japan's electronic giant NEC Corp., who were allowed to reduce
the amounts they should have reimbursed the government after
overcharging the agency for equipment.
</P>
<P>
In return for the payment reductions, which cost the state 3.54
billion yen (about 29.5 million dollars), the companies promised to
hire retired agency officials, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Two former agency officials and 12 others have been indicted
for breach of trust in connection with the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Offers Rice Loans to Local Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- To ensure continuous rice
supply and cushion the effects of typhoons, the Philippine
government is urging the local governments to distribute rice
loans from the National Food Authority (NFA) to victim families.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary Rolando Puno of Interior and Local Governments
said in a report that local executives can avail of these NFA rice
loans by entering into a memorandum of agreement on credit sales
with the food agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, the maximum quantity allowed for local
government units to purchase would not exceed 60 percent of their
calamity funds.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the units would pay the interest on the loans at a
rate of 1 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
A penalty of 2 percent would be imposed if the units fail to
pay within the prescribed period.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Soar in Tokyo on Coalition News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in
Tokyo Friday with the key Nikkei index closing at its highest
level in two and half months, as investors applauded news of a
coalition between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the
opposition Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 425.48 points, or 2.96
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 14,779.94, its strongest
finish since September 8.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 26.74 points or 2.42 percent to
1,130.74.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section flourished at an estimated 500
million shares, but was down from 515.61 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba Corp. was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Describing the coalition as a very strong market-moving factor
that will promote political stability in Japan, a dealers said
that the stock market has great expectations of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The market was also boosted by news that more major banks will
raise fresh capital, either from the government or from fellow
corporations, in a bid to clean up their balance sheets and write
off bad loans, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Retailers led the advance, as the sector gained 4.54
percent. Much of that gain was on rising expectations that a
coalition between the two political parties may be a step closer
toward realizing a suspension in the national consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
overwhelmed losers 960 to 215, with 124 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Praises Late President Liu Shaoqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today praised the outstanding contributions late President Liu
Shaoqi made to China's liberation and socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president made the comments during a CPC Central
Committee meeting to mark the 100th birth anniversary of the late
leader. Some 6,000 people attended the meeting held in Beijing's
Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who also serves as general secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, lauded Liu as a great
Maxist, proletarian revolutionary, statesman and theorist.
</P>
<P>
"Liu Shaoqi was a key member of the first generation leadership
headed by Mao Zedong, and was an excellent state and Party leader
who had withstood the tests of time," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Liu performed remarkable feats benefitting the
cause to the liberation of the Chinese people and to construction
efforts following the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Liu scored major achievements in not only the political,
economic, military and diplomatic arenas, but also the fields of
culture, education and Party building. Liu also made major
contributions to the formation and development of Mao Zedong
Thought, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"Liu Shaoqi's glorious life is closely linked to the history of
both the Party and the nation. He is loved by the Party, the army
and people of all nationalities even today," said Jiang. "His name
will remain forever in the annuals of history."
</P>
<P>
Liu served as chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress prior to becoming president. He was
treated cruelly during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), and
suffered cruel persecution at the hands of counterrevolution
cliques led by Lin Biao and the Gang of Four. Liu passed away on
November 12, 1969.
</P>
<P>
Jiang retraced Liu's life experiences and said the late leader
attached great importance to economic construction while actively
exploring ways to build socialism in line with concrete conditions
in China.
</P>
<P>
"His thoughts and actions have provided useful references for
our economic reform which unfolded following the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th Party Central Committee," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Liu helped to pioneer the people's congress system. He served
as chairman of the First National People's Congress Standing
Committee and guided the promulgation of a series of major laws
and regulations which remain as major components of China's legal
system.
</P>
<P>
Jiang concluded speech by calling the Party and people,
particularly leading officials at various levels, to learn from
and emulate Liu's traits as they strive to build China into a
modern socialist nation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army, Rebels Trade Mortar Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine army troops and
Muslim rebels exchanged mortar fire in two separate incidents in
Maguindanao, the Southern Philippines, Wednesday, shattering the
ceasefire agreement, a military report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rolando C. Bautista, commander of the 6th Infantry Division of
the Philippine Army, said no casualty was reported on the
government side.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear about the casualty of the other
side, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), he said.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the first attack occurred Wednesday when an
undetermined number of MILF bombarded the command post of "A"
Company of the 57th Infantry Battalion with 81mm mortar shells and
0.50 caliber machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers immediately retaliated with machine-gun and mortar
fire. The battle lasted 45 minutes before the MILF guerrillas
retreated.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said that on the same day, some 50 MILF rebels
attacked elements of the 39th Infantry Battalion, firing 86 rounds
of 81mm mortar shells and opening fire of their 0.50 caliber
machine-guns.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of gunfire and mortar shelling lasted almost an
hour as the troops asked for support from a nearby battery base,
forcing the rebels to disengage from the fighting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government and MILF have reached a ceasefire agreement
earlier. They are currently holding peace talks to end the
fighting in Central Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Insurers Refuse to Cover Riot Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) --Lesotho's insurers have
repudiated 80 percent of claims arising from the destruction of
the capital Maseru during rioting two months ago, South Africa's
The Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's two main insurance companies, Alliance Insurance and
Lesotho National Insurance Group (LNIG), have rejected most
claims for damages which resulted from rioting after Southern
African Development Community troops invaded the country
in late September.
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at about 350 million U.S. dollars, with
many of the businesses hit being owned by South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The LNIG has told policy holders they were not covered for
damage caused by war, invasion, the act of a foreign enemy, civil
war or popular uprising.
</P>
<P>
About 70 claims were received, LNIG officials said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, land owners and developers are angry at the
Maseru City council's order that rebuilding efforts be halted
because they do not fit in with the city's development plans.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have applied for a High Court interdict
against those proceeding with their own rebuilding plans.
</P>
<P>
The city council decided to implement the Maseru Development
Plan, approved in 1991, which seeks to turn Maseru into a modern
city with multi-story buildings. But land owners argue that there
is no legislation in place for the implementation of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Furniture chain store Ellerines was taking the council to
court after it was ordered to stop trading from a store that had
been rebuilt, said the paper.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Task Force to Maintain Cease-fire in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG has set up its third task force to maintain a
cease-fire agreement in Guinea Bissau, a senior ECOMOG officer
said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's Field Commander Timothy Shelpidi said in a statement
Thursday that the task force will uphold and maintain the
cease-fire agreement reached between President of Guinea Bissau
Benard Vieira and opposition leader Ausumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi said that the task force will begin operation as soon
as the details of modalities and logistics for the mission are
endorsed by relevant authorities of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The New Nigerian newspaper Friday quoted him as saying that
Senegalese and Guinean troops currently operating in the tiny
west African country will have to withdraw while ECOMOG took over
their positions.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG will also deploy interposition forces to fully
guarantee the cease-fire agreement reached last August and

Most of the areas in the Jenin area designed to be turned over
to the Palestinian side are not heavily populated and the
redeployment is relatively easy, said an Israeli military officer.
</P>
<P>
This is the first phase of Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank under the Wye peace accord signed last month in
Washington. Israel has to yield 13 percent of the West Bank
territories to the Palestinian side in 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, 2 percent of the land in the vicinity of Jenin
will go from exclusive Israeli control (known as Area C) to joint
Palestinian-Israeli control (Area B).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another 7.1 percent now under joint control
will be reverted to full Palestinian administration (Area A).
</P>
<P>
Friday's redeployment was okayed by the Israeli cabinet
Thursday after receiving confirmations from the Palestinian side
that it has fulfilled its first implementation commitments,
including publishing a decree to collect illegal weapons, drafting
an anti-incitement decree and arresting 10 of the 30 fugitives
demanded by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Confrontation May Continue in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the major opposition in the country, has set 12
preconditions for talks with the ruling Bangladesh Awami League
(BAL) to negotiate an end to strikes, in response to the
government's "no-hartal" call.
</P>
<P>
The BNP was ready to sit with the BAL for talks if the
government agreed to remove the reasons for hartal, A.Q.M.
Badruddoza Chowdhury, deputy leader of the opposition in
Parliament, told a meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first formal reaction from the opposition to the
ruling party's call to stop hartals. Finance Minister Shah A.M.S.
Kibria and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made the call earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury listed 12 conditions for his party's meeting with the
BAL, including immediate mid-term polls, review of the Chittagong
Hill Tracts peace accord on the basis of referendum, stopping
repression of opposition leaders and activists, and withdrawal of
political cases against opposition leaders and activists.
</P>
<P>
"The BNP is ready to renounce hartal in national interest if
these conditions are accepted," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an oblique reference to the prime minister's proposal to
renounce hartal last Sunday, he urged the ruling party to
immediately pay 519 billion taka (about 10.8 billion U.S. dollars)
to the national exchequer as compensation for the damages caused
by 173 hartals enforced by the BAL during BNP's rule between 1991
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
"According to the present finance minister, a day's hartal
causes a loss of 3.86 billion taka (about 84.4 million dollars).
If 860 million taka (about 17.9 million dollars) is deducted, even
then the Awami League caused a colossal loss of 519 billion taka
by their 173 days of hartal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, BNP Chairperson and Leader of the Opposition
in Parliament Kaleda Zia called upon the people to take vow afresh
to hasten the fall of the present government.
</P>
<P>
"We will make our agitation programs against the government a
success at any cost," she said.
</P>
<P>
She accused the government of failure to maintain law and order
in the country, being indifferent to rehabilitation of
flood-affected people, as "genuinely affected people were not
getting relief and relief materials are misappropriated by the
ruling party leaders."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared last Sunday that her
Awami League would never call hartals, either in power or in
opposition in future. "I am making this announcement unilaterally
both as the prime minister and the president of the Awami League,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina announced that the BAL decided to "shun the politics of
hartals ... in the greater interest of economic development of the
country" and "for the people and country's interest," and
justified the BAL-led hartals when in opposition as "fighting for
the people's democratic rights."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here were of the view that the announcement
of "no hartal" was designed to put pressure on the opposition
parties, which, if continuing their "hartal" programs, would be
easily held responsible by the government for failures in
conducting post-flood rehabilitation and reconstruction programs
and in maintaining law and order situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
As the government has outright ruled out the possibility of
mid-term elections, and regards the Chittagong Hill Tracts peace
treaty, signed with hill tribals in December last year, as one of
its major achievements since coming to power in 1996, it is
impossible for it to accept the opposition's conditions, according
to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
And the opposition, by announcing the 12-point precondition for
talks to end hartals, has shown no sign of recession, the analysts
said. Under such circumstances, the present political
confrontation between the ruling and opposition may continue in
the South Asian nation, they added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police Nab Three Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police have
seized three drug-traffickers who hid capsules of narcotics worth
17.6 million Shillings (about 26,000 U.S. Dollars) in their
stomachs.
</P>
<P>
The drugs which the suspects, all Dar es Salaam residents, had been
wrapped in three layers of materials including condoms, according to
local newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Drug Unit's chief, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP),
Esaka Mugasa, said here Thursday that the suspects will
soon appear in court.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who came from Tehran, Iran, on an Emirates flight,
were nabbed on November 12 at the Dar es Salaam International Airport,
Mugasa said, adding that they had planned to sell the drugs locally
and smuggle a part to Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the suspects were sent to the Muhimbili Medical
Center for X-ray check after being seized.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Ayoub Mohamed Ally, 25, was found to have swallowed a total
of 86 pellets. He managed to excrete only 25 of the pellets and
vomited one. The rest were extracted from his intestine after an
operation, Mugasa said.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect, Salum Abdallah Hemed, 33, swallowed a total of 70
pellets, all of which he managed to excrete. The third one was
identified as Fred Richard Rukwakwa, 25, excreted a total of 22
pellets, the senior police officer said.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti engineer
invented an electronic device that enables deaf drivers to
interact with other drivers on the road, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The device, which consists of three lights, works by
translating the honks of the horns into blinking lights.
</P>
<P>
A deaf driver can "see" where the horns of other cars are
coming from when the right or left lights outside the car are
on. The third light, installed inside the deaf driver's car, goes
off when he or she honks the horn.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi Al-Osta, the inventor, said that his device, which was
officially registered with Kuwait's Ministry of Commerce and
Industry, "was highly appreciated by specialists."
</P>
<P>
He said that the automatic sensitive device was easy to
install in all automobiles, and requires only 12 volts of the
automobile's battery.
</P>
<P>
Al-Osta earlier invented a device to help disabled fencing
athletes, which was used by a number of Kuwaiti fencing champions
with success.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Senate No Final Solution to Cambodia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The proposal of
establishing a senate in Cambodia's parliament as agreed by the
country's two major political parties last week has received mixed
responses from political and legal experts as well as civilians.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts lauded a parliamentary upper house as an
effective and creative solution to the nearly four-month political
deadlock in Cambodia, while others warned it is only a short-term
solution that could create more problems.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the capital of Phnom Penh welcomed the progress
made in the past week toward forming a new coalition government.
But they cautioned that even if the negotiations between major
political parties succeed, the new government still could fail if
the leaders only think about power and themselves, rather than the
people.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian People's Party (CPP) suggested last week that CPP
President Chea Sim should play the role of acting head of state
and chair the senate, and agreed to FUNCINPEC's demand that its
President Prince Ranariddh hold the National Assembly presidency.
</P>
<P>
A working group began on Thursday to hammer out the details of
the senate before the proposal is presented to the National
Assembly for approval.
</P>
<P>
But a number of problems still need to be negotiated, and the
senate legislation is unlikely to be ready by November 25 when the
Assembly opens, FUNCINPEC Steering Committee Member Ahmad Yahya
said.
</P>
<P>
The issues include: how many senators will be appointed and how
to appoint them, and how much power should the senate have in
comparison with the National Assembly. It was reported that many
members of both the CPP and FUNCINPEC want to become members of
the senate.
</P>
<P>
It appears that the monarch will appoint the first senators
from proposed candidates, and the size of the body proposed by
parliamentarians is between 50 and 60, or close to half of the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that the creation of the senate will
require a constitutional amendment and perhaps changes in many
established articles. They even predicted that the body will
dilute the power of the powerful National Assembly and its
president, much sought-after by FUNCINPEC to balance a
CPP-dominated cabinet to be led solely by Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The body will also provide one more check and balance in
passing laws, but will slow the legislative process, analysts
said. "Sometimes it's good if there are a lot of stages to effect
legislation but it might be harmful because it will take longer,"
one legal expert said.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, its members need to be paid from government
coffers, which will certainly add to the burden on the already
difficult national revenue.
</P>
<P>
But many people have expressed optimism about Cambodia's
future, saying "everything will be getting better if the leaders
trust each other and work for the interest of the people not for
power."
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting between the CPP and FUNCINPEC, which broke
the months-long post-election political stalemate in Cambodia, had
been hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk before he left for a medical
checkup in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The international community has welcomed and supported the
progress toward forming a new Cambodian government, calling it a
start toward political reconciliation and peace and development of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia hopes that a new government will enable the country to
regain its seat at the U.N., which was left vacant after internal
fighting broke out in the country in July 1997. Membership into
the regional grouping of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) was also deferred.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders will meet in Hanoi, Vietnam in December. Analysts
believe that early political reconciliation will help Cambodia
gain the membership of ASEAN and millions of U.S. dollars of
foreign aid.

LOS ANGELES -- A U.S. researcher has found the fossilized
remnants of an asteroid that may have caused the global extinction
of dinosaurs and other species more than 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Frank Kyte, a geochemist from the University of California at
Los Angeles (UCLA), found the fossil meteorite while studying the
sediment boundary layer between the Cretaceous and Tertiary
eras. His findings suggest that the original meteorite had a rocky
composition that corresponds with the makeup of asteroids, as
opposed to the porous materials that would more likely be found in
a comet. (US-Asteroid-Dinosaur)

MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign debts
expanded by 0.5 percent to 45.662 billion U.S. dollars at the end
of the first quarter this year, from 45.433 billion dollars in
December, 1997, the Philippines News Agency said Friday.

when the bank finalized a new deposit facility arrangement with
ING Bank consisting of short-term non-trade deposit liabilities,
which was aimed at boosting the country's international reserves.

The private sector debts reached 106 million dollars in net

<HEADLINE> Chinese Listed Company Punished for Severe Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hongguang Industrial
Co. Ltd. based in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, was recently punished by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) for committing a number of grave violations
including faking profits to deceive others.
</P>
<P>
The predecessor of the Hongguang Company was the state-owned
Hongguang electron tube plant which was reorganized into a company
with limited liability in May 1993. The company obtained approval
to issue shares to the public in May 1997 and gained 410.2 million
yuan from the issues.
</P>
<P>
According to a CSRC circular on the matter featured in today's
China Securities News, Hongguang was found to have reported false
profits, first to obtain the right to float shares, and later to
trap investors, to have hidden major facts including outmoded
production equipment, and to have embezzled funds for purposes
such as repaying bank loans, filling up corporate losses and
unaccounted expenditures, and investing in stock tradings.
</P>
<P>
As punishment, the company had the 4.5 million yuan in illicit
income confiscated, and was fined an additional one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company's officers, including former chairman of the board
of directors He Xingyi and former general manager Yan Zhancui, and
former deputy director of the finance division Chen Saobing were
banned from engaging in any kind of stock tradings or acting as
advanced administrative personnel in listed companies and stock
brokerages. Twelve other members of the board of directors were
also given a disciplinary warning.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongxing Trust and Investment Co. Ltd., the chief
underwriter of Hongguang stocks, and the Zhongxingfa Enterprises
Trusteeship Co. Ltd., financial advisor to Hongguang, Shudu
Accountants Affairs Agency of Chengdu, which produced false
financial auditing reports and a misleading report on profits, all
had their illicit incomes confiscated and were fined. Responsible
persons were also punished.
</P>
<P>
Also, Chengdu Assets Evaluation Agency, the Sichuan Provincial
Economic Lawyers Office, and Guotai Securities Co. Ltd. and
Chengdu Securities Company, both of which acted as promoters of
Hongguang shares, all had their illicit incomes confiscated,
received fines, and had their responsible persons punished.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council recently issued another
circular calling for effective measures to prevent similar
violations.
</P>
<P>
China Securities News also run a special commentary urging
securities brokerages to operate their businesses according to
law, and told other intermediary organizations to exercise due
responsibility in the securities market.

Villages near towns will receive TV signals through the
province's major cable network, while remote and scattered
villages will have their problem solved by setting up ground
satellite receivers, said Luo.
</P>
<P>
The government has also encouraged five developed areas
including Hangzhou and Ningbo cities to aid the five
less-developed areas around Jinyun and Kaihua with money and
equipment, and the amount of aid is estimated at about 6 million
yuan (720,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Luo also noted that a lack of information is a great barrier to
further development of the rural areas, and most of the villagers
are still living in an isolated world. This project will provide
them with a means of contact with the outside to help free them
from backwardness and poverty as soon as possible.

<P>
HANGZHOU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- More people living in
mountainous areas of eastern China's Zhejiang Province are now
able to watch TV.
</P>
<P>
All the villagers in the She Autonomous Township of Anxi in
Zhejiang, where many ethnic people live, recently watched a CCTV-1
program after technicians set up a ground satellite receiver.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, however, many television sets in the township were
just ornaments. Most of the mountain villages were unable to get
TV reception, because of the high altitude and backward economy of
the region.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of a project to enable all the rural people in
the province to watch TV by 2000," said Luo Xiehong,
vice chief of the Provincial Bureau of Radio and TV, adding that
Zhejiang will then become the first province in China where all
the villages can receive CCTV-1 and CCTV-2 programs.
</P>
<P>
Related data show that over 90 percent of the households in the
province are now able to watch TV, but there are still 2,135
remote villages with slow economic development not yet able to do
so.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker Sentenced to Twenty Year Prison Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
announced that the Intermediate People's Court in Shenzhen,
Guangdong Province, convened a trial of first instance today and
sentenced a Chinese man convicted of hijacking an airliner to
Taiwan on April 6, 1993, to 20 years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen court also convicted Huang Shugang of embezzling
some 273,000 yuan from his employer.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year sentence represented the combined punishment for
the two crimes.
</P>
<P>
Huang was repatriated to the Chinese mainland on July 16, 1997,
following extensive negotiations between the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Straits
exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
Huang formerly worked as a purchasing agent for a hotel
operated by the Tangshan Iron and Steel Company in Hebei
Province. Huang was convicted of embezzling company funds and
misappropriating materials valued at 273,000 yuan in the period
between January 1993 and the date of the hijacking. The hijacker
obtained funds by illegally cashing checks with private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Huang and Liu Baocai, a Hebei farmer, purchased handguns,
rifles and ammunition prior to boarding flight 2811 scheduled to
fly from Shenzhen to Beijing on April 6, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers forced the pilot to divert the aircraft to Taipei
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen court sentenced Huang to 15 years imprisonment for
hijacking, with an additional nine years for embezzlement
embezzlement. The court reduced Huang's sentence to 20 years based
on time served in Taiwan and on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Liu's case will be heard in a separate trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has officially launched the second phase of the
Resettlement Program in Makonde District in northern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing about 6,000 people and government officials in the
district Thursday, Mugabe said that 491 farms measuring 699,880
hectares were identified for acquisition in the Mashonaland
West Province to resettle landless families.
</P>
<P>
"This is a joyous occasion as it marks the government's
commitment to implementing the Resettlement Program at the onset
of this season's rains," the daily Herald Friday quoted Mugabe
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Land must continue to be used productively as we do not want
the Resettlement Program to result in the reduction of
productivity and degradation of the environment," the president
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that it is the responsibility of traditional
leaders, district administrators, councillors and governors to
decide who are to settle on which farms and the government will
not condone any other settlement outside this structure.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to land-hungry villagers to desist from
invading farms as this will cause further delays in the process
of orderly resettlement.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Zimbabwean government ordered those who
have illegally settled themselves on the commercial farms to
vacate the farms by Monday or face the wrath of the law.
</P>
<P>
According to the second phase of the Resettlement Program, the
government will acquire about 1,500 farms or five million
hectares to resettle 90,000 landless families in the next five
years.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Continue to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices continued to
improve at this week's auction sales despite faltering on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator rose 16 cents to close at 529
Australian cents a kilogram clean while the western indicator
finished 14 cents higher at 480 Australian cents a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
About eight percent of the 73,234 bales offered at sales in
three cities of Goulburn, Geelong and Fremantle were passed in.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) weekly market
review said the market eased considerably Thursday when overseas
customers resisted the surge in which prices have risen 13 percent
on average over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The stronger Australian dollar has pushed up prices.
</P>
<P>
"The trade is also conscious of the relatively large quantity
of wool currently rostered for sale next week," the review said.
</P>
<P>
"This could produce an irregular market but the general
consensus is that the market should quickly stabilize but with
much smaller upward movements in prices than we have seen in
recent weeks."
</P>
<P>
Wool broker Wesfarmers Dalgety's weekly wool report said the
last dash price fall added a degree of caution to the outlook for
next week's sales at Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle, where 114,630
bales were likely to test the market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Raises Gas Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to raise the price of natural gas by 15 percent for all
types of uses, to make it close to the international level and to
fulfill commitments made to donors countries and agencies for
fresh loans.
</P>
<P>
After the gas price hike, effective from December 1 this year,
domestic consumers of gas would have to pay 24 taka (50 U.S.
cents) more each month for a single-burner stove and 37.5 taka (78
U.S. cents) more for a double-burner stove, which now cost 160
taka (3.33 U.S. dollars) and 250 taka (5.21 U.S. dollars) each
month respectively, according to an official handout.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to raise the price of gas by 15 percent
only, instead of increasing it to the international level at one
go, considering the sufferings it would cause to the consumers,
the handout said.
</P>
<P>
The gas price has remained unchanged for four and a half years
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Domestic consumers use only about 5 percent of the natural gas,
while the lion's share of gas consumption goes to power generation
with 70 percent, the production of chemical fertilizer and other
industries with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In May 1995, Bangladesh agreed to increase gas tariff by 5
percent each year starting from 1995-96, under a Gas
Infrastructure Development Project loan agreement signed with the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Asian Development Bank imposed similar conditions
under a Natural Gas Loan Agreement.
</P>
<P>
As the gas price was not increased in keeping with the
commitments, both banks have reminded Bangladesh of the need to
fulfill its commitments as a requirement to get fresh loans, for
projects such as the Gas Marketing Development Project and the
Dhaka Power Systems Upgrading Project.
</P>
<P>
The matter of fulfilling the old conditions was raised at a
time when the government sought assistance from the donors for
post-flood rehabilitation programs, according to the handout.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) has
expressed grave concern over the enhancement of the gas price
rise.
</P>
<P>
The price increase was done according to the "prescription" of
donor agencies without considering the purchasing power of the
common people of the country, the CAB said.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Profits in New Zealand on Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Hotel profitability in New
Zealand continues to decline this year in one of the sharpest
downturns ever, the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing fall in profitability has been caused by a
combination of factors which include the dramatic decline in Asian
visitor arrivals, recession in the domestic economy and consequent
 falls in occupancy and room rates," the NZPA quoted Principal
Stephen Hamilton of Ernst and Young's tourism sector as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hotels in Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, have
experienced a sharp decline in profitability, down an estimated 33
percent on average in the past year, according to Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
Christchurch, Queenstown and Rotorua hotels have seen average
profits fall of 25 percent, 33 percent and 37 percent respectively
in the past year, he said, adding that Wellington bucked the
trend, overtaking Auckland as the most profitable hotel center.
</P>
<P>
"The bounce back period is likely to take some time, as severe
discounting over the past two years makes it harder to increase
room rates," Hamilton said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Mortgage Rates Tumble to 31-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Mortgage rates in New
Zealand are tumbling to their lowest in 31 years as lenders
respond to a latest announcement by the Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand's central bank Wednesday announced it will
slash its target for the monetary conditions index for the first
quarter of 1999 to negative 400, a bigger-than-expected easing in
monetary conditions.
</P>
<P>
In response to the announcement, the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ)
was the first to cut its floating mortgage rate from 6.95 percent
to 6.5 percent Thursday night, the lowest floating rate since
1967. The move triggered similar reductions by other main banks.
</P>
<P>
Telephone banks BankDirect, Mortgage Express and Hongkong Bank
all followed suit Friday by offering the same floating mortgage
rate of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Short-term fixed rates were heading even lower. BankDirect cut
its six-month rate to 5.5 percent, the lowest mortgage rate
offered by a bank in 31 years. BNZ, Australia-New Zealand Bank
(ANZ), and AMP/Ergo also cut their fixed rates.
</P>
<P>
BNZ lowered its three-year rate to 6.95 percent, becoming the
first bank to offer a fixed rate for three years below 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
BNZ's rate cut will put pressure on other banks to move. The
Evening Post, a Wellington-based newspaper, said that New
Zealand's big banks are expected to "cut their rates by early next
week at the latest."

<HEADLINE> India Spices, Oilseeds Export Struck by EU Health Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian exports of spices and
oilseeds have fallen foul of the European Union (EU) which has
described these as unfit for human consumption on account of very
high toxin content, official sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
India's spices and oilseeds exports to the EU have been rising
lately and a ban or any restriction would cost Indian exporters
crores of rupees in lost business.
</P>
<P>
With the EU taking up the issue, it would be a matter of time
before the United States, Japan and other countries could follow
suit, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The EU, Japan and the United States have laid high standards
for pesticide residues in mangoes, bananas, grapes and potatoes.
The EU has also claimed that India's livestock production
contained hormones, and placed tariff rate quotas on Indian
mushrooms, they said.
</P>
<P>
It has also banned imports of all seafood from India on the
ground of hygiene, causing big losses for the country.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government officials described the latest EU move as
non-tariff barriers which they said were rising. Over 13 Indian
industries have been hurt by non-tariff barriers, including fish,
milk and meat products, fruits and vegetables.

<HEADLINE> No New Aid Committed by HKSAR Government: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority said here Thursday that the administration
had not made any new financial commitment in respect of aid to
other nations in their economic adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has participated only in the financing
package organized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1997
 for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on certain misunderstandings about
Hong Kong making donations to Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The SAR has committed to making a swap facility of up to one
billion U.S. dollars available to Thailand when the IMF organized
a financing package for Thailand in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said this is in effect a loan facility that
attracts a market interest rate payable to the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority.
</P>
<P>
"It is in Hong Kong's interests as a leading financial center
in the region to have a strong and stable neighboring
environment." Hong Kong's participation in the IMF financing
package underscores its commitment to regional monetary stability,
the spokesman stressed.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Summit to Be Held December 15-16 in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The sixth ASEAN summit meeting
will be held on December 15-16 in Hanoi with the theme of
solidarity and cooperation for an ASEAN of peace, stability and
equitable development, Vietnamese deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan
said.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will be the first formal meeting of government and
state leaders of all the nine member countries -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam became a formal member of ASEAN in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the summit meeting, ASEAN leaders will review the
development and growth of the organization in the last 31 years
and work out measures to overcome regional challenges on the
threshold of the 21st century, Khoan told a press briefing here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Five documents to be signed during the summit are the Hanoi
declaration, the Hanoi plan of action, the frame agreement on
facilitating goods in transit among ASEAN countries, the frame
agreement on mutual recognition of goods standards and quality,
and the second phase protocol of ASEAN services, said Khoan.
</P>
<P>
Khoan said the sixth ASEAN summit will put an end to
confrontation among member countries and open up a new era for
cooperation and development in the region. The outward looking
policy of the regional organization will be affirmed at the
meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
The summit, Khoan said, is an opportunity for ASEAN to express
its wish to strengthen cooperation with its dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders will hold formal meetings with its dialogue
partners -- China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the summit, there will be an ASEAN foreign ministerial
meeting, an ASEAN economic ministerial meeting, a joint foreign
and economic ministerial meeting, a senior officials' meeting, and
a senior economic officials' meeting, scheduled for December 8-13.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy in Thailand Closes on Security Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok
closed Friday for security reasons but will reopen on Monday, an
embassy press release said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the State Department's current worldwide caution
against potential terrorist acts directed against American
interests, the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, as a precautionary step,
will be closed on Friday, November 20," the release said.
</P>
<P>
An embassy spokesman declined to say whether there was a
specific threat against the embassy, but said the closure was
related to matters discussed in a "worldwide caution" issued by
the U.S. State Department on November 12.
</P>
<P>
The public warning said "the potential for retaliatory acts
against Americans overseas continues to exist" in light of
tensions with Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections, the August
bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa and U.S. air strikes in
Afghanistan and Sudan, and the arrests of suspects involved in the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
It also warned of continuing threats by "terrorists," including
Saudi Arabian Usama bin Ladin, who was indicted for the embassy
bombings.
</P>
<P>
"We take these threats seriously and the U.S. has increased
security at United States government facilities worldwide," it
said, adding that some posts had been temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
The decision to close the Bangkok embassy was a local
initiative in response to the security threat, sources close to
the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post reported earlier that U.S. authorities had
alerted their Thai counterparts to the presence of three Arabian
terrorists, operating separately in Thailand over the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
In August, Thailand's intelligence agencies were put on alert
against possible reprisals against American-owned businesses after
the U.S. raids in Afghanistan and Sudan.

threatening the villages in the the lower reaches of the river
valley.
</P>
<P>
A number of medical teams have reached the quake-stricken areas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Tokyo to 'Vigorously' Implement New Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Friday called on Japan to "vigorously" implement the 24
trillion yen (about 196.7 billion dollars) economic stimulus
package unveiled by the Japanese government earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan,
Clinton said the U.S. wants Japan to fully reform its ailing
banking sector, boost domestic demand and take additional
deregulatory and market-opening measures.
</P>
<P>
"Delaying in a crisis like this only makes matters worse,"
Clinton said, adding that the rapid and vigorous implementation of
the new package and relevant laws would lead to an increase in
jobs and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked Japanese citizens to help their country by
striking a balance between a need to save for the future and a
need to purchase more in the present.
</P>
<P>
It is crucial for the Japanese government to convince "the
citizens that they too have a critical role to play here in
purchasing more goods and services in the domestic economy,"
Clinton stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the 30-minute speech, Clinton also warned against Japan's
alleged unfair exports of hot rolled steel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Trading partners of the U.S. would face "retaliatory
protectionism" if the business practices of Japan and other
countries were found to be unfair, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a surge in imports of hot-rolled steel from Japan as an
example, the U.S. president said such a trend in trade is not good
for the U.S. or Japan in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Thursday for a two-day visit to Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Holds Impeachment Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Judiciary
Committee held a 12-hour plus impeachment hearing against
President Bill Clinton Thursday with Clinton's private attorney
shelling questions on Independent Counsel investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr defended his investigation
under insistent questioning from Democratic lawmakers and
Clinton's private attorney David Kendall, while relaxed a bit in
Republican's turn for questioning.
</P>
<P>
"That is false and you know that it is false," Starr snapped at
one point in the nationally televised hearing as Kendall accused
him of prosecutorial misconduct in his dealing with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we have abided by our obligations," Starr
said as his adversary pressed him at another point on leaks of
grand jury material.
</P>
<P>
"Let me begin with the simple but powerful truth that nothing
in this overkill of investigation amounts to a justification for
the impeachment of the president of the United States," Kendall
started the questioning.
</P>
<P>
Starr said he wasn't present as an advocate for the report he
had presented to Congress, although he referred to "the
president's perjury and obstruction of justice" in connection with
his affair with Lewinsky and long efforts to conceal the truth
about it.
</P>
<P>
The president's lawyer asked Starr questions about his own
conduct, and that of the prosecutors, FBI agents and others who
worked for him.
</P>
<P>
Kendall's questions were at the end of the day-long pattern in
which Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee sought
to put the spotlight on Starr, whose evidence triggered the third
impeachment inquiry in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
The day began with Starr laying out the evidence he has
gathered about Clinton and Lewinsky, accusing the president of
conducting a "scheme to conceal."
</P>
<P>
He said that Clinton's alleged abuse of power might require his
removal from office and that Clinton was at the heart of a
"pattern of obstruction" that was inconsistent with his duty.
</P>
<P>
Starr's testimony was the first the committee had taken since
receiving boxes of his evidence this fall.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the
committee, said, "It is not acceptable to force mothers to testify
against their daughters, to make lawyers testify against their
clients, to require Secret Service agents to testify against the
people they protect, or to make bookstores tell what books people
read."
</P>
<P>
"I and many others, believe that Mr. Starr has crossed the line
into obsession," he said.

KATHMANDU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- An aircraft which lost
contact Thursday afternoon was found crashed Friday in Nepal and
the fate of the pilot, the only one aboard the plane, was not

<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The world's first
surviving septuplets Thursday celebrated their first birthday
quietly at home.
</P>
<P>
The first year has presented challenges -- eye surgery for
Kenneth, a blood transfusion for Joel, bouts with lung disease for
Alexis and special feeding needs for Alexis and Natalie.
</P>
<P>
Yet all seven children are rolling over, grasping, smiling and
babbling away. "Five of them are saying 'mama', and I am pretty
sure they know what it means," said their mother, Bobbi McCaughey.
</P>
<P>
The four boys and three girls were born on November 19, 1997,
and at that time were the world's only surviving septuplets. Two
months after they went home from the hospital, another set of
septuplets was born and survived in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The parents of the world's first surviving septuplets, Bobbi
and Kenny McCaughey have rejected offers from tabloid newspapers
of almost one million U.S. dollars for exclusive photographs of
the children, the family's spokesman Wes Yoder said.
</P>
<P>
They have also declined a potentially lucrative
movie-of-the-week deal, as well as many commercial endorsements,
Yoder said, adding that they just want normal and quiet family
life.
</P>
<P>
So far, major media appearances have included an ABC prime-time
special in April, a short NBC Nightly News piece for Mother's Day
and a Dateline NBC special that ran at the birth.
</P>
<P>
There was to have been an extensive public glimpse at the
squirming seven on a talk show taped earlier in the week, but that
got pushed off the airwaves Thursday in most U.S. markets by
nonstop coverage of the presidential impeachment hearings from
Washington.

BUCHAREST, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan security service
announced Thursday that they have busted an international luxury
car theft ring, detaining 10 suspects of the Moldovan, Romanian
and Ukrainian nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The group, with special tools, switched off the alarm system on

stolen cars, the Moldovan news agency BASA reported.

Moldovan police have found eight cars stolen by the ring,
including some stolen from Romania.

Car theft is alarmingly rampant in Moldova. Interior Ministry
statistics show that 534 cars have been registered stolen this
year, with only a quarter reportedly found.
</P>
<P>
Moldovan police said many owners of stolen cars prefer not to
go to the police, but turn to local crime leaders, who usually ask
for half of the car value for its return.

WARSAW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Nine people have frozen to
death since a cold wave hit Poland several days ago, local media
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Winters in Poland are notorious for their severity. Several
days ago, most parts of the country, though experiencing an

above zero centigrade.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, however, the temperature in many parts
dropped sharply to -10 to -14 degrees. Endless snowstorms blocked
traffic in many areas and caused numerous road accidents.

With the death toll of those dying from the cold continuing to

makeshift shelters.

<P>
HANOI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have agreed to adopt measures to
help the state bank of Vietnam accelerate the country's reform
program, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the specific measures involving the IMF's Expanded
Structural Adjustment Credit (ESAF) and the WB's Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC) were agreed upon by Vietnam's state bank,
an official with the WB in Hanoi said.
</P>
<P>
Teams from the IMF and WB led by Anthony Elson, senior advisor
to the IMF's Asia and the Pacific Division, and WB director for
Vietnam, Andrew Steer met Vietnam's deputy prime minister and
state bank governor Nhuyen Tan Dung on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They told Dung that both teams were satisfied with the outcome

</P>
<P>
The officials promised that the WB and the IMF would continue
to implement existing programs for financial assistance to Vietnam
to help it overcome current difficulties.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Expects Genuine Sino-Portuguese Cooperation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch
Director Wang Qiren said here Thursday that Portugal and China
should maintain fine cooperation in the final stage of Macao's
transition period.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain Sino-Portuguese cooperation and resolve well the
problems concerning Macao's steady transition and power transfer
are a big matter of responsibility for the two countries, for
Macao people, and for history," Wang told a press conference in
response to some recent clamors in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The clamors are mainly related to the stationing of troops by
the central government in the future Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR), holidays in the SAR, nationality of Macao-born
Portuguese, fiscal situation of the Macao government, and the
official status of Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
"The stationing of proper-quantity and qualified troops in the
Macao SAR symbolizes the country's sovereignty and conforms to the
stipulation in the Macao Basic Law that the central government
takes charge of defense affairs in the SAR," Wang said, adding
that such military expenses will be undertaken by the central
government,
</P>
<P>
"However, such a decision, which has won widespread and cordial
support from Macao people of various sectors, is queried even up
to now," he said, adding that the query is inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
The stationing of troops is a matter of China's internal
affairs, just like other countries making arrangements for
national defense in their own territories, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"As some preparations for the stationing of troops have to be
carried out before the handover, we expect and believe that the
Portuguese side can coordinate and offer convenience," Wang Qiren
said.
</P>
<P>
As to public holidays for future Macao, members of the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR made sufficient
discussions in September and approved a decision on public
holidays in the Macao SAR. The National Day of Portugal was
naturally crossed out.
</P>
<P>
But there is a certain kind of voice recently claiming that
such an arrangement does not take into account the characteristics
of Macao and the friendly relationship of China and Portugal.
Someone even goes so far as to think that it does not embody the
principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"Such views cannot be thought to conform to the fact," Wang
Qiren said. "The holiday with a political tint which goes against
China's resumption of sovereignty over Macao ought to be
canceled," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that except the holiday with a strong political
tint, some religious holidays established under the Portuguese
rule have been retained. In fact, one of the holidays is only
celebrated by the Portuguese. It considers the peculiar historical
 background of Macao.

<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to the nationality issue of Macao-born Portuguese,
the Preparatory Committee recently submitted a proposal to
China's highest legislative body suggesting that Macao-born
Portuguese are free to choose either Chinese or Portuguese
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal shows adequate consideration for Macao's history
and reality, represents a flexible attitude toward the nationality
problem of Macao-born Portuguese and helps to enhance their
confidence in living and working in Macao," the director said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the method goes in line with the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the consensus and
understanding between Chinese and Portuguese premiers in 1994. "It
should not meet groundless blames and new issues are not necessary
to be raised."
</P>
<P>
Asked about his comment on the current fiscal situation of the
Macao government, Wang Qiren pointed out that the future Macao SAR
government will not be able to inherit any fiscal surplus and the
fiscal operation of the SAR government will be affected.
</P>
<P>
"Someone holds the view that land fund is the right fiscal
reserve given to the SAR government by the Portuguese-Macao
government. Obviously that is a conceptual mistake," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, the revenue
of the Portuguese-Macao government from land contracts is divided
between the current government and the SAR government. In this
sense, it cannot be taken as a kind of fiscal reserve at all.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the so-called official status of
Portuguese which is projected by the Portuguese side of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group and Macao Governor, Wang noted
that there are clear stipulations in the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration and the Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
At a Sino-Portuguese JLG meeting on Tuesday, Portuguese Chief
Representative Santana Carlos said the Macao government will make
a bilingual decree to strengthen the official status of
Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren pointed out that at present the official status of
Chinese has not been put into practice in administrative,
legislative and judicial fields since the Joint Declaration was
signed 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is a lack of confidence in the Basic Law and the future SAR
government for the current government to work out a bilingual
decree for the future SAR," the official said. "The worry is not
necessary."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the interview, Wang Qiren reiterated that in the
short transition period, both China and Portugal should make
concerted efforts to settle the problems left from history in
accordance with the Joint Declaration.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Coal Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to introduce a
series of preferential loan and fee exemption policies in order to
accelerate the development of coal gas as a major new energy
resource.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Administration of Coal Industry said
today that enterprises in the initial stages of developing coal
gas will not be required to pay government compensation fees for
the exploitation of coal gas resources. In addition, preferential
loans will be available for key coal gas projects.
</P>
<P>
The official said China will prioritize the development of coal
gas in order to offset shortfalls in the energy supply. The
expanded use of coal gas is expected to improve the country's
consumption structure for energy resources, reduce air pollution
and enhance safe production of coal mines.
</P>
<P>
China has abundant coal gas reserves, with coal fields in
northern, northeastern and southern China offering estimated
recoverable coal gas deposits of over 3.5 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 coal gas projects have been developed to date,
including gas storage tanks with a total capacity of 650,000 cubic
meters and coal gas pipeline with a cumulative length of 620,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the national annual use rate for coal
gas has exceeded 400 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has developed wide-ranging advanced coal gas
technology, including 20 technological items equalling
international standards.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia to Form New Government Sooner Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia will soon form a new
government so the country will be able to respond to NATO request
for permission to send forces there, a Macedonian TV station
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov met with Ljubco Georgievski,
Chairman of the Democratic Party for Macedonian Unity (IMRO-DPMNU)
-- the winner of the recent parliamentary elections -- after the
new parliament held its first session Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president empowered Georgievski to form a new government
during their meeting and a formal authorization is due to take
place on November 23, the TV report said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament is expected to discuss the government line-up on
November 30, and the new government's formation is scheduled for
December.
</P>
<P>
Under Macedonia's Constitution, the president is to authorize
the cabinet's formation within 10 days after the parliament is
formed, and the new prime minister will form a government within
twenty days after being authorized.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov however authorized the formation of a new government
three days after the parliament was formed. Georgievski was given
only 10 days to finish his government line-up because the country
needs to respond quickly to NATO's request to send forces to
Macedonia to supervise the situation in the neighboring Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO planned to deploy 1,500 to 1,800 troops in Macedonia as
part of its operation "Eagle Eye," which is to conduct airborne
surveillance over Kosovo. Most of the forces will serve as a
rapid extraction force to pluck Kosovo monitors to safety in case
of a threat. NATO is reportedly awaiting the new Macedonian
government's reply to its demand for military deployment.

<HEADLINE> Lao PM to Visit Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Lao Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphan will pay an official visit to Myanmar on Monday aimed
at strengthening the relations between the two countries while
promoting cooperation in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
According to an official announcement here Friday, the visit
will be made at the invitation of Senior-General Than Shwe,
chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and
also prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It will be Keobounphan's first visit to Myanmar since he became
prime minister in February this year.
</P>
<P>
In June 1994 and May 1995, Than Shwe and then Lao president
Nouhak Phoumsavan visited each other's country.
</P>
<P>
During the latter's visit to Myanmar, three agreements on trade
and agricultural cooperation and the agreed minutes of the first
meeting of the Myanmar-Laos Joint Commission for Bilateral
Cooperation (JCBC) were signed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also exchanged ratification documents
regarding their agreement on the fixed international boundary in
the Mekong river.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, then Lao prime minister Khamtay Siphandone (now
the president) visited Myanmar and two agreements on drug control
and border areas management and cooperation were signed. An
agreement on tourism cooperation was also endorsed in May that
year when Lao Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister's Office
Cheuang Somboumkhanh visited Yangon.
</P>
<P>
In August 1997, Lao Foreign Minister Somsawat Lengsavad met his
Myanmar counterpart U Ohn Gyaw in Yangon and co-chaired the third
meeting of the two countries' JCBC, during which a wide range of
bilateral issues were discussed.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, Lao Vice Foreign Minister Phongsavath
Boupha visited Myanmar and had discussions on the implementation
of the two countries' agreement on border areas management and
cooperation. This month, the two sides held the First Meeting of
Border Authorities at the Central Level in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Laos were simultaneously admitted into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in July 1997.

RIO DE JANEIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Investments in the
Brazilian telecommunication sector will reach 14 billion
U.S. dollars in the next three years, the National Economic and
Social Development Bank of Brazil (BNDES) announced on Thursday.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Two villagers were
killed Thursday in Yolombo in northwestern Colombia in the latest
clash between guerrilla fighters and local paramilitary groups,
press reports said.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth violence reported in the last 15 days in
Yolombo, a village in Antioquia department.

Local government secretary Luis Fernando Restrepo told
reporters that he was the only government official who reported at
work and that paramilitary members were seen in a nearby village,
where shots were heard Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The reports said guerrillas and paramilitary groups avoided
direct confrontation but attacked civilians whom they alleged to
be helping their enemies.
</P>

According to a communique issued Thursday by paramilitary
leader Carlos Castano, 16 rebels and 19 paramilitary members were

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Vietnam to Discuss Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai and Vietnamese trade
officials will meet next Wednesday to discuss cooperation on
agricultural products and barter trade, including the issue of
import quotas for Thai motorcycles, according to the Thai Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation on coffee in particular should benefit both
countries, which are small players in the world market compared
with South American producers, the Bangkok Post Friday quoted an
official of the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, cooperation on rubber would improve Thailand's
bargaining power if other producers could join in controlling
supplies to the world market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese side proposed last year that barter trade and
counter-trade be promoted, along with the use of local currencies
for trade payments to reduce dependence on hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's position is to discuss barter trade as an additional
channel for the private sector on a voluntary basis. Vietnam has
proposed barter trade in fish, agricultural products and minerals,
the official said.

<HEADLINE> Lugou Bridge Deterioration Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Lugou Bridge, the longest
stone arch bridge in north China built in 1189, is deteriorating
as a result of chemical pollution and destructive human activity.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is located downwind from a refractory material
plant, heat and power plant, steel works, and the dregs storage
area belonging to the Capital Iron and Steel Company. It is coated
with emissions from the plants, with the main pollutant in the
form of sulphur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The bridge's ornamental stone columns have deteriorated to a
point that makes it difficult to determine the design on the base
of a stele with an inscription by Emperor Qianlong (1711-1799),
the fourth emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
A distinguishing feature of the Bridge is the 485 lions, large
and small, carved on the caps of 280 rail columns. The lifelike
lions feature 485 unique gestures.
</P>
<P>
Human activity has also exacerbated the situation. The bridge
is closed during day and is under the strict supervision of the
relics protection unit. However, pedestrians and vehicles commonly
cross the bridge at night.
</P>
<P>
Groups of people often gather on the bridge to socialize on hot
summer nights.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-one of the 281 large lions have sustained various
degrees of damage, with 27 defaced to a point beyond repair. Over
half of the bridge's 279 rail boards have also sustained damage.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, also known as the Marco Polo Bridge, is the oldest
bridge located in southwest Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Italian adventurer Marco Polo (about 1254-1324) appraised the
structure as the "best bridge in the world."
</P>
<P>
The Lugou Bridge was destroyed by a flood and rebuilt in
1698. The structure is 266.5 meters long and 7.5 meters wide. The
Lugou Bridge, along with the nearby Wanping County Wall, is the
site in commemoration of the War of Resistance Against Japan which
started on July 7, 1937, when Japanese invaders attacked Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Twelve local residents
attended the 7th Meeting of the Dalian City People's Congress
Standing Committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local residents observed the legislative process which
involved the adoption of two bills, an announcement of official
appointments and removals and speeches on several topics.
</P>
<P>
The northeast China city introduced the program to enable local
residents to attend committee meetings in October and it became
one of the first Chinese cities to implement the practice.
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Wu Bin said promoting the participation of citizens
in public affairs represents an important step forward in full
realization of political democracy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the practice is also important for ensuring
legislative transparency.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shiqiang, captain of an oceangoing vessel, said that
"allowing ordinary citizens to observe meetings of the local
lawmaking body opens a new channel for the realization of
democracy." Qiao has great interest in politics and the law.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xueye, chairman of the Paozi Town People's Congress,
traveled 90 minutes from his home to attend the Dalian meeting.
</P>
<P>
Town congresses are the grass-roots organizations of the
overall people's congress system, and Wang said he hoped to gain
greater insight into standing committee procedures.
</P>
<P>
The National People Congress (NPC), China's highest legislative
body, and its Standing Committee exercise national legislative
power.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary citizens were previously prohibited from attending
meetings of standing committees at various levels.
</P>
<P>
However, related new laws stipulate that ordinary citizens
atteding meetings can present their views and table suggestions
through members from their electoral district.
</P>
<P>
Xiu Zhonghan, an official with the general office of the
Liaoning Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, said
allowing citizens to attend such meetings will encourage greater
supervision of people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
He said that the process will greatly increase the general
public's sense of responsibility of the need to participate in the
administration of state affairs.

Islands), Panama urged Britain and Argentina to resume talks over
the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
Oyden Ortega, president of the Panamanian Parliament Foreign
Affairs Committee, made the remark during a meeting with an
Argentine parliamentary delegation led by senators Daniel Baun and
Carlos Almiron.

the southern area of South America.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that Britain and Argentina could find a
peaceful solution to their dispute.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Europe signed an agreement here Thursday on joint operation of a
set of polar-orbiting weather satellites.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, they will jointly operate the polar
satellites that carry a common set of instruments so that the two
sides can share the data.
</P>
<P>
The satellite system will observe every part of the Earth and
provide various kinds of data useful in weather research and
forecasting. The first satellite, called Metop-1, will be
launched into space in 2003.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration operates two polar weather satellites, one of which
crosses the equator in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
After the launch of the first satellite in 2003, the European
Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological satellites
will take over the morning observation.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan People Getting Sufficient Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The people of Tibet don't have
to worry about a shortage of goods any longer, according to a
Tibetan Trade Department official who said that 98 percent of the
goods available exceed demand, with serious shortages in only
about two percent of the items.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans suffered from extreme shortages for a long time and
used to try and buy as much as possible at one time just to hold
in reserve. But the purchasing power of the people in the Tibet
Autonomous Region continues to grow, even as the growth of retail
sales keeps falling, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the annual average income of urban residents
reached 5,130 yuan in 1997, exceeding the average national level
for the first time, and the growth of total retail sales dropped
by 10 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Today there are plenty of commodities for sale in Tibet, and
people find as much there as they would in other provinces and
municipalities. And competition is becoming keener, especially in
seasons when a large number of goods are kept in stock and their
prices are greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
Prices are no longer the major factor affecting Tibetan buying
habit; they are now turning their attention to high quality and
beautiful styles.
</P>
<P>
Rubber overshoes made in Chungsaykung in Tibet used to be very
popular among Tibetan people, but this year only several hundreds
out of more than 10,000 produced have been sold. Better grade
leather shoes are now taking their place.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Impeachment Hearings Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The day-long U.S. House
Judiciary Committee hearings against President Bill Clinton
continued into late evening Thursday, with Clinton's lawyers
waiting to question the Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr publicly made his impeachment
case against Clinton at the start of the hearings earlier
Thursday, arguing to Congress that Clinton's alleged abuse of
power might require his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats countered that Starr had "crossed the line into
obsession" and accused that he was a "federally paid sex
policeman."
</P>
<P>
Starr at the hearings alleged Clinton engaged in a "scheme to
conceal" his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. The president was at the heart of a "pattern of
obstruction" that was inconsistent with his duty, he said.
</P>
<P>
"He testified that he could not recall being alone with Ms.
Lewinsky. That was untrue," Starr said of the president. "He
testified that he could not recall ever being in the Oval Office
hallway with Ms. Lewinsky, except perhaps when she was delivering
pizza. That was untrue," he added.
</P>
<P>
President's lawyers, including private attorney David Kendall
and White House counsel Charles Ruff, were also present in the
committee room, awaiting their turn to question Starr.
</P>
<P>
Starr's testimony was the first the committee had taken since
receiving boxes of his evidence this fall. While the full
Republican-controlled House has voted for an open-ended inquiry,
Republican appetite for prolonged proceedings has diminished
markedly in the wake of setbacks in midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
Before Starr began his two-hour statement, Democrats sought to
expand the 30 minutes that Clinton's lawyers were allotted to
question him.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the
committee, said, "It is not acceptable to force mothers to testify
against their daughters, to make lawyers testify against their
clients, to require Secret Service agents to testify against the
people they protect, or to make bookstores tell what books people
read."
</P>
<P>
"I and many others, believe that Mr. Starr has crossed the line
into obsession,"
</P>
<P>
While Clinton was on his visit in Japan, the White House issued
a statement saying, "There was virtually nothing new in the
proceeding today."

<P>
COLOMBO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Kelaniya
University was closed down temporarily following student clashes
on the eve of the Student Council Nominations Thursday, the Island
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas to stop the clashes between student
factions which left three undergraduates seriously injured, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Students occupying the hostels of the university in the eastern
suburb of Colombo were also asked to vacate the premises, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes had been triggered off following propaganda work
for the nominations in connection with the forthcoming annual
election of the Student's Council.
</P>
<P>
A faction putting up posters had been attacked by a rival
student group, sparking off the wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by the university authorities to restore order had
failed and a decision was then made to close the university "until
further notice."
</P>
<P>
At least eight students were injured, three of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Police stepped up security and intensified patrolling to
prevent a fresh bout of violence, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agriculture Posts Recovery in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture sector of the
Philippines, after being battered in the first half of this year,
posted a mild year-on-year recovery of 1.24 percent in the third
quarter, the Business Daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing government statistics, the daily said the farm sector
shrank 5.79 percent during the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The overall drop was due to the lingering effects of the EL
Nino weather phenomenon, the government said.
</P>
<P>
An Agriculture Department statement said that "despite the
lingering effects of EL Nino, the agriculture sector is starting
to recover."
</P>
<P>
Some economists believed that the economy would be able to
avoid a recession.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector accounts for more than one-fifth of the
country's output with about 35-40 percent of the population
relying on the sector.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Increase Bonuses for Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KONI chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar said he made the promise
following complaints the sports council had paid little attention
to coaches despite their key roles in improving national
athletes' performance.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Taekwondo coach Oh Il-nam on Thursday was the
latest to criticize Wismoyo over the council's apathy toward
trainers' mediocre economic status.
</P>
<P>
Oh said he did not worry about his earnings, thanks to his
1,400 U.S. dollars monthly salary given by the South Korean
government.
</P>
<P>
"I'm paid enough by my government. It's the local coaches I'm
thinking about. If coaches always have to think about how to meet
their families' basic needs, how can they concentrate on their
jobs and in turn improve their athletes' achievement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo, who toured the taekwondo training camp in South
Jakarta, ahead of the Asiad, admitted having paid little respect
to coaches.
</P>
<P>
"Without coaches, even a very talented athlete won't emerge as
a champion," he said.
</P>
<P>
To boost Indonesia's performance in the upcoming Asiad, a
coach will be offered a prize equal to 40 percent of the cash
bonus given to a medal-winning athlete, according to Wismoyo.
</P>
<P>
Athletes received 25 million rupiah (7,000 U.S. dollars at the
time) for each gold won at the 19th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games
here last year. Coaches only earned 5 million rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The council has announced that an Asian Games gold medal will
be worth 50 million rupiah (6,500 U.S. dollars at Thursday's
rate) for an athlete, a silver 30 million rupiah and a bronze 15
million rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has set its sights on winning six golds, 11 silvers
and 13 bronzes from the 21 sports it will compete in at the event.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo said he welcomed any sports organizations' moves to
provide bigger cash prizes for coaches.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about his target at the Asian Games, Oh Il-nam
predicted one of his six proteges would win a gold.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great chance in the men's and women's flyweight,
the men's bantamweight and middleweight," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oh said South Korea would not compete in the flyweight and
bantamweight classes of the nation's traditional martial art.

<HEADLINE> Asteroid Fossil Found Related to Dinosaur Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. researcher has
found the fossilized remnants of an asteroid that may have caused
the global extinction of dinosaurs and other species more than 65
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Frank Kyte, a geochemist from the University of California at
Los Angeles (UCLA), presented his analysis of the fossil meteorite
in the November 19 issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
He found the fossil meteorite while studying the sediment
boundary layer between the Cretaceous and Tertiary eras.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists believe the worldwide extinction of dinosaurs,
which ended the Cretaceous period, was caused by the destructive
impact of a comet or asteroid.
</P>
<P>
According to Kyte, it is likely that the fossil is part of the
remains of a colossal asteroid, some six miles wide, which
collided with the earth near Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
His findings suggest that the original meteorite had a rocky
composition that corresponds with the makeup of asteroids, as
opposed to the porous materials that would more likely be found in
a comet.
</P>
<P>
Hidden in mud and buried beneath the Pacific Ocean for 65
million years, Kyte said, the fossil is no longer composed of all
of its original minerals, yet has retained its original shape and
texture.
</P>
<P>
Although the fossil itself is only a tenth of an inch long,
Kyte was able to deduce its origins using instruments from the
UCLA's electron microprobe and neutron activation laboratories.
</P>
<P>
These instruments, which can identify the chemical components
of a given substance, found the fossil to be high in iridium, an
element found in relative abundance in asteroid meteorites.
</P>
<P>
In our solar system, asteroids are found orbiting the sun in a
belt between Mars and Jupiter. This rocky belt of space debris is
thought to be a leftover from the time when the planets first
formed.
</P>
<P>
Kyte notes that this particular asteroid moved out of the belt
towards the Earth at about 40,000 miles per hour. The resulting
impact is thought to have had devastating consequences for the
world's climate and could have led to the extinction of the
dinosaurs and many other forms of life.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the finding, the National Science Foundation of
the United States, which funds Kyte's research, said in a
statement that studies like Kyte's show celestial impacts have had
a profound effect on the history of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
"One begins to think that such catastrophic events played at
least as important a role in shaping the earth as did more gradual
process," the Foundation said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Accomplish Economic Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China will realize this year's 8-percent economic growth
target in spite of the negative effects of severe natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chuantang, deputy secretary of the CPC Committee of the
region and executive vice chairman of the regional government,
noted that Tibet has witnessed double-digit economic growth rates
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Tibet recorded 8.5 percent economic growth in the first half of
this year, with the October figure hitting 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region's economic growth is expected to remain above 10
percent for the remaining two months of this year, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the regional will achieve the
targeted economic growth rate as a result of increased spending on
fixed assets and investments in agriculture, industry and
animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The region has fulfilled the three billion yuan budgeted figure
for fixed asset investments. The central government and other
provinces have also funneled over 842 million yuan in fixed asset
investments into the region.
</P>
<P>
Tibet curbed the declining profits of local state-owned
enterprises by restructuring property and assets, and adjusting
the local industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Yang projected the region's industrial output value for the
year will grow by more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has enjoyed rising fiscal and tax revenues for the year,
with the figures hitting 257 million and 493 million yuan,
respectively, by the end of October, both accounting for more than
85 percent of the annual targets.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Announces Emergency Aid for Hurricane-Hit Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) will grant 65 million U.S. dollars in immediate aid to
Honduras, the worst victim of Hurricane Mitch, visiting IMF chief
Michel Camdessus said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The funds, to be disbursed "with no strings attached" in early
December, will be followed by more IMF assistance later, he said
after a meeting with Honduran President Carlos Flores.
</P>
<P>
This money is to be used to import medicine and other
necessities, said Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief noted that scrapping Honduras' foreign debt is
not as urgent as the country's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Honduras' foreign debt stands at
a total of 4.3 billion dollars, of which more than 60 percent is
multilateral, with 40 million dollars owed to the IMF, one billion
dollars to the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), and a lesser
amount to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said, "We must strive to reduce the debt as much as
possible, but you must do more than that: give the country all the
resources it needs for its reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch, the worst Atlantic storm in the last two
centuries, left some 6,600 dead and millions homeless as well as
damages amounting to three billion dollars during its one-week
rampage through Honduras in late October.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is scheduled to visit shelters for victims and parts
of the capital city devastated by the hurricane later in his tour
of Honduras. He also visited Nicaragua earlier this week, another
Central American country hit by Mitch.

PANAMA CITY, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Panama's agricultural

ranking trade official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Antunez, president of the Non-Traditional Agriculture

The Gantrap president, who recently took part with a group of
Panamanian entrepreneurs in the International Food Hall (Sial) in
Paris, said Europe would welcome this operation.
</P>
<P>

GUANGZHOU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Direct overseas investment
continues to increase in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, despite the negative effects of the financial
crisis affecting the countries of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, direct overseas investment in
Guangzhou was 2.49 billion U.S. dollars in the first 10 months
this year, up seven percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city's overseas investment in contractual
value also rose by 23.4 percent to 1.87 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even though investments from Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan continue to decline, more European and American
investors have shown enthusiasm for local infrastructure projects,
such as the city's new airport and the second line of the urban
subway system.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment continues flowing not only into industrial
sectors, but also into real estate and agriculture. It is believed
that Guangzhou has utilized more than 14 billion dollars in direct
overseas investment over the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> 135-Year-old Atlas Depicts Tibet, Taiwan Part of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A set of atlases printed 135
years ago has been discovered in northeast China's Liaoning
Province in which readers will find that Tibet and Taiwan were
already a part of China at that time.
</P>
<P>
The atlas was published in 1863 when Emperor Tong Zhi of
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) ruled the country. It contains
3,000 maps in its 26 volumes, including two world maps.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Shoufeng, this well-preserved atlas outlines
the territory of the Qing Dynasty in both text and pictures,
as well as neighboring Japan, Russia, Myanmar and Korea.
</P>
<P>
"These old maps again remind people that Tibet and Taiwan
are inalienable parts of China," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
The atlas was kept in a duke's palace in the region before 1949
when New China was founded. Archeologists believe it was a gift
from the central government of the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The atlas is now on display in the local archives bureau.

<TEXT>
<P>
A package of measures drawn up by the Home Office includes
proposals to prevent known hooligans from traveling abroad, even
if they have not been convicted in the courts.
</P>
<P>
The new action will make it an offense for a single fan to
chant racist abuse as well as allowing for more severe measures
to be taken against ticket touts.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, to be launched at Arsenal's Highbury ground
next Friday, were drawn up after the World Cup, during which
English fans were involved in confrontations with police and
other supporters.
</P>
<P>
Recently, calls for greater action against hooligans have been
led by the independent Football Task Force, chaired by former
Conservative minister David Mellor.
</P>
<P>
In February. the Home Secretary Jack Straw held a seminar on
football hooliganism at Blackburn Rovers ground.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the government intended to treat
troublemakers severely to safeguard the interests of genuine fans.
</P>
<P>
Since then there has been a review of all legislation
affecting football.

CHONGQING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China recently closed over
150 factories creating heavy pollution in the Three Gorges Water
Conservancy Project area.
</P>
<P>
The factories included paper mills, leather processing plants

<P>
SHENZHEN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Exports of high-tech products
from Shenzhen, China's first of the five special economic zones,
continue to grow rapidly due to increasing investment from major
overseas high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the city's export volume of high-tech
products has been increasing at an annual rate of 17.19 percent in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign high-tech companies, particularly some of the
multinations, have played a leading role in the growth of the
city's high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded ventures accounted for 64 of the 100 high-tech
enterprises approved by the city, and they generated two-thirds of
the city's export volume of high-tech products last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the 500 industrial companies listed by the
American magazine "Fortune," 15 have invested in Shenzhen's
high-tech industries, including IBM, Hitachi, Philips, Dupont, Sanyo,

LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) - European stocks rebounded with
gains of over 2 percent on Thursday, led higher by financials and
telecoms stocks, as Wall Street made a strong start.
</P>
<P>
After a slow start, London's FTSE 100 Index of top shares began
to gain momentum and closed up 132.2 at 5606.2, helped by
continued hopes that another cut in interest rates will come soon.
</P>
<P>
The minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee showed all the members supported this month's reduction
in the cost of borrowing, while further cuts later on were viewed
as necessary.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt Germany's blue-chip DAX index also ended higher on
the day after investors got the key 4,800 point level firmly in
their sights.
</P>
<P>
But traders said the index was likely to keep to a range
between 4,600 points and 4,800 points for the immediate future
with a breach of the psychological level at 5,000 points still
expected by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in Paris also closed higher as Societe General's
better-than-expected 9-month operating profit prompted buying
across the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index finished up 94.26 points at a high for the day
of 3,706.76. Among banking stocks, Societe Generale was up 35 at

<HEADLINE> Employment A Matter of Common Concern: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
economies are becoming so integrated that they can no longer
export employment problems to one another because employment is a
matter of Common concern, EU Commissioner Padraig Flynn said today
at the EU Committee of the Region meeting here in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The two key problems behind our poor employment performance in
recent decades have been: first, the lack of a growth oriented
cooperation of economic policies which could handle macro-economic
shocks effectivly; second, an inability to adapt and modernize our
labor markets to changed conditions, Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner, responsible for employment and social
affairs, pointed out two ways to solve the problems: use European
Monetary Union (EMU) to response to macro-economic problems and
use Employment Strategy to response to the structural problems.
</P>
<P>
Among four strategy pillars, Flynn emphasized the
entrepreneurship: this is based on a recognition that jobs are not
created by financial schemes from Brussels or the capital cities
of the Union.
</P>
<P>
"Jobs are primarily created by local action in a local context.
The entrepreneurship pillar contains guidelines intended to make
it easier to start and run businesses, to develop new jobs -
particularly in the services sector, where the gap in employment
is widest between the EU and our trading partners - and to tap the
full employment potential of the information society," Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 26th Session of the EU Committee of the Regions,
Flynn said the local economic development function which is
essential to the entrepreneurship process is a key responsibility
of local government in many EU member states.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Assess Implementation of 1995 Social Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly on Thursday decided to convene a special session "for an
overall review" of the implementation of the outcome of the 1995
World Summit for Social Development in Geneva on June 26-30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The decision was contained in a resolution, which was adopted
without a vote at the plenary session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the special session should
establish an open-ended working group to facilitate consultations
during its first substantive session to be held in New York on May
17-28, 1999. A second meeting is scheduled for April 3-4, 2000 in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The proposed special session is aimed at reaffirming the
Copenhagen Declaration and the Program of Action of the Summit at
the national, regional and international levels and recommending
concrete actions and initiatives to further efforts towards their
effective implementation, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly will urge the continued involvement and
support by the regional commissions in the promotion of the
Summit's objectives at the regional and subregional levels.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the General Assembly will call on all governments
and the United Nations system to promote an active and visible
policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective and to use gender
analysis as a tool for the integration of a gender dimension into
the planning and implementation of policies, strategies and
programs on social development.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly will call on the international community,
including international financial institutions, to implement fully
and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable
solution to the debt problems of developing countries, in
particular African countries and the least developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Anticipates Self-Sufficiency By 2,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the Tibet
Autonomous Region said recently that the region anticipates
attaining self-sufficient in terms of grain, edible oils and meat
by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Jyabao, vice chairman of the regional government, said
that Tibet's agriculture and animal husbandry recorded bumper
harvests for the year in spite of frequent natural disasters,
including heavy snow, floods and a locust infestation.
</P>
<P>
Eleven successive good harvests has greatly enhanced confidence
that the region will achieve its goal of providing a better life
to Tibetan people by the turn of the century, said Jyabao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tibetans consume approximately one million tons
of grain and 7,000 tons of meat per year. Local grain hit 792,000
tons in 1997, with meat output standing at 3,500 tons.
</P>
<P>
The region faces a tough task in actually realizing
self-sufficiency, said Jyabao, adding that the goal is nonetheless
with the central government's full support and intensified local
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to increase investments in agriculture and
promote the use of high-yield seeds and farm equipment over the
next two years.

UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The President of the
U.N. General Assembly on Thursday stressed the media's moral duty.
</P>

The president, Uruguay's Didier Opertti, made the remarks at

should be the main objective that will chart the course of future
media policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, to be ended on Friday, is themed "The
Future of Audiovisual Memory -- Looking at the 20th Century,
Towards the 21st Century".
</P>
<P>
It brought together media workers from around the world to
discuss the role of television in the social and cultural
progress, the legacy of audiovisual memory, the impact of
technology on the future of communication and projections and
proposals for the third millennium.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Misses 1st Wave of NATO Expansion: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- British Armed Forces Minister
Doug Henderson said on Thursday that Slovakia had definitely
missed the first wave of the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization(NATO), the Reuters News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that the Washington summit next year in April
will confirm the accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland to the North Atlantic alliance," Henderson told reporters
in the Slovak capital city of Bratislava, where he is on an
official visit.
</P>
<P>
The three top candidates for NATO expansion, Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland, are scheduled to join the defense alliance at
the Washington summit on April 23, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia was once a front runner for NATO membership along with
the top three but was later downgraded to the second group of
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
Henderson said NATO would want to assess the effects of the
first wave of expansion before growing further.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected Slovak government has made NATO and European
Union entry its top priority.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Starts Impeachment Hearings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Judiciary
Committee on Thursday began impeachment hearings against President
Bill Clinton. Special Counsel Kenneth Starr is presenting his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
Starr testified at the hearings that Clinton misused his
authority and used the powers of his office to block the Monica
Lewinsky investigation and the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
The hearing began with a Democratic member, William Delahunt of
Massachusetts, making a motion asking that White House lawyers get
two hours to question Starr, rather than the 30 minutes they're
being allowed. Hyde responded that the time allotments are fair.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting that motion, Hyde responded that the White House
could "go a long way" toward helping uncover the facts, if Clinton
would submit answers to the 81 questions submitted to him by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers, the ranking Democrat in the
Judiciary Committee called Starr "a federally paid sex policeman"
obsessed with bringing down President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Starr was the leadoff witness with nine television networks
carrying the hearing live. It promised to provide a highly
partisan start to proceedings aimed at deciding whether Clinton
should be removed from office by subsequent votes in the full
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
The White House sent Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall,
to interrogate Starr and make a case on the president's behalf.

ATHENS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A home-made bomb exploded later
Thursday at the Athens suburb office of the Communist Party of
Greece (KKE), causing damages to the office but no injures.
</P>
<P>
It is the second bomb explosion at the KKE offices this week.
On Tuesday night, anarchist groups placed a gas canister bomb at a
KKE office in the Athens suburb of Dafni.
</P>
<P>
Greek police attributed Thursday's bomb attack in the Athens
suburb of Zografou to the country's anarchists because those
people wanted to protest the arrest of some 149 youths during
Tuesday's march to mark the 25th anniversary of a students'
uprising at the Athens Polytechnic in 1973 against a military

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns of Environmental Crisis in Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Caspian Sea is under the
threat of an environmental crisis resulting from oil exploration
and sewage released by the littoral states, Iranian Vice President
Masoumeh Ebteka warned on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ebtekar, who is also head of Iran's Environmental Protection
Organization, told reporters in Semnan, the capital of Semnan
province, that unfortunately most of the companies active in oil
extraction from the Caspian Sea do not bear the interests of the
region in mind and are only seeking their own profits.
</P>
<P>
She underlined that oil drilling in the Caspian Sea must
be in accordance with the international environmental standards,
</P>
<P>
The Iranian first female vice president also urged the
northern Caspian republics not to pour their untreated urban and
industrial sewage into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of such practices will cause a major
environmental crisis in the world largest inland lake, she
warned.
</P>
<P>
Ebtekar said that Iran, within the framework of the Caspian
Sea environment protection plan, is responsible for pollution
control of the sea, adding that the required international
credit for the project is in the process of being approved.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that thousands of tons of various chemical
substances flow into the sea annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that competition among the littoral states
in oil exploitation will damage the ecosystem and finally destroy
the natural resources in the sea, particularly the sea's caviar,
which is well-known as "black pearl."
</P>
<P>
In May, the U.N. resident coordinator in Iran Michael
V.D. Schulenburg announced that the U.N. Development Program, the
European Union and the World Bank have decided to form a Caspian
Sea environment protection fund to carry out environmental
protection projects in the sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece decided on Thursday to
take necessary measures in coming days to deal with thousands of
children beggars at major road junctions throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a joint meeting which was attended by
Greek Public Order Minister Phillipos Petsalnikos, Health and
Welfare Undersecretary Theodoros Kotsonis and officials from the
foreign and justice ministries.
</P>
<P>
Kotsonis said that the operation, which also aims at breaking
up the organized gangs exploiting the children, would involve
rounding up the children and sending them home or placing them in
state care if they had no families or had been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
If there was no family or the family refused to accept the
child, the state would undertake its care, he said, adding that
they would go to school and later either continue their studies or
learn a trade.
</P>
<P>
Greek police estimate that some 3,000 children now beg at
traffic lights and road junctions daily around the country. Of
them, 78 percent are from neighboring Albania, 12 percent from
other Balkan countries and 10 percent are Gypsies.

<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Thursday called on the government, business, labor and
civil society to work as one in finding solutions to the current
economic problems by discarding mistrust.
</P>
<P>
Opening a meeting of the National Economic Consultative Forum
(NECF) here in Harare, Mugabe said all stakeholders in the
economy should endeavor to unite with the prospect of a "win-win"
outcome for all.
</P>
<P>
"Mistrust and constant bickering among ourselves will not
yield anything but chaos and ruin to our economy," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe noted that the NECF had evolved from a platform for
exchange of ideas between stakeholders in the economy into a
framework for policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
The forum had for the first time enabled the government to get
expertise in various fields, giving a new dimension to policy

But the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions boycotted the

ADDIS ABABA, November 19 (Xinhua)-- Burundian President Pierre
Buyoya has appealed to Ethiopia to contribute its share for the
lifting of sanctions imposed on his country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the call was contained
in a message by Buyoya sent to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the message focused on the economic sanctions
imposed by countries in eastern and central Africa on Burundi in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the message as saying that the sanctions
have had severe social and economic repercussions on the people
of Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Rift Between Zimbabwe's Employers, Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean business community
said Thursday it is seriously considering taking disciplinary
action against workers who continue to heed calls by the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) to stay away from work.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU has called for mass stay-away every Wednesday to
protest against the recent 68 percent increase in fuel prices and
a general escalation in the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC),
the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) and the Employers
Confederation of Zimbabwe said due to the magnitude of loss of
production being experienced as a result of the mass job
stay-aways, businesses would be forced to take action against
absconding workers.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders made the remarks at a joint press
briefing held at the on-going two-day meeting of the National
Economic Consultative Forum, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
ZNCC President Nhlanhla Masuku said the workers should bear in
mind that Zimbabwe had a high unemployment rate and that their
action could result in the loss of more jobs.
</P>
<P>
CZI President Kumbirai Katsande said the stay-aways should not
be left to degenerate into a "culture of a midweek holiday".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nathan Shamuyarira, acting Minister of the Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare, said the government would
support employers for whatever appropriate action they take
against workers who stay away from work and hinted that it would
also take action against civil servants.
</P>
<P>
"Workers have a contract with their employers and if an
employer does not fulfill the contract, the worker has a right to
take action. If employees do not fulfill their contract,
employers can take action," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As for the government, we are going to be very tough with the
civil servants," he added.

<HEADLINE> 1.5 Million Tanzanians Infected with HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.5 million
Tanzanians had been been infected with HIV by the end of l997,
Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health Gabriel
Upunda said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read on his behalf by Dr. Peter Kilima at the
Partnership/Consultation luncheon held in Dar es Salaam, Upunda
said some 30 million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide,
21 million of whom in areas south of Africa's Sahara Desert.
</P>
<P>
The speech, read before government officials, United Nations
representatives and journalists, said the epidemic is not merely
a health issue but has become one related to economy, society,
culture and politics since the deadly disease has produced major
impacts on health services, productivity and national income in
general.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to increase awareness of HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, and expand partnership, consultations and
dialogs in this field.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Prime Minister's Office said that since
the cases of AIDS were reported in the Kagera Region in the
northwest, it has caused immense sufferings to individuals,
families and the nation at large.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, a country with a population of 30 million, AIDS
is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and therefore has
the greatest impact on young people who are the most productive
age group, the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan has agreed to extend
about 70 million Shillings (70,000 U.S. Dollars) in a grant to
help construct primary school facilities in Uganda's Mukono
district, some 30 km east of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The grant contract was signed in the district Thursday between
Sam Kisense, chief administrative officer of the district and
Yonez Otake, charge d'affairs of Japanese Embassy to Uganda, the
Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for the construction of classrooms,
teachers' houses and toilets for Seeta Umea and Lweza primary
schools.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan official thanked the Japanese government for the
grant and promised that the money will be effectively utilized.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese diplomat said education plays an important role
in eradicating poverty and hoped that more people can benefit
from the grant.
</P>
<P>
Before the introduction of universal primary education in
1997, the district had about 160,000 children in primary schools.
Now, the number has risen to about 370,000.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's universal primary education program provides free
primary education for four children in each household. The

<HEADLINE> Primakov Clarifies Economic Priority for Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni
Primakov said Thursday that social orientation of a market economy
and development of the real sector of the economy are two priority
for the Russian government to work.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said this at a meeting of the council of the
inter-regional "Far East and Trans-Baikal Area" Association for
economic cooperation held in Khabarovsk, far-eastern city of
Russia, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted "If we are to speak about the social edge of
the economy, it is necessary, above all, to pay wages to public
sector workers, to pay pensions and monetary allowance to
servicemen."
</P>
<P>
Primakov assured that the government "will strictly follow"
shouldered obligations to pay current wages to public sector
workers, pension and money allowances to servicemen.
</P>
<P>
In this connection he said "We cannot start uncontrolled
emission, since all funds, paid in the form of transfers or wages,
will actually lose their value.
</P>
<P>
He also said the state regulation of the economy would be
tightened. "We have 12,000 state enterprises, 5,000 joint stock
companies in Russia in which the state participates. The state has
controlling interest in 2,500 joint stock companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the premier continued, the budget receives only 900
million rubles a year as dividends from all those enterprises.
This is a real pillage of the state.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of privatization Primakov said that
"Privatization in the country was conducted, as a rule, for fiscal
considerations" up to this time.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he called "the form of bankruptcy which is in
use now" as "utterly unacceptable" for the development of the real
sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stated that he "will carry out to the end the
investigation into illegal privatization."
</P>
<P>
The Russian premier made a stop-over in Khabarovsk en route to
Moscow from Malaysia, where he attended the Asian-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) summit.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Not to Attend Peace Conference on Wye Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Thursday rejected a
United States invitation to attend a multinational peace
conference in support of the Wye accord singed by the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. invitation comes when there is no consensus among
Arab countries for the Wye agreement and while Lebanon's south
and the west Bekaa Valley and Syria's Golan Heights are still
under Israel's occupation," Lebanese Information Minister Bassem
Al-Sabaa told reporters after a regular cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon would not attend such a meeting and not give
any support for the deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is inviting countries concerned in the
Middle East peace process to gather in Washington for a
multinational peace conference aimed at expressing support for
the Wye Plantation peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-brokered deal signed last month, Israel is to
withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in return for
Palestinian Authority's crackdown on "terrorism".
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz told the
U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon David Satterfield that Lebanon would
not participate in any multinational peace talks unless progress
was achieved on the Lebanese-Syrian-Israeli peace track.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Israel and Syria, Lebanon suspended in
June, 1996 when the hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon demand the talks be resumed from
where they left off while Israel insists everything start from
the beginning.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Celebrate Upcoming Israeli Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Palestinians
marched on the streets of the northern West Bank town of Jenin
Thursday to celebrate the upcoming Israeli transfer of parts of
the surrounding areas to the Palestinians, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel will yield 2 percent of the West Bank under its full
control to joint jurisdiction with the Palestinians Friday after
its cabinet gave the final go-ahead Thursday to the first stage of
the further Israeli redeployment agreed upon between the two sides
in the recent land-for-peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The 2 percent of the West Bank will be areas surrounding
Jenin, the northernmost Palestinian-run city in the West
Bank. After the planned withdrawal, Palestinians in this area will
be able to travel to another Palestinian-ruled city of Nablus
without passing through areas under full Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said Israeli and Palestinian officers met
Thursday afternoon to coordinate the coming redeployment. Israeli
officers showed the withdrawal map to their Palestinian
counterparts before they toured the areas together.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted by the
radio as saying that the Palestinian National Authority will
convene Friday morning to discuss how to develop the areas and
bring benefits to the residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reports said a Palestinian survey showed that
the approval rating for the peace process among the Palestinians
have reached the highest point of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of the Palestinians now say that they
support the peace process with Israel, compared to 66 percent in
October, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers living in the two settlements near Jenin,
which will be isolated in Palestinian-controlled areas after the
withdrawal, expressed mixed feelings about the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Some were worrying about their security in the future, but
others said there should be no fear since their relations with
their Palestinian neighbors have been "good."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh announced the timetable
of the withdrawal after the cabinet decided to move ahead on the
first stage of the three-phased further redeployment, during
which Israel will hand over a total of 13 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians, following hours of debate.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 2 percent redeployment, Israeli troops will
also turn 7 percent of the West Bank currently under joint
jurisdiction into fully Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also expected to allow the Palestinians to operate an
international airport in Gaza Friday and free one-third of 750
Palestinian prisoners due to be released according to the peace
agreement signed last month in Washington, in the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are still disputing over the list of the 250
prisoners due to be released in the first stage. Reports said that
according to the list offered by Israel, 150 of the 250 prisoners
were common criminals, rather than political prisoners, or
security prisoners as called by Israel, as required by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said he had contacted U.S. and Israeli officials over
this issue. He called on Israel to examine the matter carefully,
saying the two sides agreed in the peace deal that the 750
Palestinians to be released should be political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved the first stage of troop
withdrawal by a slim majority. Seven voted in favor, 5 against
and three abstentions. Two other ministers were said to be out of
the country Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The majority was even narrower than last week when the cabinet
managed to approve the Wye peace accord by eight against four,
with five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, who took part in
the negotiations for the peace deal and voted for it last week,
voted abstention Thursday. The reason was unknown yet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting came after the Palestinians presented a
report on their compliance of their commitments undertaken in the
accord. Senior Israeli officials said before the voting that the
Palestinians have met all their obligations during the first
stage.
</P>
<P>
These included the issuing of a decree banning illegal
weapons, the confirmation by the Palestine Liberation Organization
Executive Committee of the cancellation of the anti-Israel
provisions in the Palestinian charter, and the arrest of
one-third of the 30 Palestinian suspects wanted by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat issued a decree to ban
anti-Israel incitement Thursday, removing the last possible
obstacle to the approval of the redeployment by the Israeli
cabinet.

CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Thursday welcomed Israel's
decision to start troop pullback from the West Bank under a new
peace accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
termed the Israeli decision as "definitely positive."
</P>
<P>
Moussa, meanwhile, cautioned that "no strings would be attached
to" the troop withdrawal, which he hoped "would be followed
through in all good faith."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet Thursday approved the implementation of the
first stage of the peace agreement signed with the Palestinians
last month in Washington. Israeli troops are expected to pull back
from the northern areas of the West Bank by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa voiced the hope that the "improved atmosphere" brought
about by the progress would promote the resumption of the peace
talks between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks came to a halt in early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the Golan Heights captured by Israel
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges Development of Non-Traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
Thursday called for the further development of Zambia's
non-traditional sector in view of the fact that its traditional
copper industry has become what he called "a curse."
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day national convention on revitalizing the
Zambian economy here, Chiluba said, "our survival lies in the
non-traditional sector -- agriculture in particular has the
highest potential to support both primary and secondary
industries."
</P>
<P>
"How can we as a nation be proud when we cannot even feed
ourselves and perpetually continue importing food and relying on
international food aid when we have all that it takes for to feed
the entire region? " he asked.
</P>
<P>
He urged his countrymen to produce first and foremost their
own food and beyond that for export.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was the largest producer of tobacco and groundnuts in
the continent in 1964 when the country gained its independence,
but it progressively lost the position, said Chiluba who called
for the improvement of marketing system to ensure that Zambian
farmers in all corners of the country have access to markets.
</P>
<P>
He pledged his government's total commitment to the policy of
liberalization as a means of achieving economic balance through
an effective market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the president called to tap his country's
forestry potential, saying that Zambia is well endowed with
abundant forest resources, particularly timber, which he believes
has great potential to contribute to Zambia's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Currently the contribution of the forest sector to total gross
domestic products stands at a meager one percent as compared to
agriculture which contributes to over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Forests and woodlands cover about 80 percent of the country's
territory and contains some three billion tons of wood with an
annual increment of 30 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the export of raw timber has not contributed to
the economy any meaningful way as it should, mainly because the
prices fetched are too low in comparison with the prices of
processed wood products.
</P>
<P>
Therefore he called for exporting value-added products, saying
manufactured furniture for instance can fetch more than eight
times the price at which raw timber is sold.
</P>
<P>
There are more socio-economic benefits such as more employment
creation, larger small business participation in the industry,
more capital formation in the economy through increased
investment in wood forestry machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also said Zambia is endowed with a tremendous range of
high value gemstones, which, if properly managed, can contribute
substantially to national income, even surpassing copper incomes.
</P>
<P>
But he said Zambia does not have sufficient capacity to
process the gemstones for value-addition.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Ten military men of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) were
killed in a fierce fighting in central Angola's Bie Province
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Cavita, Deputy governor of the province, said
Thursday in Kuito, capital of the province that the fighting
happened in Chitembo, about 150 km southeastern of Kuito, when
UNITA military men, who were trying to seize the city, were
pushed back by the government's national police forces.
</P>
<P>
Cavita said that situation is "delicate" in Chitembo, where
UNITA has massed about 4,500 men equipped with long-range
artillery. They are very active near Chitebo and Cuemba City to
its east.
</P>
<P>
The official accused UNITA forces of killing 300 farmers
including dozens of chiefs, kidnaping 2,485 and setting afire to
88 villages in the province, thus displacing about 30,000
villagers.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that fierce fightings also erupted in
neighboring Huambo Province this week, with UNITA capturing some
strategic places and cutting off the connection between Huambo's
capital city with other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners here disclosed that this happened when the
government forces are mounting attacks on UNITA-controlled areas,
and have surrounded its political and military capital of Andulo
and Bailundo in central Angola.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fears of Fresh Disputes Haunt Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Fears that disputes may erupt
agian between Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) are
still haunting many in Baghdad despite the withering down of the
latest crisis after Iraq resumed cooperation with the arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The routine monitoring activities by arms inspectors on
Wednesday and Thursday proceeded smoothly, but observers here
said the real test of Iraq's offer of unconditional resumption of
cooperation will come when intrusive on-the-spot inspections to
new suspected Iraqi sites are carried out.
</P>
<P>
The inspection work in the coming days is "crucial and
sensitive," and "any misconduct from both sides would likely
trigger serious consequences, " diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid "unnecessary troubles," UNSCOM has reaffirmed its
disciplines to the inspectors, instructing them to strictly obey
the relevant regulations.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Karim, a political science professor in Baghdad
University, said U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler, instigated
by Washington, might create another crisis to provide the United
States with pretext for a military attack.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Butler wrote to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, asking Baghdad to hand out its chemical and biological
documents.
</P>
<P>
So long as the United States continues to adopt a hostile
policy toward Iraq, the latest crisis would not be the last one,
said a local political observer.
</P>
<P>
Many Iraqis expressed discontent with Butler's tough and
provocative stand.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM and Butler should work for the United Nations, not for
the United States," said a book vendor.
</P>
<P>
Most Iraqis were pessimistic about the lifting of sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in August
1990.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people want peace and no more trouble, " Karim
said.

<P>
Botswana is taking advice from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) into account in dealing with
the situation, Sesinyi said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the UNHCR had made proposals, but did not
give any details. He denied reports that Botswana has agreed to
extradite the separatists.
</P>
<P>
"We have not agreed to that. We are still looking into the
matter of determining the status of the Namibians.
</P>
<P>
"The laws of the two countries will apply to those who are
found to have committed criminal offenses," Sesinyi added.
</P>
<P>
There is no specific extradition treaty between Namibia and
Botswana, but a Commonwealth agreement makes provision for the
return of criminals between member states.
</P>
<P>
Both Namibia and Botswana are member states of the British
Commonwealth and signatories to the U.N. convention on refugees
and asylum seekers.

<HEADLINE> Starr Makes His Case at Impeachment Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr Thursday laid out the evidence against U.S. President Bill
Clinton that triggered the third presidential impeachment inquiry
in U.S. history, while Democrats said Starr had "crossed the line
into obsession."
</P>
<P>
Clinton engaged in a "scheme to conceal" his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Starr alleged. The
president was at the heart of a "pattern of obstruction" that was
inconsistent with his duty, he said.
</P>
<P>
"He testified that he could not recall being alone with Ms.
Lewinsky. That was untrue," Starr said of the president. "He
testified that he could not recall ever being in the Oval Office
hallway with Ms. Lewinsky, except perhaps when she was delivering
pizza. That was untrue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several of the president's lawyers, including private attorney
David Kendall and White House counsel Charles Ruff, were also
present in the committee room, awaiting their turn to question
Starr.
</P>
<P>
Starr's testimony was the first the committee had taken since
receiving boxes of his evidence this fall. While the full
Republican-controlled House has voted for an open-ended inquiry,
Republican appetite for prolonged proceedings has diminished
markedly in the wake of setbacks in mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
Before Starr began his two-hour statement, Democrats sought to
expand the 30 minutes that Clinton's lawyers were allotted to
question him.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the
committee, said, "It is not acceptable to force mothers to testify
against their daughters, to make lawyers testify against their
clients, to require Secret Service agents to testify against the
people they protect, or to make bookstores tell what books people
read."
</P>
<P>
"I and many others believe that Mr. Starr has crossed the line
into obsession,"
</P>
<P>
Starr told lawmakers that his investigations into the gathering
of FBI files on Republicans by the Clinton White House and the
firing of White House travel office workers resulted in no
evidence of impeachable offenses by the president.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, he sought to blunt the criticisms
leveled against the sexually explicit nature of some of his
evidence. It was the House, he noted, that voted overwhelmingly to
make much of it public.
</P>
<P>
"The propriety of a relationship is not the concern of our
office," he said, but the case is fundamentally about "obstruction
of justice, lying under oath, tampering with witnesses and misuse
of power."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Swazi King Mswati III
appointed a new cabinet Thursday, retaining six of the old guard
and bringing in nine newcomers, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini was re-appointed last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Khoza retained his portfolio in
the 15-member cabinet, as did Foreign and Trade Minister Albert
Shabangu and justice and constitutional affairs minister, Maweni
Simelane.
</P>
<P>
Former housing minister John Carmichael became finance
minister, and former natural resources minister Prince Sobandla
swapped portfolio with his brother Prince Guduza, the home
affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
The number of women with portfolios doubled to two.
Re-appointed Health Minister Phetsile Dlamini was joined by
newcomer Stella Lukhele, a school teacher and business woman.
</P>
<P>
One of the most challenging portfolios, that of employment and
enterprise, was given to newcomer Luthfo Dlamini, who is involved
in non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
His first job will be to pass through parliament the
long-awaited Industrial Relations Bill, aimed at ending years of
feuding between unions and the government.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the bill will allow the government to forge
ahead with its ambitious economic, social and political reform
programs without stay-aways and strikes.
</P>
<P>
The king regards the improvement of labor relations and
industrial harmony as essential to attracting foreign and local
investors, and for the success of his constitutional review which
aims to draft a new democratic constitution by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet was formed after general elections last month.
The mountain kingdom is under absolute rule of the king and
political parties are banned.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The rebels fighting to
overthrow embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila, have
claimed the capture of Bumba in Equator Province.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by rebel-controlled Radio Goma, Bumba
fell in rebel hands Wednesday, after a short battle, a Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) story reaching here Thursday, said.
</P>
<P>
The radio further indicated that the towns of Lisala and
Mbandaka are the next rebel targets.
</P>
<P>
"Plans to seize them have been completed," the radio said. It
accused Sudan of having sent troops to Mbandaka to support
Kabila's forces in defending the town.
</P>
<P>
The radio recalled that in the town of Bumba, fighting had
raged between Congolese rebels and Kabila's troops on November 6,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 Chadians were said to have been killed in the
fighting and many others captured, the radio claimed.
</P>
<P>
There has been no independent confirmation of the new military
gain. However, in recent weeks, the rebels have increased the
pressure on Kabila's loyalist troops and their allies, the
Zimbabweans, the Namibians, and the Angolans in both southeastern
Katanga and in the north, the RNA report said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Admits Two Mossad Agents Arrested in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in
Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents,
Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the admission during his meeting with Cypriot
Ambassador to Israel Euripedes Evriviades on Wednesday, CNA
quoted well-informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said that the two were not acting against
Cyprus or on behalf of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said he was sorry that his words to the press
last week were misunderstood in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last week, local media slammed Netanyahu's statement that he
would bring back the two Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary, were arrested here
on November 7 after police raided their apartment and found
hi-tech equipment tuned into the police radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
They were allegedly operating in a sensitive military area at
a time of increased military activities in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Larnaca District Court issued a remand order to the two
suspects on November 7 for eight-day pending investigations. The
two Israelis will appear again before the court Friday morning
after they were remanded for another five days.
</P>
<P>
CNA Thursday also quoted Moshe Fogel, director of the Israeli
government press office, as saying that "the prime minister said
he would try to resolve the problem."
</P>
<P>
There is ongoing contacts between the two countries, said the
director, refusing to comment any further on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Duma to Put Forth New Law on START-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on
Thursday considered a new draft law on the ratification of the
START-2 treaty, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The new draft law on START-2 was proposed by the chairmen of
the Duma's Defense Committee Roman Popkovich and Committee for
International Affairs Vladimir Lukin.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov said the new draft
stipulates several conditions which would ensure Russia's national
security. The draft would "guarantee financing maintenance of the
nuclear arms remaining after the START-2 treaty is implemented",
he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law says that if the United States unilaterally
withdraws from the ABM Treaty or violates the ABM Treaty or
related agreements, Russia will have the right to unilaterally
withdraw from START-2.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it says, if the United States or any other country,
including NATO member-states, takes military decisions posing a
threat to Russia's national interests, Russia will have the right
to withdraw from STAR-2.
</P>
<P>
Among such threats is "placing nuclear or high-precision
weapons in states which join NATO after the signing of the START-2
treaty", said the document.
</P>
<P>
According to Seleznyov, the Foreign Ministry and the Cabinet
leadership have expressed support for the Duma draft. Duma will
submit it to President Boris Yeltsin and ask him to introduce this
draft for ratification, he said.
</P>
<P>
If this document is approved, it will be submitted to the
committees for defense, international affairs, security and
geopolitics for further discussion.

JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Thursday
shrugged off an allegation by the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) that it would not attend peace talks in Botswana
Friday, because it was not consulted by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The allegation by the DRC government is unfortunate, because
there was never an expectation that they would attend, and South
Africa was not directly involved in convening the meeting," South
African Press Association quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco
Boni as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It takes place under the chairmanship of Zambia and is being
facilitated by the SADC (Southern African Development
Community)."
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Gaborone, Botswana, was convened as a follow-up
to the Lusaka meeting on October 23. It will be attended by the
United Nations and SADC members including South Africa, Zambia,
Mozambique and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Boni said the Gaborone meeting was a continuation of a process
to engage the rebels, and to convince them to accept a blueprint
for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was called specifically to engage the rebels
because it is the first time that the committee (of regional
mediators) was able to present the cease-fire blueprint which was
put together in Addis Ababa," Boni said.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo left for Gaborone
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Organizing in S. Africa: Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of the Sri
Lankan rebel movement Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
have organized themselves in at least two formal groups in South
Africa, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Pretoria that one of these groups, the
Tamil Rehabilitation Organization based in Durban, was raising
funds for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"There are organizations here. At least two organizations...
which are hardened sympathizers and supporters of the LTTE,"
Kadirgamar said.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly of the view that money is being collected under
the guise of being used for social or humanitarian purposes, but
they are funneled to the LTTE and they become a part of the
LTTE's war chest."
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said the main purpose of his visit was to discuss
with South African government officials his country's fears
regarding LTTE activities on South African soil.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he had met his counterpart, Alfred Nzo, Water
Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, who is also responsible for arms
sales control, and several other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said he had been heartened by the South Africans'
response.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the South African government
would not allow the LTTE to get a foothold in the country, adding
that the organization's activities posed a considerable threat to
South African society.
</P>
<P>
He described the LTTE as the deadliest terrorist organization
in the world, saying his government had reliable information that
it may be trying to shift its headquarters to South Africa after
the United Kingdom recently adopted strict anti-terrorism
legislation.
</P>
<P>
"There is also information that South African soil is being
used by the LTTE to support its terrorist activities in Sri
Lanka, including the possible use of South African ports for arms
smuggling."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Nzo announced that South Africa would probe
claims that the LTTE had ties with South African government
officials.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government was considering legislation
preventing terrorist organizations from setting up bases in the
country, and stressed that South African President Nelson Mandela
had made it clear that the LTTE would not be allowed to operate
from South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Fragment of Asteroid Killing Dinosaurs Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A geochemist from the
University of California at Los Angeles said that he had found the
fossilized remnants of the asteroid that may have caused the
global extinction of dinosaurs and other species more than 65
million years ago, The New York Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frank Kyte said that the fragment contains high
concentrations of iridium, a rare metal, as well as iron, nickel
and chromium at levels peculiar to extraterrestrial objects.
</P>
<P>
The coarse-grained fleck was pulled from the floor of the
Pacific Ocean in a thin layer of the planet's crust that marks the
transition from the Cretaceous epoch to the beginning of the
Tertiary epoch 65 million to 66 million years ago. This zone is
called the K/T boundary. This layer is believed to have been formed
from the debris that settled back to Earth after being blown into
the atmosphere by the asteroid.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kyte has used an electron microscope and other
high-resolution equipment to examine the fragment's molecular
structure. He said that this is the first object recovered from
the K/T boundary that is unarguably meteoric.
</P>
<P>
Other scientists said the geochemical analysis shows that the
rock chip probably did originate from space. But whether it was
shed from the asteroid that doomed the dinosaurs remains open to
debate.
</P>
<P>
Kyte's analysis provide a support to the theory proposed in
1980 by geologist Walter Alvares of the University of California
at Berkeley that the dinosaurs vanished because of a collision
with a huge asteroid or comet.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Security Council
on Thursday adopted a resolution, asking African countries to make
varying efforts to curb the illicit arms flows, in particular the
illegal trafficking of small arms.
</P>
<P>
The resolution expressed "grave concern at the destabilizing
effect of illicit arms flows, in particular of small arms, to and
in Africa and at their excessive accumulation and circulation."
</P>
<P>
It said such a flow "threaten national, regional and
international security and have serious consequences for
development and for the humanitarian situation in the continent."
</P>
<P>
The resolution stressed "the importance of all Member States,
and in particular States involved in manufacturing or marketing of
weapons, restricting arms transfers which could provoke or prolong
armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in
Africa, such as through voluntary moratoria."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution encouraged African states to
participate in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms,
and the establishmen of appropriate reached by African states
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The resolution encouraged the U.N. Secretary-General, in
consultation with Member States, to explore means for collection,
sharing and dissemination of information, including technical
information, on illicit small arms flows and their destabilizing
effects, in order to improve the international community's ability
to prevent the exacerbation of armed conflicts and humanitarian
crisis, as well as means for the rapid exchange of data on
possible violations of arms embargoes.
</P>
<P>
It is held that the illegal trafficking of small arms into
conflict areas in Africa has flared up the internal fighting, and
had highly negative impact on peace and development in the areas.

The three parties jointly accused the minority coalition
government of corruption and having relations with gangs and mafia

</P>
<P>
The three parties also accused Yilmaz of interfering in the
privatization plan of the Turkish Trade Bank and helped a

The crisis emerged after businessman Korkmaz Yigit claimed that
Yilmaz rigged the bidding process of the bank. CHP leader Deniz
Baykal said the case should be taken up by courts and Yilmaz must
resign.

Yilmaz denied any wrongdoings and stated that he will not
resign.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Yilmaz's coalition government could
collapse if the CHP, which supports the government from outside,
withdraws its support for the coalition.

<P>
DAMASCUS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Ten Palestinian factions
expressed their opposition to the revocation of anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter at a meeting held here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the political factions and other national
forces based in Syria, Jordan and the occupied Palestinian
territories attended the meeting, called by leader of the
Palestine National Salvation Front Khaled al-Fahoum.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fahoum told reporters after the meeting that participants
reviewed development of the national cause of the Palestinian
people from the signing of the Oslo accords in 1993 to the
just-reached Wye Plantation deal.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian Wye Plantation deal reached in
Washington stipulated further Israeli troops withdrawal from the
West Bank in exchange of Palestinians' tougher crackdown on Muslim
militants and the consideration to abrogate anti-Israeli clauses
in the national charter.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting, the factions also agreed to setting up a
preparatory committee involving all the Palestinian national
forces as a prelude to holding an expanded national congress. And
the committee will be headed by Khaled al-Fahoum.
</P>
<P>
The congress will meet on December 12 to 13, on the eve of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine National Salvation Front includes the Palestinian
groups outside the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and
opposes to any accommodation with Israel.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservative Party Blocks Euro Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government was
abandoning plans on Thursday to put the European Election Bill in
place after Conservative Party leader William Hague refused to
help the government force the legislation through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair accused the Conservative Party of
blocking the bill, saying "The Conservatives have obstructed this
all the way through in the House of Lords through use of the
Conservative majority in the Lords with hereditary peers.
</P>
<P>
"If the Conservatives carry on using their permanent majority
in the House of Lords as a result of hereditary peers to obstruct
the legislation, then obviously we will have to have the existing
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the House of Lords voted, for the fifth
time, to reject the government's preferred "closed list" system of
PR, under which electors vote for a party rather than an
individual candidate.
</P>
<P>
Instead, peers backed the Conservatives' preferred "open list"
system under which electors vote for a named candidate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC News, Hague said his party will not cooperate
with the government to change the voting system. He insisted
Labor's proposals were undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I do not believe it is the duty of the opposition to
help the government make bad law."
</P>
<P>
The Bill has exposed deep divisions between the two houses - as
well as between rival parties.

UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday adopted a resolution, calling on African
countries to "further develop institutions and procedures to
implement the provisions of international law relating to the
status and treatment of refugees" on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called upon African nations to implement

their country of origin, and the separation of refugees from other
persons who do not qualify for international protection."
</P>

The resolution also urged African states to seek appropriate
international assistance in this regard.

The 15-member Security Council asked the U.N. secretary-general
and member states concerned "to enhance Africa's peacekeeping
capacity to continue to ensure that training gives due emphasis to
international refugees, human rights and humanitarian law and in
particular to the security of refugees and the maintenance of the
civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and
settlements," the resolution added.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli cabinet gave its final go-ahead Thursday

three phases of further redeployment, in which Israel will hand
over a total of 13 percent of the areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said the withdrawal would begin as early as
Thursday night. Besides turning the 2 percent into shared control,
Israel will turn over 7 percent of the West Bank now under joint

<HEADLINE> London's Brent Crude Oil Closes Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) - World oil markets closed
slightly lower on Thursday, after a slump on Wednesday took prices
to 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark Brent crude closed at 11.54 U.S. dollars a
barrel, down one cent, after touching 11.15 dollars on Wednesday,
the lowest price for oil since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, U.S. light crude for December delivery closed
down 14 cents at 12.00 dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The latest slide is considered to reflect expectations that the
Oganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will not
engineer any further supply cuts to rebalance an oil market glut
at its ministerial meeting scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
"These historically low price levels will serve as grim
evidence of oversupply to OPEC ministers meeting next week in
Vienna," Lynton Jones, the chief executive of London's
International Petroleum Exchange, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some OPEC watchers, however, still see a possibility that the
cartel might pull off a surprise.
</P>
<P>
Robert Mabro of the Oxford Energy Institute warned against
ruling out entirely the possibility of further cutbacks in output.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that there will be no further cuts is not absolute,"
he said. "There will either be an agreement on further cuts or an
agreement to comply better."
</P>
<P>
Most likely OPEC will batten down the hatches in the hope of a
harsh northern hemisphere winter to bolster demand and then look
at possible further supply cuts next year, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
According to OPEC's Vienna secretariat, stocks on the 75
million barrels daily market grew by more than two million bpd in
the first nine months of this year after a 1.1 million bpd
stock build in 1997.

WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of 39 donor
nations have agreed on new funding for the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank affiliate and one of
the main sources of development financing for the world's poorest
nations.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank announcement here Thursday, the
donors meeting, held in Copenhagen of Denmark Thursday, endorsed a
replenishment which will allow the IDA to provide concessional
lending of 20.5 billion U.S. dollars (or 15.3 Special Drawing
Rights) to poor countries between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
New contribution from donor countries to this package will
total some 11.6 billion dollars (SDR 8.7 billion), with the rest
coming mainly from repayments of earlier IDA credits and
contributions from the World Bank itself.
</P>
<P>
The IDA deputies agreed that all IDA activities should revolve
around the objective of poverty reduction as a key element of
support for the borrowing countries' own efforts.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Analytic Applications Software to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide analytic
applications software revenues will pass 2 billion U.S. dollars by
2000, according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. market analysis firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
said in the report that the burgeoning analytic applications
market broke the 1-billion-dollar mark in 1997 and is poised to
reach 3.6 billion dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
This is a market of solutions that automate activities for
planning, forecasting, and predictive modeling such as budgeting
or factory planning, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
IDC defines the term "analytic applications" as packaged
software that meets three distinct conditions:
</P>
<P>
-- Process support -- packaged application software that
structures and automates a group of tasks pertaining to the review
and optimization of business operations or the discovery and
development of new business;
</P>
<P>
-- Functional separation -- the application functions
independently of an organization's core transactional applications,
yet can be dependent on such applications for data and may send
results back to these applications; and
</P>
<P>
-- Time-oriented, integrated data -- the application extracts,
transforms and integrates data from multiple sources, supporting a
time-based dimension for analysis of past and future trends.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that accounting-related analytic applications
represents half the market today. But customer relationship
management analytics will be the fatest growing segment overall,
garnering a 20 percent share of the entire market by 2002.

inspectors.

Butler called on Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on
Wednesday "break the habit of a lifetime and tell us the truth.
And we'll verify that as quickly as we can."

Hamdoon said "I do not think that this talk is really
constructive. He is talking about the past. I do not think he
should because we are looking forward, trying to establish some
better sphere of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said if Butler was discussing the current situation,
there were no reasons for complaints because his teams had just
resumed inspection work on Wednesday.

"So there is no reason for him to elaborate on the current
