HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Two Hong Kong Police
officers appeared at court today under the charge of conspiring
to solicit advantages from constables who were considered for

<HEADLINE> HK Welcomes Liberalization of Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong today welcomed the
successful conclusion of the financial services negotiations under
the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Around the negotiation table in Geneva, a total of 102 member
governments have made various levels of binding commitments to
open up their financial markets, which account for 95 percent of
the global trade in financial services.
</P>
<P>
Denise Yue, Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry, said
here today: "We are very pleased with the final outcome of
negotiations. The package of offers will bring about very
significant liberalization of financial markets on a global
scale."
</P>
<P>
She predicted that all industries would benefit from the
liberalization of the financial market, which is the keystone of
any economic infrastructure and provides the necessary capital and
funding for other economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has made a comprehensive offer covering all the
financial services within the scope of the negotiations, including
banking, insurance, and securities.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has a very liberal financial services regime and our
commitments are consistent with our free and open market
situation," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on financial services were originally
scheduled to end in June 1995. In an interim agreement in July
1995, participants decided that negotiations would be resumed in
April 1997 to achieve a higher level of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Participants are allowed to make adjustments to their
commitments made in 1995 during a two-month period before December
12, 1997.

<HEADLINE> AFC Moves to Popularize Women Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December (Xinhua) -- Asian Football Confederation
(AFC) are moving to make its biannual women soccer event more
appealing and competitive, the organization unveiled here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Weak teams will have to come through the qualification rounds
to enter the next Asian Women's Soccer Championship in two years
in 1999 and the finals will only involve eight teams rather than
the current eleven, AFC's committee for women soccer decided at a
meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The semifinalists at the underway tournament, which have come
out as China, DPR Korea, Japan and Chinese Taipei, will
automatically qualify for next Asian Cup and other teams have to
vie for the remaining four berths through the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
Some incredible outcomes at this championship would be unlikely
to repeat themselves two years later, General Secretary of AFC
Dato' Peter Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
China produced a stunning 21-0 rout of the Philipines and the
scoreline was reading 21-0 when the Japanese walked off the field
past Guam, who were brushing their unbelievable eyes.
</P>
<P>
More than one third of the group matches turned out
double-number results and even one of the semifinals ended in a
good 10-0 drubbing.
</P>
<P>
AFC have come to be concerned that the big gap between the
strong and the weak has affected the game and turned off
spectators.
</P>
<P>
It seems that not many people at this Southern Chinese city are
following the currently-going event since half the stadium seats
are empty.
</P>
<P>
"Taxi drivers here didn't even know there is a game on," Dr.
Velappan complained.

<P>
LUANDA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and fifty
Portuguese peace keepers in Angola are to leave the country from
February 5 to 10 next year, UN observation group here said today.
</P>
<P>
It is said that 55 of the 205 Portuguese logistics army

<HEADLINE> Scot Leas Omega PAG Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Scot Kenny Walker took the
lead in the Omega PGA Championship with a four under par 66 in
Saturday's third round.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Scot, who lives in Thailand, leads the 500,000
US dollar Asian PGA Tour event on nine-under-par 201 by a stroke
from South Korea's Choi Kyung-ju.
</P>
<P>
Choi, who led at the start of the day by five strokes from
Walker, returned a two-over-par 72.
</P>
<P>
Walker, in search of his first big win, lost the Kuala Lumpur
Open to Korean Kang Wook-soon by a stroke last year after missing
three three one foot putts over the closing three holes.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad collapse. I try not to think about it too
much. If I can just play steadily in the final round I'll have a
good chance," said Walker, a former Scottish Amateur champion.
</P>
<P>
Walker made ground on Choi after firing birdies on two, four,
13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
"The only mistake I have made on the greens in three rounds was
on 16," added Walker. "I nearly holed my first putt from 25 feet
and then my next for par lipped out."
</P>
<P>
The Scot shook off the bogey by holing a 10 footer for a birdie
on the 17th.
</P>
<P>
Choi, who fired a 65 in cold and breezy weather in round two,
was thrown by the change in conditions at Clearwater Bay Golf and
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
He led on 10 under at the turn but made bogies on par threes 11
and 14. "On both those par threes I hit the wrong iron. Yesterday
there was a strong wind on both holes but without the wind today I
did not know what irons to hit."
</P>
<P>
Lying in a tie for third place on six under are Rodrigo Cuello
of the Philippines, who carded a 65, Korea's Park No-seok, in with
a 68, Burma's Zaw Moe, with a 69, and Lu Wen-teh of Chinese
Taipei, who also fired a 69. Chang Tse-peng, also from Chinese
Taipei, equalled the course record with 64 to lie five under with
Chris Williams of England and India's Jyoti Randhawa.

In doing so, sources said Saturday, the European Commission
used criteria set out by EU leaders at their Copenhagen summit in
1993, including the political and economic standards.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day summit here, the EU leaders decided to start
entry talks early next year with the six applicants the EU
considers to be better off in political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
To be sitting around the negotiations table would be Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The remaining five, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and
Slovakia, are also promised a place in the world's biggest single
market once they have met the same criteria.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU leaders said, they would have to move towards
EU membership on a slower track.
</P>
<P>
The would-be members, as required by the EU, are supposed to
have stable institutions which can guarantee democracy, rule of
law, human rights and respect for minorities.
</P>
<P>
They are also to have a viable market economy to enable them to
deal with the competitive pressure from EU membership and shoulder
their responsibilities concerning the single currency to be
launched in early 1999.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Summit to Focus on Regional Economic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today said ASEAN leaders will concentrate on the
current economic problems at their second informal summit which
begins here on December 15.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed confidence that ASEAN will be one of the
strongest economic entities in the world in the future but for now
it has to concentrate on the present difficult situation arising
from currency and share market problems.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders' meeting will of course discuss the future but I
am afraid that it is very difficult to concentrate on the future
when the present is so painful," he said when answering questions
at a dialogue session after opening the four-day "Private Sector
Salute to ASEAN" conference being held in conjunction with the
summit in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said ASEAN had what it took to succeed including
regional peace, close cooperation among member countries and the
willingness to talk to each other to settle differences.
</P>
<P>
He said "the chances of ASEAN becoming a very dynamic region is
very good and I hope in 10 years time we will be just that."
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the conference, he suggested that a
"Buy ASEAN" policy be promoted as a way to recover from the
regional economic setbacks, saying he did not see any harm in
proposing the idea to his other ASEAN colleagues during the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated questions from the floor, Mahathir refused to
pin-point those responsible for the region's economic problems,
saying "I'm not allowed to blame anybody except ourselves. There
are certain things that you must not say."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said unless the root cause of the problems was
recognized and corrected, any proposed answer to solve them would
not be effective.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would continue to welcome genuine foreign direct
investments to the country, he said, adding "We still welcome
those people who come in to do serious long-term business."

<HEADLINE> UK Supports America's European Meat Imports Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government said
here today that it supported the new U.S. restrictions on European
meat imports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. Agriculture Department announced
Friday it would restrict meat and some livestock products imports
from 21 European nations until there was proof they carried no
risk of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham said in a
statement issued early today that Britain is "interested that the
U.S. is concerned about BSE (or mad cow disease) in other
(European Union) member states."
</P>
<P>
"The U.K. has similar concerns and is pressing for
implementation from January 5 (1997) of EU-wide controls on the
removal of some Specified Risk Material from beef and some sheep,"
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham noted that Britain "appears likely to be little
affected by this U.S. action. We do not export beef to the U.S.
and the market for sheep meat is small."
</P>
<P>
A British Agriculture Ministry official was quoted as saying
today that Cunningham welcomed the U.S. restrictions on European
meat imports and pledged to take tough action against European
Union (EU) countries if the January 5 deadline for removing any
BSE-risk material from their meat was not met.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a world-wide ban on British beef products in
March 1996 when the British government admitted possible links
between eating beef infected with BSE and its human equivalent of
the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

<HEADLINE> Maputo Records Highest Crime Rate in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican capital of
Maputo has recorded 6,026 criminal cases from January to November
this year, the Mozambique Information Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The crime rate in the capital was the highest among the cities
all over the country during this period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a meeting of the Ministry of the
Interior held at the suburbs of Maputo on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The police blamed the highest crime rate on the increasing
living cost, arms proliferation, over-consumption of hard drinks
and other causes in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Nampula Province with the second highest crime rate has
recorded 3,996 crime cases in the same period, said the report.
</P>

From January to November this year, the national crime rate
has increased by 0.25 percent, the report added, without

<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
today called for an all-out effort to fight against the spreading
crisis over the so-called mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The public should be informed that they ought to have
confidence in the food which is fit for human consumption, they
said during a two-day summit beginning in Luxembourg Friday.
</P>
<P>
But they assured the public that necessary precautions must be
taken to prevent tainted food from being sold for consumption,
according to a draft communique due for release after the summit.
</P>
<P>
"The production and supply of safe food must be one of the
European Union's priorities," they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU's independent Scientific Steering Committee said use of
intestines of cattle, sheep and goats of all ages and lungs,
vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia of these animals when
more than 12 months old should be banned.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said in the statement that everything necessary
should be done in order to restore the public's confidence
severely shaken by the BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy)
crisis.
</P>
<P>
They also said that they supported a high level of health
protection "ensured on the basis of high-quality, transparent
scientific advice."
</P>
<P>
The United States reportedly said Friday that it would impose
restrictions on cattle, sheep and some livestock imports from a
total of 21 European nations to avoid risks of mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Invites Clinton to Visit S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson
Mandela said today that he looked forward to a state visit by his
United States counterpart Bill Clinton who, he said, had done
much to uplift South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks in Pretoria after meeting with United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright earlier met South African deputy president Thabo
Mbeki, with whom she discussed problems in African countries such
as Rwanda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told reporters after talks that the United States and
South Africa shared "the some concerns" which included violence
in Rwanda, and delay in the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between his country and the United States is
"very good", adding he was encouraged by the U.S. commitment to
helping sustained economic development on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the talks, Albright expressed
concern that a number of provisions in the Lusaka peace protocol
had not yet been carried out.
</P>
<P>
She said the Democratic Republic of Congo should be helped to
become "an asset to the region".
</P>
<P>
Ms Albright said the former Zaire has caused a major problem,
as its tentacles "have reached into a number of conflicts in
Africa."
</P>
<P>
But she said she and Mbeki did not discuss the possibility of
setting up an African peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Mandela's recent visit to Libya, which was
criticized by the U.S, and about arms trade between South Africa
and the U.S, Ms Albright said: "We did not find any
disagreements."
</P>
<P>
But she also said such matters should be handled through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Ms Albright arrived in South African last night for a working
visit. She was on a week-long tour of seven African countries,
which included Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic
of Congo and Angola.
</P>
<P>
She was to leave for Zimbabwe later today for the last leg of
her visit.

<HEADLINE> Rival Militiamen in N. Mogadishu Agree on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Rival militiamen in North
Mogadishu agreed on cease-fire today after 150 clan elders and
politicians intervened and mediate at an intensive
representative meeting to end clan dispute over land.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held in the residence of Hussein Hagi Bod, the
deputy chairman of Ali Mahdi Mohamed faction, the two sides have
reached a cease-fire agreement which would be effective at 3:30
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides mediated by neutral sub-clans have also agreed
upon the separation of the militiamen and moving them together
with their technical wagons back to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
Before signing the accord, the mediatory sub-clans have
managed to put neutral forces in between the front lines of the
battled militiamen early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
In the process of sandwiching the neutral militiamen between
the rival armed-men, three gunmen were killed, two from the
neutral forces, as they tried to station themselves near Sana
junction, one of North Mogadishu's most populated area.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the cease-fire pact was inked this afternoon, the
elders sacrificed two sheep for the occasion according to the
tradition and called on each side to honor the agreement. The
elders shared slices of mutton and had their meal together with
extra happiness.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators, mainly children and women, poured
onto the streets to celebrate the signature of the cease-fire
accord. They marched past all the streets including the one in
front of Ali Mahdi's residence.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi's deputy, Bod, told reporters that the agreement was
applauded by both sides. "I assure you that the situation is now
under the full control of the elders," he said, "and the rival
sides pledged to observe the agreement."
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the supporters of Ali Mahdi Mohamed in the
past three days has claimed the lives of more than 30 people and
wounded nearly A hundred others.
</P>
<P>
Rival Militiamen had fought because of clan dispute over land
ownership in Deganley Village, 25 km north of the capital last
month.

<HEADLINE> Another Bombing Raid Reported in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
Sierra Leone today reported another bombing raid by a Nigerian
air force jet this time on the border town of Zimmi near Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Zimmi, some 60 miles to the Liberian border in the south, was
said by the authorities to have been hit by three cluster bombs
on Friday evening by the jet which flew later to Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said it was not established what damage was
caused or whether there had been any casualties as communications
link with the capital is extremely poor.
</P>
<P>
There has not been any independent confirmation of the claim
but unofficial reports said it is believed that the Nigerian
contingent in ECOMOG "is trying to establish a safe corridor to
bring in a number of sophisticated tanks and other vehicles into
Sierra Leone from Fairo to Zimmi as it disengages from
peace-keeping missions in Liberia."
</P>
<P>
However, a junta spokesman later claimed that 20 people were
killed during the raid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, continuing deaths have been reported in many of the
displaced people's camps in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone Red Cross officials reported that a total of 100
people, including children, have died in two camps in the east
and south of the country within the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Cholera, measles and starvation claimed the lives of some 20
people at the Kenema displaced camp in the east while in Bo in
the south, 80 people have also died at the Gondama camp.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Party to Sue Govt over Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition National
Democratic Union (NDU) today said it will take the government to
court over the designation of commercial farms whose owners have
only one farm.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, NDU President Mark Muchabaiwa said although
his party agreed with the government on the need to resettle
thousands of landless peasants, the state had erred in
designating farms of people with only one farm.
</P>
<P>
He urged Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai to
delete the list of these farms and designate those whose owners
had more than one.
</P>
<P>
"If the government continues to grab these farms then the NDU
shall have no alternative but to take the whole matter to court
so that justice must be seen to be done," Muchabaiwa said, adding
that their lawyers were already preparing heads of arguments.
</P>
<P>
The NDU president said some of those affected were black
indigenous commercial farmers who were still trying to develop
their farms which they had bought recently.
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to help people affected by this irrational
government move," he said.
</P>
<P>
Muchabaiwa said it was on record that the government's first
resettlement program was a failure and their main worry was the
effect the designation of the farms would have on the agro-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Its on record that over a million people have been resettled
all over the country but not even one person has been granted
title deeds for those pieces of land so that they can borrow
money from banks to improve production," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has designated about 1,500 farms throughout the
country which intends to acquire for resettlement purposes as
soon as it considers all objections which have to be received
before the end of December.

NAIROBI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- President of Democratic Congo
Laurent Kabila left Kinshasa today for a state visit to China,
his first trip outside Africa since he assumed power in May this
year, a report from the Congolese capital said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not by chance that the president has left for China," a

</P>
<P>
"That big country means a lot for us. That country has always
stood by the Congolese revolutionaries. The President will hold
talks with a wide range of personalities there," the aide added.
</P>
<P>
Kabila will hold talks with his Chinese counterpart Jiang
Zemin and visit provincial towns outside Beijing during his
week-long trip in China, diplomatic sources predicted in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
And this is his first trip to China since he toppled
late Mobutu Sese Seko after a seven-month military drive.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupts During Protestant March in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Catholic nationalist
protesters, angered at a march by Protestant Apprentice Boys in
Londonderry, Northern Ireland, set several vehicles on fire this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that following the first leg of the march
around the Diamond area of the city center, the nationalist
protesters, who oppose British rule of Northern Irelan, threw
petrol bombs, bottles and bricks at police officers.
</P>
<P>
Several buses and a truck were torched after a 30-minute
stand-off between police and the protesters.
</P>
<P>
The annual Lundy's Day demonstration by the pro-British
Protestants marks the shutting of the city's gates in the face of
Catholic forces in 1688.
</P>
<P>
Nationalist residents had wanted the march re-routed or
otherwise they would hold a counter demonstration. They regard the
march as anti-Irish and sectarian.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said British troops returned to the streets of
Londonderry later today for the first time in nearly six months
after the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has been plagued by sectarian clashes linked to
tension over controversial parades for many years. Scuffles broke
out during the Lundy's Day parade last year as well.
</P>
<P>
The clash has cast a shadow on the multi-party peace talks on
the future of Northern Ireland which began in September and was
scheduled to end next May.

<HEADLINE> Ruling May Affect Microsoft's New Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The temporary ruling of the
U.S. federal court Thursday in the antitrust case against the
Microsoft Corporation suggests that a final decision next Summer
could erode the power of the company, the New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, the world's most powerful and profitable software
maker, has expanded its business actively to areas such as
telecommunications, cable television, entertainment and travel.
</P>
<P>
It was charged by some of its competitors for binding its World
Wide Web browser, Internet Explorer (IE) 4.0, to its operating
system, Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
The initial ruling forbids Microsoft to continue its forced
binding of the softwares and give consumers to have their own
choices. Now the Navigator browsers produced by the Netscape
Communications still dominate the market, although their shares
have been cut hard by Microsoft's IE 4.0.
</P>
<P>
The Netscape Communications welcomed the ruling and said it
would compete with other browser makers on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, however, could lead to delay or halt shipments of
Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0, the next versions of the operating
system that runs on more than 90 percent of the world's newly
shipped personal computers, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft defenders argue that delaying Windows 98 could have a
broader detrimental impact on the United States economy than a
monopoly would have, it said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft receives only a small payment for each machine sold
with its operating system, but the almost 100 million computers
sold world-wide each year added up to a huge part of the 5.97
billion U.S. dollars the company's operating systems division
earned this year, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Albania Plans to Buy Back Weapons from Citizens, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Albania's Minister to the Prime
Minister's office, Kastriot Islami, said today that his country
was planning to buy back weapons seized when insurgents ransacked
arsenals throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki,
Islami said that one solution would be to buy back the weapons,
with the assistance of the United Nations. "We are currently
discussing this option with the international community," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Islami said that 30 percent of weapons had already been
recovered but the rest of the weapons were being kept in people's
homes, and some of them had been smuggled into neighboring Greece
and the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was much more difficult for the Albanian government to
recover arms from villages than cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Tirana was preparing to amend legislation in
order to allow the Albanian Communist Party to become legally
established.

<P>
ATHENS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The five-day environmental
conference today ended in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki
with a declaration calling for tremendous coordination and radical
changes in people's behaviors and lifestyles, including changes in
production and consumption models.
</P>
<P>
The conference, entitled "Environment and Society: Education
and Sensitization of Citizens on Sustainability", was organized by
the United Nations Educational, Scientifical and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) and the Greek government, and was attended
by delegations from 90 countries.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stresses that the reorientation of all
education towards sustainability includes all levels of formal and
informal education in all countries, and that sustainability is a
moral value in which cultural differences and traditional
knowledge must be respected.
</P>
<P>
The declaration says that UNESCO should set up a special prize
which is to be awarded every two years to exemplary educational
programs for the environment and sustainability.
</P>
<P>
It also recommends the holding of an international conference
in 10 years to evaluate the application and progress of the
recommendations included in the declaration.

KUWAIT CITY, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan said here today that the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observation
Mission (UNIKOM) will carry out its marine monitoring on the
Kuwaiti side in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to strengthen the monitoring on the sea to
prevent violations of U.N. resolutions and infiltrators, drug
smuggling and other incidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Friday for a two-day visit, was
awarded an honorary degree of Ph.D. at Kuwait University today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the awarding ceremony, he said that
marine monitors will be equipped with four boats and two radar
stations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. observers currently carry out their mission along the
Kuwaiti-Iraqi border on the sea by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
According to UNIKOM adviser Tadesse Tesfaeye, the two radar
stations are being installed and the four patrolling boats are
expected to come into service in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
The UNIKOM, formed after the 1991 Gulf War ending Iraq's
seven-month occupation of Kuwait, patrols a demilitarized zone
along the border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The zone, which extends 10 kilometers into Iraq and five
kilometers into Kuwait, runs 200 kilometers on land and 40
kilometers in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Praises Irish Troops' Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
today awarded his Irish counterpart Mary McAleese Lebanese Merit
Medal of Special Rank in appreciation of the role played by Irish
troops in the U.N. peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The award ceremony was held during a luncheon given in
honor of McAleese, who arrived in south Lebanon late on Thursday
where she had inspected the 500-strong Irish troops in the
4,500-member U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
Hrawi said that the Irish troops not only help Lebanon in
keeping peace, but also play a humanitarian and social role.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Irish troops were among the first groups
coming to Lebanon to implement the U.N. resolution 425, which
calls for Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon without any
condition.
</P>
<P>
On her part, McAleese said that the main aim of her visit to
Lebanon, her first foreign trip since she assumed office in
November, is to give her respect to the U.N. peacekeeping forces,
especially the Irish troops in south Lebanon which account for 80
percent of the country's troops abroad.
</P>
<P>
In separate incidents or clashes between Iranian-backed
Hezbollah and Israeli troops, a total of 38 Irish soldiers had
lost their lives in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Irish president expressed hope that Lebanon will be able
to exert authority on its whole territory and achieve just and
comprehensive peace as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
McAleese visited the headquarters of the UNIFIL in Nagoura near
the Lebanese-Israeli border and held talks with the force's
commander Jioje Konrote before coming to Beirut by a UNIFIL
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
She will leave here for home Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Summit Regarded as A Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
summit wound up here today with agreements on its most ambitious
expansion plan ever and establishment of a euro council to manage
the planned single currency.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg hosting the
two-day summit, said at the final press conference Saturday
evening that "monumental and historical decisions" had been made
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Geography and history have finally found each other together,"
he said, adding that he was proud to witness the first step taken
towards EU enlargement at the summit.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the summit had reinforced the irreversibility
of the planned European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, president of the EU's executive body, the
European Commission, described the summit as a "major success,"
adding that the same words could be used to describe the EU's jobs
summit held in November in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The summit, considered by Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok as "a
summit of enlargement," decided that entry talks would be started
early next year with the five-plus-one configuration proposed in
July by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and
Cyprus are regarded as candidate countries advanced in required
political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU leaders agreed that the other five applicants
on the slow track -- Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and
Slovakia -- could participate in the enlargement process early
next year but had to be patient before they could have truly enter
talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The five candidates, which will join the "accession
partnerships" like the others, will be evaluated by the EU on
economic and political terms to see if they are qualified for
formal entry negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with the EU's reluctance to recognize Ankara's EU
candidate status, Turkey snubbed an invitation to dine with EU
leaders Saturday after the closure of the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, EU leaders agreed that it was politically difficult to
exclude Turkey from the "European family."
</P>
<P>
A European Conference, which the heads of state and government
decided to establish to group EU members and its applicant
countries, would lack substance if Turkey was not there, said EU
Commissioner Hans van den Broek.
</P>
<P>
Britain seemed to have saved face in a hairsplitting battle
with France over a French-proposed new club of European single
currency member states despite its announcement not to join the
economic and monetary union (EMU) before 2002.
</P>
<P>
Followed by Sweden and Denmark, and to a lesser extent Greece,
Britain has announced not to join the EMU at its launch on January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl finally intervened to help find a
compromise on the issue, which will provide the four potential
non-euro countries a possibility of attending the euro council's
inner circle meetings if there are issues of common interest
raised.
</P>
<P>
But decisions concerning common economic and monetary policies
still need to be taken by Ecofin, the formal body of all 15 EU
finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair told a press conference held
Saturday afternoon that the summit was an "extremely successful"
one. Britain is going to have the rotating EU presidency for the

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes EU Summit Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed
European Union's (EU) decision to open membership talks with
Cyprus and five Central and Eastern European countries next March.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Cypriot journalists in Luxembourg today, Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides said that it's a decision of historic
importance that will benefit the countries concerned, according to
Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The decision which was made today by EU leaders in their
summit has opened the door for Cyprus' accession to the EU,
Clerides said, adding that "I am fully satisfied with this
development."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reference to Turkish Cypriots' participation
in the negotiations, Clerides said "we never denied their
participation in the Cypriot delegation, under the auspices
of the Republic of Cyprus' delegation. We had said this has
always been our stance."
</P>
<P>
The president also pointed out that it had always been the
firm stance of the Cypriot government that the accession course
into the EU would be helpful and a catalyst toward reaching a
solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Clerides estimated the duration of EU-Cyprus accession talks
to be around two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has expressed
dissatisfaction with the EU decision on accession talks with
Cyprus, noting that this was not helpful toward a settlement to
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Denktash told the Turkish Cypriot press that it "seems the
Greek Cypriots, Greece and the EU do not wish a settlement of
the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of a direct peace talks between Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides in August due to the EU's planned
accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Turkish Cypriots object the EU's decision to
start accession talks with Cyprus, insisting that Cyprus can
join the EU only after a political settlement on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> African Justice Ministers Conference Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The two-day conference of
African justice ministers and attorneys-general decided here
today to adopt the draft protocol on setting up an African court
on human and peoples' rights.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in a communique issued after the
conference concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of justice and attorneys-general of the member
states of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) met here in
Ethiopia on December 12-13 and considered the draft protocol on
the setting up of the African court on human and peoples' rights.
</P>
<P>
"Having examined the draft protocol in the light of statements
and observations made by delegations, the conference decided to
adopt the draft protocol and recommended it for adoption by the
OAU Council of Ministers and the assembly of heads of state and
government," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU and the states parties to the African charter on human
and peoples' rights said "the charter of the OAU recognizes that
freedom, equality, justice, peace and dignity are essential
objectives for the achievement of the legitimate aspirations of
the African peoples", according to the draft protocol.
</P>
<P>
They are "firmly convinced that the attainment of the
objectives of the African charter on human and peoples' rights
requires the establishment of an African court on human and
peoples' rights to complement and reinforce the functions of the
African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights", said the
communique.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts Urged In Reforming State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will publish a commentary Monday saying that
the success of restructuring state-owned enterprises relies on
joint efforts from the government, society and the firms.
</P>
<P>
In the commentary, titled "Success Relies on Joint Efforts,"
the paper says that some state enterprises have suffered losses
because their internal problems related to the managerial
mechanism and the external market environment.
</P>
<P>
The paper terms it a special situation of China since the
country is turning from a planned economy toward a market
economy. The enterprises should try to solve their own internal
problems, while the government and society have to join hands in
tackling the external problems, it says.
</P>
<P>
The state firms have taken measures to cut the staff and
improve efficiency to reduce losses, but the issues of laid-off
workers and their re-employment should be regarded as an issue for
the enterprises as well as the government and society, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary uses Shanghai as an example to show how the
government could deal with the issues. The municipal government of
Shanghai has set up a group to study the issue of
re-employment. Professional training, favorable taxation and
financial assistance are the three means used by the city to solve
the problem, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper urges the establishment and improvement of the
country's social security systems, including medical insurance for
retired people and jobless benefits.
</P>
<P>
State firms are unable to compete with other kinds of companies
on an equal footing, unless their social burdens of various kinds
are relieved, with the help of the government, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It says that government efforts are necessary to reform the
structures of industries and regional economy and, meanwhile, to
solve internal problems, the enterprises should depend on Party
organizations and staff workers as well.
</P>
<P>
During the process to reduce losses, the state companies are
turning themselves into the real subject on the market, while the
government is changing its functions to boost the formation of the
market and create conditions for loss-reduction, the commentary
says.

<HEADLINE> Cuello Captures PGA Championship Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Filipino Rodrigo Cuello
chalked up his second major victory in Hong Kong in the space of a
year taking the 500,000 U.S. dollars Omega PGA Championship at
Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Cuello won by a stroke from Chinese Taipei's Lu
 Wen-teh in what is the season's final strokeplay event on Asian
PGA's Tour. This added the title to the Hong Kong Open which he
won in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Cuello fired a four-under-par 66 to finish with a
four-round-aggregate of 10-under-par 270, while Lu closed with a
67.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Park No-seok finished third after returning a 69
while overnight leader Kenny Walker of Scotland and South African
Craig Kamps finished fourth with rounds of 73 and 68 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Cuello was playing in the second from last group and started
the day four strokes behind Walker.
</P>
<P>
Cuello's focused approach saw him fire six birdies and two
bogies.
</P>
<P>
His birdie on the 15th proved to be the most decisive as it
took him to 10 under and three strokes clear of Lu and Park.
</P>
<P>
Lu, playing in front, rallied with birdies on the last two
holes. But Cuello, drawing on the experience he gained in last
year's Hong Kong Open, calmly came home with three pars.
</P>
<P>
Walker who had played so steadily for the first three rounds
succumbed to the pressure on the final day.
</P>
<P>
Choi Gwang-soo of South Korea was a stroke behind Walker after
three rounds but crashed to a 79 and placed joint 26th.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that he missed the cut this week American Mike
Cunning took the Omega Order of Merit crown.
</P>
<P>
His total of 170,619 dollars from the 17 events he played in
saw him win the merit crown from Thailand's Prayad Markseang, who
also missed the cut this week. Prayad finished the year on 123,805
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lu's second place in the Omega PGA Championship, worth 55,650,
led him to claim third place on the list with earnings of 114,716
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The victory has given Cuello a berth in next week's
season-ending 250, 000 U.S. dollars Asian Matchplay Championships
at Mimosa Golf and Country Club from December 17 to 20.

TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran today lashed out at a
U.N. resolution urging Iran to improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed by the U.N. General Assembly last week
is based on "biased reports", whose sponsors bear grudge against
Iran and Islam, said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He called the resolution as misjudging Iran's reality and
lacking knowledge of Iran's legal and political systems.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that international cooperation for improvement
of human rights should be free from ideological conflicts,
unreliable information and exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction that more countries voted against
such an anti-Iran resolution at the U.N. General Assembly this
year than in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
This indicates more and more countries have realized that the
human rights issue has been used as a political tool and the
double-standard approach of the sponsors of the resolution, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the resolution will harm the spirit of
cooperation, but Iran, which attaches great significance to human
dignity, will further improve material and spiritual rights of the
people.

<HEADLINE> Effective Education Helps Prisoners Turn Over New Leaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- At a New Year's Eve party by the
Tibetan calender in a Tibet prison, a young woman prisoner and her
inmates sang a song in which they called the warders "our dear
mum."
</P>
<P>
"We wrote the words ourselves," said Cering Lhamo. "For if my
parents had given me proper advice, I would have not committed
crime and ended up in prison," said the 20-year-old woman who is
serving a four-year prison term for endangering national security.
</P>
<P>
Lhamo was very hostile during the first few months in prison,
officials said, but the ideological work by the warders and
education have made her gradually realize the nature of the crime
she had committed.
</P>
<P>
"The warders here have never beaten me or called me bad
names. Instead they are like doctors trying every means to correct
my behavior," said Cering Lamu, who had been a nun in a Buddhist
nunnery in suburban Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
She is one of 200 women prisoners in the prison which is
situated in northern suburb of Lhasa. More than 750 males with
charges of murder, rape, robbery, theft and endangering national
security. Seventy-five percent of the prisoners here are Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Gequ Zhouga said the education conducted by the prison
authorities has a unique "human touch."
</P>
<P>
"We take days off on national holidays and have three dishes
added to the usual menu," said Gequ Zhouga, who was jailed for
gambling and stealing. "We are criminals, but the warders respect
our personal dignity.
</P>
<P>
"They have done more than our parents could do to help us
reform ourselves. If we make progress, we are rewarded with an
extension of the meeting time with our family members relatives."
</P>
<P>
The way the Tibet Prison conducts education has yielded
positive results -- nearly every prisoner has had his or her
prison term reduced for good behavior and only two out of a
hundred convicts commit crime again after they are released.
</P>
<P>
According to warden Loshang Gelie, the prison reforms prisoners
by combining education with labor work. "Our goal is to correct
their had habits and turn them into law-abiding citizens."
</P>
<P>
To that end, the prison offers several courses so that
prisoners can learn one or two skills to make a living after
release.
</P>
<P>
Norbu, who learned to knit woolen cushions in the prison, now
runs a small cushion factory in his hometown. More than 50 former
convicts are getting rich through honest labor, like Norbu.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners work six hours a day, five days a week, said Loshang
Gelie. They also have seven hours to learn to read and write. The
prison often invites scholars and well-known personages to give
prisoners lectures on law, Tibetan history and organizes
discussions on changes taken place in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The living expenditure for prisoners in the prison averages
2,500 yuan per person a year, the highest of all prisons in
China. Prisoners have three meals a day which are "hot, clean and
nutritious". There is also a clinic to ensure prisoners get timely
treatment for illness.
</P>
<P>
"I will never do anything that endangers national security
again when I am out of here," said Cering Lhamo who has only four
months before her prison term is over. "I say so not because I am
afraid of being jailed again, but because I know what I did is
totally wrong."

to represent their interests in the elections scheduled for next
May, he added.
</P>
<P>
The voter registration campaign started on December 6 and the
deadline is fixed for January 16.
</P>

that it would help engender a stronger sense of belonging and
promote harmony among residents in Sha Tin district.
</P>
<P>

district, such as public housing estates, shopping malls, sports
grounds and Sha Tin Town Hall before the festival ends on February

WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The accord to liberalize trade in financial services
reflects a U-turn by Asian countries, which suddenly are desperate
to attract investments, as well as the conclusion that they could
not send another shock to the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
-- The only English-speaking nation in South America is about
to elect a new president, and although 90 percent of the
population traces its ancestry to India or Africa, a 77-year-old
Jewish woman from Chicago appears to be the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Asian financial crisis, which only weeks ago was being
shrugged off as a mild irritant to the U.S. economy, has now sent
investors, executives and economists scrambling to revise their
forecasts and strategies. Few are willing to predict when or how
the Asian mess will end.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time in modern Korean history, an opposition
candidate could win the presidency here this week, earning the job
of putting this important and economically stricken Asian nation
back on its feet.

GUANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Commodity Inspection
Bureau of Guangdong Province in south China has imposed stricter
controls on the quality of vegetables exported to the neighboring
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

493 local residents in the territory fell sick after eating
vegetables from the inland.

Since 1990, the province has issued a series of regulations to
check and supervise the quality of vegetable exports to Hong
Kong. Local health-care authorities from both sides meet twice
yearly to talk on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The efforts reportedly have paid off. Few such incidents have

<HEADLINE> Township-run Enterprises Reap Harvest In Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Township-run enterprises in
east China's Fujian Province have enjoyed double-digit growth
rates because of adjustments in the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the total industrial output of
township-run enterprises reached 293.6 billion yuan (36.7 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996, an increase of 10.3 percent over 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,010 township-run enterprises recorded annual sales of

</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 39 percent of the added value of the
province's gross domestic product (GDP) are from the township-run
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Because it is a coastal province near Taiwan, Fujian has worked
hard to build its township-run enterprises into export-oriented
ones.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the province had built up 8,934
export-oriented township-run enterprises by introducing advanced
technology, overseas funds and expertise.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has received 50 million yuan in loans
from the state and attracted overseas investments of 10 million
U.S. dollars to help 16 township-run enterprises win the right to
export their own products.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 146 groups have been formed from the township-run
enterprises, 45 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has built up 1,000 industrial zones
involving a large group of township-run enterprises with abundant
funds and advanced production technology.

<HEADLINE> Von Gruenigen Wins Giant Slalom After Maier Disqualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Michael Von Gruenigen of
Switzerland gained a surprising victory of a men's World Cup giant
slalom Sunday after winner Herman Maier was disqualified in Val
D'isere, France.
</P>
<P>
Maier of Austria finished overall first with the best time of
the two runs, 2 minutes 29.08 seconds, better than Von
Gruegnigen's 2:29.48.
</P>
<P>
But Maier stopped too soon after the finish to take off his
skis and display them, short of a line set by the International
Ski Federation to avoid skiers making too much of a show of the
sponsor's skis.
</P>
<P>
The rule was brought in for the Olympics one year and skiers
must go past the line before taking off their skis.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss immediately made an appeal against Maier's action and
FIS officials disqualified him about a half hour after the race.
</P>
<P>
So instead of Maier's third victory of the season, it went to
Von Gruengien, who won the giant slalom in nearby Tignes in
October. It was Von Gruenigen's 13th career victory.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Eberharter of Austria moved up to second 2:30.41 with
another Austrian, Hans Knauss now third, 2:30.57.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disqualification Maier is still in the lead of the
overall standings with 429 points.

<HEADLINE> Somali Communities Join Hands in Assisting Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- In addition to efforts made
by the international community, the Somali social groups have
donated Somali Shillings 53 million (about 8,000 U.S. dollars) to
flood victims in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in south Mogadishu today, the Flood-Aid
Collecting Committee, said the donations were made by 11
community centers.
</P>
<P>
The largest donation was made by the Islamic Solidarity Forum
which paid more than 2,000 dollars. Aerolite Somalia
Telecommunications and Barakat Telecommunications, also paid
2,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the other sectors are the Coalition Grassroots Women's
Organization (COGWO) which donated one million Somali Shillings
(about 151,500 dollars) and a large number of buckets and other
necessary household utensils.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Mohamud Shirwa, chairman of the Flood-Aid Collecting
Committee, said in the press conference that another 8,000
dollars has been promised from wealthy individuals and small
business communities.
</P>
<P>
Two local hospitals, Dr Hassan Jiis Memorial Hospital and
Shifo Hospital, have told the committee that they are ready to
send volunteer health workers to send the donations to their
destination areas.
</P>
<P>
"We should not forget that we have received considerable
package of the essential drugs from the Bakara market medicine
dealers," said Shirwa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the distribution modalities, Shirwa said they
noted that areas in lower and middle Shabelle regions are worst
affected by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Their target areas, he said, are Kurtunwarrey, Sablale, and
Muddul Barawa of lower Shabelle region and Mahadday district of
middle Shabelle region where tens of thousands of people are
outside on flood created islands eagerly waiting for help.
</P>
<P>
"This money will be used to buy sorghum, maize, dates, cooking
oil and medicines. We'll wrap the food in one kilogram bags for
easier distribution," Shirwa noted.
</P>
<P>
The committee has strongly commended the international aid
agencies who have so far delivered aid to the flood ravaged
regions of Somalia, saying "They showed a special responsibility
in saving our people."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, president of the break away Republic of Somaliland
and Mohamud Mohamed Guled, former chairman of Somali Airlines
Company have each raised 1,000 dollars to the flood victims. The
money was handed to the United Nations Children's Funds (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest donation ever made by the Somali
communities in response to the flood victims who desperately need
local and international help.

NANNING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have invested in their own

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Grants More Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet approved in
principle today to allocate more budget for 1998 to buy 14
life-saving drugs that could keep the patients alive as demanded
by the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The extra allocation totals 42.85 million U.S. dollars which
will be used specially to buy 14 expensive drugs for cancer,
diabetes, schizophrenia and AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome) patients in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry was previously reluctant to cover the
cost of these drugs, saying granting extra funding on the drugs
will break the government budget target of 2.4 percent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
This policy of the Finance Ministry has drawn sharp criticism
from Isreal Medical Association, trade unions and cancer and AIDS
patients.
</P>
<P>
Ten AIDS patients petitioned last Thursday the Tel Aviv
District Court for an injunction against the government and
the Finance Ministry, demanding they supply the anti-AIDS
"cocktail" drugs that can keep them alive.
</P>
<P>
The same day, the Histadrut (National Trade Union) also
petitioned the High Court of Justice against the government's
attempts to reduce the health budget and reduce the basket
of health services ensured by the National Health Insurance Law.
</P>
<P>
A group of cancer and AIDS patients called on President Ezer
Weizman last Tuesday, and appealed him to intervene on their
behalf.

<HEADLINE> Comorian Parties Reach Agreement on Island Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Comorian government
and opposition parties attending the international conference on
Comoros have reached a six-point agreement here after a four
days' negotiation and discussion.
</P>
<P>
According to the Addis Ababa Agreement issued here earlier
this morning at the end of the conference, the Comorian parties
expressed deep regret over military actions on the two islands of
Anjouan and Moheli, as well as the loss in human lives, injuries
and destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
They called for the establishment of an international
commission of inquiry to identify the responsibilities, evaluate
the damage caused in the two islands during the crisis and
propose measures likely to enable the victims obtain the
necessary compensation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Comorian parties agreed to hold, as
soon as possible, under the auspices of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and according to the format of the Addis
Ababa international conference, an inter-island Comorian
conference with a view to defining a new institutional framework,
meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Comorians.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the Comorian parties noted the firm position
expressed by the OAU, the United Nations, the League of Arab
States and the European Union, on the unity and territorial
integrity of the Comoros," said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Comorian parties pledged to continue with their dialogue
with a view to establishing the conditions conducive to the
convening of the proposed conference.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to establish a commission in charge of
implementing the agreement which comprises the representatives of
all the Comorian parties to the international conference in Addis
Ababa and chaired by the OAU, the agreement noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Comorian parties appealed for urgent
assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized under the auspices of the OAU also
drew observers from the central organ of the OAU mechanism for
conflict prevention, management and resolution, five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, the League of Arab States
and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Article Calls for People's Attention to Economic Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- An article in the last issue
of the Beijing-based bi-weekly magazine "Outlook" reminds people
that China remains a developing country relatively backward in
many fields, despite all of its economic achievements and growing
national power.
</P>
<P>
Contributed by the State Statistics Bureau, the article uses
charts and diagrams to illustrate the fact that China is still in
the primary stage of socialism by comparing China's major economic
figures and indices with those of other countries, including
developed ones.
</P>
<P>
"Having a correct understanding of the reality and courageously
facing that reality should be the starting point of everything we
do," says the article.
</P>
<P>
The article cautions that while the country's economic size
keeps expanding, its economic efficiency remains low,
characterized by high input and low output.
</P>
<P>
For every 100 yuan of added industrial value in 1994, China
used 32 times more energy or 15 times more electric power than
Japan did.
</P>
<P>
Although China has made remarkable progress in readjusting its
economic structure, it remains basically an agricultural society
with the rural population accounting for 80 percent of the
nation's total, 12 percent more than India.
</P>
<P>
In education, China's literacy rate is higher than the world
average, but its system of higher education has not been
well-developed. In 1993 only 3.3 people out of 100 had the chance
to receive a college education, while the world average was
15.5. In India it was 4.9, and 48.2 in the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology currently contribute more than 60
percent to the national economy in industrial countries, but in
China the figure is about 30 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that the face-to-face dialogue between
leaders of China and Vietnam, which are neighbors, is of great
importance in promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president, who arrived here this afternoon for the
upcoming informal summit between ASEAN and China, Japan and South
Korea and that between China and ASEAN, made the remarks while
meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted the increase in the high-level visits between the
two countries in recent years and expressed his hope that the
momentum of such high-level visits should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang also congratulated Phan on his becoming the
Vietnamese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that both China and Vietnam have similar
tasks of reform, opening up and economic construction, saying that
"our two countries should learn from each other".
</P>
<P>
Jiang also spoke highly of the achievements Vietnam has made in
its socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
Phan recalled with pleasure his visit to Beijing in July and
said that he was glad to meet with President Jiang again in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese prime minister said that the recently-concluded
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was very
successful and Jiang's speech at the Congress left deep impression
on him.
</P>
<P>
Phan said that he agreed to the assessment made by Jiang on the
bilateral ties between Vietnam and China, adding that leaders of
the two countries should work further for enhancing the existing
friendly bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang also extended his congratulations on Vietnam's
joining the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and Phan
expressed his thanks for the support China gave in this regard.

JAKARTA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's world champion Ye
Zhaoying thrashed her nemesis Susi Susanti of Indonesia in
straight sets to win the women's singles title at the 380,000
dollar World Grand Prix Badminton tournament here tonight.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has raked up four out of five golds at the
championships.
</P>
<P>
Ye tamed Susanti, 1992 Olympic champion and a long-time rival,
in a surprisingly easy way, winning the battle 11-4, 11-4 in just
over 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
earlier today, China's mixed doubles team, Liu Yong and Ge Fei,
took the first gold by beating Trikus Heryanto and Minarti Timur
15-9, 15-13. In the men's singles, Dong Jiong beat his compatriot
Sun Jun 19-9, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
China is already assured of another gold in the women's doubles
in which Ge Fei and Gu Jun meet compatriots Tang Yongshu and Qin
Yiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian's only hope for gold was the men's doubles which
will pit Candra Wijaya and Budiarto Sigit against Malaysia's

The article points out that the Chinese are enjoying a better
life now with improved housing and reduced food costs, but
adds: "The bottlenecks in transportation and telecommunications
constrain the further development of production, which in turn
will make it difficult on people's consumption level."
</P>
<P>
At present, China owns fewer telephones than the average for
developing countries and the number of private cars per person is
about one-tenth the world average.
</P>
<P>
Calculated in the way the World Bank assesses a country's
wealth, the per capita gross national product (GNP) was 620
U.S. dollars in 1995, much lower than the world average of 4,880
U.S. dollars. The average in developed countries was 24,930
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The article warns that China is turning into an aging
society. In the absence of a sound pension and social welfare
system, the number of people above 60 has reached 120 million,
nearly one-tenth of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
"The figures and charts can illustrate the gap between China
and the other countries in terms of material wealth, but cannot
show the gap in social development, such as the legal and justice
system, citizens' ethics and moral standards and to what degree
the economy is operated under the market force," says the
article.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Center In Southern China Succeeds In Saving Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the biggest
industrial center in southern China, used to consume a large
amount of energy, but has saved 260,000 tons of coal in the first
ten months of this year in 108 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The city, which is the capital of Guangdong Province, began to
adjust its industrial construction in favor of light industry,
which tends to consume less energy. Statistics show a growth in
light industry of five percentage points higher than for heavy
industry.
</P>
<P>
The output value of light industry is 25 billion yuan (about
3.12 billion U.S. dollars) more than for heavy industry. Computer
output has increased 180 percent over the same period of last
year, and audio equipment output is 11 times that of 1996. Cement
and fertilizer on the other hand have grown less than seven
percent, and pig iron and nonferrous metals are having negative
growth.
</P>
<P>
The city is also encouraging enterprises that used to use a lot
of energy to develop new energy-efficient products and to use
advanced energy-saving techniques.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Guangzhou spent 5.7 billion yuan (about 712.5 million
US dollars) on bringing 25 energy-saving methods to its heavy
industries.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of its heavy industrial products are being made
with less energy consumption.

<HEADLINE> County Boosting Aquatic Products Breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Duchang County in central
China's Jiangxi Province has used more than 12 million U.S.
dollars in foreign investment to promote the breeding of aquatic
products during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Duchang, adjacent Poyang Lake, has been trying to tap its rich
water resources. Statistics show that the county has more than
10,000 hectares of lakes.
</P>
<P>
However, development of the lakes has been greatly handicapped
because of below-standard breeding and limitations on businessmen
from other localities contracting the lakes.
</P>
<P>
Since local government introduced a series of preferential
policies welcoming foreign investment in 1994, businesses from
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, the United States and France have
been developing such water resources as breeding pearls,
soft-shelled turtle, crabs and bullfrogs.
</P>
<P>
Domestic provinces, such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian are
also participating in developing the county's water resources.

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has asked the United
Nations to help extradite a U.N. worker, who fled the country on
December 6 after killing an Iraqi in a car accident, to stand
trial, said the official Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Danish Londe Rorine, a member of
U.N. guards contingent in Iraq, had on June 22 run over an Iraqi
while driving his car in Shaqlawa area, Erbil Governorate. The
Iraqi died on way to hospital.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator's Office in Baghdad sent a note
to Iraqi Foreign Ministry regretting the accident.
</P>

The U.N. worker left the country without getting the formal
approval of the Iraqi government and the UN office.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, UNSCOM Start Technical Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction started technical talks on eliminating Iraq's
remaining chemical and biological weapons here today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency reported that the Iraqi side to the talks was
headed by an engineer in the army, General Amir al Saadi, also an
advisor to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The team of UNSCOM to the talks was headed by Nikita
Smidovitch, a Russian, who is in charge of the missile team,
according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Informed diplomatic sources said that some of the U.N. Security
Council permanent members' ambassadors took part in the talks, but
stopped short of giving any specific information about the role of
those diplomats during the talks.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM chief Richard Butler arrived in Baghdad Friday with a
high-level technical team of UNSCOM on his first visit to Iraq
since last month's crisis between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Iraq, he will hold talks with a number of
Iraqi officials on the development of relations between Iraq and
the commission. On Saturday he explained to about 50 diplomats
accredited to Iraq his mission in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, Butler expressed the hope that the
problem of access to the so-called presidential sites can be
settled through the talks, claiming he will show appropriate
respect to Iraq's legitimate concerns over national security,
sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has been refusing to grant access to U.N. weapon
inspectors to some sensitive sites, including presidential
palaces, which are considered by Iraq as a sign of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors' work in Iraq has lasted about three weeks
since they were allowed to return and resume work in Baghdad late
last month.
</P>
<P>
On October 29, Baghdad threatened to expel U.S. inspectors
working with the UNSCOM on charges of spying and hindering the
lifting of the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions against Iraq, setting
off the Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can
only be lifted when the weapons inspectors verify that Iraq is free
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Butler will leave Iraq Tuesday to report to the Security
Council on Thursday results of his talks with Iraqi officials.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Equities continued to drift
downwards dragging the indices sharply down on the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) during the week in the wake of heavy selling
pressure from operators as well as foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The continuing political uncertainty in the country was another
factor to keep the market under pressure with bulls preferring to
remain aloof.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the BSE Sensitive Index (Sensex) broke the
3319-support level to dip even below 3300-mark but later recovered
to close the week at 3329.27 points as against last weekend close
of 3469.08, netting a loss of 139.81 points.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index dropped by 53.51 points to end the week at
1450.87 from previous weekend close of 1504.38.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the Dollex were quoted substantially down to
close the week at 324.95 and 136.17 points respectively compared
with last weekend close of 337.79 and 145.51.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business improved moderately by 3.8554 billion

<HEADLINE> Returned Scholars Valuable Resource for Chinese Academy of Sciences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Over half of all research
fellows and professors working with China's top natural sciences
research body are scholars who have returned from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that, among all senior researchers in
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), 59 percent are returned
scholars. And 79 percent of the tutors for doctoral-degree seekers
are returned scholars, as well. Scholars returned from overseas
also hold over half of all leading positions in 100-odd institutes
under the CAS.
</P>
<P>
Among newly elected CAS academicians, 43-year-old CAS vice
president Bai Chunli is the youngest and he is also one of the
youngest among the 610 CAS academicians.
</P>
<P>
Bai worked for 10 years to rise to an academician from an
ordinary scholar after his return from abroad. Bai went to the
United States in the mid-1980s for a post-doctoral program on the
advanced technology of watching surface atom distribution. Bai
returned to the CAS to advance the study in the field after two
years in the United States.
</P>
<P>
CAS began sending researchers abroad for advanced training in
1978 when China started its reform and opening-up drive. More than
13,000 scientific researchers have gone to 40 countries and
regions for further training during the past decade. More than
8,000 of them have returned to the CAS.
</P>
<P>
The scholars have built a "bridge" between China and the
outside world, experts say. More than 95 percent of returned
scholars keep in touch with their overseas institutions. They have
pushed domestic scientific research into the international
frontier through various channels, including taking part in
international academic conferences, discoursing on academic
subjects and conducting international cooperation on scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, CAS returned scholars have begun study
on 184 new subjects and have undertaken more than 6,000 key
national or ministerial research programs since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Returned scholars are seen as a "talent reserve" for CAS as
nearly three-fourths of CAS senior researchers will retire in
three years.
</P>
<P>
CAS will unite and attract excellent scholars studying abroad
to work at the academy or to serve it in different ways, Bai
said.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China set an unequalled
record in Asian women's soccer history when it landed its sixth
consecutive title by beating the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea 2-0 in the final here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two impressive strikes from veteran striker Liu Ailing brought
yet another glory to an illustrious Chinese trophy cabinet and
earned herself the MVP Award of the Tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese side, five-time champions in a row and
beat its opponent 3-1 in the group competitions earlier, needed to
endure 48 minutes to crack the Korean resistence and put the ball
into the net.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans, mounting a brave blockade on a more physical
approach to the game, had the measure of the tournament's
most-feared attacking throughout the first half.
</P>
<P>
The home side opened the scoring three minutes after the break
when the 30-year-old Liu found herself in front of a deflected
ball and coolly slipped it home.
</P>
<P>
China sealed the victory 11 minutes later as Liu unleashed a
powerful dippping shot into the far corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the third-place play-off, Japan chalked up a 2-0 win
over Chinese Taipei and grabbed the last berth for FIFA's World
Women's Soccer Championship in the United States in 1999.

<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Macao's inflation rate during
the first 10 months of this year reached 3.7 percent, according to
the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that the average consumer consumption price index
(CCPI) between January and October this year went up 3.7 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The price index for the 12-month period ending October this
year rose 3.9 percent from the previous 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
In October, the CCPI jumped 2.7 percent from the same month
last year, mainly because of price hikes for transportation,
cigarettes, wines and services.
</P>
<P>
Macao has seen a sluggish economy for the third year running
this year. The inflation rate was 4.8 percent for the whole year
of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Canadian Educator on Hong Kong, China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's young people now
have a new opportunity to get to know the remarkable civilization
of China after Hong Kong returned to the motherland, said Ruth
Hayhoe, director of the Hong Kong Institute of Education.
</P>
<P>
Hayhoe, a Canadian, came to Hong Kong 30 years ago to visit her
cousin, who was a missionary here. As a girl of 21, Hayhoe just
wanted to see the world and thought she would stay in Hong Kong
for only a few months when she came in 1967.
</P>
<P>
"But it turned out that I have stayed here for 11 years and was
later drawn to China's mainland by its rich culture and history,"
said Hayhoe in an exclusive interview with Xinhua at her office on
the campus of the Hong Kong Institute of Education.
</P>
<P>
Now a well-known sinologist and a leading international
authority on comparative education, Hayhoe took up her
appointment as director of the institute in September this year,
nearly three months after Hong Kong returned to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong people should be proud that after more than one
hundred and fifty years of colonial rule Hong Kong has now become
part of China, which has such a rich cultural and historical
heritage," Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years when I lived in a Chinese family in Hong Kong
as a young teacher, I found myself unable to resist the attraction
of China's rich culture and history, and felt myself drawn to the
mainland," said Hayhoe at her office decorated with Chinese
paintings and calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
She started off in 1978 by teaching in Shanghai and later
working in Beijing, and over a period of 17 years, she spent time
making lengthy visits to each of the far-flung regions of the
country. She is advisory professor to seven universities in
different parts of China.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the third graduation ceremony of the Hong
Kong Institute of Education in November, Hayhoe told her students:
"I want to challenge each of you today to explore and learn from
China's rich cultural heritage which is yours, and which lies open
to you now in a new way."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that you will find a universe of meaning there
which will open your minds to many new areas of understanding,"
Hayhoe said, when delivering her speech to the students in
English, Cantonese and Putonghua (standard spoken Chinese).
</P>
<P>
Hayhoe said that she encouraged her students, not for the
political reason, but for the cultural and historical reason to
know Chinese mainland and to understand it is a very diverse and
very large country with different regions.

<HEADLINE> Explosion in Nigerian Capital Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- One security operative was
killed and another seriously injured in the first explosion in
the Nigeria capital of Abuja on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the two security officials were on
routine duty at the presidential wing of the capital's
international airport Saturday morning when their duty car
exploded while they were inside with their security equipment.
</P>
<P>
One of them died on the spot while the other was rushed to
hospital, said Alhaji Mustapha Ismail, police commissioner of the
federal capital territory, quoted by local press today.
</P>
<P>
Some unconfirmed reports also said that the country's number
two man, Chief of General Staff Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya
was at the airport when the explosion occurred at the
presidential wing's car park.
</P>
<P>
Diya was said to take control of the situation as he calmed
his 15-man entourage. None of them was injured.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which is under investigation, would be the first
time the capital witnessed an explosion since the nation
experienced its first such incident on May 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
It also brought the number of blasts which Nigeria has so far
recorded to 16 in about two and half years.
</P>
<P>
In most of the cases, the military and security agencies as
well as top government officials remained apparently the prime
targets.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Canadian Educator on Hong Kong, China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking Cantonese fluently, Hayhoe can communicate with
ordinary Hong Kong people. She said some of the Hong Kong people
have mixed feelings about the handover.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, they are proud that Hong Kong has ended its
history as a colony and become part of the motherland again. On
the other hand, people in Hong Kong don't know the mainland very
well.
</P>
<P>
The memory of the economic difficulties, the Cultural
Revolution and other political movements brought them some
hesitations, confusion and fears.
</P>
<P>
Five months after the handover, nothing has happened that is
negative and on the whole, the daily life of people is the same.
The handover was more smooth than people had expected, Hayhoe
said.
</P>
<P>
Many people who went abroad are returning to Hong Kong because
they are sure that they have more exciting life, they have more
opportunities here, she added.
</P>
<P>
"I hope gradually the people in Hong Kong will recognize the
cultural and spiritual wealth of China, the region, the culture
and the language," Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past the people in Hong Kong were largely restricted to
a small place with no national identity. I think Hong Kong people
now have a very interesting task to redevelop their identity," she
said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce showed that most employers felt strongly that Hong Kong
staff have little knowledge of China affairs.
</P>
<P>
They asked the education sectors to increase understanding of
China and the teaching of Chinese culture in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
"That's a challenge for my school to give the students more
information about the mainland and encourage them to visit the
mainland, to talk to people there and observe the mainland for
themselves," Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to enhance our exchange and collaboration with
universities and colleges of the mainland. In the near future, we
will have more teachers from the mainland and some of our teaching
staff are doing their doctorate research in the mainland," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Hayhoe has published many books and articles about the Chinese
culture and comparative education.
</P>
<P>
She said what impressed her deeply in the mainland is a spirit
of experimentation, a kind of daring to try out new things on a
large scale.
</P>
<P>
China's daring experimentation with market patterns in recent
years is an example of this spirit and it has resulted in rapid
and dynamic economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The policy of "one country, two systems" is another example of
this spirit and it is the best way to keep Hong Kong prosperous
and stable with a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Another thing impressed me deeply in the mainland is a kind of
cultural or spiritual health - a sense of dignity, a sense of
being masters in their own land, which enables people to be open
minded, confident and unthreatened, ready to receive guests with
great generosity and to enter into fruitful cooperation with
others," Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
"I think Hong Kong will have a very positive future because it
has demonstrated the economic and social vitality that can result
from an effective integration of aspects of Western and Chinese
civilization," Hayhoe said.

NEW DELHI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and member of the
Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), arrived here today on a nine-day goodwill visit to
India.
</P>
<P>
Wei, the senior most Chinese official to visit India this year,
came here at the invitation of Indian Vice President Krishna Kant.
</P>
<P>
The visit is mainly aimed at promoting the further development
of friendly relations between the two countries and the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Wei is scheduled to meet with President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan, Vice President Kant, Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral and leaders of major political parties of
India.
</P>
<P>
Wei's visit comes at a time when relations between the two
neighbors have gained positive momentum after the historic state
visit to India by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in November last
year.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's visit, leaders of the two countries decided to
establish a constructive and cooperative partnership oriented
towards the 21st century on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, to guide the Sino-Indian relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit to India pushed bilateral trade and economic
cooperation to a new high this year with trade volume between
India and China set to touch a record level of 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars from 1.4 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wei is being accompanied on his India visit by Dai Bingguo,
head of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> People's Courts Urged to Get Involved in Reforming Judicial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- People's courts at various
levels should be involved in judicial reform to improve China's
justice system, Ren Jianxing, president of the Supreme People's
Court, told a national conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Establishing a just, democratic and efficient system of justice
compatible with a socialist market-economy system is an essential
part of China's judicial reform, Ren told the conference attended
by presidents of higher people's courts.
</P>
<P>
China will set up a system of judges with its own
characteristics by following the requirements of judicial law and
by promoting the establishment and perfection of a modern judicial
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ren reaffirmed China's efforts to combat corruption and punish
those who commit such crimes. The judicial agencies will focus on
crimes related to corruption, bribery and embezzlement of public
funds, that occur in Party or government organizations, law
enforcement bodies, judicial agencies and financial
departments. County heads and above will be closely watched.
</P>
<P>
Ren said that people's courts should adjust economic relations
and promote a healthy development of the socialist market economy
according to law.
</P>
<P>
The courts should particularly safeguard the basic economic
system under which economies of various ownerships seek common
growth with public ownership as the principal ingredient.
</P>
<P>
Judicial agencies should also fairly and equally protect
property rights, support and protect reform of state-owned
enterprises, and serve the establishment of the modern enterprise
system.
</P>
<P>
The national conference, which opened here today, is scheduled
to last five days.

million U.S. dollars of former president Ferdinand Marcos'

GUANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Motor vehicles, which make a
lot of noise in downtown Guangzhou, will no longer be allowed to
honk their horns after this month, a sign that there may be a
reduction in noise pollution in this busy city, the capital of
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
This is one of several pollution control measures in the city
this year. Others include a series of environmental protection
regulations on the use of leaded gas.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection work here dates back to the mid 1970s,
when the main efforts were in controlling industrial waste
water. In the 1990s, pollution in the city has mainly come from
vehicle emissions and noise. In 1995, the city used about a
million tons of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The city has also increased water quality controls for the
Zhujiang River, a source of drinking water since 1995, and dykes
and grassland along the river have been improved, and garbage
removed from the surface.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has built two sewage plants that treat 330,000 tons
of waste water every day, and will build another by the year 2000,
bringing its treatment capacity to 1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city closed 155 small paper mills, dye factories,
and leather makers, reducing waste water by over 2 million tons
annually.
</P>
<P>
As a result of its industrial pollution controls, industrial
waste water decreased from 372 million tons in 1990 to 278 million
tons in 1996. There were similar decreases in industrial waste
gas, solid waste, and dust.
</P>
<P>
The city spent 1.5 billion yuan (1.68 billion US dollars) on
environmental protection in 1996.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sri Lankan Peace Process Sees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 saw more
military offensives, rebel counterattacks, bomb explosions and
demonstrations than progress in the peace process pursued by the
Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
Despite strenuous efforts made by the People's Alliance (PA)
government to push through its devolution package and bring peace
to the war-torn island nation, no major progress leading to peace
has been achieved as some major obstacles persist.
</P>
<P>
In politics, the PA and the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) in April agreed to adopt a bipartisan approach toward
the resolution of the ethnic conflict, which started 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the two main forces in Sri Lanka's political arena
remain divided when it comes to the devolution package, the core
of the government's peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, more autonomy will be granted to local
authorities in Eastern and Northern provinces, with a view to
ending the conflict between the majority Sinhalese people and the
minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling party has tried repeatedly to win the UNP
support for the package, the latter has turned a deaf ear to the
PA's calls and remained silent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, differences exist among the Sinhalese people
and even in the government itself regarding the peace package and
some government officials have expressed their reservations about
it.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the peace proposals have also met with strong
opposition from the Buddhist circles.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Report of the Sinhala Commission, a non-official
organization appointed by the National Joint Committee that groups
56 professional, religious and other associations, rekindled a
controversy in the country by saying the devolution proposals
would endanger the future of Buddhism and lead to a breakup of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from heavy media debate, a string of demonstrations were
held by Buddhist monks either supporting the package or opposing
it.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said it would be very difficult for the
government to push through the proposals if it cannot gain support
from Buddhist monks as Buddhism is influential in Sri Lanka's
social affairs and politics.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has
already rejected the devolution proposals.
</P>
<P>
On the military front, the security forces launched Operation
Jayasikuru (Certain Victory) on May 13 in a bid to open a land
route running to the north through rebel-held territories.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the beginning of the military thrust against the
LTTE, government troops have been pushing forward inch by inch in
the jungles amid strong rebel resistance and both sides have
suffered heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
The rebels mounted four counterattacks in seven months, in the
last of which they killed at least 150 troops and injured
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
The government strategy is to establish overwhelming military
dominance in the battlefield so as to bring the LTTE to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
No matter how much the LTTE has been weakened through the
years, it is by no means easy to be wiped out from the north and
east, where the Tamils make up almost two-thirds of the total
population with the Sinhalese accounting for only 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LTTE rebels proved that they are Sri Lanka's
biggest obstacle on the hard road to peace when they exploded
Colombo's business center in October and planted bombs in a key
power station in the capital one month later.
</P>
<P>
Police have said rebels who have sneaked into the capital are
seeking every chance to carry out more attacks on strategic
targets.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that Tiger bombers are everywhere. In
Batticaloa, Eastern province, two explosions took place this week,
killing seven people and injuring some 50. Last month, several
bombings hit Badulla in the central part of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
With Christmas and New Year approaching, the Colombo police
have beefed up security in the city to prevent any recurrence of
bomb explosions.
</P>
<P>
Every sign indicates that there would be no immediate
breakthrough in Sri Lanka's peace process in the near future as
the LTTE is far from ready to lay down arms.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the PA government will continue to take
the issue of peace process as one of its top priorities in 1998
and it will make every effort to convince its people, as well as
the opposition and the LTTE, that the devolution package is the
only way to end the bloody war in the country.

This is because drug smuggling and trading were rampant,

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh can be a high-risk
area and it is indeed an ideal place for an epidemic outbreak of
HIV, which causes AIDS, according to an AIDS expert in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, about 350,000 people have been screened
serologically for the HIV antibody in the country, Professor
Nazrul Islam, project director of the Bangladesh AIDS Prevention
and Control Program, was quoted today by The Daily Star as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The latest findings show 95 people have been identified with
AIDS and as many as 100,000 people may be carrying HIV
positively," he said. "But the figure could be much higher."
</P>
<P>
The professor drew attention to the high prevalence of sexually
transmitted diseases among those people who have high-risk
behavior, get transfusions of unscreened blood and use
unsterilized syringes, needles and sometimes surgical and dental
instruments.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that the country may have a large population
with HIV," he stated.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has rejected his South African counterpart Nelson Mandela's plea to
guarantee the safety of Zambia's former president Kenneth Kaunda,
according to today's Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted "highly placed" sources who confirmed the
discussion as saying that Mandela also requested Chiluba to
pardon Kaunda, also leader of Zambia's main opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP), for any offences he may have
committed before he returns home.
</P>
<P>
The sources revealed that Chiluba rejected Mandela's request
on the grounds that even as president, he could not interfere
with any police investigations.
</P>
<P>
The request was made during a "recent" telephone conversation
between the two leaders where other bilateral issues were also
discussed, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They added that the request was made against the backdrop of
the October 28 attempted coup and the ensuing proclaimation of a
state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
On 28 October, a group of army soldiers staged a coup to
overthrow the Chiluba administration. However, the short-lived
military coup was crushed four hours later and Chiluba declared a
state of emergency in the country the following day.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that some opposition leaders are involved in
the coup. And UNIP leader Kaunda has exiled himself abroad since
the coup attempt failed for fear of being arrested after his
return to Zambia.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Between 20 and 30
percent of expectant mothers die of abortion in Tanzania every
year, majority of them being adolescents who engage in early sex,
Sunday News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on safe motherhood initiative and
adolescent health which ended here on Saturday, Dr Victor
Ngonyani, acting Iringa Medical Officer, said young girls are at
a high risk of death because they are ignorant of pregnancy
preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Ngonyani appealed to the government to introduce sex education
in schools to save girls from unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
Other risks adolescent girls are facing include sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs), blockage of reproductive tubes and
physical deformation, said Dr Cletus Semiono at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Semiono, a senior gynaecologist at Tumbi hospital in the Coast
Region, said most of the girls under 20 are not physically
developed to carry pregnancies, and therefore, efforts should be
made to protect them.
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide survey conducted by medical
practitioners, maternal mortality rate among expectant mothers
are mainly caused by excessive bleeding, workload and rupture of
the uterus.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, participants appealed to pay more attention
to early registration of pregnancies, immunization, delivery by
trained personnel, and setting up of more medical facilities in
health centers, dispensaries and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The four-day workshop, organized by the Ministry of Health in
Collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
drew medical personnel from Mtwara, Morogoro, Iringa, Ruvuma and
Mbeya regions.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Prevention
of Corruption Bureau (PCB), in collaboration with other
institutions, has recovered 1.5 billion shillings (about 240
million US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Augustine Buluda, PCB Acting Director of Research, Training
and Public Education, told the Advanced Investigative Journalism
Association Workshop here over the weekend that most of the money
recovered was from tax evasion and bogus payments.
</P>
<P>
Buluda said PCB has cooperated with the Tanzania Revenue
Authority and the Controller and Auditor General.
</P>
<P>
However, Buluda admitted that corruption is rampant in most
government institutions despite government's strenuous efforts to
curb it, according to "The Guardian" today.
</P>
<P>
He said the Judiciary was on the top of the list of corrupt
institutions followed by the police force.

It is disappointing that some of the PCB staff were also
involved in corrupt practices, he said, disclosing that three men
had been imprisoned.

The workshop, which ended on Saturday, has recommended urgent
measures to be taken to institute legal reforms to enable
journalists to work smoothly.

As China is making a new effort to reform its poorly-operating
state enterprises, an increasing number of workers become
jobless. However, governments at all levels are also taking steps

<HEADLINE> City Ruins Provide Clue of Early Dynasty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- City ruins believed to date
back to the beginning of the Shang Dynasty (about 16th-11th
Century BC) have been found in Yanshi county in central China's
Henan province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists expect the finding to give clue to the
exact dating of the dynasty, which has long puzzled the experts.
</P>
<P>
China's chronological records so far found began from the year
841 BC during the Western Zhou Dynasty (about 11th Century to 771
BC). Dating of the earlier dynasties, Xia (about 21th-16th Century
BC) and Shang, remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found city ruins, however, shed a light on the issue,
says Wang Wei, director of the group on the study of Xia, Shang
and Zhou dynasties under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his colleagues found the city ruins within the remains
of a Shang capital in summer this year..
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the city was probably built right
after Tang overthrew the Xia Dynasty and set up the Shang Dynasty
because it was only six km away from the Erlitou site, the capital
of the late Xia Dynasty, and that the relics found in the city was
quite similar to those found at Erlitou.
</P>
<P>
Experts are also happy at finding Remains of charcoal and
animal bones in the city, which are usually used as dating samples.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the experts found that the ruins of imperial palaces
were located along the axis, which was probably the origin of
building imperial palaces at city axis.
</P>
<P>
Foundations of at least eight palaces were found at the site of
imperial palaces. The Number Two Palace, which is under
excavation, is measured 90 m by 13 m, the largest Shang palace
ever found.
</P>
<P>
Traces of reconstruction and densely-located pillar holes were
also found at the palace, suggesting a comparatively complicated
architectural structure at that time, the experts say.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Establishes Blood Bank for Leukemia Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has established the
country's first cord blood stem cell bank and more Chinese
patients both at home and abroad contracting with such diseases as
leukemia, lymphoma and Mediterranean anemia are expected to have
more chances to receive effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
The cord blood stem cell bank is located at People's Hospital
attached to Beijing Medical University which has Asia's largest
bone marrow transplant center.
</P>
<P>
Recent medical research has proved that cord blood can replace
bone marrow in treatment of serious bone marrow diseases.
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transport requires strict matching of bone marrow
types and the transport of cord cell grants patients more chances
for effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
In usual cases, only brothers and sisters of leukemia patients
can offer bone marrow for transplant.
</P>
<P>
Lu Daopei, head of the cord blood stem cell bank, said cord
blood is convenient for storage and use and a number of Western
countries have adopted cord blood transplant for several years.
</P>
<P>
He said cord blood is taken from placenta and umbilical cord of
women after childbirth. He said there will be no harm to either
new-borns or mothers.
</P>
<P>
Lu said his bank, jointly run by the hospital and a big Chinese
company, is expected to spend 100 million yuan (about 12 million
US dollars) on cord blood stem cell storage in the coming three
years.
</P>
<P>
He said at that time, his cord blood bank is expected to meet
the requirement of all the Chinese hospitals or overseas Chinese
patients who come to his cord blood bank to find the cord blood
types they want.
</P>
<P>
In China, the number of leukemia cases is added by around
40,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> "Super Rice" Strain Nearly Marure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agro-scientist Yuan
Longping, known as father of hybrid rice, announces today the
breeding of "super high yielding rice" is nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
Yuan told Xinhua in an exclusive interview that his group has
succeeded in cultivating the super high yielding rice with an
average per hectare output of 13.26 tons, which is much higher
than the quota of 12 tons per hectare set by the International
Rice Research Institute (IRRI).
</P>
<P>
The super rice with a mature period of 120 days was grown on
0.24 hectares in three different cities of east China's Jiangsu
Province earlier this year, according to Yuan.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do now is just to get more people involved in
the project and expand super rice growing area," said Yuan, who is
a 67-year-old academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
"If the growing area goes beyond a total 6.5 hectares, China
will be regarded as the first in the production of super high
yielding rice," He said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more scientists to participate in his project,
Yuan announced last month among his colleagues of the China
National Hybrid Rice R and D Center (CNHRC) in the capital city
Changsha, central China's Hunan Province, that scientists who are
able to grow over 0.07 hectares of super rice in two years will be
handsomely awarded.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, the first cultivating program for super high
yielding rice was initiated in Japan in 1980. Its aim was to
develop new varieties outyielding the old ones by 50 percent
within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the IRRI, which is funded by the Rockefeller and Ford
Foundations, started the "super rice" program which is also called
"new plant breeding program." The goal of this program is to
develop a super rice with a growth period of 120 days and a yield
of 12 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture also set up a super high
yielding program based on different periods of time, different
ecological conditions and cultivating seasons. And the program was
carried out by the CNHRC, headed by Yuan.
</P>
<P>
So far, a dozen scientists of the center have got involved in
the project, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Science and Technology Commission said
that once "super rice" produced by Yuan enters a stage of
application all over the country, it will become the key point to
promoting the pace of China's agricultural development in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Agriculture felt that Yuan's idea
of super high yielding rice will play an "orientation role" in
pushing up China's grain yield in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Former Defense Chief May Run in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa has indicated that he may continue to
pursue his presidential bid even after he was denied the
endorsement of President Fidel Ramos, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would soon bolt the ruling Lakas-NUCD party and run
for the presidency in next year's elections as Fidel Ramos did in
1991, de Villa said he was "not discounting anything."
</P>
<P>
President Ramos has anointed House of Representatives Speaker
Jose de Venecia as the ruling party's presidential candidate in
the 1998 polls, instead of de Villa as had been speculated.
</P>
<P>
Opposition stalwarts said de Villa may still push through with
his presidential plans, but it would be possible only with the
discreet support of the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
"The palace is not a monolithic bloc and there is a de Venecia
camp and a de Villa camp. The latter can encourage de Villa to
proceed," Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an opposition party, the PDP-Laban, Saturday
expressed willingness to open its door to de Villa who belittles
de Venecia's chances of winning in next year's elections.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Soars Among Thai Young People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- There has been an alarming
rise in the number of crimes committed by young people in
Thailand, according to a high-ranking judge.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months this year, there was a 29-percent
increase in crimes committed by young people, the Nation newspaper
reported today, quoting Deputy Chief Justice Wicha Mahakhun of the
Central Juvenile and Family Court.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-month period, there were 22,638 cases of juvenile
delinquency, only marginally short of last year's 12-month total
of 23,951.
</P>
<P>
Of the total criminal cases in the period, there were 6,614
cases of drug abuse, in which amphetamine was the most common,
followed by heroin.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, police detained 81 of about 300
revelers during a pre-dawn raid on a pub in East Bangkok. The 81
youngsters were tested positive for drug use.
</P>
<P>
The raid followed another one last month, during which 47
teenagers were arrested at a discotheque in a nearby province
outside Bangkok after their urine tested positive for drug use.
</P>
<P>
Following the two incidents, the Metropolitan Police Bureau has
set up a special task force to combat "drug parties" among
teenagers in Bangkok and peripheral areas and beefed up measures
to prevent the smuggling of drugs into the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Parties to Contest Northern Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Several Tamil parties in Sri
Lanka have decided to contest the local government elections in
the north next year as other Tamil parties and the main opposition
United National Party (UNP) are opposing the polls.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil United Liberation Front, which gained control of most
local bodies in the north in the last elections, has decided to
nominate Sarojini Yogeswaran as the mayoral candidate for Jaffna
Municipality, the newspaper The Sunday Observer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Eelam People's Democratic Party, the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front, the People's Liberation
Organization of Tamil Eelam and the Tamil Eelam Liberation
Organization have also decided to contest the polls.
</P>
<P>
But not all the Tamil parties are to participate in the
elections. The All Ceylon Tamil Congress has decided to stay away,
saying the polls are not going to gain anything constructive.
</P>
<P>
The Eelavar Democratic Front, formerly known as Eelam
Revolutionary Organization of Students, said the party has not yet
reached a decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNP has announced it is not going to contest the
polls.
</P>
<P>
Tamil parties which intend to contest the elections are in the
process of selecting candidates, who are likely to include a large
number of young people, a Tamil party spokesman was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, representatives of the parties are in Jaffna
organizing their campaigns, which they will launch following the
nomination of candidates from December 16 to 23.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Tamil parties submitted the names of their
polling agents to the commissioner of elections.
</P>
<P>
The local elections will be held for 17 local bodies in Jaffna
and Kilinochchi districts.

Intensive training courses are also a strong advantage of
Yucai. Intensive focuses range from mathematics, computer science
and foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
Yucai distributes students with fine quality into different
training classes according to their interest. Yucai tries to help
students forge a strong ability on a certain subject and then
transfer their strong points into learning other subjects.
</P>
<P>
Taking intensive training courses of foreign languages for
instance, students have native speakers teaching the foreign
language. And other subjects such as mathematics and physics are
also taught in foreign language.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dan, a graduate of the intensive training course of
Japanese language, became a pride of Yucai when she was enrolled
by Tokyo University of Engineering of Japan. She enjoys an annul
scholarship of one million yen (about 8,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
For students taking the intensive training course of English,
many of them can get as many as over 600 points in the TOEFL
during their first or second year of study in senior middle school.
</P>
<P>
The experiment of Yucai is paying off. Forty fine graduates
have been admitted by Beijing University and Qinghua University,
two of China's most prestigious universities, without being
required to take the entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
Yucai, now accommodating 1,600 students, has 180 staff
members. About 70 percent of the teachers were graduates of
Beijing Normal University and Northeast China Teachers'
University, two national key universities for normal education.
</P>
<P>
As a middle school, Yucai is one of the few in China which have
kept in touch with the outside world through Internet. The
multi-media teaching and learning system of Yucai has been
connected with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Yucai is now able to conduct cooperation and exchange
experience with 59 key middle schools throughout the country. It
also became sister schools with middle schools in countries
including Russia, the United States, the Republic of Korea,
Germany and Malaysia.

SHENYANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- In northeast China, if a
couple happens to have a baby with an IQ (intelligence quotient)
of more than 130, they could one day send the child to the
Northeast Yucai Middle School.
</P>
<P>
The Northeast Yucai (literally meaning "training talents" in
Chinese) Middle School, known as a "cradle for prodigies", has
seen all its 104 graduates with an average age of 15 becoming
college students over the past five years. And, 94 of them were
enrolled by key universities across China.
</P>
<P>
Yucai, established in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province,
in 1949 when New China was founded, began its experimental
education for students with high intelligence in 1986.
</P>
<P>
It has been approved as the country's first pilot school which
applies comprehensive education for talented students in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Yucai opens a special class section for talented students under
the age of 11. The students are expected to go through four years
of study, which normally requires six years for ordinary
students, and then succeed in entering university.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, it will save at least three years for such a
talented student to receive a doctor's degree. Usually a person
can obtain a doctoral degree at the age of 28 if he or she follows
China's current education procedure step by step.
</P>
<P>
Yucai is not only designed for those students with high
intelligence, but for students with normal IQ showing promising
potentials.
</P>
<P>
Yucai encourages students to be logical thinkers, quick
self-learners, and to get involved in field work. Thanks to the
teaching methods, students are able to learn more.
</P>
<P>
The students therefore have the initiative with or without
teachers' instruction in acquiring knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Parliament Meets on 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's Popular Power National
Assembly (parliament) Friday began its fourth legislature session
to work out the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by President Fidel Castro, came as the
country's economic recovery since 1994 slowed down after a 7.8
percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Power Economic Affairs Commission President Osvaldo
Martinez said despite all the odds, Cuba's GDP is expected to
maintain a growth of 2.5 percent this year and the budget deficit
was predicted to be no more than two percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
He said the island country's economy suffered this year as a
result of the United States' 1996 Helms-Burton Act and terrorism
against its infrastructure of tourism. Tourism is an important
hard currency earner of the country.
</P>
<P>
Other adversities were a low yield of cane sugar and declines
in the prices of sugar and nickel -- Cuba's two major export
products.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton, signed into law in March 1996, seeks to
punish foreign companies that invest in property confiscated from
Americans after the 1959 revolution in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Boat Schools Benefit Kids from Fishing Communities on Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Among hundreds of fishing
boats scattered on the Hongze Lake in East China's Jiangsu
Province, some large unique boats without any fishing equipment
are always floating around -- they are schools.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the boats are indispensable to the fishermen.
While they are fishing, fishermen like to stop for a while to
watch the unique boats.
</P>
<P>
The boats are floating primary schools specially for fishing
communities on the Hongze Lake covering 2,069 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Every morning, fishermen send their kids to the floating
schools and in the evening they bring them back home.
</P>
<P>
On an 80-ton wooden boat with a sign of the Erhe Village Boat
School of Sihong County, 80 pupils sitting in two brightly-lit
classrooms are listening to their teachers.
</P>
<P>
The boat equipped with two wind-power generators has a driving
cabin, two classrooms and an office for teachers.
</P>
<P>
"As the earliest floating school, the boat has been floated on
the lake for 31 years," said Yan Chengmi, headmaster of the school.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old headmaster has taught at floating schools for
31 years. While recalling his teaching career, he felt proud. "I
have taught about 1,000 pupils. Some of them have become college
graduates, government officials and teachers," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than a dozen floating schools with more than
1,000 pupils on the Hongze Lake, the fourth largest of its kind in
China.
</P>
<P>
The schools usually offer first two-year courses of a primary
school. When the kids are to begin their third year schooling,
they have to go to schools on land, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
The curriculums at the floating schools are the same as those
for schools on land and the pupils have to pass unified
examinations.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yong, an official for education at Linhuai Town of Sihong
County, said that the floating schools are not only beneficial to
fishermen, they have also contributed to the implementation of
China's Compulsory Education Law which stresses that all
youngsters have to finish nine-year schooling.
</P>
<P>
He said that floating schools set up in the 1950s have ensured
most of the kids from the floating fishing communities to enter
schools at age of seven.

<P>
HEFEI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Anhui province in east China has
sped up pollution control on the Chaohu lake, the major component
of the Haihe river system, one of the most seriously polluted
river in China.
</P>
<P>
A countdown clock has been erected in front of the Anhui paper
mill, reminding people of the approaching deadline set by the
Chinese government to make all enterprises along the Huaihe river
meet the waste discharging standards by December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The paper mill has spent 12 million yuan (about 1.5 million US
dollars) building a waste water treatment plant with a daily
capacity of 20,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
With a loan of 140 million US dollars from the Asian
Development Bank, Anhui province has sped up its pollution
treatment drive for the Chaohu lake near the province's capital
city of Hefei.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a group of treatment projects, including
four dealing with industrial polluting sources and two urban waste
water treatment facilities, has been underway.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the major part of a waste water treatment
plant near Hefei with a capacity of 150,000 tons per day has also
been completed.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of these projects, pollutants discharged
from the Hefei city, the major polluting source of the Chaohu
lake, are expected to be reduced by over 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Chinese Favor Early Education on Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A sampling survey shows that
about 80 persent of Chinese prefer to giving teenages an early
education on sex so that they could be aware of sex correctly at
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted in eight major Chinese cities
including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chengdu and Kunmin, has
aroused interest of participants to a recent international
symposium on intervention of HIV/AIDS in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Researchers believ that with the country's rapid social and
economic development and opening up to the outside world, Chinese
adolescents' sexual awareness is generally lagging behind their
sexual maturity. Therefore, there is a need for giving them an
early education on sex to help them build up a healthy awareness
of sex, and avoid sexual diseases and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Social Sciences
has run an experimental program to educate students at the age of
12 or less. They found that children who received an early
education on sex could tell what is right or wrong on sex behavior.
</P>
<P>
So far, Chinese education departments have launched campaigns
to give students education on sex in schools of higher education.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the earlier children receive an education on sex,
the better," said Xiao Yan, an official of HIV/AIDS control under
the Ministry of Health. In some parts in China, students have to
find jobs after nine-year compulsory schooling, and therefore,
they will easily be hit by sexual diseases and AIDS if they have
no such knowledge, she said.

BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's steady economic growth
lures more foreign insurance companies, but the sound development
of domestic insurance industry is a must for licensing foreign
firms, according to today's China Daily.

The newspaper quotes Yuan Guanhua, deputy division chief of the

It said that the country's national premium income is
remarkably low, constituting only one percent of the gross
domestic product. Therefore, a step-by-step approach will be
adopted for the opening up of China's insurance market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign insurers are asked to meet the following requirements
in order to gain an operating license in China, it said.
</P>
<P>
-- The foreign insurers should have a history of at least 30
years of writing insurance business.
</P>
<P>
-- The foreign insurers should have total assets of more than
five billion US dollars at the end of the year prior to
application.
</P>
<P>
-- The foreign insurers should have maintained a representative
office in China for over two years.
</P>
<P>
All these requirements are in line with international practice
and provide a preparatory period prior to business operations for
foreign firms, it said.

<HEADLINE> China's Gold Policy Faces Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China, which has long stressed
the value of gold as a fiscal reserve, will peg its purchasing
price for gold to the ever-changing global price.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise rampant smuggling and distorted expenses paid to
gold mines would cause significant losses to the State coffers," a
source with China's central bank, the People's Bank of China
(PBOC), was quoted as saying in today's Business Weekly of China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The pressure is building on China to adjust its gold purchasing
and selling prices yet again, after cutting them twice this year
as the central banks and trust investment companies of some
nations dumped gold on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC source declined to elaborate on whether China would
cut the gold purchasing price for the third time this year.
</P>
<P>
"China will by no means sell gold in large quantities on the
international market," the official said. All gold mined in China
is purchased by the central bank, which sells part of it to
jewellery plants and other factories.
</P>
<P>
The gold price tumbled below 300 US dollars per ounce on
November 27 as some central banks lost confidence in gold as a
support for their currencies. The price cuts have caused a loss of
750 million yuan (90 million US dollars) for China's gold mining
sector.
</P>
<P>
The whole industry has incurred a debt of over five billion
yuan (600 million US dollars) due to price falls, illicit
exploitation of gold by private firms, redundant workers and
scattered production structure.
</P>
<P>
Jewellery retail sector complained for not being allowed to set
prices for gold jewellery, although the plunging gold prices on
the marketplace have allowed them the margin to do that. The
retail prices of gold jewellery are strictly controlled by the
State authorities in China.
</P>
<P>
"It's inevitable that the jewellery market will be liberalized
someday in the future," said the PBOC official.

<HEADLINE> New Drug for Osteoperosis Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved a new drug Thursday, The Washington
Post reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, called Raloxifene and developed by Eli Lilly, is one
of a new class of "designer estrogens" that seems to mimic
estrogen's good effects on bones and the heart, but not the bad
effects.
</P>
<P>
Lilly said it fights hot flashes and other menopause symptoms
and protects bones as well as helping keep women's hearts healthy.
There are some studies suggesting it may even help prevent
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
However Raloxifene is not risk-free. It increases chances of
serious blood clots by about the same amount as birth control
pills, Warned The Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
Lilly will sell the drug under the brand name Evista by
early January.

</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, assistant foreign minister Chen Jian,
who is also accompanying Jiang and has already arrived in
Malaysia, told Xinhua that to hold these summits on the occasion
of the 30th anniversary of the founding of ASEAN is a major
initiative in east Asia's history, as well as a great event in
China-ASEAN history.
</P>
<P>
They will have far-reaching impact on east Asian development in
the next century and on the progress of the friendly relations
between China and the ASEAN, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side hopes these meetings would help east Asia
forge an open cooperative format of balanced development,
complementarity and non-exclusiveness, in line with the principles
of mutual respect and benefit, equal participation, and common
development," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
He held the conviction that the summits would "determine the
goals of China and the ASEAN for establishment of the
21st-century-oriented good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust,
and serve to bring China-ASEAN friendly cooperative relations onto
a new and higher level".
</P>
<P>
Local observers note that the upcoming meeting between ASEAN
and China, Japan and ROK, and that between ASEAN and China are the
first summits between East Asian countries and ASEAN, and between
China and ASEAN in history.
</P>
<P>
The summit "reflects the rise of East Asia and its
international status" after the Cold War, sources claim.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that during these meetings, leaders of ASEAN
countries, China, Japan and ROC will exchange views on the
prospects of development and regional cooperation in East Asia in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Besides, President Jiang will have an extensive exchange of
views with leaders of ASEAN countries on bilateral relations, and
after the meeting will issue a joint statement on the
establishment of the 21st-century-oriented good-neighborly and
mutual trust partnership, which is expected to bring the
China-ASEAN relationship into a new phase of development.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Private businesses in Xinghua,
east China's Jiangsu Province, began to shift their priority to
helping industrialize local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Of the city's 4,800 private enterprises, more than 2,000 are
processing farm produce and by-products, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
In Dangzhu Township, Wang Yixue and three other farmers have
started a vegetable dehydrating factory, and they export all their
products to the Republic of Korea. Local farmers grow 200 ha of
garlic to feed the factory, and they collect 60,000 yuan of income
on per hectare, three times that in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development of private businesses in the city has greatly
promoted local agricultural industrialization, and farmers in turn
plant more than 1,300 ha of economic crops in this effort.
</P>
<P>
Some private firms have also imported new varieties of crops
from Japan and Taiwan that sell well on the international
market. This year, the city's private sector is expected to export
100 million yuan worth of farm produce and by-products.

<HEADLINE> Hybrid Rice Technology Ready For Large-scale Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China will expand the
application of hybrid rice technology on some 3.3 million ha of
farmland at the end of the century to increase grain output by 2.5
billion kg a year.
</P>
<P>
"The two-line hybrid rice technique will be a major contributor
to the central government's target of increasing 50 billion kg of
grain a year by the end of the century," said Lu Xinggui, head of
the Hybrid Rice Engineering Technique Research Center of Hubei
Province, one of China's major rice producers.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, the invention of the three-line hybrid rice
brought a new green revolution to China's rice production . And
hybrid rice varieties have been grown on more than 13 million ha,
accounting for 40 percent of the country's total rice acreage.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the photoperiod-sensitive genic mala-sterile
rice resource in Hubei in 1973 made it possible to develop the
three-line hybrid rice into the two-line rice.
</P>
<P>
By now China has developed eight two-line hybrid rice
varieties, and their cultivation proved that they could raise
per-ha grain output by more than 750 kg, or 10 percent, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Early success has also been made in the mid-term trial
development of the two-line hybrid rice, and a trial base has been
set up for this effort in Maoming city of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
China planted more than 4,000 ha of two-line hybrid rice for
seeds this year, and expects to expand the varieties to some
400,000 ha next year, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese experts aim to develop some high-quality hybrid
rice varieties by the end of this century that can increase
per-unit output by 15 percent.

</P>
<P>
All workers are required to take special examinations designed
to test their technical expertise within two years, it says.
</P>
<P>
There are so far about 2.05 million workers engaged in vehicle
repair, which generates a business volume of 28.2 billion yuan

ROME, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian milk farmers protesting
European Union (EU) fines over failures to comply with quotas for
milk production continued their tractor caravan named "March on
Rome" on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-tractor caravan, launched by the Modena branch of the
grass-roots milk farmers' organization Cobas, is expected to reach
Rome, capital of Italy, on Monday.
</P>

travelled peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Italian President Oscar Scalfaro has described
the protest as illegal.
</P>

Early this month, protesting dairy farmers blocked railway
lines and sprayed police with silage and manure in northern Italy
in a bid to force the Italian government to return 100 percent of
past fines.

<HEADLINE> 2.3 Million Poor Farmers Escape Poverty in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 2.3 million poor
farmers in north China's Shanxi Province have shaken off poverty
in the past decade, thanks to the implementation of a nationwide
anti-poverty strategy.
</P>
<P>
The province, located on the Loess Plateau with adverse natural
conditions, had some 4.5 million poor people, mainly in 50
counties of the Taihang and Luliang mountains, when the poverty
relief program began in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Decade-long efforts, together with more than two billion yuan
of funding by the central and local governments, the number has
been reduced to 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Those farmers who now have sufficient food and clothing now
enjoy a per capita income of 950 yuan and 437 kg of grain. And 29
of the poor counties have basically met the poverty relief targets.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the province raised over a billion yuan to
improve rural infrastructure. It completed projects to provide
drinking water for a million people, build roads for every
township, enable 97 percent of the villages to have electricity
and 45 percent to have telephones. The province also helped build
a large number of rural hospitals and schools to end the history
of cave classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the poor areas increase nearly 40,000 ha of basic
farmland and plant some 30,000 ha of economic forests. The nine
counties of the mountainous Luliang area along the Yellow River
have grown more than 130,000 ha of jujube trees and produced 200
million kg of dried jujube last year. As a result, tens of
thousands of farmers have got rich.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Improve Power Supply Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has started the
building of 25 electric power substations and 30 transmission
lines, in a bid to ease its power supply tension and guarantee
stable power supply in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the North China Electric Power
Group, contractor of the project, the whole project is expected to
be completed by the end of 2000 with an investment of 7.8 billion
yuan (939 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said by the end of 2000, the improved power supply network
can fully guarantee power consumption of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The official said the transformer stations include nine
stations of 220 kilowatt and 16 stations of 110 kilowatt.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes improvement of some high-tension and
low-tension lines and upgrading of the electric power distribution
systems of the city's big power consuming units.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been in short power supply. Though there has been
almost no power cuts in urban residential areas since 1995, the
city has been encountering an constant increase in
electricity-consumption.
</P>
<P>
The urban city network building project is one of six major
infrastructure projects in Beijing.

and livestock associations of the four Mercosur countries held
a meeting to discuss, among other themes, the common external

livestock sector.

The CET 3-percent increase was decided by the Mercosur economy
ministers last November, at the request of Brazil.

agriculture and livestock sector and can damage seriously the
exports of his country.

common external tariff (CET) if its partners do not grant it
compensations.

Sosa said at a press conference on December 11 that if
the bloc partners rejected the concessions Uruguay requested, the
authorities of this country would make use of their right to veto
to prevent this increase to go in force.
</P>
<P>
Sosa warned that Paraguay will not admit CET increases, at
least in the fuels, raw materials and other necessities for the
productive sector and the industrial activity.

achieved by the two blocs in the negotiations to create a
unified commercial zone, it must continue the talks.

approach, a partial deregulation agreement, "because that is the
desire of the presidents of the Community.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Crackdown on Medicare Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday urged Congress to pass legislation preventing doctors
from charging more for drugs than they pay themselves.
</P>
<P>
Fraud of Medicare -- the federal medical insurance program
covering millions of elderly and disabled -- costs billions of
dollars each year and undermines the nation's ability to care for
those most in need, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers deserve to expect that every cent of hard-earned
money is spent on quality medical care for deserving patients," he
said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that clamping down on drug overcharges would save
700 million dollars over five years. He said that a recent report
by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human
Services found that what Medicare pays for drugs "bears little or
no resemblance to actual wholesale prices that are available to
physicians and suppliers that bill for these drugs."
</P>
<P>
"These overpayments occur because Medicare reimburses doctors
according to the published average wholesale price, the so-called
`sticker price,' for drugs," Clinton said. "Few doctors, however,
actually pay the full sticker price."
</P>
<P>
"For more than one-third of these drugs, Medicare paid more
than double the actual wholesale prices, and in some cases pays as
high as ten times the amount," the White House said in a fact
sheet.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the proposal, to be included in his budget for the
1999 fiscal year, will "ensure that doctors are reimbursed no more
and no less than the price they themselves pay for the medicines
they give Medicare patients."
</P>
<P>
The president said his proposal is just one of a series of
actions he has taken to curb waste, fraud and abuse in the
Medicare system.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein on Jordan's Relations with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein said
today that his country would not make bargains with Iraq on the
rights of the Jordanians even if Iraq cut off all its oil supply
to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The king severely criticized the Iraqi regime and condemned
the execution of the four Jordanians by Iraq on Monday while
delivering a speech to the members of parliament at the Royal
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Jordan suffered many times from total cut of oil supply, but
it succeeded in overcoming oil shortage all the time, the king
said. Iraq has been Jordan's sole oil provider for years.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also criticized the Iraqi government's policy on its
own people, saying the regime was built on a "mountain of human
skulls." He hoped that normal life could be restored to the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The four Jordanians were sentenced to death by Iraq Monday on
charge of smuggling car spare parts which are in short supply in
Iraq due to the U.N.-imposed sanctions for its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expelled seven Iraqi diplomats Wednesday and recalled
its Charge D'Affairs in Baghdad Adel Sweidan back home for
consultation in retaliation for the Iraqi harsh punishment on the
Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
Gulf crisis. But after that, the bilateral ties suffered a
setback as Jordan was eager to distance itself away from Iraq to
end international alienation.
</P>
<P>
However, the ties have been picking up in recent years as Iraq
began to provide the kingdom with more oil at discount prices and
kept increasing the volume of imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq provided Jordan with oil worth 625 million U.S. dollars
this year, a 7 percent increase over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes Butler's Discussion with Iraq to Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed his hope that the discussions between
Richard Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and
the Iraqi authorities would make progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after he was awarded an
honorary Doctor degree of Kuwait University, Annan said "I hope
Butler will not fail, Butler has gone to Iraq to discuss with
them practical ways of moving the disarmament process forward."
</P>
<P>
Annan added that "our objective is to get the job done, our
objective is to keep the inspectors on the ground and to
continue our disarmament of Iraq to ensure that it is no longer
a threat to its neighbors or to the countries in this region."
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has refused to let the UNSCOM, which is in charge
of eradicating Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, check the
presidential palaces on grounds that the practice violates the
sovereignty of the country, but the UNSCOM insisted to inspect
the palaces where they suspect the banned materials were hidden.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the UNSCOM, arrived in Iraq Friday to hold
talks with the Iraqi government on the relations between his
commission and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Friday at the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission
headquarters at the border area that "UNSCOM did not ask to
visit all places in Iraq, but only specific ones."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "I think we have been quite consistent
in our determination to get the Iraqi authorities and President
Saddam Hussein to comply (with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions), and I think the past weeks have demonstrated that
the international community's pressure and determination will be
maintained."
