<HEADLINE> 2ndlead: Death Toll Rises to 32 in Philippine Bus  Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Two bombs believed to have been
planted by terrorists exploded Friday afternoon in a passenger
ferry boat docked in a seaport in the southern Philippines,
killing 32 people and seriously wounding 38 others, the Coast
Guard said.
</P>
<P>
Celso de Torres of the Philippine Coast Guard told Xinhua that
the blast ripped through two passenger buses aboard the 201.85-ton
M/V Mediatrix which sank after being totally razed down by the
consequent fire.
</P>
<P>
De Torres said the Mediatrix, a local barge-type ferry boat,
had just arrived at Ozamis City port from Kolambugan city, Del
Norte province when the incendiary bombs tucked inside the two
buses went off at about 4:00 p.m. (local time)
</P>
<P>
He said rescue divers were scouring the water for more
passengers trapped inside the sea vessel. Most of the survivors
who jumped into the sea were rushed to different hospitals for
treatment of burns.
</P>
<P>
De Torres said the search and rescue operation is still going
on, adding that the total number of passengers aboard and the
number of missing passengers had not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
He said the death toll was expected to rise further.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the rebel New People's Army or the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front could have been behind
the incident.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Railway Freight Rates to Rise in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- In a soft railway budget for
2000-01, the Indian government Friday proposed a modest five
percent increase in the freight rates of all commodities except
essential items and a seven percent hike in parcel and luggage
rates to mop up six billion rupees (approximately 139 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, in an bid to reverse its falling share in the goods
and passenger traffic, the coalition government promised to
improve railway service and spared from any fare hike its
passengers of over four billion annually.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget in parliament, Railway Minister Mamata
Banerjee proposed measures to raise additional resources for an
outlay of 111 billion rupees (2.58 billion dollars), an increase
of nine percent over the revised estimates of 89.65 billion rupees
(2.09 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The freight traffic target had been fixed slightly higher at
475 million tons while growth in passenger traffic had been
projected at five percent. Following the onslaught from the road
sector, the minister announced a multi-pronged new freight policy
which she said would help railways raise its market share.
</P>
<P>
She also announced increased investments in new lines, and
steps to take advantage of the information technology in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The essential commodities spared from the freight increases are
foodgrains, sugar, edible salt and oils, kerosene, liquid
petroleum gas, urea, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Mamata told parliament that the impact of the freight hike
would be negligible on inflation and would not discourage higher
industrial growth as the hike in core sector items like industrial
coal, iron and steel, cement, limestone and certain petroleum
products had been kept below five percent.
</P>
<P>
Exempting newspaper, magazines and medicines from the freight
increase in her budget proposal, Mamata also announced concessions
by extending free travel facility to students.
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition party Congress attacked the budget as "
imbalanced" in terms of regional development, saying that the
freight increases would lead to inflation.
</P>
<P>
Senior Congress leader Madhavrao Scindia, a former railway
minister, told the media that there was no indication in the
budget as to how the financial condition of the railway was going
to be improved.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grew by 6.9 Percent in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy, propelled
by hardy consumer spending, increased by 6.9 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1999, the strongest momentum in more than three years,
the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was much higher than the estimated 5.8 percent and
matched a 6.9 percent growth spurt posted in the second quarter of
1996.
</P>
<P>
This also means the economy grew by 150.3 billion dollars in
the fourth quarter of 1999, pushing the country's total output of
goods and services to 9.05 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the whole 1999, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased
4.1 percent, higher than the government's previous estimate of 4
percent, but lower than the 4.3 percent recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has bumped up interest rate four times
since June to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
Many economists expect that the central bank will boost rates
again on March 21 because the economy continues to grow faster
than the organization's preferred speed limit in the 3 percent
range, which is believed to be the growth rate that can be
sustained without sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors contributed to the fourth-quarter's
performance: robust consumer and government spending, a strong
buildup in inventories held by businesses, and that the swelling U.
S. trade deficit continued to subtract from it.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Create Its First Sperm Bank This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A sperm bank will be
established at Shanghai's Renji Hospital this year, a doctor at
the hospital revealed today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first sperm bank in Shanghai, China's largest
commercial center, according to Dr. Wu Yulun.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the bank are in full swing and it is expected
to start functioning within this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will be responsible for all sperm donations and
artificial inseminations in the city, and is expected to help end
non-standard artificial insemination practices.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that one out of every ten young Shanghai
couples are infertile, and at least 30 percent of these are
capable of having children through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wu said his hospital has seen several thousand infertile
couples in recent years, but performed only about 100 artificial
inseminations due to a limited amount of sperm.
</P>
<P>
Since Shanghai Renji Hospital opened a sperm website in
December 1998, it has received applications from more than 200
volunteer donors, most of them college graduates.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts here note that the artificial insemination
market in China is not standardized because the government has not
yet adopted a law on the practice.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Deming, president of Shanghai Renji Hospital, said he will
deliver a petition in this regard to the upcoming session of the
National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Party Building and Productivity (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang compared China's current situation with that a century
ago, saying that better political and social conditions provide
golden opportunities for the developments of China's high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
China now is fully capable of catching up with the world's
advanced level in the high-tech sector, and in social and economic
developments in general, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that in doing so the relatively developed eastern
region of the country may achieve modernization earlier, and this
will enable it to make contributions to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that in the 21st century China's economic
development must rely mainly on scientific innovation and
institutional restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, our task to further the reform and opening-up,
as well as the modernization process, will be even more difficult,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked related departments to restructure the economy through
scientific and technological progress, and establish and improve a
whole array of systems and mechanisms for the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current national campaign to develop western
China, Jiang said this is a strategic decision made by the CPC
Central Committee to promote China's development in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
He then urged the east to give more financial, technological,
expertise and management assistance to the west.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the west will also bring new market
opportunities to the east," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that along with economic development, greatly
enhancing ethical and cultural progress is another urgent and
important task for the entire Party.
</P>
<P>
He asked all officials and Party members to maintain the spirit
of austerity and hard work, and make every effort to prevent all
corruption and crime.

<P>
He added that it was the Party's wise leadership and the
socialist system,along with the correct guidelines given by the
late leader Deng Xiaoping, that guaranteed such achievements.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday afternoon Jiang presided over a meeting on Party
building in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, and pointed
out that more than 70 years of the CPC history had demonstrated
that the only way to win people's support is to spare no effort in
the struggle to benefit both the country and the people.
</P>
<P>
"All our efforts are to liberate and develop social
productivity," Jiang said. "So all our decisions, policies, and
guidelines should be made to strengthen our economy and promote
social developments."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that all Party members should remember in their
hearts that the CPC is always the representative of advanced
social productivity,correct cultural and social trends, and the
benefit of the majority of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that a qualified Party member should serve the people
heart and soul, and never act against the will and benefit of the
masses.
</P>
<P>
As a Party with more than 60 million members, the CPC should
now give top priority to improving its building so that it meets
the demands of the new circumstances, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also showed that he pays great attention to economic
restructuring and the development of high and new technology
industries during his inspection tour.

GUANGZHOU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin has been making an inspection tour for Party building and
high-tech development in south China's economic powerhouse
Guangdong Province in the past five days.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chairman of the Central

improvement of Party building should be given top priority.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as the CPC continues to represent the
correct social trends and benefits the majority, it will be
supported by all the people of China and will be never defeated.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, one of China's special economic zones set up 20
years ago, Jiang showed his satisfaction with the huge social and
economic progress made there during the past two decades under the
reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhen's story illustrates the superiority of socialism and
the party's leadership, and facts have shown that our reform and
opening-up policy are successful and completely correct," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made great achievements, and it is necessary to let
the people, especially those in relatively developed regions, know
how these achievements were made," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Pipeline Vandalization in Nigeria Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) recorded 497 cases of oil pipeline
vandalization last year, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted NNPC manager Jackson Gaius-Obaseki as saying
in Nigeria's eastern Ondo State on Friday that the wanton
destruction is a major cause of scarcity of petroleum in the
oil-rich west African country.
</P>
<P>
"Vandalization of NNPC pipelines across the country by men of
the underworld has made the efforts of the corporation at ensuring
regular supply of fuel abortive," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the federal government is making efforts
to combat the menace.
</P>
<P>
According to a NAN report on Thursday, the Nigerian government
Wednesday ordered oil pipeline vandals be henceforth "shot on
sight".
</P>
<P>
Vandalization has become NNPC's biggest problem. For any line
vandalized, it would cost the company between 1.2 million to 1.6
million naira (12,000 to 16,000 U.S. dollars).

RIYADH, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Petroleum and
Mineral Resources Ali Bin Ibrahim al-N'aimi Saturday discussed with
visiting U.S Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson situation in the
world oil market and oil-related bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two ministers stressed the need to
stabilize the world oil market, which has seen a nine-year high oil
prices of 29 dollars per barrel, Saudi News Agency reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The buoyant oil prices have drawn concerns from oil consuming
states, especially the United States. They hope the oil producing
states can raise their output to bring down the prices.
</P>
<P>
But the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
which provides the world's 13 percent of supply and has adopted a
year-long slash of oil production last March to prop up the sagging
oil prices, have shown no signs of increasing output.
</P>
<P>
Richardson's visit to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, two major members
of the OPEC came apparently to express their concern over the high-
flying oil prices before OPEC oil ministers meets in Vienna March
27 to draw up their future policy.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Extend Emergency Rule in Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Security Council
(MGK) of Turkey has decided to extend the emergency rule
for another four months in southeast, the Anatolia News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The emergency rule, which were imposed in 1980s in
turmoil-plagued eastern and southeastern regions, has been in place
in Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Sirnak, Tunceli and Van
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was made following a MGK meeting on
Friday to review illegal fundamentalist and separatist activities
in the regions, will be submitted to the cabinet for approval.
</P>
<P>
A written statement, issued by the MGK General Secretariat, said
that "the measures that were taken in these regions in economic,
educational, health and psycho-social fields were reviewed. The MGK
appreciated the success of the security forces in the recent
operations against Hezbollah."
</P>
<P>
In southeastern regions, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK) has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state.
</P>
<P>
The radical Islamic terrorist Hezbollah, which Ankara
accused of having committed kidnappings, murders and blackmails and

launched nationwide crackdown against, is also active in the
regions.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, which used to mainly target PKK and its sympathizers,
and turned to violent kidnappings against local businessmen in
recent years, has also been seeking to turn secular but
overwhelmingly
Muslim Turkey into a strict Islamic-ruled regime by violence and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The MGK said, following reviewing the developments in the
regions, that they "find appropriate the extension of the term of
emergency rule for another four months to be valid as from March
30,
2000."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that tension in the regions was growing following
three pro-Kurdish mayors were detained a week ago on charges of
colluding with PKK.
</P>
<P>
It was thought that peace and reconciliation will emerge in the
regions after PKK's leader Abdullah Ocalan was imprisoned and
called for PKK to denounce armed struggle.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes EU Interest in Expansion of Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday welcomed the
recent statement by the European Union (EU) on its interest in
promoting relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Terming the statement as a sign of the EU's "realistic attitude"
towards Iran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
said that Iran's foreign policy is based on the principles of
detente, confidence-building and contribution.
</P>
<P>
The policy will continue in future, he said, expansion of
relations based on mutual respect with all countries, including
European countries, is among Iran's policies, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with developments in relations between
Iran and the EU over the past months, saying that strengthening
cooperation between the two sides is in line with mutual interests
and regional stability, security and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tehran began to address European concerns over its stiff
opposition to the Middle East peace process, its ambitious pursuit
of nuclear capability, its human rights status and its alleged
support for what the West branded as "international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came only after Tehran assured that it was
against terrorism, and the spread of nuclear arms and weapons of
mass destruction, and that it did not seek to sabotage the peace
process despite its opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
While Washington continued brandishing its favorite "dual
containment" stick against Iran and Iraq, the Europeans embarked on
a "critical dialogue" to ease tension with Tehran, despite twists
and turns. Their efforts intensified in 1999 and will continue in
the new century, said analysts here.

<HEADLINE> Italy Explains Kosovo Policy Responding General's Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian troops in the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo "must not feel alone because the
government and the parliament back their precious work" in the
troubled province, said Italian Foreign Undersecretary Umberto
Ranieri in response to accusations that Italy has abandoned these
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera
", Ranieri also pointed out that the Italian contingent of some 4,
000 troops in the Kfor mission is there "for peacekeeping, not to
facilitate Italian economic penetration".
</P>
<P>
Friday, Major General Silvio Mazzaroli, the deputy Kfor
commander, was quoted as saying the Italians in Kosovo are left on
their own while the other contingents have the backing of their
countries and these countries "have a real foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Ranieri said in response that the Italian soldiers in the force
of some 37,000 troops are there "to contribute to the enactment of
United Nations Resolution 1244: to pacify a region torn by ethnic
war and guarantee a free Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Their purpose, he continued, is not to bring economic benefits
from the military operations, "Italy's economic penetration" in
Kosovo will come, "as happened in Romania and Bulgaria, where the
presence of our enterprise is greater than that of the other
European Union countries."
</P>
<P>
But these moves are different matters entirely, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the general's statement that Italian troops will to be kept
in Kosovo for a long time yet, Ranieri said they will probably
stay "a few years," for as long as the other military contingents
in the Kfor remain in the province.

<HEADLINE> Russian Think Tank Urges "Selective Engagement" Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's non-governmental
Council for Foreign and Defense Policy on Saturday called for a
concept "of selective involvement" in the country's foreign
strategy.
</P>
<P>
The council, whose members met Saturday in Moscow, said that
Russia must "firmly defend a small set of its vitally important
interests," but it should give up "chasing the 'great power'
phantom."
</P>
<P>
The Council for Foreign and Defense Policy is a public
organization, which draws up recommendations in domestic and
foreign policy and presents them to the Russian leadership.
</P>
<P>
In a document entitled "Sketch of Russia's Foreign Policy
Strategy," the council said Russia must "do its best to avoid
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly applicable toward the countries and
regions exerting an impact on (Russia's) economic development,"
the Interfax news agency quoted the document as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Tough rhetoric" should be abandoned, it said, adding that
Russia's foreign policy should focus on "seeking benefits for the
country primarily in its economy."
</P>
<P>
"It must not merely retaliate to challenges and threats in the
sphere of traditional security," the document said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Daily Criticizes Jospin For Rapping Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Syrian government
Chishreen daily has criticized French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
for his anti-Hezbollah remarks.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, who is on a tour to Israel and Palestinian territories,
Thursday in Israel termed anti-Israeli Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas as "terrorists" and their resistance movement against
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon as "terrorist movement."
</P>
<P>
Jospin's remark has aroused a storm of criticism among the Arab
states. He was stoned in the West Bank city of Ramallah Saturday by
Palestinian university students.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper demanded in its editorial of Paris to redress the
balance specially as the whole Arab countries were looking forward
to an effective and fair French role in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's remarks were especially serious as Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy has threatened to burn Lebanon if Hezbollah
failed to stop attacking Israeli soldiers and Israel's north areas,
the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
The French premier's statement went against the French policy as
announced by President Jacques Chirac, the daily stressed,
cautioning that such remarks were not in favour of the Arab-French
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
summoned French Ambassador in Beirut Philippe Le Courtier and told
him of Lebanon's discontent with Jospin's pro-Israeli remarks.
</P>
<P>
Syrian- and Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
recently increased its attacks on Israeli occupation troops. In
retaliation, Israel early this month bombed three Lebanese power
stations and other civilian facilities, in which 20 Lebanese
civilians were injured.
</P>
<P>
Israel's air raids on Lebanese civilian targets have unleashed
wide criticism from the Arab world and the mounting tense situation
in south Lebanon also cast shadow over the future of the already
stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes France for Stand Against Lebanese Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi on Saturday criticized the stand taken
by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin who described the Lebanese
resistance movement against Israel as "terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"At a time when Lebanese civilians are under heavy air raids and
ground aggressions by the Zionist regime, the French prime minister
has taken an illogical stand by describing the resistance to the
Zionist aggressions as terrorist actions," Asefi was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said France, as a member of the April Monitoring Group, was
expected to condemn the "state terrorism" of Israel, work to bring
to an end the aggression on Lebanon and support the deterrent force
of Lebanon to defend their territory and confront the aggressions.
</P>
<P>
The April Monitoring Group, which groups representatives from
the U.S., France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was formed in April
1996 to monitor a cease-fire deal between Israel and Lebanon's
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran expects the French government to
understand the realities and help restore the rights of the
Lebanese through an immediate withdrawal of the Zionist occupation
force from Lebanon," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which is occupying party of south Lebanon, made a series
of air strikes on Lebanese targets, including civilian facilities,
earlier this month in retaliation for attacks mounted by Lebanese
Hezbollah guerillas.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not recognize Israel and calls for armed struggle
against the Jewish state to force it to return occupied Arab lands.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Maintain Policy of Detente: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said on Saturday that Iran will stick to the foreign policy
of detente to develop relations with all other countries.
</P>
<P>
The policy of detente can lead the international community to
peace and welfare and it is the strategic policy of the Islamic
Republic of Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted
Khatami as telling a group of Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president, who is also chairman of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference, called for solidarity among Islamic
states, saying that Iran has numerous common grounds with other
Islamic states and is keen on unity among Muslim nation, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his opposition to presence of external powers
in different parts of the world, which "heightens tension between
the regional states."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran is interested in fostering better
relations with both developing and industrial countries on the
basis of mutual respect and equality, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has taken good steps to reinforce detente in its
foreign policy which should continue and enter the phase of
confidence-building and then bring about permanent regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's 6th parliament elections, which were held on February
18 and resulted in an overwhelming victory of reformists, Khatami
said the elections were the continuity of the movement of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The reform-minded president said the large turnout in the
elections indicated the political maturity of the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
"It indicated that the Iranian nation is willing to apply the
democratic methods to materialize its goals, attain its legitimate
rights and make scientific, economic, and technological progress,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that reform exists within the Islamic revolution,
because it is a dynamic movement with great expectations that
should come true.
</P>
<P>
Reform is a movement to secure the aspirations of the Islamic
revolution and to improve the methods to speed up social progress
in Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that reform does not mean putting aside the
principles of the Islamic revolution, but it means that to what
extent the Iranian nation abides by the constitution of the Islamic
republic and its democratic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"The world should honor the grandeur and independence of the
Iranian nation in order to see an appropriate reaction from Iran,"
President Khatami stressed.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Cause Heart of Mideast Peace Process : French PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin stressed on Saturday that the Palestinian Issue is
the heart of the Middle East Process.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, at a news conference with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza, said "it is our desire to see the
peace process resumed specially on the Palestinian track because it
is the heart of this process and even controls it."
</P>
<P>
He said he was visiting the Palestinian territories as a "friend
for the Palestinian people and for Arafat," whom he has known for
over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He also said their talks which started in the West Bank City of
Ramallah on Friday touched on the peace process. He also expressed
concern about the current situation in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Arafat expressed apology for a stone attack against
Jospin in Birzeit University in Ramallah on Saturday morning
engendered by the prime minister's remarks against Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, who is on a four-day tour to Israel and Palestinian
territories, termed Thursday in Israel Hezbollah as "terrorists"
and their resistance movement against Israeli occupation troops in
south Lebanon as "terrorist movement."
</P>
<P>
Syrian- and Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war since 1985 when Israel set up a self-
styled security zone in south Lebanon to oust Israeli occupying
forces from the country.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's words have angered and knocked back the whole Arab
world, for French had been taking a more sympathetic stand toward
the Arab side than the United States. But Jospin said the incident
would not affect the French-Palestinian ties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed thanks for the French support for the
Palestinian people on all levels as well as the French attitude
towards the Palestinian issue and the Peace process as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people were in need for the support of France,
the European Union (EU), and the international community to push
the sluggish peace talks forward, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, whose country is to hold the next rotating presidency of
the 15-nation EU, termed his talks with Arafat as "very important,"
adding that they discussed the bilateral ties and the possible
areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
France was committed to provide 111 million francs (over 18
million U.S dollars) to fund the construction of the Gaza Port in
addition to Dutch aid and funds from the European Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on a 30 million francs package (5 million
dollars) for the same purpose and an extra 20 million francs (about
3.3 million dollars) for Palestinian medium- and small-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
France will also raise its contribution in the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to 18 million francs (3 million
dollars) while it will contribute about 200 million Francs (about
33 million dollars) to four other projects.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on establishing a French-Palestinian joint
committee and hold its first meeting next Summer, according to
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
French aid to the Palestinians between 1993 and 1997 reached 350
million francs (nearly 60 million dollars) in joint projects under
financial protocols on Gaza port, water sector and private sector,
the French side said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin who arrived in the region on Wednesday has left for home
from the Gaza International Airport Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Joint Efforts To Break Deadlock in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein said Saturday Israel and its Arab neighbors should be fully
committed to the peace process and to implementing the already-
signed agreements to give momentum and confidence in the process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the remarks during a meeting with U.S. Middle East
Peace Envoy Denis Ross, who arrived here earlier in the day to
brief the monarch on the outcome of his shuttling diplomacy between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders this week.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the role by the United States in supporting and
activating the peace process and overcoming differences between the
parties concerned, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The king reiterated his country's principle stands of supporting
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon in their struggle to regain
their legitimate rights and occupied territories, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab state following Egypt signing a peace
treaty with Israel in 1994, has been a major peace broker between
Israel and its Arab neighbors since then.
</P>
<P>
Ross visited the region after Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators failed to meet a February 13 deadline to hammer out a
framework for a possible final peace agreement by September.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Thursday night, Ross
said he sensed a Palestinian and Israeli willingness for breaking
the current deadlock in the peace talks
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said earlier this week that it would be
decided by Sunday whether the peace talks would be resumed or not.
The results of the current mission by Ross will be considered.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria were suspended indefinitely
in January after Israel rejected a Syrian demand for a formal
commitment to handing back in full the Golan Heights it captured in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not resumed its peace talks with Lebanon, where Syria
had been a major power broker, since their negotiations broke off
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Saturday apologized, in his own name and the name of the
Palestinian people, to visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
for the stone attack on him by some university students.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told a news conference after his meeting with Jospin here
that the incident was "totally condemned" and the Birzeit campus
would be closed for a three-day investigation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian students of Birzeit University in the West Bank city
of Ramallah stoned Jospin on Saturday morning when he was to leave
the campus, but the French leader was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Police Chief in Gaza Strip said Arafat has asked the
security forces in West Bank to take immediate measures and
investigate the incident in full in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Arafat described those who pelt the stones as "non-Palestinians
who caused much disturbance for the guests".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French prime minister said that the attack would
not affect the French-Palestinian ties.
</P>
<P>
Birzeit University students stoned Jospin for his earlier
remarks against Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
Jerusalem on Thursday, Jospin told reporters that he condemned
Lebanese Hezbollah's attacks on Israeli troops occupying South
Lebanon as terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's remarks against Hezbollah angered the Arab world.
Lebanon summoned the French ambassador in Beirut on Friday, asking
France to explain the logic Jospin used when he said the resistance
movement in Lebanon is a "terrorist" movement and whether this
marked a policy change in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Jospin arrived in the region on Wednesday for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a Lebanese resistance military
group fighting against the Israeli occupation since 1985 when

terrorism. The remarks angered the Arab world at large, and Lebanon
summoned French ambassador in Beirut on Friday, asking France to
explain the logic Jospin used when he said the resistance movement
in Lebanon is a "terrorist" movement and whether this marked a
policy change of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian government held that these remarks went against the
official French policy and the spirit of friendship in the Arab-
French ties, Nasir said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian government demanded that the French side explain
Jospin's remarks which encourage Israel to continue its hostilities
against Lebanon, she added.

<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is a Lebanese resistance
military group fighting against the Israeli occupation since 1985
when Israel set up its so-called security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Military activities inside the zone have been intensified since
the beginning of this year and seven Israel troops were killed
there so far.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched fresh retaliatory air raids on south
Lebanon Saturday, causing no casualties, Lebanese police said.

<HEADLINE> Truckers End Five-Day Protest in Newfoundland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of independent
truckers Friday night ended their five-day protest against soaring
fuel costs in Canada's Atlantic province of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
The protesting truckers were "very pleased and satisfied" with
an agreement with John Efford, acting Works, Services and
Transportation Minister, the local information service said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Efford also said the agreement would address some of the
concerns which drove truckers to an action of blockade on the
Trans-Canada Highway.
</P>
<P>
The details of the agreement remain unknown. Earlier in the day,
negotiations reached an impasse after provincial Finance Minister
Lloyd Matthews rejected the truckers' request for temporary tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
Scores of local gas stations ran out of fuel Friday. Some
dairies were reported to stop shipping milk while mail delivery
was difficult to get through.
</P>
<P>
About 200 trucks were lined up at roadside checkpoints at
several junctions on the Tran-Canada Highway, while smaller
protests were staged outside oil depots in St. John's, Holyrood
and Come By Chance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched fresh
retaliatory air raids on south Lebanon Saturday, causing no
casualties, Lebanese police said.
</P>
<P>
Israel aircraft fired six missiles in two raids around 3:15 p.m.
(1215 GMT) near the villages of Kafra and Yater, on the edge of the
Israeli-occupied security zone while about 40 tank and artillery
shells were also fired from the zone on the countryside, police
said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed responsibility for an attack
earlier in the day on an Israeli patrol near Blat in the occupied
strip.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the zone said that about 10 rockets and
mortar rounds were fired at the patrol but they did not strike the
men.
</P>
<P>
As the Israelis carried out their retaliatory raids, Katyusha
rockets were fired on another Israeli position, at Hula further to
the east, the security sources said, without mentioning any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the second
attack.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla
war to oust Israeli occupation troops from the country since 1985
when Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> French PM Attacked in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian students of
Birzeit University in the West Bank city of Ramallah stoned
Saturday visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and his
entourage, but the French leader was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, the University Council decided to
close down the university for three days since Saturday, to enable
the university to investigate the incident, according to a senior
Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The council also issued a statement to condemn the the bad
behavior of the students, who threw stones at Jospin's motorcade
and chanted anti-Jospin slogans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official added, the Palestinian security forces
have already rounded up 15 palestinian students after the incident.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Saturday morning when the French prime
minister and his party were to leave the campus after giving a
lecture to the university teachers and student representatives.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 Palestinian students, angered by Jospin's remarks
against the Lebanese Hezbollah, confronted with the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The situation at the campus was out of control and some students
threw stones at the French delegation. All members of the
delegation were unhurt, but a reporter was hit by stone, according
to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the university was part of Jospin's arrangement of his
four-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories. In the
lecture, Jospin told the university teachers and students about
France's policy towards the Mideast peace process, saying his
government will do everything possible to help push the process
forward.
</P>
<P>
But several Palestinian students asked Jospin during the lecture
why he termed the Lebanese Hezbollah as "terrorists" and requested
him to give the reasons to back his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Jospin refused to answer this question in detail, but said that
the French government strongly opposes Israel's occupation of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
Jerusalem on Thursday, Jospin told reporters that he condemned
Hezbollah's attacks on Israeli troops occupying south Lebanon as
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's remarks against the Hezbollah angered the Arab world
and other countries in the region. Lebanon summoned the French
ambassador Philippe Le Courtier in Beirut on Friday, asking France
to explain the logic Jospin used when he said the resistance
movement in Lebanon is a terrorist movement.
</P>
<P>
Jospin told the university teachers and students that his
remarks represented no change in the policy of France, which has
often been seen as more sympathetic than the United States to Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac was reportedly concerned about
the incident, asking Jospin to report to him immediately after his
return to France.
</P>
<P>
Jospin arrived in the region on Wednesday for a four-day visit.
He went to the Gaza city in the afternoon to hold talks there with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is a Lebanese resistance
military group fighting against the Israeli occupation since 1985

GAZA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Saturday strongly berated the stone-throwing incident at Birzeit
University, Ramallah, against visiting French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who met Jospin in his office here, expressed hope that
the incident will not mar the relations between the Palestinians
and France.
</P>
<P>
As Jospin entered Arafat's office, Palestinian officials
apologized to him about the attack, which occurred while Jospin was
walking to his car to leave the university after giving a lecture
in which he tried to strike a balance concerning France's position
on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Over one thousand Palestinian students, angered by Jospin's
remarks against the Lebanese Hezbollah, confronted with the French
delegation. Some of the students pelt stones at the delegation but
all the delegation members were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Faces Serious Arsenic Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 21 to 24 million
Bangladeshi people are potentially at risk due to high doses of
arsenic contents in tube well waters, a top official of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNICEF survey carried out on 51,000 tube wells,
29 percent contain arsenic level beyond human consumption. The
number of tube wells in the country is about 4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Shahida Azfar, the representative of UNICEF in Bangladesh, said
the incidence of high rates of arsenic contents in tube well
waters in Bangladesh is not a man-made case, but a geological
matter.
</P>
<P>
Such natural phenomenon could be found in many parts of the
world including the neighboring West Bengal of India, the United
States and Taiwan. The arsenic found in Bangladesh and West Bengal
are deep down on the soil accumulated through the ages coming from
the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
Azfar said a program in this direction is already in action,
and the World Bank is providing 30 million U.S. dollars to fully
ascertain the incidence of arsenic in each tube well in the
country, the principal source of safe water for the vast majority
of the people living in the country.
</P>
<P>
She said the UNICEF's budget this year for arsenic mitigation
will be over 2.5 million dollars compared to 1.5 million dollars
spent last year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Airlines to Begin Flights over North Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian airlines may fly
passengers over the North Pole to Asia as early as next year, the
Ottawa Citizen newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nav Canada, the nation's air traffic control and navigation
services, believes that it may have the capability for regular
commercial flights to the other side of the world via new polar
air.
</P>
<P>
Nav Canada is talking about potentially handling some 20
international polar flights an hour, around the clock, within
about five years.
</P>
<P>
By going over the top of the world and shortening the distance
to destinations in India, aircraft would need less fuel, freeing
up payload capacity for more passengers and cargo, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Nav Canada estimates Canadian-Siberian polar routes could save
North American airlines bound for Asia millions of dollars
annually.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Probe into Inter-Korean Private Fisheries Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will take
appropriate measures on the Inter-Korean Private Fisheries
Agreement, which was signed by two organizations of South Korea
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in Beijing on
Saturday, after an investigation of the accord, said a South
Korean official.
</P>
<P>
"We will decide what actions to take after a thorough probing
of the accord when the South's delegates return home," said Hwang
Hak-soo, director of the Intra-Korea Interchange and Cooperation
Bureau of the Unification Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the South Korean Movement for Fisheries
Association and the National Economic Cooperation Association of
the DPRK was signed without the government's prior approval and
the inter-Korean fisheries cooperation should be made in a legal
way so that it can benefit fishermen of both sides, Hwang said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Korean boats are allowed to fish in
a large maritime zone off Wonsan, DPRK's North Hamkyong Province.
</P>
<P>
It also gives South Korea the right to fish in the DPRK waters
until 2005 and can be extended every five years thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The fishing zone is located between 38 degrees, 36 minutes and
40 degrees north latitude and between 130 degrees, 30 minutes and
131 degrees, 23 minutes east longitude.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also adopted an addendum to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In the "Annex on the Division of Fishing Outcomes," they agreed
to divide incomes on a 50-50 basis after all fishing expenses are
deducted.
</P>
<P>
About 400 fishing vessels are expected to operate
simultaneously in the designated maritime zone.
</P>
<P>
DPRK chief negotiator Ho Hyok-pil said Pyongyang pursued the
agreement in the name of "lofty brotherly love and unity" and in
consideration of the plight of South Korean fishermen who lost
their jobs due to the South Korea-Japan fisheries agreement.

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Some consumer organizations
and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) held a conference
here Saturday in an effort to launch action plans to help elderly
or disabled people to learn how to prepare their life for real
euro era in the future.
</P>
<P>
Participants, at the invitation of the European Commission,
discussed ways to help elderly or disabled people or people who
may not be reached by traditional means of information to adjust
themselves to the new monetary language of daily life. Effective
and timely information was made available at the gathering, named
"The Euro Made Easy: the Role of the NGOs."
</P>
<P>
Citizens in the EU countries will finally change over to the
euro with the introduction of coins and notes on January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the transitional period of dual circulation of the
euro and national currencies was scheduled to last six months. Now
it has been reduced to two months at most, and for many reasons it
will in practice last for only a few weeks. Most of the
inhabitants, unless they prepare themselves in advance, have
little time to learn.
</P>
<P>
The conference also displayed the results of studies on the
psycho-sociological aspects of the euro and on the special needs
of disadvantaged groups, as well as experiences and examples of
actions and materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many overseas universities advertise their programs in a
variety of ways, and participation in education exhibitions held
by the Chinese government is one of them.
</P>
<P>
Li Shunxing, secretary-general of the China Education
Association for International Exchange, said today that the
Chinese government always encourages its students to study abroad
and welcomes foreign education organizations to cooperate with
China.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese students who once studied abroad have made great
contribution to shortening the distance between China and the
outside world", said Li, adding that returning students open
channels for attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 320,000 Chinese have studies abroad
in the past two decades in over 100 countries, and 100,000 have
returned to China.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Chinese government certified 68 agencies in 11
provinces and municipalities to provide consultation services for
Chinese students who want to go abroad to study.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, the international higher education exhibition, one of
the two at the World Trade Center, will move to Xi'an, Shanghai,
Chengdu and Wuhan cities. In March and April, the World Trade
Center will also hold education exhibitions from the United States
and Australia.

BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Wu Ningning, an undergraduate
in China's Qinghua University, came early this morning to attend
education exhibitions at the World Trade Center in Beijing looking
for useful information for pursuing his education in the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Today, two education exhibitions were held at the World Trade
Center, one by 100 universities in the UK and the other by over
100 universities in 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
Martin Davidson, culture counselor of the British embassy in
China, said that the future of education is in globalization, and
China will send more students to other countries to study as its
economic situation improves. "We are confident in the potentiality
of China's education market," noted Davidson.
</P>
<P>
"Providing education to Chinese students will strengthen the
cultural and trade and economic exchanges between the UK and
China," said Davidson, adding that China will be one of the most
influential countries in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> French PM Stoned in Ramallah for Remarks on Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian students of
Birzeit University in the West Bank city of Ramallah attacked on
Saturday visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and his
delegation, but the French leader was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Saturday morning when the French prime
minister and his party were to leave the campus after giving a
lecture to the university teachers and student representatives.
</P>
<P>
Over one thousand Palestinian students, angered by Jospin's
remarks against the Lebanese Hezbollah, confronted with the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The situation on the campus was out of control and some students
threw stones at the French delegation. All members of the
delegation were unhurt, but a reporter was hit by stone, according
to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the university was part of Jospin's program of four-day
visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories. In the lecture,
Jospin told the university teachers and students about France's
policy towards the Mideast peace process, saying his government
will do everything possible to help push the process forward.
</P>
<P>
But several Palestinian students asked Jospin during the lecture
why he termed the Lebanese Hezbollah as "terrorists" and requested
him to give the reasons to back his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Jospin refused to answer this question in detail, but said that
the French government strongly opposes Israel's occupation of south
lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
Jerusalem on Thursday, Jospin told reporters that he condemned
Hezbollah's attacks on Israeli troops occupying south Lebanon as
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's remarks against the Hezbollah angered the Arab world.
Lebanon summoned the French ambassador Philippe Le Courtier in
Beirut on Friday, asking France to explain the logic Jospin used
when he said the resistance movement in Lebanon is a "terrorist"
movement and whether this marked a policy change of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the university audience Saturday, however, Jospin
said his remarks represented no change in the policy of France,
which has often been seen as more sympathetic than the United
States to Arab states.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac was reportedly concerned about
the incident, asking Jospin to report to him immediately after his
return to France.
</P>
<P>
Jospin arrived in the region on Wednesday for a four-day visit.
He went to the Gaza city in the afternoon to hold talks there with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is a Lebanese resistance
military group fighting against the Israeli occupation since 1985
when Israel set up its so-called security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Military activities inside the zone have been intensified since
the beginning of this year and seven Israel troops were killed
there so far.

<HEADLINE> hke022627-- S'pore Manufacturing Output Grows Strongly in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output grew by 17.3 percent last month, contributed mainly by the
electronics and chemical clusters, according to the monthly
bulletin released by Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB)
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster grew by 18 percent compared to January
1999 mainly thanks to vigorous global demand for chips and strong
demand from the Asia Pacific for its mobile communication products.
</P>
<P>
The chemical cluster shot up by 89.5 percent over a year
earlier with the output of pharmaceuticals segment expanding by
more than four-fold and that of the industrial/special chemicals
and petrochemicals increasing by 16.9 percent and 12.6 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the petroleum segment recorded a decline of 28 percent
mainly due to poor margins from crude oil processing resulted from
the un-matching between the increases in prices of crude oil and
refined products.
</P>
<P>
The output of the engineering cluster increased by 5.8 percent
year-on-year in January, with the output of the precision segment
surging up by 19.8 percent boosted by the expanding wave in the
electronics cluster.
</P>
<P>
But the process engineering segment declined by 14.1 percent as
a result of lower output of oil field equipment in response to
less overseas demand.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Urges Ruling Party Leaders to Mobilize Voters for Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged all leaders of the ruling National Resistance
Movement (NRM) to mobilize people to ensure they register and
vote in the coming referendum.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call when answering questions from the
public in a CBS television program Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He urged NRM leaders at all levels to sensitize people on the
pending referendum which is meant to decide on the country's
political system and the future of the ruling party, saying that
mobilizing people to participate in the referendum is one of the
ways of strengthening democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that some people would refrain from
casting ballots in the referendum and there would be a low
turnout. He also listed the big achievements the NRM has been
achieving over the past decade, especially in the fields of
health, education, governance and economy.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's 1995 Constitution stipulates that a referendum be held
in 2000 to give people a chance to choose a political system of
their preference.  The referendum is slated for this June. The
multipartyist camp, which groups almost all the oppositions
parties, has accused the NRM of taking advantage of the
privileges it has now while in power and threatened to boycott
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Several senior government officials have urged the opposition
camp not to go against the constitution. Most analysts here
believe that the ruling NRM would win in the referendum and thus
continue to rule the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, this
week stressed the importance of "Three Emphases" education --
theoretical study, political awareness, and good conduct -- during
his inspection tour in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
"Three Emphases" education is a strategic decision made by the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to further
promote the party building, said Li, who is also a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It will prepare the Party ideologically, politically, and
organizationally for the new century and new historical tasks," he
said at a meeting with local officials in Zhangjiagang City of
Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
He asked officials at the county level to fully realize the
importance of the "Three Emphases", overcome their shortcomings,
improve their work, and lead the people in opening up a new
prospect in the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"We must let the masses see the real effects of the 'Three
Emphases' education, so as to increase the public's confidence in
the drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
To better conduct "Three Emphases" education among county
officials, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee recently decided to send its members to
several cities and counties in a number of provinces to mobilize
officials there and conduct related research activities.
</P>
<P>
Li also visited some enterprises and villages in southern
Jiangsu's Jiangyin, Zhangjiagang and Wuxi during his tour between
February 22 and 25, where he solicited opinions and suggestions
regarding development from local people.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee a sustained, fast and healthy economic development
in the new century, we must further restructure the national
economy and give top priority to the development of science and
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the southern part of Jiangsu, famous in China for
its booming township enterprises, should now shift its development
focus onto the high-tech sector so as to upgrade the economic
structure.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Soldier Testifies to Truth of Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A former Japanese soldier said
today in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, that
the atrocities committed by the Japanese who invaded China and
recorded in his wartime diary are ironclad facts.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, one of the Japanese soldiers who massacred some
300,000 people in Nanjing in 1937, said that he will fight against
Japan's right-wing forces until he wins. The Japanese Supreme
Court has overruled his appeal in which he sought to acknowledge
the history of the invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
The 88-year-old former soldier said his diary is meant just to
disclose the true facts of the Japanese invasion and prevent the
reoccurrence of such tragedies.
</P>
<P>
The ridiculous trial in Japan was aimed at denying the Nanjing
Massacre totally, Azuma Shiro said, adding that he will continue
to appeal.
</P>
<P>
The residents of Nanjing held a series of activities to show
encouragement and support for Azuma Shiro, according to a local
source.
</P>
<P>
Shiro plans to go to Beijing, Shenyang, and Shanghai to speak
on this matter and hold symposiums.

<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Health
announced today that no epidemic diseases have occurred since
devastating floods hit the country in 1998, thanks to the great
efforts made by public health workers.

<P>
Six provinces and municipalities including Beijing and Shanghai
also contributed medicine and medical equipment worth more than 92
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 339,000 health workers went to the flooded areas
to treat patients in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Urban Health Care System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China will conduct a key
reform of the urban health care system in two to three years to
ensure fair and quality medical service for all under a socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Zhang Wenkang said today that the State Council,
China's cabinet, has approved a government document which provides
guidelines for the reform, such as allowing the establishment of
for-profit hospitals, improving community-based medical services,
and setting up a comprehensive disease-control network.
</P>
<P>
The reform will pave the way for the country's painstaking
creation of an urban medicare system which will replace the old
cradle-to-grave welfare system.
</P>
<P>
Administrations of public health would enhance macro-control of
the entire health sector to achieve a more balanced disposition of
health care resources in different areas, Zhang told a meeting
attended by national and provincial officials in charge of public
health.
</P>
<P>
"New problems and challenges emerging with the establishment of
a market economy have urged us to reform the outdated health care
system so that we can provide fair and quality service to the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals across the country are to be separated into two kinds,
commercial and non-profitable, the minister said, stressing that
non-profitable hospitals run by the government and community and
non-governmental organizations will continue to dominate the
market and provide basic health care.

<P>
Zhang also assured hospital staffs that their incomes will be
guaranteed by imposing higher "technical fees" such as fees
charged for diagnosis, outpatient services, operations and nursing.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the future health system in urban
areas will be composed of community-based health care institutions,
comprehensive hospitals, and specialized ones.
</P>
<P>
The community institutions will be responsible for disease
prevention, health promotion, health education, family planning
service, and the treatment and rehabilitation of common illnesses
and chronic diseases. Large hospitals will specialize in disease
treatment and clinical studies.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a massive disease-control network is to be
set up nationwide to monitor and prevent epidemics, poisonings,
and other public health disasters, and provide professional
instructions as well.
</P>
<P>
The reform also focuses on the adjustment of the structure of
the pharmaceutical industry by discouraging redundancy among small
drug manufacturers, while prompting the formation of large
enterprise groups which will be in a better position to develop
new drugs.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of drug safety, from production to use, will be
enhanced as well.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Hospitals Get Green-light in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's public health
authorities have given the green light to commercial hospitals as
part of the country's new health care system which is undergoing
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals should be separated into two kinds - non-profit and
commercial - to satisfy the people's varying demands for medical
care," Health Minister Zhang Wenkang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Non-profit hospitals are mainly run by governments, enterprises,
communities and non-governmental organizations, and should
guarantee basic medical care for the public, putting any profits
into improving medical equipment and introducing new technology.
They enjoy preferential tax treatment and financial allocations.
</P>
<P>
Commercial hospitals will have the freedom to decide their fees,
but will have to pay taxes according to relevant regulations,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals have long been considered public benefit institutions
in China because they were funded by the government as a part of
the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
However, privately owned, shareholding, and foreign joint-
venture hospitals have been burgeoning in recent years, though
they still make up only a tiny percent of the country's 16,600
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"We have to face reality and formulate relevant rules and
policies for better administration as soon as possible," said one
public-health specialist. He said that this new system may help
improve the quality of hospital service since competition would be
prompted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mutual Funds Ride IT Boom in India  By Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- In India, information
technology (IT) funds have become the flavor of the season and
practically every mutual fund is launching schemes to ride the
current IT boom.
</P>
<P>
A month back, the IT fund launched by the IL &AMP; FS Asset
Management Company mobilized 6 billion rupees (139.53 million U.S.
dollars) in its subscription period.
</P>
<P>
This month, the Kothari Pioneer IT fund kicked off the Internet
Opportunities Fund, which is designed to capitalize on investment
opportunities created by the dramatic growth on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
This week, Kotak Mahindra also launched its IT-specific fund, K
Tech and subscription is open till March 21 this year.
</P>
<P>
India's IT boom is driven by the software industry, which
witnessed an annual growth rate of 60 percent between 1992 and
1999 and many Fortune 500 companies are outsourcing India's
software to retain their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
According to Devang Mehta, president of the National
Association of Software and Service Companies, India's software
industry was worth 3.9 billion dollars in 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
In 2008, the Indian software industry is expected to touch a
gross turnover of 85 billion dollars. Out of this, software
exports are expected to be 50 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Already, software exports from India are about 10.5 percent of
the country's total exports and it has been projected that by 2003,
software exports will be 23 percent of India's total exports.
</P>
<P>
What has also helped is that mutual funds dedicated to the
Infotech sector launched in the last year or so have shown
impressive returns.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Kothari Pioneer IT fund has appreciated by
over 111.21 percent during the past three months and by 314.33
percent since inception in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Magnum IT fund of the State Bank of India
announced a 40 percent dividend and a bonus issue of one share for
every two shares.
</P>
<P>
Even the indices are riding high with the Sensex on the Bombay
Stock Exchange scaling unprecedented peaks on the surging waves of
IT-driven mammoth stocks like Infosys and Wipro.
</P>
<P>
However, some mutual fund managers warned that investors should
look at these funds only as high-risk, high-return avenues to park
their money.
</P>
<P>
Anil Sahgal, vice-president of Dundee Mutual Funds, said that
people must decide what percentage of their savings they would
like to put in the IT sector before selecting a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
Putting all the money in the IT basket just because of the
meteoric returns seen over the past few months is not a good idea,
he said. "It is very good to move with the trend but not become so
fashionable. Invest in the IT but diversity your portfolio."

<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China today Launched a "Smooth
Traffic Project" in 36 major cities and some medium-sized and
smaller cities in a bid to create a better traffic environment for
the country's economic progress and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
The project, initiated by the Ministry of Public Security and
the Ministry of Construction, is aimed at tackling the
overburdened traffic systems in cities through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Jia Chunwang, minister of Public Security, Beijing Mayor Liu Qi,
and Zheng Yijun, vice minister of Construction, attended a
ceremony today in Beijing to kick-off the project.
</P>
<P>
China now has 53 million motor vehicles, and the figure is
increasing at an average increase of 18 percent a year, while the
length of the country's roads are increasing by only 8.78 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that China has fewer than one million
parking spaces, or one parking space for every 50 vehicles. At the
same time, drivers in big cities often complain about traffic jams,
speed limits, and the difficulty of parking their cars.
</P>
<P>
Beijing alone has 1.4 million motor vehicles, according to Ma
Zhenchuan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Public
Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China is now hard at work ensuring that its national roads and
expressways, and its urban traffic remain in good order in
anticipation of a new round of economic growth which requires
higher goals for traffic management.
</P>
<P>
Traffic departments at all levels have been urged to improve
their professional skills and adhere to the principle of "
improving capabilities through science and technology."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Japanese, ROK Ministers (details added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
here this afternoon with Japanese Environment Agency Director-
General Kayoko Shimizu and Environment Minister of the Republic of
Korea Kim Myung-Ja.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and ROK guests are here to attend the ongoing
meeting of the environment ministers of China, Japan and the ROK.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Chinese government highly stresses environmental
protection, which is a fundamental national policy, and the
functions of the country's environmental protection departments
have been reinforced and relevant laws and regulations improved in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The government has increased investment and taken effective
measures in this regard, such as closing down seriously polluting
enterprises, planting trees to increase afforestation, and
returning farmland back to forest, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Chinese government is willing to promote
the sustainable development of the Asia-Pacific region and the
world in the 21st century through global and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China, Japan and the ROK all belong to east Asia, and
should join efforts to protect the environment. The Chinese
government supports cooperation among the three countries in this
field, and hopes that such cooperation will become a model of
regional cooperation in environmental protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu expressed satisfaction over environmental protection
cooperation between Japan and China, and Kim voiced the hope that
the present ministerial meeting will usher in more substantial
cooperation in this sector among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The tri-ministerial meeting, which was held for the first time
in the ROK in January 1999, is meant to implement the consensus
reached among leaders of the three countries to cooperate in
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Visit East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"On Tuesday, I will leave for East Timor and Kupang (capital of
Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province)," the president told
newsmen Saturday at the Merdeka palace.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Wahid will meet with the chief of the UN
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), East Timorese
leader Xanana Gusmao and Baucau Bishop Basilio do Nascimento.
</P>
<P>
This is the president's first visit to East Timor since the
territory separated from Indonesia after the ballot in August last
year.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony for more than 400 years. In
1976, it was integrated into Indonesia. On August 30 last year,
more than 400,000 East Timorese took part in a U.N.-sponsored
ballot and overwhelmingly voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wahid said, his planned visit to Papua New Guinea(
PNG) has been postponed because the country is not prepared for it
due to its chaotic internal situation.
</P>
<P>
"When I contacted the PNG (government), it informed me about
the chaotic situation (in the country). That is what it said, so
we just accept its information," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that on Sunday (Feb. 27) morning, he will visit Brunei
Darussalam and return home in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also said his recent trip (from January 28 to February 12)
to the Middle East, Europe and Asia which brought him to Saudi
Arabia,France, the UK, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany,
India, South Korea and Thailand, had run well.
</P>
<P>
He said his trip had borne good results, with Indonesia getting
a"reward" from the international community.

<HEADLINE> SGX, KLSE Reach Agreement on Clob Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The stock exchanges of
Singapore and Malaysia have finally broken the impasse in their
negotiations on the 20 billion ringgit issue of frozen Malaysian
shares formerly traded on Clob International, Singapore's over-the-
counter market.
</P>
<P>
A joint press statement issued late Friday night by the
Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE)
said the two exchanges had signed two agreements which will
provide "a comprehensive and amicable" solution to the Clob issue.
</P>
<P>
The resolution to the Clob impasse will come as a pleasant
surprise to Clob's 172,000 weary shareholders -- mostly retail
Singapore-based investors.
</P>
<P>
These agreements are scheme A, an amended version of an earlier
proposal submitted by Effective Capital and Scheme B which
involves a much longer 33-month trading suspension and a nine-
month staggered release of the shares thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Under Scheme A, there is a three-month waiting period for the
opening of individual securities accounts with the Malaysian
Central Depository (MCD). Thereafter, the Clob securities will be
released over a 13-month staggered period.
</P>
<P>
The other scheme worked out between Singapore's Central
Depository (CDP) and Malaysia's Securities Clearing Automated
Network Services (SCANS) will allow investors to trade their
shares at the end of 43 months from now for an "administrative"
fee of one percent based on the last five trading days of the 31st
month.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's CDP said it will distribute the revised offer
documents to Clob investors by March 6.
</P>
<P>
Investors who opt for Scheme A will have until March 27 to
submit written acceptances, and those for Scheme B until March 31.
</P>
<P>
This is likely to put an end to the 18-month saga which has
left 11.5 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
Trading of Clob's Malaysian shares came to an abrupt halt in
September when Malaysia imposed capital controls. The shares have
remained frozen with the Malaysian Central Depository since. The
Malaysian government imposed an end-june 2000 deadline for the
shares to be transferred to investors' individual accounts with
the MCD.

<HEADLINE> Alert Urged on False Claims of Aids Cure in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Medical practitioners who are
currently using the mass media to attract attention to themselves
with the claim that they have found a cure for the dreaded AIDS
disease are violating the profession's ethics, reported Nigeria's
leading newspaper The Guardian Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there are several reports in the country's major news
papers claiming that some doctors have found the cure to the
deadly disease with the aid of traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
They each claimed that they have successfully cured dozens of
patients.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Nigerian Health Minister Tim Menakaya as
saying on Friday in Abuja that "we (doctors) have started treating
AIDS patients on the pages of newspapers. we do not follow the
professional ethics any more."
</P>
<P>
He added: "doctors with valid claims that they have found cure
to the dreaded disease, should subject their findings to
scientific verifications by recognized authority."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the public is largely gullible, the minister
expressed concern that false claims might be difficult to identify
and sanctioned if those with the cure employ the same medium with
charlatans.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the current administration is committed to
providing adequate health care for Nigerians as indicated in the
2000 budget, adding that government had concluded arrangements to
rehabilitate 109 hospitals across the country.

<P>
Panic-stricken, residents Friday shut their shops, withdrew
children from schools and ran helter skelter. Those with friends
and relations in army barracks moved in with their belongings for
safety.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers' wives made brisk business selling food and drinks
to the displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with journalists after a tour of the city, the
governor expressed delight that "the rumor has come to nothing,
attributing it to miscreants who hoped to capitalize on the
expected disorder to loot.
</P>
<P>
He urged law abiding citizens to go about their businesses as
"this city and indeed this state has remained peaceful as ever".
He said law enforcement agents had been told to properly handle
the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
was greatly outraged by the remarks made by Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin in Jerusalem on Thursday and has asked Jospin to talk to
him as soon as he returns home from Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a comment on the Israeli-Lebanese conflict, Jospin called
the attacks by Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas on Israeli troops in
southern Lebanon "terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that Jospin's remarks risk harming
France's Middle East policy, which stresses close ties with Arab
countries, especially Palestine, Syria and Lebanon, while
remaining highly critical of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential palace said in a communique Friday
night that Chirac "has demanded that the prime minister make
contact with him as soon as he returns to France."
</P>
<P>
The event marked the biggest crisis between Chirac and his
Socialist prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Benjamin Raich won his
first title of the season by taking the World Cup Alpine skiing
giant slalom in Yongpyong, South Korea on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Raich clocked his winning time of two minutes 27.56, edging
Switzerland's Michael von Gruenigen, the 1998 champion, by a
quarter of a second with Joel Chenal of France in third place 0.79
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Hermann Maier, overall and giant slalom leader,
decided to skip the race in South Korea in order to prepare for
the coming speed events at Norway's Kvitfjell as he was ensured to
lead the standings with two races left.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's race was a long-awaited success for the promising
Raich who has reached the podium five time since the start of the
season.
</P>
<P>
"It was about time that I won a race. I have often been unlucky
in the past months," he said, adding that "fortunately, I remained
confident and motivated. I appreciate this success even more
because I had to fight harder and wait longer than last season."
</P>
<P>
Raich, a fine technical skier, is hoping for his first slalom
win of the season in Sunday's slalom.

A Country Fire Service (CFS) spokeswoman said 13 houses and
businesses in the Booleroo Center township had been sandbagged
after unofficial reports that the township had received 75mm of
rain between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. (local time) Saturday.

But CFS and State Emergency Services crews were forced to use
corrugated iron at the southern end of one street, when
sandbagging failed to protect the area from floodwaters, she said.
</P>
<P>
The local golf club was flooded with 10cm of water after a
nearby dam broke its banks during the downpour.
</P>
<P>
Roads from the township to Murray Town and Appila, south of
Booleroo Center, were closed.
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews had contacted farmers on low-lying land outside
the township to ensure all homes were safe, but concern about
further flooding eased once the rain subsided.

CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Food packages Saturday were
helicoptered into Aboriginal communities isolated for a fortnight
by flooding in the South Australia (SA) state's far northwest.
</P>
<P>
The state Aboriginal Affairs Department made three food drops
to the Napri and Kanpi communities in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara
Lands, which have been cut off by floods since February 11.
</P>
<P>
Police from the northwest SA town of Marla attempted to air-
drop food in the area from a fixed-wing plane last Tuesday, but
about 75 percent of the food packages disintegrated on impact.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the state Aboriginal Affairs Minister Dorothy
Kotz said about 200 people had been left stranded by the floods
and the food drops would continue as long as needed, with more
rain likely.
</P>
<P>
She said Australia's defence forces were expected to arrive
Sunday to help with future drops, if needed.

CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The floods crisis in the
Queensland state, Australia, intensified overnight as heavy rain
deluged the state's far north, Queensland's Bureau of Meteorology
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The state's Cairns-Innisfail area bore the brunt of the
downpours, and heavy rain continued to fall in the city of Cairns
early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Falls of up to 150mm in six hours were recorded overnight, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
State emergency services and local residents began sandbagging
local businesses in low-lying areas as swollen creeks spilled over
onto roads and caused flash flooding.
</P>
<P>
Cairns police said water had already seeped through the doors
of some premises in the city's inner suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, floodwaters have continued to recede in western
Queensland after the towns of Winton and Longreach were inundated
with water earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The downpour in the past week put one-third of Queensland on
flood alert.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Destroys Marijuana Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM THLAN MUROI, Cambodia, February 26 (Xinhua) Cambodian
Prime Minister Hun Sen Saturday burned some 30 hectares of
marijuana plants in a remote mountain area, showing the government
's determination to crack down the drug production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 150-strong military police force led by top military and
police officials took part in the operation in Phnom Thlan Muroi,
Kampot Province. Also at present were Director General of National
Police Hok Lundy, RCAF Deputy Commanders-in-Chief Pol Saroeun and
Kun Kim, and other government and local officials.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, flew there by helicopter, severely criticized local
and government officials, blaming them for not excercising
effective leadership in crackdown on the drug plantation and urged
them to make a thorough investigation on the matter.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, the plantation was financed by foreign
investors who hired about 400 poor local farmers, and some
powerful officials were involved, including Kampot Deputy Police
Chief Keow Tha who was suspended last week.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister warned that drug production is completely
banned in Cambodia. Anyone who violated it would be punished by
law,regardless how high his ranking is.
</P>
<P>
Many signs showed that the operation was well organized. "This
area is like the realm of marijuana or autonomous zone and it will
become dangerous in the future if we fail to destroy it," said Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Thlan Muroi is situated north of Kampot town in Chhouk
district, some 100 kilometers from Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that more than 40 hectares of marijuana fields
have been destroyed so far since the crackdown operation was
carried out in the provinces of Kandal, Koh Kong and Kampot.
However, it was said many more hectares of marijuana still exist
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen ordered the National Authority for Cambatting Drugs to
work harder to fight against the drug.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hok Lundy had said that the first stage of the
operation was to completely destroy the cannabis, and the second
stage was to bring to justice the masterminds of the operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is currently hosting
over 200, 000 refugees from neighboring countries and the number
is growing daily, a newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The refugees came mainly from Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya and Ethiopia, the
New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the exact number of refugees now
living in Uganda could be higher and it has been growing with the
influx of more refugees from countries suffering civil wars, like
the DRC and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are now living in the northern and
southwestern Uganda and they have reportedly been well treated.
</P>
<P>
They have been receiving assistance from international
agencies, the Ugandan government as well as non-governmental
organizations based in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt. Assesses Loss in Kaduna Sharia Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of senior federal
government officials are in the city of Kaduna to assess the loss
in the three-day clashes between Christians and Moslems over the
proposed implementation of the Islamic Sharia law in the northern
Kaduna State.
</P>
<P>
Internal Affairs Minister Sunday Afolabi, who led the team,
announced that the federal government is resolved to assist the
victims of the disturbance with relief materials, the Guardian
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But another round of protests by Moslems took place Friday when
the delegation arrived in Kaduna where riots earlier this week had
reportedly taken 300 lives. The protests caused fears that the
violence may renew.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic gunshots were heard in some parts of the city. Feared
citizens rushed into army barracks and other safe places.
</P>
<P>
The government delegation included minister of state for
education, minister of women affairs and the minister of solid
minerals.
</P>
<P>
After a tour of the city, the team later visited some Christian
and Moslem leaders in the capital city of Kaduna State where the
population is almost evenly divided between Moslems and
Christians.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 14, infects 400 in Western Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A Cholera outbreak has
hit Tanzania's western Kigoma Region, killing 14 people and
infecting more than 400 others in the past two weeks, the Guardian
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kigoma District Commissioner Maulid Kaggo attributed the
outbreak to the congestion of refugees in neighboring camps.
</P>
<P>
Several villages in rural Kigoma District, located close to
refugee camps, were affected most seriously, the commissioner was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He suspected that the epidemic originated from unhygienic
conditions in the camps and was later transmitted to the
countryside and ultimately reached the town.
</P>
<P>
Kigoma Region, with a population of 1.2 million people, hosts
some 500, 000 registered refugees and at least 200,000
unregistered mainly from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Most residents mainly depend on the expansive Lake Tanganyika
as the source of water, the Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
The cholera epidemic comes amid the long-standing problem of
acute water shortage facing Kigoma Region with thousands of people
going without clean and safe drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Dar Port, Major Drug Transit Point: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- International drug
traffickers are making the Dar es Salaam port in Tanzania one of
the major transit points in Africa, according to the International
Narcotics Control Board.
</P>
<P>
The board, a branch of the U.N. International Drug Control
Program, said in its 1999 report that illicit drugs were smuggled
through Africa's major ports including Dar es Salaam, Kenya's
Mombasa, Mozambique's Maputo, South Africa's Durban and several
ports in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Seizure dates indicate that those places are most frequently
used as transit points by drug traffickers, said the report
available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While drug trafficking routes were diversifying, countries like
Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius and Tanzania are key routes used by
traffickers to transport heroine from southwest and southeast Asia
to countries in Europe and North America and to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual report also says that drug trafficking
and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in Africa
are strongly influenced by the various ongoing civil conflicts and
post-conflict situations, triggering growing abuse of narcotic
drugs especially among children and youths.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. anti-narcotics body urged improved cooperation from
African governments and regional organizations to combat the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, like many other countries in the world, is faced with
 challenges of illicit drug trafficking and abuse and its
associated crimes.
</P>
<P>
Police sources say many Tanzanian youths are caught inside and
outside the country dealing with drugs. Some of them are facing
long-term jail sentences or even death sentences abroad.

COMESA trade accounts for 44 percent of the east African
country's exports, the Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted

The trade official said Kenyan products to be displayed at the
Cairo trade fair will include bulk and packed tea, coffee,
processed food, sisal products, pyrethrum extracts, horticultural
products, crafts, among others.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Opposition Urged Not to Boycott June Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister for
Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda has appealed for opposition parties in
the country not to boycott the coming referendum, saying that they
could win it.
</P>
<P>
Rugunda made the call at a public debate and launch of a book
on Ugandan democracy here Friday, the New Vision newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the ruling National Resistance Movement
(NRM) would accept whatever results of the referendum if it was
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
The multipartyists should respect the Constitution and take
advantage of the present chance to express their views in the
pending referendum, Rugunda said.
</P>
<P>
At the debate, the minister said that the ruling party is
democratic because power has been transferred to the people as
demonstrated by the decentralization process and the last
parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
A referendum is scheduled to be held in June to decide on the
political system of the east African country as stipulated in the
its 1995 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The opposition group has been complaining about inequality in
campaign preparations and threatening to boycott the referendum.

BELGRADE -- The Kosovo office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Friday condemned some media
controlled by ethnic Albanians for their groundless accusation of
Serbs, saying their irresponsible move could expose the accused to
danger, reported the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE office said in a statement that the media in question
published a name list of Serbs and the units they are working with,
accusing them of committing crimes during the Kosovo war but
without specifying any evidence for the accusation. Such practice
is very dangerous and irresponsible, which could only lead to the
deepening of social conflicts and ethnic violence, said the
statement. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo)

ROME -- Head of the Italian Defense Chief of Staff has ordered
Army Major General Silvio Mazzaroli, deputy commander of the KFOR
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, to return home following the
publication Friday of his criticism of Italian policy in Kosovo in
Italian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued Friday night by the Chief of Staff said the
order was given "in relation to the tenor and content of articles
which appeared in the national newspapers today." The senior
officer was quoted as saying that "Italy is politically absent.
All the other members of the military in Kosovo have a country
system which supports them and we, instead, have been left on our
own." (Italy-KFOR)

maintain policy continuity and support the European Union's
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian far-right Freedom Party has accepted the
government's policy to support the EU's expansion, and the party
will back Hungary's bid to join the EU, she said at a news
conference after meeting with her Hungarian counterpart Martonyi
Janos. Ferrero-Waldner was on a one-day visit to appease Hungary's
concerns aroused by a recent remark by Freedom Party President

<HEADLINE> Mayon Erupts Again After Simmering Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Mayon, the most active volcano
in the Philippines, exploded again at 11:15 (03:13 GMT) Saturday,
42 hours after it simmered down, in what experts said could be a
resumption of the volcano's second-phase of eruption.
</P>
<P>
The blast, of volcanic type complete with rumbling sounds and
rock fragments, once more sent ash-laden columns of clouds about
two kilometers to the clear blue sky and carried by the westward
wind to Albay's third district.
</P>
<P>
Ted Sandoval of the Philippine Institute of Seismology and
Volcanology (Phivolcs) said that the blast was preceded by one
with lava fountains and flows Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He said this could be a resumption of the second-phase of the
volcano's explosions, adding that it follows its own established
pattern of a series of blasts, then quieting down for a certain
period, and then exploding again.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates massive build-up of magma underground, climbing
up the volcano's shaft," Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
He added the recent blast could be the start of another series
of explosions.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, disaster authorities expressed fears over
many evacuees who returned home Friday and early Saturday, near
and within the danger zones.
</P>
<P>
"They'll be baked to death if this hits them," said Sandoval,
reiterating Phivolcs' warning of a "no man's land" down to the
extended eight-kilometer danger zone at the southeastern sector of
the volcano facing Legazpi City and Sto. Domingo.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of evacuees, most of them males, were visiting their
homes and properties they left behind Friday, one day after the
volcano erupted.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets Vietnamese FM </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, expressed the
hope here today that the visit paid by Vietnamese National
Assembly (VNA) Chairman Nong Duc Manh in April would be a success.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in his meeting with visiting Vietnamese
Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Li said that along with the smooth growth of party-to-party and
state-to-state relationship between China and Vietnam, NPC also
further consolidated its ties with VNA.
</P>
<P>
NPC is willing to carry out multi-facet and multi-channel
exchanges and cooperation with VNA so that we can learn from each
other and better serve the socialist construction and the cause of
reform and opening-up in the two countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Li said that top leaders between China
and Vietnam have kept high-level contacts since the Chengdu
meeting held in 1990, greatly pushing forward the development of
bilateral ties and advancing the solution to the problems left
over by history.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from strategic perspectives, General Secretary of
Communist Party of China (CPC) Jiang Zemin and General Secretary
of Communist Party of Vietnam (VCP) Le Kha Phieu defined the
framework of bilateral relationship in the new century as "long
term stability, future-oriented, good-neighborlihood and all-round
cooperation," Li said, adding that the guiding principles would
bring bilateral ties into a new historical period.
</P>
<P>
He described the singing of the agreement on Sino-Vietnamese
land borders by the two governments at the end of last year as "an
event of historic significance." He also expressed the belief that
the two sides will concentrate their efforts on resolving the
demarcation of Beibu Gulf within this year.
</P>
<P>
Nien extended gratitude to Li for his invitation of VNA
Chairman Nong. He believed Nong's April China tour would
definitely further promote the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After Vietnam and China forged diplomatic ties five decades ago,
bilateral ties witnessed all-round development, he said. Such ties
were first nurtured by old revolutionary leaders, including late
Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Mao Zedong. New generation of
Vietnamese and Chinese leaders made new contribution to the
further consolidation and development of bilateral ties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"VCP and the Vietnamese government are ready to make
unremitting efforts for the further growth of our ties within the
framework defined by the general secretaries of our two parties,"
he told Li.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Nien will conclude his China visit tomorrow
and leave south China's Guangdong Province for home.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Refutes U.S. Human Rights Accusation (detail added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua)-- China is strongly displeased
with and firmly opposed to the United States' action of distorting
other countries' human rights situation, according to Chinese
foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks here today in response to the U.S. State
Department human rights report of the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has consistently respected
the universal principles on human rights and actively committed
itself to promoting and protecting the human rights and
fundamental freedom of the Chinese people in line with its
national conditions.
</P>
<P>
After long-term and unremitting efforts, Zhu said that the
human rights and basic freedom enjoyed by the Chinese people have
been upgraded to an unprecedented historical level, adding that it
is a fact known to all.
</P>
<P>
There exist serious human rights violations in the United
States, yet those human rights abuses still continue to
deteriorate, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. government pays no heed to its own human
rights violations, but always meddles with other countries'
internal affairs by issuing the so-called human rights reports and
willfully distorts human rights situation in other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is totally unreasonable and with ulterior
motives for the U.S. to do so, adding that it is also a typical
demonstration of double standards on human rights.
</P>
<P>
China hereby expresses its strong displeasure with and firm
opposition to such action of the U.S., said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"It must be pointed out that the U.S., running counter to the
historical trend, persists to lodge a draft resolution concerning
China at the United Nations conference on human rights in Geneva
this year once again. It will end up in failure as always," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side urges the U.S. to observe the fundamental
principles in international relations, correct its erroneous
doings, and stop interfering in the domestic affairs of other
countries by utilizing the so-called human rights question, Zhu
said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, ROK Non-Governmental Organizations Reach Fisheries Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Two non-governmental
organizations from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have reached a fisheries agreement,
the first ever on economic cooperation by non-governmental
organizations since the separation of the two sides more than five
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
DPRK's National Economic Cooperation Association and ROK's
Whole of Korea Fishermen Union made the announcement at a joint
press conference here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two sides told the conference that after
six days of negotiations starting from February 20, the two sides
struck such a deal, which should be approved by their respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, vessels from the south side will
soon engage in fishing activities in water areas off the east
coast of the north in five years, and the two sides are expected
to share economic returns by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
DPRK's delegation is led by its advisor He Hiek Pil and ROK's
delegation is led by its advisor Kim Dae-Kwon.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen in the south side, who lost some fishing ground out
of a ROK-Japan fisheries agreement early last year, appealed to
the north side to fish in the latter's water areas last August.
</P>
<P>
Both sides began the recent round of negotiations on related
issues in Beijing this month following two rounds of consultations
in September and December last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The lawmakers from the
Nepali Congress (NC) have withdrawn their no-confidence motion
against Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai after an agreement
was reached Friday night between the two top leaders of the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by NC President Koirala and Prime
Minister Bhattarai said they had agreed to end the present dispute
through mutual understanding, as they were aware of the need of
consensus not only within the party but also with other political
parties to combat the present challenges, Radio Nepal reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to resolve the present problem through
understanding as we are aware of the other problems facing the
country," the statement said, citing the problems as poverty,
unemployment and violence.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not spell out the details of the
agreement between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of no-confidence motion was announced shortly
after the agreement was announced, ending the two weeks of
deadlock within the Nepali Congress.
</P>
<P>
On February 16, 58 pro-Koirala lawmakers from NC filed a no-
confidence motion against Bhattarai to force the prime minister to
step down on ground of his poor governance since he came to power
in May, 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali tourism industry
has borne a loss of 1.5 million U.S. dollars in the last two
months after the suspension of inbound Indian Airlines (IA) flight
in the aftermath of the hijacking in December last year.
</P>
<P>
At least 28,400 potential visitors have been denied access to
Nepal and 244,000 kgs of export cargo have failed to reach the
international markets due to the suspension of IA flights after
the hijacking of an IA passengers plane on December 24, 1999,
according to a press release available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The release jointly issued on Friday evening by the tourism-
related associations said the number of Indian tourists coming to
Nepal dropped by 54 percent, and foreign tourists by 5 percent
from January.
</P>
<P>
Among all the tourists visiting Nepal, 48 percent come from
India or via the Indian route. After an IA plane was hijacked on
route from Kathmandu to New Delhi, IA has suspended all its
Kathmandu-bound flights.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Compromise On Nuclear Deterrence: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The present Pakistani
government headed by General Pervez Musharraf will not entertain
any suggestion that may in any way compromise the country's
nuclear deterrence capability.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar on Friday
while addressing a seminar on CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty)
and Pakistan's National Interests in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully cognizant of the imperative and we continue to
develop and upgrade our nuclear capability," Abdul Sattar said.
</P>
<P>
"Few issues are more directly linked to national interest than
our nuclear policy. All of us, government as well as people, are
well aware that nuclear capability is indispensable for
preservation of the peace and security of our country," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Sattar noted that acquisition of nuclear capability by
Pakistan has proved a positive factor for peace.
</P>
<P>
He said experience testifies to Pakistan's indispensable need
for nuclear deterrence. So long as India continues to harbor evil
intentions, and persists in threats of use of force, Pakistan has
no option other than maintaining credible deterrence capability
which is clear to every citizen of Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Pakistan will continue to act in future, as
it has done in the past, with responsibility and restraint.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam recorded a 13.2 percent
increase in the industrial production output during the first two
months of the year, local English daily Vietnam News (VNS)
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production value reached more than 31,100
billion Vietnamese dong (2.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the first
two months of the year, according to the General Statistics Office
(GSO).
</P>
<P>
The non-state sector, which accounts for only 20 percent of the
overall industrial output, grew 15.8 percent in the first two
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The state sector which accounts for the majority of industrial
output experienced a 11.6 percent increase for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The foreign invested sector, which included wholly foreign-
owned enterprises and joint ventures, registered 13.5 percent
growth over the same period, accounting for about 38 percent of
total output.
</P>
<P>
VNS quoted GSO as saying that one-third of Vietnam's major
industries experienced growth over the same period last year, such
as the power sector up 17 percent, cement up 26.1 percent, diesel
engine manufacturing up 44.5 percent, motorbike sales up 37.2
percent and processed seafood products up 19.3 percent.
</P>
<P>

<P>
However, crude oil production, the country's key money maker,
dropped by 5.8 percent to 2.35 million tonnes in the first two
months.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Outraged by U.S. Ambassador's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexico on Friday reacted
furiously over U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow's remarks on the
previous day calling Mexico "the world headquarters of drug
trafficking."
</P>
<P>
Davidow, speaking to the Mexico City alumni of the University
of Southern California on Thursday, said, "The fact is that the
world headquarters of drug trafficking is in Mexico. And that's
the truth."
</P>
<P>
His remarks left the Mexican government "surprised" and "do not
contribute to, nor reflect, the efforts at cooperation between
Mexico and the United States against drugs," the Mexican Foreign
Ministry said in a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Deputy Foreign Minister Carmen Moreno summoned
U.S. Charge d'Affaires James Durban to convey Mexico's
dissatisfaction with Davidow's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Mexican senators representing several political parties said
that the U.S. ambassador's words are offensive to the dignity of
Mexico and smack of interventionism in violation of the principle
of mutual understanding in the joint anti-drug efforts of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Davidow should first look at his own country's record in
failing to control drug abuse before passing any comments on
Mexico, they said, noting that the United States, with over 20
million drug addicts, accounts for more than half of the world's
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Fox, presidential candidate of the opposition National
Action Party, said that the U.S. ambassador has no right to
criticize Mexico while senior police officials said that the
United States has a host of drug problems on its own hands.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Health Condition to be Checked Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) - A medical team set up by the
Indonesia's Attorney General Office is due to have a cross-check
on health condition of the former president Soeharto on Monday, a
report said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cross-check is a follow up of the report on Soeharto's
medical team handed over by the Soeharto's lawyer to the Attorney
General Office several days ago.
</P>
<P>
"On Monday, the team plans to have a visit to Soeharto's house.
The team will give second opinion on the real Soeharto's health
condition," Attorney General Marzuki Darusman was quoted by the
Media Indonesia daily as saying, adding that the team consists of
ten experts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said that the 78-years old man who ruled
Indonesia with iron hand for 32 years is reportedly to undergo
medical treatment abroad.
</P>
<P>
But Darusman said he has not received such a report, adding
that he hoped to be informed if the plan was true.
</P>
<P>
Due to the health reasons, the former toughman failed on
February 14 to show-up at the Attorney General Office for
questioning as a suspect in corruption cases during his 32 years
rule, while the House of Representatives (DPR) working committee
also failed on February 18 to summon Soeharto for questioning on
his policy in disbursing the Banking Liquidity Support (BLBI) to
the country's sicked-banks during his rule.
</P>
<P>
The committee even was banned to meet the former president by
his doctors team.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon said that his client
still has problems with communication skills both spoken and
written since he suffered stroke last year.
</P>
<P>
"Medically, it is impossible for Pak (Mr.) Soeharto to undergo
investigation," Tampubolon said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Darusman said that Soeharto may be detained for
legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
"But right now, we have yet put Soeharto under house detention
or banned (him) from visiting abroad," Darusman added.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Volcano Simmers Down, More Eruptions Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Mayon Volcano in the Central
Philippines is simmering down after Thursday's eruption, but it
may burst again, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology (Phivolcs) warned Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
In its latest bulletin, the Phivolcs said that there was an
abrupt drop in the correlation spectrometer readings of sulfur
dioxide emissions from 13,500 tons Thursday to 2,300 tons Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The apparent quiescence of Mayon does not mean cessation of
the explosive eruption stage," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Observations indicate continuous movement of rolling
incandescent rocks along Bonga Gully, suggesting ascent of new
supply of lava and its intrusion into the dome. Thus the threat
for explosive eruptions still exists," the Phivolcs said.
</P>
<P>
The institute still maintained Alert Level 5 since the
occurrence of more hazardous eruption events can not be discounted.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the six-kilometer Permanent Danger Zone
around Mayon and the eight-kilometer extension of the dangerzone
in the southeast sector of the volcano should be strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
Mayon Volcano erupted Thursday morning, sending lava fountains
and huge columns of smoke to the sky as local residents fled their
homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Social Welfare and Development,
more than 18,000 people have been housed in different government
evacuation centers in Albay province where the volcano is located.
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of the evacuees ignored warnings of new eruptions
and began returning home Friday to guard their fields and animals.
</P>
<P>
The 2,462-meter Mayn Volcano has erupted at least 40 times
since 1616 and its last major eruption was in 1993, which killed
some 70 persons.

ejected from Thursday's 92-85 loss to Utah.
</P>
<P>
With 4:02 to play, Rodman, who has already been suspended once
since signing with the Mavericks earlier this month, was called
for a foul against Jazz forward Karl Malone and argued, receiving
his second technical foul.
</P>
<P>
As he left the court, Rodman began pulling his jersey out of
his shorts to throw to the crowd, which he has made a tradition.
Two male fans at courtside unsuccessfully reached for it and ended
up in a fistfight, with one being led away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
Rodman was suspended one game without pay and fined $10,000 by
the NBA for his actions a 112-99 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on
February 15. The flaky forward reacted somewhat harshly to the
suspension, telling reporters he and NBA commissioner David Stern
should "get in a ring and get it on."
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks are just 1-4 with Rodman in the lineup and host
Denver on Saturday. Dallas is eight games behind Minnesota for the

final playoff spot in the Western Conference.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Houston Rockets rookie
guard Steve Francis was fined $10,000 today by the NBA for his
flagrant foul on Denver Nuggets guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad.
</P>
<P>
NBA executive vice president of basketball operations Rod Thorn
announced the fine, which was brought about by Francis' actions in
the third quarter of Thursday's 106-97 loss.
</P>
<P>
With 3:09 remaining, Francis tried to block a fast-break layup
by Abdul-Wahad and slammed him to the floor, drawing a flagrant-2
foul and ejection. For his trouble, Francis also chipped a tooth.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough judgement call," Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. "It looked like he made an attempt to block the shot and his
momentum carried him into the player. I'm glad Tariq wasn't hurt
and it looked like Steve got the worst end of the play."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Pledges Security Guarantee for  Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to boost the on-going
national economic recovery program, the Indonesian government
insisted its commitment to give security guarantee for foreign
investors who will invest or have been investing in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the government wants to give a guarantee of conducive and
safety climate for the arrival of investors, as the country in the
process of economic recovery, that is it, nothing else," the
Bisnis Indonesia daily Saturday quoted ad interim Coordinating
Minister for Politics an Security Surjadi Soedirdja as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commander of the Indonesian Military (TNI) also said on
Friday that security situation in the country has come back to
normalcy and conducive for investment.
</P>
<P>
"The security situation in Indonesia is generally under control,
" Razi said, adding that social and religious conflicts plaguing
some provinces of Indonesia have reduced.
</P>
<P>
Previously, President of the World Bank James Wolfenson in his
four-day visit here also said that Indonesia needed to build
investors' confidence in the country so that they would put their
money here to help maintain economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
One of the indications of not-yet-returning confidence was the
slow pace of investment activities by small and medium enterprises
in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the government data, foreign investment approvals for
the whole year of 1999 reduced by 22 percent to 10.6 billion U.S.
dollars over the previous year as political instability deterred
investors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment approvals fell further by 74 percent in
January this year to 95.8 million U.S. dollars over the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Austria Reaffirms Support for EU's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Austrian Foreign
Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner said here Friday that the new
Austrian government will maintain policy continuity and support
the European Union's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian far-right Freedom Party has accepted the
government's policy to support the EU's expansion, and the party
will back Hungary's bid to join the EU, she said at a news
conference after meeting with her Hungarian counterpart Martonyi
Janos.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner was on a one-day visit to appease Hungary's
concerns aroused by a recent remark by Freedom Party President
Jorg Haider, who said that EU candidates could join the EU only
when their economies reach the average level of EU members.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian foreign minister criticized "political sanctions"
that other EU members have imposed on Austria since its new
coalition, which includes Freedom Party, was inaugurated on
February 4. She claimed the sanctions are unjust and will impose a
negative impact on Europe in a long run.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope for an eventual removal of obstacles in
bilateral relations between Austria and other EU members.
</P>
<P>
Martonyi said that his meeting with Ferrero-Waldner was helpful
and that relations with Austria are important at this crucial
moment of decision over Hungary's accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that Hungary reserves its concerns over the
entry of the far-right Freedom Party into the new Austrian cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, which is striving for EU membership, has reacted
cautiously to Austria's political scenario, while most European
countries, especially EU members, have expressed strong discontent
over Austria's new government.

OTTAWA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Toronto court Friday sentenced
brother drug lords to 18 years in a federal penitentiary for
smuggling more than 2,000 kilograms of cocaine into Canada.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Caruana, 54, and his 56-year-old brother Gerlando
pleaded guilty to leading an international cocaine-smuggling
operation for 30 years, according to a news release from the
country's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso and Gerlando both admitted to being "high-level"
members of a ring engaged in cocaine smuggling from Colombia to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the Rothschilds of the Mafia, the brothers are believed
to be in one of the largest crime families in the world, rooted in
Venezuela and Sicily, with criminal operations stretching from the
Americas to Western Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Their younger brother Pasquale Caruana, 51, was sentenced to 10
years for drug trafficking and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
"They were untouchables and this demonstrates that even the
untouchables can be taken down," a leading police investigator
said, referring to Alfonso, a kingpin known in the mafia world as
an "untouchable."

<P>
DUBLIN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern reaffirmed Thursday that his government regards Taiwan as a
part of China.
</P>
<P>
"Ireland accepts that Taiwan is a province of China," Ahern
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said Ireland in 1971 voted in favor of the U.N. resolution
2758 recognizing the government of the People's Republic of China
as the only legitimate representative of China at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
This "one China" policy was reaffirmed in 1979 when Ireland
established diplomatic relations with China, and "all Irish
governments since then have followed the same policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the concept of "one country, two systems" is
already in practice in Hong Kong and Macao, Ahern said that it is
also applicable to Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Revenue in Panama Canal Drops in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

PANAMA CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Revenue from the Panama
Canal stood at 48.9 million U.S. dollars in January, down 2.6
percent compared with the same month last year, the Panama Canal
Authority said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said that cargo movement in January dropped by 2 percent to
15.9 million tons, compared with January of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Aleman Zubieta, interoceanic waterway administrator,
attributed the negative results to the reduction of oil byproducts
shipment, which was down 16.78 percent to 2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Transport of oil byproducts, which continues to be affected by
oil production cuts by the member countries of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is the second largest earner
in the total cargo industry along the waterway, said Aleman
Zubieta.
</P>
<P>
The commercial flow of grains, however, increased by 10.7
percent to 3.5 million tons, while containerized cargo was up 1
percent to 2.5 million tons during the same period.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Raps Media Over Groundless Accusation of Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo office of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Friday
condemned some media controlled by ethnic Albanians for their
groundless accusation of Serbs, saying that their irresponsible
move could expose the accused to danger, reported the Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE office said in a statement that the media in question
published a name list of Serbs and the units they are working with,
accusing them of committing crimes during the Kosovo war but
without specifying any evidence for the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Such practice is very dangerous and irresponsible, which could
only lead to the deepening of social conflicts and ethnic violence,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, ethnic Albanian terrorists have
stepped up violent actions against non-ethnic Albanian residents,
aggravating the tense situation in Kosovo. Local Serbs, under
attacks almost every day, charge that the terrorists are carrying
out "ethnic cleansing."
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, many say, are trying to force Serb residents
out of Kosovo by violent attacks and threats so as to achieve
their goal of building a "mono-ethnic" country.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics said about 350,000 non-ethnic Albanians
have been forced to flee Kosovo since the international
peacekeeping force entered the war-battered region in June last
year.

ROME, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Italian Defense Chief
of Staff has ordered Army Major General Silvio Mazzaroli, deputy
commander of the KFOR peacekeeping force in Kosovo, to return home
following the publication Friday of his criticism of Italian
policy in Kosovo in Italian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued Friday night by the Chief of Staff said the
order was given "in relation to the tenor and content of articles
which appeared in the national newspapers today."
</P>

The senior officer was quoted as saying that "Italy is
politically absent. All the other members of the military in
Kosovo have a country system which supports them and we, instead,
have been left on our own."
</P>
<P>
Mazzaroli was reported, in substance, to have cited the many
accomplishments of Italian troops abroad against the backdrop of a
lack of direction in Rome, while delivering unflattering comments
on other countries with soldiers in the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
The staff chiefs have named Major General Salvatore Carrara, a
former deputy in command of the staffs' military policy office, a
deputy Eurofor commander and ex-military attache in Washington, as

All major Beijing-based newspapers today gave their front page
coverage to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent inspection tour
in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chairman of the Central
Military Commission, stressed during his five-day tour that the
CPC is now playing a crucial role in all aspects of China, and the
improvement of Party building should be given top priority.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as the CPC continues to represent the
correct social trends and benefits the majority, it will be
supported by all the people of China and will be never defeated.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC, made the call during
his five-day inspection tour in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
which began on February 21 and ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
 Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces in northeast
China have planned to reduce their corn-growing areas to increase
soybean-growing areas in a bid to adjust plantation structure and
to increase farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
 China Youth Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese children pay more attention to self development,
have a strong sense of equality, and are fond of taking part in
collective activities.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by China's first book introducing and
analyzing the current situation of its children, which was
published this week.
</P>
<P>
"New Discovery -- Report on the Current Development of Chinese
Children" based the above conclusions on a research which covered

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian President Wins Last Seat in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani has won the last seat of the sixth Majlis (
parliament), according to the final vote of the Tehran
constituency released early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The election headquarters at the Interior Ministry announced
that Rafsanjani's name appeared at the bottom of the list of 30
candidates who were elected into the Majlis by the Tehran
constituency.
</P>
<P>
However, the other 29 seats in the Iranian capital city of
Tehran were all taken by reformists, the strong supporters of
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, according to the Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that Rafsanjani won 749,884 votes, or 25.
58 percent of the total of 2,931,113 votes in the constituency,
just above the minimum of 25 percent required to enter the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani currently heads the powerful State Expediency
Council, which functions as an arbitrator between the Majlis and
the Guardians Council and an advisor to the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's poor showing in the polling, which was held on
February 18, has come to symbolize the unpopularity of the
powerful conservatives, who oppose the reformist efforts of
President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's reformist allies have won a sweeping victory in the
polling by winning more than 160 seats across the country, while
the conservatives have only taken some 40 seats, losing their
majority in the parliament. The remaining 69 seats will be
determined in a run-off.
</P>
<P>
The election results in metropolitan Tehran were delayed 36
hours amid widespread rumors about possible vote rigging.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Board assigned by the Interior Ministry and the
Supervisory Board appointed by the conservative Guardians Council
decided on Thursday to recount 105 ballot boxes over which they
had differences.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, a centralist enjoying close ties with the
conservatives, lost his popularity after he decided to run for the
Majlis while the conservatives threw their weights behind him.
</P>
<P>
His supporters have boasted that Rafsanjani would easily enter
the Majlis, which he had presided over for almost 10 years before
he was elected the Iranian president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
With a humiliating result in the polling, Rafsanjani will
unlikely assume the post of speaker in the new parliament, local
political analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern Thursday called for efforts to promote Sino-Irish relations
to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward accordingly to increased cooperation between
China and Ireland in all areas -- politics, economics, trade,
culture and people-to-people exchanges," Ahern said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations, and I am happy to say that relations between
our two countries at present are close and friendly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Ireland and China have had many useful exchanges of
visit and other contacts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Ahern recalled his own "fruitful and enjoyable visit" to
Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong in September 1998 when he had "
very productive meetings" with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji as well as other leaders.

<P>
"Ireland recognizes the importance of the relationship with
China," he said, adding that his country is increasing its

China from either a trade, investment or national competitiveness
point of view."

"We have now in place a long term strategy for increasing trade
and investment between Ireland and Asia with a particular focus on
China," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Considers Radical Changes to Some Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GHENT, Belgium, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Radical changes to
reduce the duration of some major events to make athletics more
attractive to broadcasters were proposed by International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) president Lamine Diack on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Diack said that sprints and field events would come under the
scrutiny of a new competition commission.
</P>
<P>
"In the pole vault and high jump, for example, one proposal is
to have a limited number of attempts -- say six -- for all
competitors. By doing this it would be possible to know roughly
how long a competition would last -- and also offer spectators an
element of suspense," Diack said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sprinters could be disqualifed after making one
false start.
</P>
<P>
Another radical changes was to reduce the rounds in the long
and triple jumps and cut shot attempts from six to four.
</P>
<P>
The European indoor championships has started a streamlining
operation by reducing the number of field event finalists from 12
to eight -- the first big international competition of modern
times to institute such a change.

<HEADLINE> Rockets, Tomjanovich Agree to Terms on Four-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Houston Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich, who is faced with the tast of rebuilding the team he
guided to consecutive NBA titles, agreed to a four-year contract
extension through the 2005 season.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Tomjanovich has endured a rough season. It
began in the preseason when superstar Scottie Pippen demanded a
trade. After Pippen was shipped to Portland, Tomjanovich lost
veteran forward Charles Barkley, who had announced his retirement,
to a season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
Hakeem Olajuwon, the last remaining link to Houston's glory
days, also was hurt and has seen his minutes cut as his
productivity declined. The team is just 21-34 and 10 games behind
Minnesota for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Tomjanovich, who is slated to coach the U.S.
Olympic team this summer, has opted to remain with the club.
</P>
<P>
Tomjanovich does have a building block in rookie point guard
Steve Francis. Shooting guard Cuttino Mobley also offers promise
as a perimeter player.
</P>
<P>
Tomjanovich has guided the Rockets to the postseason in each of
his seven full seasons. He has been eliminated in the first round
each of the last two seasons but has a postseason record of 51-39.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Tomjanovich has a career record of 374-253. He took
over for Don Chaney in February 1992.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Fans Jailed for Match Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Three soccer fans have been
jailed for a violent clash with rival supporters at the first
match of the football season.
</P>
<P>
Cardiff City and Millwall fans fought running battles last year
in Cardiff city centre and at the ground as both sides' supporters
met in a pre-arranged fight.
</P>
<P>
Cardiff City supporters Paul O'Hara, 26, 25-year-old Craig
Hughes and Paul Rankin, 25, were jailed at Cardiff Crown Court for
a total of 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The three had been caught on CCTV cameras as they taunted
Millwall supporters.
</P>
<P>
The court heard that Millwall fans were pelted with stones and
attacked as they left the Ninian Park ground on the first day of
the new season.
</P>
<P>
Police in riot gear were forced to charge at the Welsh
supporters to protect the visiting fans from attack.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Julian Greenwood said: "The Millwall fans stayed
inside Ninian Park until it was safe to let them out.
</P>
<P>
"But outside waiting for them were about 60 Cardiff supporters.
"
</P>
<P>
All three gave themselves up after their pictures were released
by police from CCTV cameras showing violence and stone-throwing.
</P>
<P>
Huw Evans, defending O'Hara, said the Millwall fans were "
winding up" the Cardiff supporters.
</P>
<P>
Evans said: "He deeply regrets bringing shame on Cardiff City
Football Club."
</P>
<P>
Ex-soldier O'Hara, of Splott, Cardiff, Hughes, of Rumney,
Cardiff, and Rankin, of Trowbridge, Cardiff, were jailed for six
months each at the city's crown court.
</P>
<P>
Judge Michael Gibbon told them: "Most of the spectators were
decent law-abiding people.
</P>
<P>
"Now Cardiff City football hooligans have just as bad a
reputation as the Millwall hooligans."
</P>
<P>
The fight had been set up by rival groups using mobile phones
and the internet.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO, Nigeria to Set up Investment Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Manufacturers Association
of Nigeria (MAN) have agreed to set up an investment centre in
Nigeria, the News Agency of Nigeria said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Robert Hallett, leader of a five-member
UNIDO delegation to Nigeria, here on Thursday when he briefed
members of MAN on the organization's activities lined up for the
country.
</P>
<P>
The centre, which aims to provide relevant information to
Nigeria's manufacturers, will focus on identifying projects,
capital needs and partnership required.
</P>
<P>
According to Hallett, UNIDO's industrialization efforts in
Africa and Nigeria this year would focus on the manufacturing
sector so as to propel it as the engine of growth.
</P>
<P>
He pledged the commitment of UNIDO to work closely with MAN to
ensure that specific programs are drawn up to identify investment
opportunities open to reliable local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO delegation is scheduled to discuss with President
Olusegun Obasanjo on how to improve the investment climate in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Promises to Raise Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia, the world's top
oil producer, has pledged to raise oil production to help rein in
the buoyant oil prices in the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia made the promise in a joint statement issued with
visiting U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson Saturday. But the
statement did not give detailed output plans of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Richardson arrived here from Kuwait and his visit came in an
apparent attempt to convince Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the two major
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), to help bring down the robust oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC adopted a year-long policy last March to slash its member
states' oil output to prop up the sagging oil prices, which have
recently jumped to a nine-year high of nearly 29 U.S. dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers will meet on March 27 in Vienna to discuss the
current situation and future policies. Some consuming giants,
especially the U.S., want the oil producing states to pump more oil
to tame the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said "I think I've made it clear that the United
States believes that there should be an increase in production."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is a leading oil supplier to the U.S. and has
significant influence over OPEC and many producers outside the
group.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia said in the joint statement it would review supply
and demand to ensure market stability.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived here late on Saturday for talks with Egyptian officials on
difficulties facing the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to brief him
on the true picture of the Mideast peace process and the latest
developments in negotiations with Israel, Mubarak's political
advisor Osama al Baz said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled early this month
following an unsuccessful summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak. The two sides are locked in a dispute about
further land transfer of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians was angered by Israel's failure to respect a
compromise deal to have the Palestinians have a say in deciding the
maps of the targeted land.
</P>
<P>
On a parallel track, the two sides missed the February 13
deadline for a framework deal on final status of some thorny issues
such as the fate of Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements, Palestinian
refugees and borders. In fact, no tangible progress has been made
so far on the issues.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross toured the region last week
with a aim to help break the impasse in the peace talks, but he
returned empty handed.

<HEADLINE> mee0226 hke -- Large Turkish Delegation in Baghdad for Closer Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish state minister
heading a 200-member delegation arrived in Baghdad Saturday to
promote bilateral economic and trade cooperation, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Edip Safter Gaydali came to attend the
12th session of the Iraqi-Turkish Joint Committee for Trade,
Economic and Technological Cooperation. The last session was held
in Baghdad in April, 1997.
</P>
<P>
During his seven-day visit, Gaydali will discuss with Iraqi
officials ways of developing bilateral cooperation, especially in
the economic field, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, the Turkish minister told INA that due to the
trade embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990, Turkey has lost 30
billion U.S. dollars in trade transactions with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that Iraq and Turkey has not been capable of
implementing a deal signed in 1997, under which a 1,100-kilometer-
long pipeline worth 2 billion dollars should be laid to supply 10
billion cubic meters of Iraqi gas for Turkey annually.
</P>
<P>
During the previous six phases of oil-for-food program, now in
its seventh phase, Turkish companies got 477 million dollars worth
of contracts to provide Iraq with detergents, medical appliances,
equipment and various spare parts, and ranked the ninth largest
exporter of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, political relations between the two countries remained
cool. Iraq has long criticized Turkey for allowing the U.S. and
British war planes to take off from its bases to patrol the
northern no-fly zone set up following the 1991 Gulf War, with the
so-called aim of preventing Iraqi government troops from attacking
the Kurds. Iraq has never recognized the northern and southern no-
fly zones.

<HEADLINE> Eggs, Paint Hurled at Polish Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Polish missions in Moscow
and St. Petersburg were attacked Saturday, when Russian protesters
hurled eggs and bottles of paint at the buildings, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The attacks followed a Wednesday incident when the Russian
consulate in Polish City of Poznan was attacked by pro-Chechen
protesters who torn down and burnt the Russian flag and hoisted a
Chechen flag in its place.
</P>
<P>
The incident, in which Polish police reportedly did not
intervene, angered Moscow and prompted Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov to cancel a trip to Poland scheduled for early March.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, a group of people dressed as Cossacks, hurled eggs
at the Polish Embassy, Interfax reported, citing sources at the
Moscow interior agencies. It was not clear if the Moscow police
took any actions.
</P>
<P>
In St. Petersburg, five unidentified young people threw eggs
and bottles with paint at the Polish General Consulate building.
They were detained by law enforcement agents and an investigation
is under way, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo
sent a letter to his Polish counterpart, Marek Biernacki, urging
Warsaw to "most effectively search for and punish those guilty" of
Wednesday attack in Poznan.
</P>
<P>
Rushailo expressed serious concern over "a whole number of
troubling events for Russian-Polish relations, the peak of which
was the vicious attack on the Russian General Consulate by members
of the Free Caucasus Committee, operating in Poland."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to "the unceasing acts of vandalism toward the
graves of Soviet soldiers and officers," and to "the increasingly
frequent cases of robbery on Russian citizens, travelling on
passenger trains across Poland, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Move to Promote Stagnant Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A newly adopted U.N.
resolution on sending about 5,500 peace-keepers to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) will surely help rekindle hope of the
peace in the war ravaged central African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution voted unanimously by the U.N.
Security Council on Thursday, a total of 5,537 U.N. peace-keepers
including up to 500 military observers will be deployed in the DRC
to monitor its stagnant peace process.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed following all parties involved in the
DRC conflict kept their promise to fully ensure the safety of the
U.N. peace- keepers. Therefore, it has been received welcome from
the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the government of the DRC said the government
will " accept the deployment" and allow the deployment to go
ahead, despite it was disappointed that the U.N. resolution does
not clearly ask those countries who back rebels fighting to topple
the government led by President Laurent Kabila to withdraw their
military forces from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Both Ugandan and Rwandan government officials hailed the U.N.
move as a good decision to push forward the stagnant DRC peace
process in separate telephone interviews with Xinhua on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi
said: " Uganda welcomes the resolution and we hope the United
Nations will send more soldiers soon."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Rwandan official from the President's
Office, who preferred anonymity, described the deployment of U.N.
peace-keepers in the DRC as a piece of belated good news.
</P>
<P>
Regional leaders have time and again appealed to the
international community to help resolve the DRC issue so as to
restore peace and stability in the Great Lakes Region as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Lusaka for a regional summit on Wednesday,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said that the U.N. should move
in to accelerate the full implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement inked last July and August by all the belligerents.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu made a similar appeal at
the one-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution was passed at a crucial moment. It came
when continued violations of the cease-fire accord were
threatening to derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The DRC government forces and rebels have been engaged in
fighting on several fronts, blaming each other for firing the
first shot.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission, which was set up to monitor the
implementation of the cease-fire, seems hard to further promote
the peace process and looks helplessly at the fighting raging on.
</P>
<P>
The DRC civil war sucked in six close and neighboring countries
 with Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia supporting Kabila, and Uganda
and Rwanda backing rebels, soon after its breakout 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
It has posed a serious threat to the regional stability,
throwing the staggering regional economies into an even worse
situation.
</P>
<P>
Under such a circumstance, all belligerents have come to the
common understanding that early ending of hostility and deployment
of U.N. peace- keepers in the DRC would benefit all of them.
</P>
<P>
At the just-ended Lusaka summit, regional leaders reaffirmed
their commitment to the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that so long as all parties involved in the DRC
conflict will act in accordance with what they have promised in
the agreement, the U. N. peace-keepers will play a due role in
their mission and the peace in the DRC will be hopeful.

<HEADLINE> State Election to be held in Schleswig-Holstein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The state election in
Schleswig-Holstein will be held on Sunday. It is the first state
election this year and also the first one since the financial
scandal of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) broke out.
</P>
<P>
On September 27 1998 the coalition of the German Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens Party won the general
election, but from February 1999 on the SPD and the Greens have
been defeated for seven times at the state election and European
Parliament's election.In November 1999 the CDU's candidate Volker
Ruehe led still with 47 percent in state opinion polls. After
baring of the financial scandal the CDU found itself in a tight
situation. The CDU fell behind the SPD by ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the regional vote in Schleswig-Holstein state is
also a crucial test for the CDU and the man who wants to take over
the Christian Democratic Union(CDU) leadership and run for
chancellor in general election 2002.

Molina was vice consul in Cuban Interests Office in Washington
and preceded in the post Jose Imperatori, whom the U.S. government
charged with spying, and ordered to leave U.S. territory no later

</P>
<P>
Molina, who plans to travel to the United States, requested to
be deprived from the residual immunity "for the sake of the

Imperatori resigned his post and announced that he will remain
in the United States "with all the risks and consequences that
might be necessary to fight the slander that hurts my honor, that
of the Cuban Section of Interests in Washington, and that of my
motherland."
</P>

"The accusation made against me is absolutely false. In the
same way I consider my duty to say that the INS official is
innocent," said Imperatori in a letter addressed to the director

<HEADLINE> Jospin Returns Home From Turbulent Trip to Israel, Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin returned to Paris Saturday evening from his visit to Israel
and the Palestinian autonomous territories, which was marked by a
violent attack upon him by Palestinian demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Jospin was injured in his head by a stone thrown by the
Palestinians at the University of Bir Zeit in the West Bank
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place after Jospin said on Thursday in
Jerusalem that the attacks upon Israeli troops by Hezbollah
guerrillas in southern Lebanon were acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
When he ended a visit to the University of Bir Zeit, Jospin was
attacked by a rainfall of stones from Palestinian students who
surrounded him and his delegation members, including French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
His car was seriously damaged after being stoned and kicked for
several minutes by violent demonstrators, who blocked the exit
route of the motorcade of Jospin's.
</P>
<P>
Jospin cut short his visit to the Palestinians territories and
cancelled a visit to a refugee camp and a joint press conference
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Before he left Israel for home, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak called Jospin and expressed his support and salutation.
</P>
<P>
Jospin is due to meet with President Jacques Chirac next week
at a cabinet ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who first expressed his discontent about Jospin's
remarks on Hezbollah, has expressed his shock at the attack
against Jospin by the Palestinians, which was the first of this
kind ever met by a French leader when visiting the Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite his defeat in
primaries in New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona, Texas Governor
George W. Bush is leading over rival Senator John McCain
nationally in support rate, polls showed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The polls also suggest that McCain may face trouble in coming
primaries if he relies too heavily on Democrats and independents,
whose votes gave him victories over Bush in New Hampshire and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Among likely Republican voters in California's primary, Bush is
leading 48 percent to 23 percent, according to a Time/CNN poll.
Sixty percent of voters said Bush was more likely to win the
primary.
</P>
<P>
The California primary on March 7, also called "Super Tuesday",
will produce 162 delegates to this summer's Republican national
convention for presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
A Newsweek magazine poll also found Bush enjoying a 56 percent
to 27 percent lead nationally among registered Republicans and
those likely to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
It found that 62 percent expected Bush to win the presidential
election, down from 73 percent in the last poll in early February,
compared with 27 percent for McCain, 8 percentage points above
last month's.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Briefs Barak on Visit to Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on Saturday briefed his Israeli counterpart Ehud Barak on
his visit to the Palestinian territories and the incident he
experienced in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jospin phoned Barak before returning home from the Gaza airport
and updated him with his talks with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat over the issues concerning the Mideast peace
process and French-Palestinian relations, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, in the telephone conversation, also mentioned the
Ramallah incident, but no detail was given.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian students of Birzeit University in Ramallah stoned
visiting Jospin and his party Saturday, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, the University Council decided to
close down the university for three days since Saturday, to enable
the university to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
The council also issued a statement to condemn the bad behavior
of the students, who threw stones at Jospin's motorcade and chanted
anti-Jospin slogans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian security forces have already rounded up
15 palestinian students after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the university was part of Jospin's program of four-day
visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
In his lecture given in the university, Jospin told the
university teachers and students about France's policy towards the
Mideast peace process, saying his government will do everything
possible to help push the process forward.
</P>
<P>
But several Palestinian students asked Jospin during the lecture
why he termed the Lebanese Hezbollah as "terrorists" and requested
him to give the reasons to back his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Jospin refused to answer this question in detail, but said that
the French government strongly opposes Israel's occupation of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also said that his government supports the Palestinians
to establish an independent Palestinian state as occasion serves.

After his meeting with Barak in Jerusalem on Thursday, Jospin
told reporters that he condemned Hezbollah's attacks on Israeli
troops occupying south Lebanon as terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's remarks against the Hezbollah angered the Arab world
and other countries in the region. Lebanon summoned the French
Ambassador Philippe Le Courtier in Beirut on Friday, asking France
to explain the logic Jospin used when he said the resistance
movement in Lebanon is a terrorist movement.
</P>
<P>
Jospin told the university teachers and students that his
remarks represented no change in the policy of France, which has
often been seen as more sympathetic than the United States to Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac was reportedly angered by
Jospin's remarks, asking Jospin to report to him immediately after
his return to France.
</P>
<P>
Jospin arrived in the region on Wednesday for a four-day visit.
He went to the Gaza city Saturday afternoon to hold talks there
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Ramallah incident, Jospin cancelled his visit to a
Palestinian refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and his planned press
conference in the Gaza city on Saturday before flying home.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is a Lebanese resistance
military group fighting against the Israeli occupation troops since
1985 when Israel set up its so-called security zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Military activities inside the zone have been intensified since
the beginning of this year and seven Israel soldiers were killed
there so far.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diplomat Says He'll go on Hunger Strike against Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference just before the deadline the U.S.
set for his departure, Imperatori said he would clear his name of
allegations that he has a contact with a U.S. immigration official
charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"I have become the victim of a major slander. I have been
wrongly accused of doing intelligence work in the United States,"
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department announced last week Imperatori should
leave the United States by 1:30 pm Saturday and his diplomatic
privileges and immunities will be removed after the deadline.
</P>
<P>
However, Imperatori said he resigned his post as consular
officer at 7 a.m. this morning, thus voluntarily eliminating his
immunity six hours before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
"I shall remain in the same apartment where I have lived, and
as of this moment I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have
been absolutely cleared of the accusation brought against me," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The State Department announced earlier this week that
Imperatori may be arrested if he failed to leave the country by
the U.S. deadline.
</P>
<P>
"I shall not resist arrest, not even if I am handcuffed and
jailed. My morale and my truth will be my shield," Imperatori said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cuban Interests Section officials have been "
categorically and precisely instructed not to do intelligence work
in the United States" since the mission was opened 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Such instructions have been strictly observed and with
absolutely no exceptions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Imperatori was asked to leave the country after the FBI
concluded he was the Washington contact for Mariano M. Faget, a
Miami-based official of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
Faget was arrested a week ago on charges of spying for Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diplomat Defies U.S. Expulsion by Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuban diplomat Jose
Imperatori, who was ordered to leave the United States, went on a
hunger strike on Saturday to protest the expulsion and to gain
back his innocence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference just before the deadline the U.S.
set for his departure, Imperatori said he would clear his name of
allegations that he was a contact of a U.S. immigration official
charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"I have become the victim of a major slander. I have been
wrongly accused of doing intelligence work in the United States,"
he told reporters.

</P>
<P>
"Such instructions have been strictly observed and with

</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department announced Imperatori "Persona Non
Grata" after the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded he was
the Washington contact for Mariano M. Faget, a Miami-based
official of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
Faget was arrested a week ago on charges of spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government said that the expulsion is really a
maneuver to block the return of six-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who
was rescued in the sea off Florida after his mother drowned when
their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
Father of Gonzalez, backed by the Cuban government, asked the
boy to return to him. INS ruled the boy belongs to his father and
should be returned.
</P>
<P>
But the boy's relatives, supported by Cuban exiles and anti-
Cuba congressmen, insisted Gonzalez stay in the United States.
The boy still remain in Florida with his relatives.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Congress to Help Troubled Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Too few of these failing schools ever get enough help to turn
around," Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "With today's
action we are declaring as a nation that we will not fail our
children by tolerating failing schools ... Students can't aim high
in schools that perform low."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also offered the option of permitting a student at a"
chronically failing" public school to transfer to a public school
with a better record of achievement.
</P>
<P>
He announced state-by-state allocations from an existing 134-
million-dollar fund that states and cities can tap for struggling
schools, and release guidelines on how the money can be used most
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also asked Congress to approve the 250 million dollars
he requested for the accountability fund in his fiscal 2001 budget
proposal, so that states can make targeted, concentrated efforts
to fix schools that no longer perform for their students.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's guidelines suggest ways to strengthen curricula,
improve teacher training or close schools entirely and then reopen
them with stronger leadership and teaching staffs or reestablish
them as charter schools with community support.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Diplomat Charged With Spying Starts Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deadline given on February 19 by the U.S.Department of
State to Imperatori to leave the United States, after being
charged with alleged links of spying for the island with Mariano
Faget, an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) official,
comes due Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government announced that it would ask its diplomat
to remain in Washington to demonstrate the fallacy of the
accusation, whatever the consequences.
</P>
<P>
"My decision is voluntary. I do not belong anymore to the
Office of Interests. I will assume the responsibility and the
consequences," said Imperatori in a letter entitled "To the United
States people," published in this capital.
</P>
<P>
He said he will remain in the apartment where he has been
living and in hunger strike, until the accusation is completely
cleared."I will not resist if I am arrested, if I am manacled and
if I am jailed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State spokesman James Rubin said
Tuesday that if the Cuban representative does not go, he will lose
his immunity and will be subjected to U.S. laws. "If there are
reasons to arrest him, he will be arrested," said Rubin.
