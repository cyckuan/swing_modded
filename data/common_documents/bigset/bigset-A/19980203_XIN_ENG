<HEADLINE> U.S. Income and Spending Go Up Moderately in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. personal income had
a moderate 0.4 percent growth in December with spending nearly
keeping pace during the holiday shopping season, the Commerce
Department reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase in income followed stronger increases of
0.7 percent in November and 0.5 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, almost split equally between goods and
services, rose 0.3 percent in December after increasing 0.4
percent in November and 0.6 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1997, incomes rose 5.8 percent, a bit
faster than spending, which increased 5.4 percent. But tax and fee
payments to government shot up 11.4 percent. So disposable, or
after tax, income rose just 5 percent, a little slower than
spending.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Americans saved 3.8 percent of their disposable
income, down from 4.3 percent in 1996, which also represented the
lowest savings rate since 1939.
</P>
<P>
Income growth in 1997, the best in two years, indicated robust
6.7 percent growth in wages, a big 10 percent jump in farm income
and a 10.4 percent rise in dividends. Interest income rose only
4.5 percent; nonfarm business owners income, 4.3 percent; interest
income, 4.5 percent, and government transfer payments, such as
welfare and Social Security, 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The strongest spending category last year was services, up 6.5
percent. Spending on durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to
last three or more years -- rose 3.9 percent and non-durable goods
spending increased 3.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Pakistanis to Get Plots in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for Labor
and Manpower Sheikh Rashid Ahmed announced on Monday a decision to
acquire an exclusive sector in this capital city for overseas
Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Rashid said the government has decided to give to
overseas Pakistanis possession of the plots they have purchased in
various housing schemes before March 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to set up a special industrial zone
along the Lahore-Islamabad motorway for overseas Pakistanis, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The industrial zone will be specifically developed for overseas
Pakistanis, who can invest in various schemes, providing foreign
exchange and employment to the people.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to prepare vocational training
schemes and around 100 vocational training centers are to be set
up in the private sector all over the country to train manpower.
</P>
<P>
Courses will be provided in the use of computers, left-hand
driving, cooking and electrical work besides working knowledge of
English and Arabic languages, according to Rashid.
</P>
<P>
"We have got enormous demand for skilled labor and there is
strict competition and the days of sending unskilled labor abroad
are over," he said.
</P>
<P>
An insurance scheme has been launched for overseas Pakistanis.
Under the scheme, overseas Pakistanis who have been working abroad
for 10 years or more would be insured.
</P>
<P>
The scheme would provide numerous benefits to them if they are
disabled.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, to meet the emergency requirements or other problems
of the families of overseas Pakistanis, interest-free loans of up
to 100,000 rupees (about 2,270 U.S. dollars) would be extended.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Increase of Iraq's Oil Sale to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended an increase of Iraq's oil sale from
the current 2 billion U.S. dollars to 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general's proposal is aimed to allow Iraq to buy
more food, medicine and other humanitarian necessities for its
people and to alleviate the serious humanitarian crisis caused by
the stringent sanctions imposed on Baghdad by the UN since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said that for Iraq
to get adequate humanitarian supplies, it would have to pump 3.2
billion dollars more in oil in addition to the 2 billion dollars
in oil Iraq currently sells every six months.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said that since the oil-for-food program began a
year ago, it had become increasingly apparent that the sum of 2
billion dollars is inadequate to prevent further deteriorating in
humanitarian conditions and could not effect the improvement in
the health and nutritional status of the Iraqi population.
</P>
<P>
The current oil-for-food program now permits Iraq to sell oil
worth 2 billion dollars every six months to buy badly needed
humanitarian goods. Annan's new proposal adds 3.2 billion dollars
to the present amount.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general's recommendations are targeted
specifically to the health and nutrition sectors, with more than 1
billion dollars going to infrastructure repairs, including the
rehabitation of schools, hospitals, water and sanitation systems,
agriculture production, laboratory equipment, mine clearance and
the repair of dams.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian Agency for
Development Cooperation (NORAD) has recently signed an agreement
with the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) for supporting a
democratic electoral process in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The project initiated by UNDP focuses on strengthening the
Election Commission while encouraging greater participation of
women in democratic events at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, inked last December, is basically meant to
strengthen the Election Commission's capacity to handle the
election process in a proper way, UNDP said in a news release here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alf Arne Ramslien, charge d'affaires of the Norwegian Embassy,
said here Monday, "The Norwegian government through NORAD
appreciates the opportunity to contribute to capacity building of
the democratic process which is linked to the Election
Commission's role."
</P>
<P>
Norway's participation in this particular project is an
extension of the previous ad-hoc support to the government of
Pakistan for election work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramslien expressed the Norwegian Embassy's appreciation of the
project collaboration with UNDP, saying it considers this an
"excellent example of international cooperation in support of the
government of Pakistan."

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister of State
for Women's Welfare Tehmina Daultana said the government has taken
concrete measures for socio-economic development of women.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Pakistan Television at the weekend, the
minister said a private bank is being set up for the social
welfare of Pakistan's women.
</P>
<P>
The bank will have 95 percent women personnel and will give
loans to the deserving women on soft terms. It will also have some
funding from foreign agencies and be partly funded by the
government, according to Tehmina.
</P>
<P>
She said the bank would have best women bankers and grow to a
national level.
</P>
<P>
Women living in rural area could get loans from these banks to
start their own businesses in areas like cottage industry, poultry
farming and agriculture, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Crisis centers are being set up to combat violence against
women and two such centers have already been established, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The centers are being opened aimed at checking violence against
women and educate them about their rights and duties, she added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said these crisis centers would be linked
with women police stations, health centers and legal advisers to
guide the affected women.
</P>
<P>
She hoped the centers and proposed banks would help women
achieve economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that women, who make up half of
Pakistan's population, should be provided the opportunity to play
their due role in the country's development.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, US Discuss Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz held talks Monday with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in Riyadh on arms inspection crisis in Iraq,
the Kuwaiti News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Albright discussed ways of pressuring Iraq into
backing down from its position on denying United Nations arms
inspectors access to presidential palaces suspected of concealing
banned weapons, the agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two sides voiced keenness to allow diplomacy to take its
full course towards convincing Baghdad to permit the U.N. arms
inspectors to carry out their mission unhampered, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors are in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons, before the U.N. Security Council can lift the sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the inspectors from searching the presidential
palaces on grounds of national sovereignty, and the U.S. has
threatened military strike to force Iraqi compliance with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Albright expressed hope that Iraq would defuse the
tension by complying with the U.N. resolutions to avoid military
actions, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the necessity of Iraq's full cooperation, Saudi
Arabia favors a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis rather
than a military option.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Riyadh earlier Monday after visiting
Kuwait, where she won firm support for military actions to force
Iraqi compliance should diplomatic efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
She will go to Bahrain and Egypt after wrapping up her visit to
Saudi Arabia.

<P>
MOGADISHU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu, capital of the
war-torn Somali enjoyed peace and tranquility Monday with people
of different clans cheering for peace.
</P>
<P>
The largest gathering of the Mogadishu's dominating Hawiye
clan has been held at Ramadan hotel in pursue of the
implementation of the Cairo Peace Declaration signed by 28 Somali
faction leaders in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was attended by more than 500 clan delegates
was also attended by the main faction leaders who each led 30
member delegates representing their respective clans.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cheering people from the various clans in the
capital, Mogadishu, were also outside the busy hotel to witness
the great event and the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one hundred battle wagons belonging to the factions who
earlier shared bitter street fighting in the capital have also
been together in harmony under a single security committee.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed who chaired the conference spoke emotionally
about the past catastrophic civil war and especially the fighting
in Mogadishu between the Hawiye clans who toppled the former
dictatorial regime of Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi has then asked the people to forgive each other and open
a new page for Somalia's contemporary policy in accordance with
the recent Cairo agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi also spoke about the need to establish a representative
government for Somalia which consists of administrative
technocrats.
</P>
<P>
The one day long meeting has also called the Hawiye
communities to reconcile, forget all grudges and stand up for the
implementation of the Cairo agreement and the pacification of the
capital and the rest of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The conference has supported all proposed agendas and
applauded for the speech of Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
The politicians, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, Osman Ali Atto,
Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, Abdi Osman Farah and many others who all
sat beside Ali Mahdi also stood up an` sang the national anthem
hand in hand together with all the participants of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the meeting, two members from each clan
stood up to declare their support for the Cairo agreement and
their willingness towards more peaceful Somalia.
</P>
<P>
There has been a sense of peace and calmness in Mogadishu ever
since the Cairo meeting was signed despite occasional banditry
and looting here and there.
</P>
<P>
The green lines that divided the Somali capital for more than
seven years now have also been abolished after the faction
leaders have called for their total dismantling in their first
meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders themselves have been crossing back and
forth the former green lines visiting each other and holding
indoor meetings.
</P>
<P>
Three Mogadishu-based warlords -- Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hussein
Mohamed Aideed and Osman Hassan Ali -- met Sunday and agreed to
re-open the city's main ports and airport, closed since UN troops
withdrew from Somalia in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Though no date has been fixed for the re-opening of the ports,
the three sides have agreed to meet again Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Loan Risk in Europe From Asian Crisis Manageable: S&AMP;P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- European banks could face losses
of up to 20 billion US dollars on their lending to Asia, according
to new estimates from Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating agency.
</P>
<P>
Using data supplied by individual banks, S&AMP;P calculates
European bank credit exposure to South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia
and Malaysia, the four most affected by the current economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
It expects that the exposure totals could be 110 billion US
dollars to 130 billion US dollars, saying 30 percent of all Thai
bank loans and 50 percent of Indonesian loans to be
"non-performing" in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, S&AMP;P still believes European banks are strong enough to
weather the shock. "The potential damage is manageable in the
context of the capital strength and indeed the earnings capacity
of the European banking sector," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Other rating agencies estimated losses in Asia are equivalent
to 7-9 percent of common equity for European banks with the
largest exposure, or 30-40 percent of one year's pre-provision
earnings.

LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- House prices in London rose by
more than 40 percent last year compared to 12.1 percent
nationally, according to Nationwide's latest Housing Finance
Review.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase in property values in the capital has
started to slow down. House price inflation in London slowed to 17
percent in the fourth quarter from 23 percent in the third
quarter.
</P>

Nationwide predicts the increase in property values on a
national level will also slow down to an annual increase of 7
percent this year with a rise of 5 percent in the number of sales.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the housing market is also reflected in the
number of mortgages granted by building societies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Building Societies Association (BSA), the
number of net advances fell to 539 million pounds (862 million US
dollars) last month from 825 million pounds (1,320 million US

HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Dollar opened
the week stronger Monday against major currencies on the back of
relenting import pressure and the promised 3.3 Billion Zimbabwean
Dollars (176 million U.S. Dollars) credit support from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The buying rate for the Dollar was 16.34 Zimbabwean Dollars
against the U.S. Dollar while the selling rate was 17.81
Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Zimbabwean Dollar crashed 75 percent against the
world's premier currencies under immense import pressure and
heavy speculation.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, last year, the exchange rate for the Dollar
was 25 Zimbabwean Dollars against one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Association of Zimbabwe
Zibusiso Nkomo Monday said, "companies that had gone on a panic
buying of foreign currency at the end of last year are now merely
effecting their payments and we are seeing more of receipts while
demand has fallen."
</P>
<P>
However, he said while the promised IMF facility would also
help stabilize the Dollar, at the moment it only brought in
confidence on the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the IMF announced that it had agreed in principle
to release a 3.3 billion Zimbabwean Dollars stand-by balance of
payment support to Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Asian Vehicle Demand Forecast to Fall Sharply in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian car market is forecast
to shrink sharply this year due to the region's financial crisis
and will not recover to its peak levels in 1996 until 2001, said
the Economist Intelligence Unit today.
</P>
<P>
The unit said vehicle sales in Asia, one of the fastest growing
car markets in the world before the economic crisis, will fall 29
percent this year to return to the level of 1992.
</P>
<P>
It said that taken together with a drop of 7 percent in 1997,
this will amount to a loss of 2.35 million vehicles over two years
compared with a stable market environment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the region's share of the world market will fall
to only 8 percent this year from 11 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It expected sharp falls in demand in South Korea and in the
Southeast Asian countries worst hit by the crisis. Sales in
Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia are expected to fall
by 70 percent, 60 percent, 37 percent and 33 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the fall in China and India is forecast to be more
moderate at 5 percent and 9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said that falls in the regions vehicle output
will not be as notable as sales, as some countries will be able to
export some of their production to more mature markets.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle industry of the region will face intense
competition, greater price pressures, fewer incentives from
governments and greater pressure to cut imports and increase
exports, the unit added.

<HEADLINE> Specialist Urges Enough Attention to "Millennium Bug" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 80,000
computers will face the "millennium bug" when the century changes
at midnight on December 31, 1999, but not sufficient attention has
been given to the problem, Peter de Jager, a specialist on the
bug, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, de
Jager said, "Everybody is aware of the problem. Few people have
any understanding of the consequences."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the timing bug could throw computers around the
world into confusion.
</P>
<P>
Telephone companies are now saying they cannot guarantee a dial
tone when the clock ticks forward into the new millennium;
airlines are admitting they cannot guarantee all flights; and
public authorities are passing laws to stop themselves from being
sued for failure to honor welfare and other payments as a result
of any glitches in programs.
</P>
<P>
De Jager said he was alarmed that businesses and governments in
Europe are not giving the problem attention because they are more
concerned with the advent of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Yet programmers still do not have an idea of how to change the
currency rates in programs because they do not know the euro's
exchange value or which countries will join.
</P>
<P>
Most businesses operate on a 12-month forecasting cycle,
meaning they will have to sort out their computer problems by
January 1, 1999. However, he said, 86 percent of all projects in
the computer industry run late.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Looks Into Violation of Angola's Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African government is
investigating the violation of Angola's air space by a private
plane from South Africa last month, the official Angola News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by South African Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo in an interview with a Mozambican weekly "Domingo" which
published the interview on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the South African government has directed the
security forces to look into the above-mentioned incident. Any
officials, if found to have been involved in it, will be
punished, he added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his country will continue to support the
Angolan peace process, observe the UN sanctions against UNITA and
make its contributions to the realization of final peace in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The South African plane was forced down on January 20 near
Menongue, a city in southwestern Angola by the Angolan air force
for transporting cargo for the opposition National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Three crew members and five
passengers aboard the plane were detained by the Angolan side.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Plans to Introduce Tough Drink-Drive Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain today unveiled plans to
introduce tougher drink-drive laws to reduce the number of deaths
due to drink-driving in a government consultation paper.
</P>
<P>
The consultation paper published today by the Department of
Transport asked for views on a cut in the legal drink-drive limit
to the equivalent of two glasses of wine and on a two-tier system
of punishment for drink-driving offenses.
</P>
<P>
It proposes a reduction of the blood alcohol limit from 80
milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood to 50
milligrams, the same as in France, Belgium and other countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that John Prescott, deputy prime minister,
confirmed plans of a two-tier system of punishment in which
breaking the lower limit would lead to a fine while violating the
present higher level could lead automatically to a ban.
</P>
<P>
Alcohol-related deaths in the UK have remained static, at about
540 a year, for the last four years and police and road safety
campaigners have long argued for lowering the legal drink-drive
limit.

<HEADLINE> SADC Peacekeeping Force May Come True: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The dream to establish a
Southern African Development Community (SADC) peacekeeping force
may soon be a reality as efforts are being made to determine how
realistic the objective is, a Zimbabwean minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge, who was part
of a delegation of defense, foreign affairs and home affairs
ministers from 10 SADC countries who visited Bosnia and Denmark,
told a press conference here Monday that the region was now
studying the technicality of setting up a regional peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
The delegation from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, Swaziland, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe
had a chance to observe Danish participation in multinational
peacekeeping in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"We were there in the context of the SADC Organ on Politics,
Defense and Security, trying to see what to learn from there on
the possibility of having a SADC peacekeeping force," Mudenge
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Denmark, which already funds a number of peacekeeping
training programs through the Zimbabwe Staff College, had
expressed willingness to provide support for further endeavors in
the field.
</P>
<P>
As a follow up to the visit, Denmark had invited two military
personnel from each of 12 SADC countries to study the technical
aspect of setting up the regional force.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of the military personnel based on the
European visit would be submitted by the defense ministers to the
SADC leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the regional peacekeeping force could also
operate in the context of the Organization of African Unity as
well as participate in multinational operations.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Ratify All Eight Protocols by June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) has given itself a deadline of June
30 this year to ratify its eight outstanding protocols which form
the basis of cooperation in the 14-member group.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge Monday said
it was a matter of concern that only Botswana had ratified all
the protocols, while both Zimbabwe and South Africa had ratified
only two each.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the delays on government officials whom he said did
not seem to realize the importance of the swift implementation of
the SADC cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the ministers understand the importance of these
protocols but the officials are just sitting on these issues. But
Zimbabwe will go to the next SADC meeting in Mauritius with all
the remaining six protocols ratified," he said.
</P>
<P>
SADC member countries include Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, South Africa,
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe as well as the recently admitted
Seychells and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> Normalcy Returns to Rival Communities in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Peace has returned to the Ife
and Modakeke communities in west Nigeria's Osun State after a
week-long bloody clash with some shops opening for business.
</P>
<P>
However, few people were seen on major streets of the ancient
city, where stern looking mobile policemen manning strategic
locations, the official newspaper New Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the churches in the city recorded a low turn out as
people preferred to stay indoor out of fear created by the
reckless shooting.
</P>
<P>
State Police Commissioner Sunday Aghedo declared that the
police had to take decisive action since all their earlier pleas
for peace fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
He did not give details of the police decision, but maintained
the two rival communities would think twice before embarking on
any violent action.
</P>
<P>
The latest hostilities, which started early last Monday, was
caused by some Ife youths who stormed the Oke Yidi praying ground
where the Modakeke Muslim faithfuls go for prayers and began
felling the trees there.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people, including two mobile policemen, were
killed during the clash, with about 50 houses destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The two communities began the war last August over the
relocation of the Ife-East local government headquarters from
Modakeke to Oke-Ogbo in Ile-Ife.
</P>
<P>
The intermittent clashes have claimed the lives of more than
100 people, injured over 200 others and caused huge economic
losses as many houses and properties were damaged.
</P>
<P>
However, observers doubt whether the fragile peace can last
long as the people of Ile-Ife cautioned on Sunday the state
government against official bias in the crisis between them and
the Modakekes.
</P>
<P>
The state administrator has pronounced that Ife claim to Oke
Yidi after Modakeke had used the place for decades "is
unacceptable" to his government.
</P>
<P>
The Ifes rejected the pronouncement, saying that it was
colored with bias and emphasizing "Modakeke has no inch of land
in Ifeland, either by inheritance or donation".
</P>
<P>
"No one can donate an inch of our land to them and expect to
see peace even if every inch of Ifeland is filled with soldiers,"
they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The state administrator, Lt.-col. Anthony Obi said however his
government would adopt drastic measures in finding a lasting
solution to the Ife-Modakeke crisis.

<HEADLINE> French Scientist Offers Tips for Efficient Internet Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Director of Cite des
Sciences of France Joel de Rosnay offered here today his
suggestions to help those who are stuck, lost, or spend too much
time in their search for information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
At a session on the Internet of the annual meeting of the World
Economic Forum, de Rosnay gave the following suggestions:
</P>
<P>
1. Europeans should use the Internet in the morning so far as
possible, before the 49 million US "Internauts" have connected;
</P>
<P>
2. Use fast modems, 28.8kbs or above. The investment is well
worth the time saved;
</P>
<P>
3. De-activate graphics for faster downloads. This can usually
be done through the "Options" on the menu bar of Web browsers;
</P>
<P>
4. The most important tip and the clever way to use the
Internet is to open several Web pages at a time, rather than
waiting for each successive page to download. While one page is
loading, go to another. If the modem is a 28.8kbs, up to 14 pages
can be downloaded at once at full speed.
</P>
<P>
Finally he advised: stick to an "Information Diet." "Limit your
time, as you limit your lunch, so you are not swamped with
information."

<HEADLINE> Doctors Develop New Scanning Method for Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- British doctors have developed a
new scanning technique for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The new method, using special antibodies armed with a tiny
amount of radioactivity, can determine whether cancerous cells
have spread to the lymph nodes under the armpit.
</P>
<P>
It can tell breast cancer patients how extensive their
operation is going to be and will eliminate the need for surgery
in women with no sign of cancer spread, researchers told a new
conference.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the technique could also be used as an important
prognostic tool, said doctors from the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only way to know if cancerous cells have reached
the lymph nodes is to remove and examine the lymph tissues, which
will result in a painful operation for women with breast cancer.

<HEADLINE> France Reiterates Need for More Diplomacy on Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine stressed here today that at the moment Paris is not
expecting military strike against Iraq though it still keeps "all
options open."
</P>
<P>
"When man tends to accept the hypothsis of a military strike,
it would lead to the impression that all diplomatic efforts have
already failed, which is not the case at the moment," said Vedrine
after talks with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, here today.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that it was now necessary and a matter of urgency
to intensify all diplomatic and political efforts to try to
persuade Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to comply with UN resolutions
with regard to arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
It was for this reason that Paris was sending the secretary
general of the French Foreign Ministry, Bertrand Dufourcq, to
Baghdad, who would carry a message from President Jacques Chirac
to Saddam Hussein, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that France was staying in close contact with
Russia and Turkey which also sent their own envoys to Iraq to try
to defuse the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a proof that diplomacy might work, Vedrine noted that
similar crisis had also emerged before but had then been resolved
after Baghdad finally changed its mind to allow the return of UN
arms-inspection teams.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM to Visit Egypt Within 48 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf is to arrive here within 48 hours as Baghdad
shores up diplomatic effort to defuse tensions in the face of
threatened U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf is expected to brief his Egyptian counterpart Amr
Moussa on Iraq's stance on the crisis with U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and the
implications of U.S. threat of use of force against Baghdad, the
Middle East News Agency learned.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister is expected to convey a message from
President Saddam Hussein to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
response to a letter sent by Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf also will meet with Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid here on Wednesday to seek support from the Arab
organization, which has voiced its opposition to the use of force.
</P>
<P>
A few hours ago, Abdel-Meguid announced his readiness to visit
Iraq immediately and meet with Saddam. He said this move comes
within the framework of Arab efforts to reach a peaceful
settlement to the crisis through diplomacy and avert any military
action.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf will also tour several other Arab capitals to seek
sympathy and support while some other Iraqi officials are on
urgent diplomatic missions elsewhere to expound Baghdad's position
on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a shift of Iraqi position, Saddam has reportedly agreed on
Monday to open eight presidential sites to U.N. weapons
inspectors, on condition that the inspection be conducted in the
company of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday al-Sahhaf reaffirmed Iraq's cooperation with
UNSCOM to expedite weapons inspection and secure the lifting of
the seven-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an emergency session of the Iraqi National Assembly,
al-Sahhaf said his country spares no effort to foil American
schemes to launch a military strike.
</P>
<P>
Most Egyptians sympathize with the plight of Iraqi civilians
suffering under U.N. economic sanctions. Egypt has opposed the use
of force in the current confrontation between the U.S. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday urged the
international community to exert further efforts to reach a
solution to the Iraq-U.N. standoff and warned that the use of
force will lead to further tension in the region.

<HEADLINE> Israel Deploys Patriot Missiles in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- In a move to prepare for a
possible attack by Iraq, Israel has deployed the American-made
Patriot anti-missile missiles in the south, Israel Radio reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman confirmed that four batteries of
Patriot missiles were deployed Sunday night on the hills near the
southern city of Arad in the Negev Desert. The areas around the
hills have been declared closed military zones, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who was not identified, however refused to link
the move to a possible military strike against Iraq by the United
States. This is part of a routine training program of the army, he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to attack Iraq militarily if it
continues to bar the United Nations Special Commission in charge
of eliminating its weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces suspected of concealing banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli army's assessment, the chance of an Iraqi
missile attack against Israel is low, but the Jewish state does
not dare to take any chance.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, in which Iraqi troops were driven out
of Kuwait by U.S.-led allied forces, dozens of Scud missiles fired
by Iraq hit Israel's busiest city Tel Aviv, causing property
damages.
</P>
<P>
There is fear in Israel this time around that Iraq, in
desperation, might fire biological or chemical missiles against
Israel in retaliation for a U.S. military attack.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated that Israel has
the right to decide how to respond should it be attacked. Reports
said the U.S. has urged Israel to keep a low profile as in the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Gas mask distribution centers have been busy these days as the
Iraqi crisis continues. In Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv, the
distribution center was still open at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the southern city of Eilat, where there is no mask
distribution center, traveled long distance to Arad to get the
masks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli hospital officials and medical experts
warned the government against the ill preparedness for a possible
biological and chemical attack.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the government add budgetary allocations to
better equip for a non-conventional warfare in the medical field.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG to Stay on in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Some soldiers of the west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) are expected to continue
staying in Liberia to help strengthen security and train the
national army, the government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected government of Charles Taylor has earlier set
February 2 as the deadline for the pullout of the 10,000-strong
ECOMOG, which was sent there in 1990 to help stop the bloody
civil war.
</P>
<P>
But Defense Minister Daniel Chea said Monday that as the force
has concluded its mandate, the government will no longer see
ECOMOG as a peacekeeping force but a capacity building mission to
strengthen security operators for post-war Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that under a new arrangement, between 4,000
and 5,000 ECOMOG troops are expected to remain in Liberia for
between six months and one year, quoted by the British
Broadcasting Corporation monitored here.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give further details of the fresh arrangement.
He neither disclosed whom the government made the arrangement
with.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, ECOMOG soldiers to stay on in
Liberia will involve three things -- to provide VIP protection
for the president, assist in the training of the post-war
Liberian armed forces and build capacity for the local security
forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the governments of Nigeria and Ghana have been
requested to help with the training aspect for, because of
language barriers, troops divided by francophone countries like
Burkina Faso will be involved mainly in the VIP protection.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) has arrived in the capital Monrovia to work out with the
government details of the mission of ECOMOG soldiers remaining in
Liberia, he disclosed.

<HEADLINE> France Seeks to Sell Second Hand Arms Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- France is seeking to sell its
second hand arms to foreign countries, as its armed forces are
having redundant arm stocks from the cutting of military personnel
since 1995, reported the daily Le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The French army alone is having 60 billion francs (10 billion
U.S. dollars) worth of second hand equipment for sale, while the
navy and air force are also reducing their scales, said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
France made at the end of 1997 the first delivery of
old-fashioned Mirage III and Mirage 5 combat aircraft to Pakistan,
which has ordered a total of 45 such planes, said the report.
</P>
<P>
France had kept secret the contract on Mirage aircraft with
Pakistan for a long time, in order not to irritate India, which is
considering buying the modern Mirage 2000 from France.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to India last month, President Jacques Chirac
promised not to sell Mirage aircraft to Pakistan any more.
</P>
<P>
France will train 250 air force pilots for Singapore for
several years in an air base in Cazaux, Landes in southwest
France, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Paris is also negotiating with Chile the sale of a 17,800-ton
navy squadron oil supply ship, La Durance, and 20 AMX-30 tanks.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Able to Defend Itself: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel has capabilities to
defend itself against any possible attack during the current
crisis with Iraq, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing students of a high school in the Israeli coast city
of Ramat Gan, Netanyahu stressed that Israel has the respondent
and deterrent capabilities, which any side interested in attacking
Israel should know and take it into account.
</P>
<P>
He admitted the current political atmosphere in the region is
not good for Israel, saying that "the situation in the Persian
Gulf reminded us the kind of Middle East in which we live."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also told Jewish leaders from the United States on
Sunday that Israel will decide how to defend itself in the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking the necessary precautions to defend ourselves
against any development in the Gulf. We will do anything that is
necessary to protect Israel's national security, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned
that if attacked by Iraq, Israel has the right to retaliate. He
confirmed the U.S. would give early warning to Israel of any U.S.
military strike.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli defense officials assessed that Iraq has no more
than several missiles armed with non-conventional warheads and
that there is only the slightest chance that Iraq would use them
or try to involve Israel in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
After her meeting with Israeli leaders, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has said that Washington is ready to use
"substantial force" against Baghdad and nothing will shake the
American commitment to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has reportedly set up a special
unit to maintain his biological weapons system and keep the United
Nations' inspectors from discovering it.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler said last week that
Iraq has sufficient quantity of biological weapons to "wipe out
Tel Aviv."
</P>
<P>
Israel has deployed U.S.-made Patriot anti-missile missiles in
the hope of intercepting Iraqi missile if they are fired at
Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
During 1991 Gulf War, 39 Iraqi Scud missiles were fired at
Israel after U.S. attacked Iraq. An Israeli man died of a heart
attack in the missile-attack and heavy property damages were
inflicted.
</P>
<P>
Israel bowed to U.S. pressure and did not retaliate for fear of
disintegrating the anti-Iraqi alliance mustered by the U.S.

the up-grading of the Debre Markos-Gondar, Woldiya-Alamata,
Betemariam-Woukro roads as well as the Awash-Kulubi gravel road.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamicheal said part of the loan will also finance the

<HEADLINE> London Crude, Natural Gas Trading Volumes Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- High price volatility saw
volumes of trade at London's International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) soaring last month, with new records set for Brent Crude and
Natural Gas futures.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the IPE, Brent Crude
volumes averaged nearly 55,000 lots a day last month, equivalent
to 55 million barrels or more than two thirds of total daily world
oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
The previous record of just under 50,000 lots was set in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Natural Gas futures also enjoyed a record trading month.
Volumes rose to just under 850 lots a day, equivalent to more than
25 million therms or a third of total daily UK natural gas
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Heightened tension between Iraq, the US and the United Nations
boosted volumes at the end of the month and led to prices rallying
by almost two dollars each barrel in the course of last week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, the financial crisis in the Asia-Pacific
region had a big impact on the global crude market.
</P>
<P>
Fears that demand growth in this key energy consuming region
would be lower than initially expected saw Brent Crude prices
falling through a key support level at 15 dollars a barrel to
14.70 dollars, their lowest level for almost four years.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas industry of the country recently celebrated the
first birthday of the futures contract which was launched on 31
January last year.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with last month's record volumes," said the
IPE's Executive Vice President for Business Development Richard
Ward.
</P>
<P>
"The recent price volatility has reinforced the importance of
risk management to any company that has an interest in buying or
selling energy," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Official: US, Turkey Share Opinion on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said here
Monday that both Washington and Ankara share the opinion that Iraq
must comply with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
United States Assistant Secretary of State Marc Grossman told
reporters that he and Turkish officials have discussed the lastest
developments of the arms inspection crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Grossman arrived here Sunday evening to brief Turkish Foreign
Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir on the crisis between Iraq and the
United Nations, and discuss ways of defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Grossman stressed that the U.S. and Turkey often hold high-level
dialogue to discuss international sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to launch a military strike to force
Iraqi compliance with the U.N. resolutions. A number of U.S.
senior officials are visiting countries in Europe and the Middle
East to rally support for the military option.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said last Friday that
Turkey would not play an active role in any military strike
against Iraq and would have reservation if involved passively.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Turkey's proposal to dispatch Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem to Baghdad to mediate a settlement of the crisis,
Grossman said that "If Turkey achieves a successful result, we are
firstly to celebrate Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Turkey announced Monday Iraq has accepted its mediation offer
and that Cem will go to Baghdad in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Urges Bosnia to Make Breakthrough in Implementing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bolstered by a new political
landscape in Bosnia, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said
today that Bonn is expecting Bosnian parties to achieve a
"breakthrough" this year to implement the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Bonn, Kinkel said that Bosnia
has reached a "turning point" after last month's election of a
moderate government in the Serb Republic, which means that both of
the two Bosnian political entities are now led by politicians
backing the implementation of Dayton peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's remarks came two days before a visit to Bonn by the
new prime minister of the Serb Republic, Milorad Dodik, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that one of the key demands he will make to the
Serb leader will be a swift return of about 250,000 Bosnian
refugees still living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Complaining that the repatriation of the refugees was moving
too slowly, Kinkel said, "1998 must be the year of return of
refugees."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the German foreign minister said that he will also
call on the new Serb government to speed up the reconstruction
process and to surrender more convicted war criminals to the UN
tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
According to Kinkel, Germany has spent 17 billion marks (9.3 US
billion dollars) to take care of refugees from all regions of the
former Yugoslavia since 1991 and has also contributed about 3
billion marks (1.6 billion dollars) in reconstruction aid for the
regions.

<P>
UNITED STATES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here today he stands ready to offer good office in
trying to resolve the latest crisis over Iraq's weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks after he briefed the Security Council on
his recommendations to increase Iraq's oil sale amount for the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the UN chief stressed that the UN
Charter required both governments and the secretary-general to
exhaust all peaceful means before undertaking military actions,
and he was standing ready to offer his good office for whatever
purposes might be deemed helpful by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said he had proposed that the Security
Council increase Iraq's oil sale amount which was aimed to address
the severe humanitarian crisis in Iraq and save Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He noted this move should not be linked with the latest crisis
over Iraq's weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief also expressed his concern about the increasing
tension brought about by Iraq's refusal to comply with relevant
resolutions of the Security Council, urging the Iraqi leadership
to understand that if they want sanctions to be ended -- if they
want to see light at the end of the tunnel -- Iraq must fully
comply with the relevant resolutions of the council.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said it was his hope that diplomatic
efforts to this end would succeed.

LUANDA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Angola produced 301,000 tons of
cement in 1997 and earned 35 million U.S. Dollars, making a new
record since its independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by General Manager of Angola Cement Plant
Endre Rygh on Monday when he was speaking to reporters.

in 1997, but the production was increased to 301,000 tons by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Rygh attributed the increase to the implementation of the
Lusaka peace agreement in his country and the efforts of his
plant to restore and increase production.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government will invest one million U.S. Dollars in
the cement industry this year to keep the momentum of cement
production for reaching the target of 350,000 tons of cement.

WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said today that an Iraqi compromise offer to settle
the crisis over weapons inspections was worth looking at but was
not a solution.
</P>
<P>
"It's something we will look at," Cohen to reporters. "I don't
think it's an appropriate solution at this time.... The best
solution is for the inspectors to have unfettered access."
</P>
<P>
Cohen's remarks came when Russian news agencies reported
earlier today Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told Russia's special
envoy to Baghdad, Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, that
he was ready to allow the United Nations to monitor eight new
sites and to meet chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been trying to mediate in the crisis in hopes of
averting a military attack by the United States over the weapons
inspections. The United States threatened a military strike to
force Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he did not have details of Saddam's offer, although
he understood Saddam was insisting on "additional personnel"
accompanying U.N. inspectors. He said Washington was concerned
that the inspection process would "not be politicized."
</P>
<P>
He said Washington did not want to have anyone but
U.N.-selected technical experts involved with the process.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Removal of traditional
non-tariff barriers within Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) has greatly facilitated trade among its member
states.
</P>
<P>
COMESA acting executive secretary general Erastus Mwencha made
the remarks here Monday at a workshop on the Operationalization
of the COMESA Customs Bond Guarantee Scheme.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the removal of the barriers, intra-COMESA trade
volume rose to 2.4 billion US Dollars in 1995 from 834 million US
Dollars in 1985, Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
COMESA countries have seen an "impressive" growth in exports,
averaging 7.2 percent per annum, Mwencha told the opening session
of the two-day workshop at Kilimanjaro Hotel in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
During 1991 and 1994, Uganda's exports increased by 151
percent, while Namibia rose 72 percent, Kenya 40 percent,
Mauritius 25 percent and Zimbabwe 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although all traditional non-tariff barriers have been
removed, he said, there still exist other barriers like the
documentation required to transport goods and poor communication
systems.
</P>
<P>
To speed up customs clearance, he said COMESA has introduced
Automated System of Customs Data to harmonize, standardize and
simplify customs procedures and documentations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same workshop, Tanzania's Minister for
Industries and Trade, William Shija said the COMESA states will
be able to meet the target of establishing a free trade area by
the year 2000, thanks to the solid support of transport and
communication facilities.
</P>
<P>
The minister listed several achievements made by COMESA, like
harmonized transit charges, harmonized axle load limits and
vehicle dimensions, as well as telecommunication
inter-connectivity.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Improve Food Transport to Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
signed Monday a 1.3-million-U.S.-Dollar agreement with the Kenya
Railways Corp. in a bid to have food aid delivered faster and
more cheaply to the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, WFP will provide parts to refurbish 10
locomotives on the line between Kenya's Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa and the Ugandan capital city of Kampala, according to a
news release issued by WFP regional office here.
</P>
<P>
The increased rail capacity will allow WFP to load food
shipments directly onto freight cars at the Mombasa port, saving
almost 7,000 Dollars daily in warehousing costs. Turnaround of
freight cars will be shortened to be completed by five days
</P>
<P>
The U.N. food aid organization moves 9,000 tons of food aid a
month -- enough to feed 850,000 people for the month -- from
Mombasa to the main dispatch point in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa line to Uganda is one of two links for
transporting food to WFP relief projects in the Great Lakes
region. WFP, which is one of Kenya Railways' largest client,
moved a total of 110,000 tons of food on the line during 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This route is a lifeline for the Great Lakes region," said
Russell Ulrey, WFP Regional Logistics Officer.
</P>
<P>
"The project will enable WFP to deliver more food aid, faster
and at lower cost to the people who need it most," he added.
</P>
<P>
WFP also has an agreement with the Tanzanian Railway Corp,
under which it has provided locomotives, spare parts and
technical assistance. The body is also discussing a similar
accord with the Uganda Railway.
</P>
<P>
WFP has carried out a number of multi-million-Dollar railway
projects in southern Africa and the Caucases to improve the
efficiency of its food aid operations.

in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In response to Russia's call, Saddam Hussein named eight

As concerns all other sites, Saddam Hussein said, "The form of
inspection which was discussed earlier will remain in place."
</P>
<P>
There are dozens of sites in Iraq regarded as "presidential"
and closed to international inspectors, the press service said.

AMMAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said Monday it will not
allow the United States or any force of the anti-Baghdad alliance
to use its territory or airspace to launch attacks against Iraq.

<P>
"Jordan will not be a base and will not serve as a passage for
any American action against Iraq," Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan

The U.S. has threatened military strike to force Iraqi
compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.

security, sovereignty and dignity
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hassan called on Iraq to fully implement the U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday denied a report
in the Los Angeles Times newspaper that President Mohammad Khatami
has sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton through the
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said this
was yet another U.S. attempt to make up that a change has appeared
in Iran's position toward the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Giving an example of the U.S. endeavor to achieve that goal,
Mohammadi said U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson also said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi had
received his greetings at the world economic forum in Davos,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
There is no room for any negotiations or improvement of
relations with Washington unless the U.S. gives up its unrealistic
policies towards Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the U.S. have entered a subtle
stage after the two presidents expressed expectation for more
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In December and January, Khatami formally called for cultural
dialogue between the two peoples in order to make a "crack on the
wall of mistrust" between the two countries, although he stressed
"no need to have ties with the U.S. administration."
</P>
<P>
In response, Clinton said on Thursday that he expected more
exchanges between the American and Iranian peoples and a good
relationship with Iran again in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts said the two countries have embarked on some
sort of secret contacts for a future rapprochement, though both
claimed to pursue a "wait and see" policy toward each other.

BONN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Interior ministers from Germany's
16 federal states Monday decided at a meeting to continue
expelling illegal Algerian immigrants despite stronger human

terrorized by massacres.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the ministers based the decision on a foreign
ministry report which concluded that no expulsion ban was
necessary given that people in Algeria were not being persecuted
on grounds of race, religion or nationality.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the ministers rejected such a ban for fear
of encouraging more Algerians to seek refuge in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Official data show there are 17,500 Algerians in Germany, with
6,400 of them having been denied asylum status or a residency
visa. Asylum recognition cases of a further 3,000 Algerians are

<HEADLINE> Argentina Supports Lebanon on Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Argentine President
Carlos Menem Monday expressed his country's support to Lebanese
demand for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Menem
said Argentina supports the implementation of the United Nations
Security Council resolution 425 and the realization of a
comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution demands that Israel unconditionally pull
back its troops from south Lebanon, where Israel set up a security
zone in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border Muslim guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Menem also expressed hopes that the stalled Mideast peace
process will be resumed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Lebanon and Israel, Syria and Israel
were suspended in early 1996 and the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations deadlocked in March 1997 due to Israel's hardline
policy.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Menem praised the Lebanese-Argentines for
their important role in promoting the development of Argentina's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has a population of more than 34 million, of which
1.5 million are the Lebanese-Argentines.
</P>
<P>
Menem, who arrived here Monday afternoon, is expected to
address the Lebanese Parliament and hold talks with Speaker Nabih
Berry and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He will travel to Egypt Wednesday after wrapping up visit
here.

<P>
CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Arrived here Tuesday afternoon at the last stop of her
week-long tour in Europe and the Mideast to mass up support for a
possible military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Albright will hold talks with President Hosni Mubarak and
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the developing crisis in the Gulf
and the latest developments of the U.S.-sponsored peace process in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss means of promoting relations
between Egypt and the United States especially through the
Egyptian-American partnership program that was initiated by
Mubarak and U.S. Vice. President Al Gore in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Albright is to hold a press conference following the talks and
before leaving Cairo on her way back to Washington at the end of a
Mideast tour which also took her to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, together with many other countries, has opposed the use
of force against Iraq and exhorted more diplomatic efforts to
defuse the tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held a flurry of telephone consultations with 14 Arab
leaders on Monday to ensure there is a common positive Arab stand
on giving diplomacy a full chance to work on the breathtaking
developments in the Iraq-U.N. faceoff.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf emirates, where the U.S. maintains its forces ashore
and afloat, have backed Washington Tuesday in warning Iraq of
grave consequences if it fails to comply with U.N. demands for
granting its special commission team full access to suspected
weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors have to verify Iraq has destroyed its chemical
and biological weapons programs to pave way for lifting a
seven-year-old U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq after the 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the Bahrain emir, Albright said her country
would stick to its demand on unrestricted inspection of the sites
where biological and chemical weapons material are suspected to be
hidden.
</P>
<P>
Since last Wednesday, Albright has also toured several European
states including France, Spain and Britain.
</P>
<P>
She has won unequivocal support from Britain in using military
means against Baghdad if diplomacy fails to resolve the present
crisis over the United Nations arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France, Russia and China have been resisting the tough
U.S. stance and are still pressing for a non-military solution to
the crisis.

ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The chief of a major Japanese
car-maker predicted that automobile industry of the Asian region
will be bidding for recovery this year from the shocks of the

</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to predict the prospects for automobile
industry during 1998," Managing Director of Japan's Toyota Motor

</P>
<P>
The automobile sector of Japan had to face stagnation during
the financial crisis in the Asian block in the latter part of
1997, Saito said.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1998 would rather be a period of recovery for
automobile industry of Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota firm chief appreciated the present policy of the
Pakistani government regarding the automobile sector, saying it
will greatly stimulate efforts to promote the local auto industry.
</P>

Long-term and consistent government policies will provide a
sound ground for the automobile industry in Pakistan to grow at an
accelerated pace, Saito said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the pledge that his company will continue to
contribute its share to the development of the car industry in
Pakistan.

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Allauddin Broujerdi, special representative of the Iranian
president for Afghanistan affairs, arrived in the northern Afghan
city of Mazar-e-Sharif as the leader of an Iranian delegation.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival at Mazar-e-Sharif, the headquarters of the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, Broujerdi said his country is
willing to work for the restoration of peace and tranquillity in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit is aimed at starting fresh endeavors for
ending internal war and bringing the Afghan groups closer to
reaching a consensus on the restoration of peace.

<P>
Broujerdi said that as chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, Iran feels responsible for restoring peace and
ending war and bloodshed in Afghanistan.

their responsibility and give up their difference for restoration
of durable peace in that country," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Broujerdi is expected to hold talks with ousted Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and other Afghan leaders during the

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- One worker was killed and
dozens of others were injured in an explosion at a factory in
southern Pennsylvania on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred workers were inside when the blast came at the
York International Corporation plant at York City at 11:30 p.m.
EDT (0430 GMT Tuesday). Dozens of dazed and injured workers
struggled to get out of a collapsed building while the rest fled.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, rescue crew combed through the rubble, but
everyone was accounted for. About 20 people were treated for burns
and respiratory problems at hospitals in the city, west of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The blast was felt 40 kilometers away and large metal chunks of
debris littered residential streets 12 blocks away.
</P>
<P>
The factory makes refrigeration, heating and air conditioning
units. Witnesses said a vapor plume above the plant was burning
the eyes and throats of people nearby.
</P>
<P>
York International was No. 419 on the Fortune 500 list last
year, with 3.219 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 sales. The company

<HEADLINE> Rural Shanghai Residents Undergo Changes in Lifestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Residents living in the rural
and suburban areas of China's largest metropolis are catching up
with their urban counterparts in terms of clothing, food and
housing.
</P>
<P>
An official survey shows that rural residents in Shanghai have
experienced profound changes in their lifestyle and ideology.
</P>
<P>
Their food regimen has been much improved, the survey
shows. Compared with the early 1980s, local farmers have increased
their yearly consumption of meat by 47.6 percent; fowls and eggs,
210 percent; aquatic food, 160 percent; and fruit, 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the per-capita daily intake of protein for local
villagers is 75 grams, five grams more than in the early 90s, and
the proportion of animal protein has gone up 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that residents in both rural and urban
areas in Shanghai have increased the quality and quantity of
clothing purchases. The average per-capita expenditure on clothing
by local farmers has reached 249 yuan, 130 percent increase over
the figure for the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
Rural people in the city each spends 726 yuan on housing costs,
2.8 times the expenditure in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of local farmers have moved into new
apartments. All the newly-built residential structures are
steel-wood construction.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, many rural people have decorated their
houses. Improvements include the fact that 36.3 percent of the
rural houses are now equipped with modern sanitary facilities;
76.1 percent use gas for heating and cooking; and 26 percent have
home telephones.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many local farmers have built luxury houses or
have purchased residential apartments in urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Wreckage of Philippine Plane Spotted, Search Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A possible wreckage site of the
ill-fated Cebu Pacific plane carrying 104 people was spotted in a
mountainous area in Mindanao, but search operations were called
off late Tuesday afternoon due to low visibility.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Tuesday evening, the Air
Transportation Office of the Department of Transportation and
Communications said the Philippine Air Force spotted the wreckage
site on the northeast slope of Mt. Sinagaya at an elevation of
about 6,700 feet (more than 2,000 meters) above sea level.
</P>
<P>
"It was also noted that what appears as aircraft fuselage and
plastic debris is scattered all over the mountain but mostly at a
southwesterly direction of the possible point of impact," the
office said.
</P>
<P>
"Further verification could not be made due to extreme
gustiness in the area and the very thick vegetation and forest
cover which characterizes the area," it said.
</P>
<P>
The office said there was no debris which could positively
identify the wreckage as that of the missing plane, Cebu Pacific
Flight 387.
</P>
<P>
According to local television reports, the search operations by
the Philippine Air Force were called off late in the afternoon due
to low visibility and will resume Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
There are conflicting reports about casualties in the air
disaster. In the morning, the official Philippine News Agency said
members of a non-governmental organization team have found 15
survivors and 30 dead bodies in Mt. Sinagaya, Claveria, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Inspector Apolonio Santos of Misamis Oriental, Mindanao, also
said a group of rescuers, who trekked the mountainous area between
Gingood City and Claveria Town, carried the dead bodies and 15
survivors on foot down the rugged terrain toward Claveria, Misamis
Oriental in the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But Cebu Pacific Air, the owner of the plane, said late in the
day that reports about the survivors might not be true.
</P>
<P>
The passenger plane went missing Monday on a flight from the
Philippine capital of Manila to Cagayan de Oro City, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Air Force, Cebu Pacific Air and the Air
Transportation Office suspended their air search operations for
the plane late Monday afternoon due to bad weather and low
visibility. Ground and air rescue operations resumed early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Several teams have been sent to comb a mountainous area
northeast of the airport.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area is on the flight route of the plane, which
lost radio contact with the Lumbia airport air tower while flying
over the area before approaching the airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which took off from the Manila Domestic Airport at
09:30 Monday, was scheduled to land in the Lumbia airport, some
500 miles (800 kilometers) south of Manila, at about 11:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
But the plane, which made a brief stopover in Tacloban City,
failed to arrive at the destination.
</P>
<P>
Air transport officials said the pilot of the aircraft, Captain
Paulo Justo, made a last radio contact 13 minutes before
approaching the runway of the Lumbia airport and reported no
trouble but asked for a priority landing.
</P>
<P>
Cebu Pacific Air, owned 49 percent by Filipino-Chinese
billionaire John Gokongwei, started operation in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The airline is one of several new airlines established after
the Philippine government deregulated the aviation industry two
and a half years ago. It has had no previous accidents.

<HEADLINE> 1.8 Million Villagers Gain Access to Drinking Water in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.83 million
rural people in the hilly areas of north China's Hebei Province
have gained access to drinking water in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the availability of drinking water to these people,
who are scattered among some 3,690 villages, Hebei has over the
years invested 3.58 billion yuan (430 million US dollars) in
building projects to divert, reserve and purify water. A total of
1,707 match-up projects at the city and county levels have also
been completed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hebei has beefed up its efforts to improve
irrigation, afforestation and the environment. During the last few
years the province has sunk 218,000 wells and built 294,600
small-size water conservation projects, enlarging the irrigated
acreage by more than 600,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hebei has adopted effective measures to curb water
pollution, such as closing down nearly 10,000 polluting
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Continued Economic Slump in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean manufacturers said
that a severe economic slump will appear this month despite signs
of domestic currency market stabilization, according to a survey
issued by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted among 600 largest companies, said that
economic outlook is gloomy because recovery in exports will be
delayed and consumers' demand is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
The companies blamed the delayed export recovery on high
interest rates and poor corporate finance saddled by the
reluctance of banks to issue export letters of credit.
</P>
<P>
Most industrial sectors will suffer setbacks from soaring
import prices of oil and other raw materials due to the sharp
devaluation of South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, the
survey added.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, is in
desperate need of foreign currency to overcome the current
financial crisis triggered by the collapse of a slew of
conglomerates and the bad loans of financial institutions late
1997.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund
for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to
restructure its economy, continue its high interest rate policy
and completely open its financial market while it has to pay back
a large part of its debts totaling 153 billion dollars this year.

</P>
<P>
For centuries, the tiger is a symbol of bravery and power and

</P>
<P>
Tsang voiced full confidence that the Hong Kong economy,
affected by the regional financial turmoil since the latter half
of last year, will recover soon thanks to its solid foundation and
 the sustained development of China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Attending the gathering were Chief Executive of the Hong Kong

<HEADLINE> Macao Sees More Visitors during Chinese New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Macao received a total of 650,000
visitors during the Chinese Lunar New Year period, up 20 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Macao Government Information
Service on Tuesday said that between January 26 and February 1
Macao witnessed a remarkable increase in tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
There were 428,514 people coming via the border gate adjoining
Zhuhai City, south China's Guangdong Province, up 27 percent,
while the number of visitors coming from Hong Kong reached
200,000, up 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors coming by air also went up by 24 percent
in the period to more than 21,000.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials were very happy at the news, saying that the
rise means a "good sign of confidence in Macao's image as a unique
tourist destination in the region."
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to promote Macao as a place of
tranquillity, an ideal place for leisure and a place where East
meets West.
</P>
<P>
A leading economic sector of Macao, the tourism industry hires
one-third of Macao's workforce and accounts for about 43 percent
of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Macao received a total of 7 million tourists in 1997, down 14.1
percent from the previous year. The drop was blamed on the Asian
currency crisis, fewer tourist arrivals in Hong Kong and the
media's wide coverage of Macao's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
Macao remained relatively calm during the Chinese Lunar New
Year as police increased patrols along its major streets.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Meet to Deal With El-Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from countries
in the Asia-Pacific region opened a three-day conference here
today to discuss weather anomalies thought to be caused by El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-sponsored by the Asian Disaster Preparedness
Center and Thailand's National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, focuses on more efficient ways to predict the
impacts of El Nino and the weather changes caused by the
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is the name given to the occasional warming of surface
waters in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. It
causes disruption of the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical
Pacific, with important consequences for the weather around the
globe such as increased rainfall, flooding, drought, bush fires
and hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
The majority of participants in the conference, entitled "El
Nino and related crises in Asia," agreed that most of the
projected impacts of El Nino have come true as predicted. They
pointed to the El Nino-related weather changes in the region,
noticeably temperature rises of as much as three degrees Celsius
in Thailand, a lack of tropical cyclones in the Philippines and
heavy rainfall in coastal China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, Nick Graham of the U.S.-based
International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI)
predicted that most of Southeast Asia will experience less than
normal rainfall for at least the next three months.
</P>
<P>
He said the IRI also predicts that the region most likely to
suffer from severe drought will be in the eastern archipelagic
states, including the Philippines, eastern Indonesia and the
Malaysian state of Sabah. These areas have already suffered a
serious shortage of rainfall over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Panmao of the China National Climate Center spoke of the
heavy rainfall in coastal China and Taiwan, saying there will be
further heavy precipitation in southeastern China during the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
Aida Jose of Pagasa of the Philippine Weather Agency said:
"Normally, the Philippines receives an average of nine tropical
cyclones each year, but in late 1997 only two hit us."
</P>
<P>
"There were no tropical cyclones in September for the first
time in 30 years. When the storms came in from the Pacific, they
seemed to be 'afraid' of entering the Philippines and moved up
northward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yong Pok Wing of the Malaysia Meteorological Service said they
reported sub-normal rainfall during the haze crisis in Malacca
from July to October. "We think the haze may have suppressed the
convection currents, because there was heavy rainfall there toward
the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise so far concerning the impact of El Nino in
the Asia-Pacific region has been in Australia, which during
pervious events suffered severe nationwide drought.
</P>
<P>
"Given the magnitude of the El Nino event, the impact on
Australia has been fairly moderate," said John McBride of the
Australia Meteorology Research Center. "The southeastern portion
of the country was indeed quite dry at the end of 1997, but
elsewhere there has been higher than normal rainfall."
</P>
<P>
More than 100 researchers are taking part in the conference
held in Downtown Bangkok.

FUZHOU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
will strive to raise the proportion of machinery and electronic
products among its total exports.
</P>

The move is in part intended to make the mechanical and
electronics sectors two of the most important fields in Fujian's

</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the mechanical and electronics

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Approves Amendment on Public Utilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Parliament Tuesday
approved the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)
government's amendment bringing about changes in labour relations
in the loss-making or bankrupt Public Utilities and Enterprises
(DEKO).
</P>
<P>
The amendment was carried by 142 votes in favour and 121
against, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The amendment was in fact a reformulation of Clause 31 in the
tax bill giving the government the power to intervene in the
restructuring of ailing state firms such as the Hellenic Post
Offices, Olympic Airways, Greek Railways Organization and the
Urban Transport Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government faces its most difficult test so far as
farmers and trade unionists prepare to escalate their protests
against the policies of tight spending and radical restructuring
of the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have threatened to block the country's main highways by
tractors if Prime Minister Konstantinos Simitis refuses to meet
them.
</P>
<P>
Their demands include higher prices for their products and an
end to production quotas and penalties imposed by the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unionists from public utilities describe the ratification
of the amendment as a "hostile act."
</P>
<P>
In recent months, unionists have organized a series of
nationwide strikes and they have threatened to do so if the Greek
government makes no concessions to them.

ROME, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Italy and AC Milan coach
Arrigo Sacchi has declined an offer to coach Spanish champions
Real Madrid next season, local reports said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Real asked Sacchi this week to take over
from Dutchman Jupp Heynckes, who inherited the job from current AC
Milan coach Fabio Capello.
</P>
<P>
Sacchi rejected the offer not only because he wanted to work
either in France or England, but because he did not want to take
over a squad built by Capello, who led Real to the Spanish title
last season before taking charge of Milan.
</P>
<P>
Sacchi built the great AC Milan side of the late 1980s, guiding
them to two European Cup titles before taking over as Italian
national coach.
</P>
<P>
Capello stepped into his shoes, leading Milan to another
European Cup and four Italian championships.

WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright held talks in
Saudi Arabia with Crown Prince Abdullah. The Saudi government
later issued a statement saying that if diplomacy failed and the
U.S. attacked Iraq, the fault "would lie exclusively on the Iraqi
regime."
</P>
<P>
-- A poll taken by Tel Aviv University indicated that Israeli
believe that peace efforts with the Palestinians have come to a
stop. And commentators in Israel viewed the current impasse as a
low point in the American mediating effort.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton Monday sent Congress a document that
five years ago would have seemed like an impossible dream -- a
budget in surplus that is winning plaudits from Wall Street
economists and liberal Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday proposed doubling
the amount of oil Iraq can sell in exchange for food and medicine,
and urged that the humanitarian program not be linked to the
confrontation that has led the U.S. to threaten military action if
Baghdad continues to obstruct U.N. inspectors searching for
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The EU and U.S. are reviving plans to create a
trans-Atlantic free-trade pact. U.S. Trade Representative
Barshefsky and EU trade chief Brittan aim to set a negotiating
agenda in time for Clinton's May trip to Britain.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. AIDS deaths fell 44 percent in the first half of 1997,

21,460 in the first half of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Update Data on Private Sector Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
update its data on private sector debts and disseminate the
information to market players in an effort to ease the monetary
crisis, a government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to dispel rumors about the total amount of
Indonesia's private sector debts, Chairman of the Economic and
Financial Consolidation Council Tanri Abeng said after meeting
with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, the offshore debt of the
Indonesian private sector was 66 billion U.S. dollars at the end
of 1997 and most of the loans were short-term with a maturity of
between one and two years.
</P>
<P>
Abeng pointed out that private-sector debts have been incurred
by multinational companies, joint ventures between Indonesian and
foreign businessmen and purely Indonesian companies.
</P>
<P>
He said debts incurred by multinational companies have no
influence on the Indonesian economy while those owed by
joint-venture companies could be shouldered by both the foreign
and Indonesian partners.
</P>
<P>
Purely Indonesian companies however have to bear their debts by
themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abeng said the council and the team tasked to settle the
country's private sector debts are making a list of these debts,
their amounts and dates of maturity, the debtors and the lenders.
</P>
<P>
Many businessmen are buying U.S. dollars to pay for their
mature loans, he said, adding that about 228 companies owned by
about 54 tycoons are facing the obligatory servicing of their
mature loans.
</P>
<P>
Economists here held that the private-sector debts were one of
the main causes of the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah
against the U.S. dollar. The rupiah has dropped from 2,400 per
dollar in early July last year to the present 11,000 a dollar.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of More AIDS/HIV Cases in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine health experts
Tuesday warned of an expected rise in human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infections in the country after cases were recorded in areas
previously not reporting any, the Philippine News Agency reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey, conducted by the Health Department in 10 areas
and with 300 participants from six selected high-risk groups,
shows more than 1-percent HIV prevalence in some risk groups in
cities which did not have such cases before.
</P>
<P>
However, the same survey revealed that HIV incidence in the
country is still generally low and that it does not seem likely
the Philippines is going to have an HIV "explosion" like the one
Thailand experienced.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, high-risk behaviors are widespread
among those groups whose potential for sexually transmitted
diseases/HIV infection is highest.
</P>
<P>
The survey results came after the Health Department earlier
reported a 25-percent decrease in the number of recorded HIV/AIDS
cases last year compared with 1996. The country's cumulative
HIV/AIDS cases stand at 978.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, a Health Department AIDS expert also warned
that the Philippines is ripe for an HIV/AIDS epidemic if no
immediate steps are taken to reduce the rapid transmission of the
virus among the population at risk.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued after a four-year, seven-round survey of
12 cities nationwide targeting seven groups of people with
high-risk behaviors.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Further Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRETORIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday vowed to further develop relations between
his country and the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony to receive the letter of credence presented by
Chinese Ambassador Wang Xuexian, the first top Chinese diplomat
ever stationed in South Africa, Mandela said his government were
fully aware of China's contributions to South Africa's struggle
against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong, Zhou
Enlai, Zhu De and Liu Shaoqi, stressing that they had made
important contributions to the liberation struggle waged by the
South African black people.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also recalled his one-week visit to China in October
1992, during which he met General-Secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party Jiang Zeming, Premier Li Peng, and then State
President Yang Shangkun.
</P>
<P>
"That was a very successful visit," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was looking forward to Chinese President Jiang
Zeming's visit to South Africa, and expressed hope that he might
visit China again before he steps down as South African president
next year.
</P>
<P>
China established diplomatic relations with South Africa on
January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited
South Africa from December 28, 1997 to January 1, 1998 at the
invitation of his South African counterpart Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, Qian met Mandela and signed a joint
communique with Nzo on normalization of bilateral relations,
effective at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint communique, South Africa recognizes there is
but one China in the world, and that the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal government
representing the whole of China, and recognizes China's position
that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in China's Ningxia up 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Investment overseas from in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region grew by nearly 42
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Ningxia actually utilized more
than 60 million U.S. dollars in overseas investment last year, up
41.9 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in overseas investment has come mainly as a
result of improvements in the investment environment; the
attractiveness of abundant coal, power and agricultural resources;
and the launching of more investment and trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched market economy reforms in the late 1970s,
overseas investment has been mainly concentrated in its east and
coastal areas because of the availability of relatively better
infrastructure and preferential policies. In recent years China
has encouraged overseas investors to move to the less-developed
interior provinces and regions in an effort to boost economic
development there.
</P>
<P>
While Ningxia uses more overseas investment, it has also
implemented 23 projects funded by loans provided by foreign
governments or international financial institutions, with loans
totaling some 110 million U.S. dollars in contractual value.
</P>
<P>
To date, Ningxia has approved 512 projects funded by overseas
investment or loans, utilizing actual overseas investment in the
amount of more than 300 million U.S. dollars. The projects cover
energy, transportation, telecommunications, processing of
agricultural produce, machinery, light industry and poverty
reduct. Overseas investors come from 26 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Reassures Public Over Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army sent a calming
message to the public Tuesday, saying the possibility of an Iraqi
biological and chemical attack against Israel was extremely small.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee on the Iraqi crisis, Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin
Shahak said it is "extremely unlikely" that Israel would be
targeted by Iraq for an attack.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in Tel Aviv by the Defense Ministry,
Deputy Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz made the similar comment on the
situation in the Gulf. He said while Iraq still has certain
non-conventional capabilities, including a few launchers and
unknown number of missiles, Israeli defense establishment
believed that Israel is outside of the dispute over Iraqi weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz said that the army is continuing its assessment of the
Gulf situation in close coordination with the United States. He
assured the public that if there is any change in the situation,
information would be given to the public at right time.
</P>
<P>
But Army intelligence officials still did not rule out the
possibility that Iraq may attack Israel when Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein feels he is in an impossible situation once the
U.S. launches strike against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Gabi Barabash, Director-General of the Health Ministry, told
the same news conference that Israel has all the necessary medical
responses to possible Iraqi biological and chemical attack. He
said no special medical preparation is needed at the stage since
the wounds of such attack could be treated under present medical
condition.
</P>
<P>
The news conference was held following the decision by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Monday night to reverse the policy of secret over the
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Pressured by the public outcry over the lack of official
information over the Iraqi crisis, the government moved to
prevent public panic by providing authorized information.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Knesset's Finance Committee approved an
emergency bill of 240 million shekels (69 million U.S. dollars) to
fund the preparation for possible biological and chemical
warfare. The money will be used to buy gas masks, drugs and other
medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the repeated calls for calm issued by political
leaders, Israeli citizens have been flooding gas masks
distribution centers throughout the country in the past days. The
memory of the Iraqi Scud missile attack during the 1991 Gulf War
is still vivid for many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Iraq fired 39 conventional Scud missiles
against Israel, most of them landed in the most bustling city of
Tel Aviv. Although no one was killed, but several people were
wounded and serious property damages were inflicted by the
strike. Many Israelis were forced to take shelter for days inside
underground bomb shields.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The private sector of east
China's Shandong Province has experienced rapid growth in recent
years amid continued market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Shandong had 2.55 million private industrial and commercial
businesses and 74,000 private enterprises at the end of last year,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the private businesses and
enterprises have a combined registered capital volume of 32.47
billion yuan, with 98 enterprises each having more than 10 million
yuan in registered capital.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has become an important part of the Shandong
provincial economy, turning over to the state coffers a total of
9.28 billion yuan in taxes between 1993 and 1996. It has also
created jobs for 140,000 urban workers.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of private enterprises has played a
significant role in accelerating the pace of urbanization and
absorbing surplus rural workers, experts say.
</P>
<P>
This year Shandong will take new measures to boost the growth
of its private economic sector.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has used a number of high-technology developments to
change weather conditions for agricultural harvests in the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
To relieve damage to farm fields resulting from natural
disasters such as drought or hail, local scientists have provided
a dozen high-tech developments since the early 1990s such as
artificial rain and lightning monitors.
</P>
<P>
To date, the developments have reduced economic losses by more
than 1 billion yuan in provincial agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province produced 25 artificially induced
rainfalls, increasing available water by 500 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, scientists fired 15,254 shells and 155
rockets to prevent hail over 330,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Choose Inexpensive Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
residents in China's largest commercial center Shanghai
Municipality enjoy economical entertainment activities after work.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of local people prefer inexpensive recreational
activities to stimulating but costly spare-time fun, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
On the weekends, many Shanghai residents say they would rather
stay at home watching movies on a VCD player than go out to the
cinema. And when they do go out to the cinema, they say the cheaper
ticket price is the decisive factor in their selection.
</P>
<P>
About 36 percent of local people seldom go out to the
movies. Among those who see movies regularly, only 33 percent buy
tickets; the others are given tickets as gifts by their working
units or friends.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that only 10 percent of Shanghai people
go to bars or bowling alleys as many as three or four times per
month. And half of the local ballroom-dance fans hold dancing
parties at home or go dancing at free-of-charge parks.

<P>
LHASA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 420 households of Tibetan
herdsmen have bid farewell to their nomadic life because of a
project to develop pastoral areas in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 9-million-yuan investment project has increased the output
of meat by 7.2 percent and milk by 4.6 percent since its inception
two years ago, and nearly 70,000 head of sheep now have access to
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
So far, the pasture development project has built centers in
the four Tibetan counties of Coqen, Amdo, Zhongba and
Nyainrong. The centers grow forage grass, select fine seeds,
prevent epidemics, and promote science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A contract and responsibility system that centers on public
ownership of the pasture, long-term management through contract
and paid use of pasture has also been introduced since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the autonomous region has added more
than 8,000 hectares of natural grassland and 8,430 hectares of
refined man-made grassland, while the survival rate of newly born
animals has increased 5.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Republic Convention Enters Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional Convention,
debating whether Australia should become a republic or not, gave a
clear signal Tuesday that it was in favor of a republic by
rejecting a monarchist motion which endorsed the current system
with 78 votes to 56.
</P>
<P>
Pro-republicans said Tuesday's result was a step forward, with
Australian Republican Movement (ARM) deputy chair Wendy Machin
saying it had narrowed the field without ruling out many of the
options delegates still wanted to discuss.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which entered the second day Tuesday, spent
most of the day considering resolutions of seven working groups
which considered the question of what powers a new head of state
should possess and how they should be defined.
</P>
<P>
Proposals ranged from the minimalist, with existing powers of
the governor-general carried over to the new head of state, to
full codification in which expanded powers of the president are
spelled out in full detail in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Passed were three of the seven proposals which now go to the
convention resolutions committee for further refinement and
consideration later. However, none of those proposals preclude
further consideration of any particular measure.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional convention on the republic threw up some
unlikely and bewildering alliances as ruling Liberal Party deputy
leader and Treasurer Peter Costello threw his support behind a
republic.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer agreed with the model put forward by one of the
coalition's most hated targets, former prime minister Paul
Keating. Costello agreed with the Keating minimalist proposal,
outlined by Keating in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer's comments put him at odds with Prime Minister
John Howard, who declared in his opening speech Monday that he
opposed Australia becoming a republic, because the present system
had provided certainty and stability.
</P>
<P>
Costello's public stand could prove a significant boost for the
republican cause. By taking a position against Howard, Costello
has effectively ensured the republic will be off the agenda at the
next federal election.
</P>
<P>
While Howard supports the monarchy, he will be unable to
campaign for the status quo during the election without
highlighting divisions within his own side.
</P>
<P>
Costello's stand also makes it more difficult for Howard to
publicly campaign against the republic during a referendum
campaign, as any overt campaigning for the referendum would be
seen as a direct contest between the two top leaders of the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
With Costello widely tipped as a likely successor to the prime
minister, the referendum would then become a vote Howard could not
afford to lose.

<HEADLINE> 24 Killed in Mob Justice in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four people were killed
in mob justice in southern Rwanda's Butare province in January,
the national Radio Rwanda has reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Butare Province officials in charge of security,
the victims were killed by angry villagers who caught them trying
to steal food from plantations or from people's houses.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of Butare have expressed concern over the
issue and have resolved to pursue and arrest the people who took
law in their own hands.
</P>
<P>
Southern Butare and Gikingoro provinces have been badly hit by
serious food shortages for the past months.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the World Food Program (WFP) in Rwanda show
that the humanitarian agency distributed 24,000 tons for the
October - December period last year throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our assistance targeted for 578,000 people every month, with
67,000 in the sole Butare province," the WFP Information Officer,
Paul Simkin told Rwanda News Agency which sent a special dispatch
to Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During 1997, the WFP distributed 125,000 tons of food
throughout Rwanda. "This represents one of the highest levels of
assistance in the region," Simkin further said.
</P>
<P>
The dire food situation in southern Rwanda has been blamed on
bad climatic conditions and the mass returns of refugees from
neighboring countries.

MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia has committed 7
million pesos (170,000 U.S. dollars) in a livelihood assistance
package for the Special Zone of Peace and Development in the

</P>
<P>
The amount will fund a special project called
Philippine-Australia Special Community Assistance for the area,
primarily to help former Muslim rebel fighters rebuild their
livelihood bases, the Philippine News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Miles Kupa Tuesday
signed a memorandum of understanding on the project with Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development Executive Director
Muslim Sema in the southern city of Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
Kupa said the project aims to enhance the capacity of the
Australian Development Cooperation Program to the Philippines in
responding directly to the development needs identified by local
community groups in the area.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to meet the specific humanitarian and
peacekeeping needs of 14 provinces and nine cities in the southern
Philippines, particularly the communities where the former Moro
National Liberation Front combatants live.
</P>
<P>
The project is also expected to generate some 18 new projects
in the next few months to help implement Philippine social

MAPUTO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The plague which broke out in
central Mozambique has claimed 19 lives in Morrumbala County in
Zambezia Province, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joao Antonio, magistrate of Morrumbala County was quoted by
the Noticias paper as saying that about 1,000 people suffering
from the plague have been taken into the county hospital since
the end of last year.

The spreading plague is still taking lives, especially in the
countryside, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The sudden eruption of the disease has killed all the
first-caught people in the county, and the number of death is
believed to be much bigger than the hospital figure, as many
might have died in remote areas far away from hospital, Antonio
said.
</P>
<P>
The county leader urged the central government to take
immediate measures to prevent the infectious disease from
spreading into other parts of the country, as it is hard to stop
it just by spraying general disinfectant.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Makes Efforts to Enhance Bus Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Hong Kong's
Transport Department, the Police and representatives of Citybus,
one of the major bus service companies in Hong Kong, met Tuesday
to discuss possible measures to enhance the safety of bus
operation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed on four areas of activities to enhance the
standard of bus operation, namely, to arouse safety awareness of
drivers, to step up enforcement of road code, to install more
warning road signs and to examine other preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was convened after a Citybus double-decker
overturned on a Wan Chai flyover on January 30, killing three
passengers and injuring 54 others.
</P>
<P>
To increase the safety awareness of bus drivers, the Transport
Department and the Police will join hands with bus operators to
run a series of road safety seminars for all bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
Citybus has also been requested to design an advanced driving
course for bus drivers which will include defensive driving,
anticipatory skills, and skid aversion techniques.
</P>
<P>
To inculcate better driving behavior among bus drivers, the
Police will step up enforcement of the road code.
</P>
<P>
The offending bus drivers will be issued with fixed penalty
tickets and given demerit points for improper driving behavior.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Transport Department will seek funding for
more red light cameras and speed enforcement cameras to be
installed at busy road junctions, expressways, flyovers and sharp
road bends which pose safety risks.
</P>
<P>
Within the next two months, the department will carry out a
survey of all flyovers with sharp bends to review the adequacy of
existing road signs to alert drivers to difficult road conditions
and to use appropriate driving speed.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Transport Department has started a review of
speed limits throughout Hong Kong since last November. The review
is expected to be completed in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Other road safety measures which are being considered include
medical examination for bus drivers and more stringent restriction
on blood alcohol content for bus drivers.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Three northern provinces in
Zambia have recorded the highest rainfall in 30 years this year,
the Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the country's Meteorological
Department Director Gabriel Chipeta as saying that the rains in
Northwestern, Northern and Luapula provinces are over 125 percent
above normal annual rains recorded in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
But copperbelt, Eastern, Lusaka and Central provinces have
recorded normal rainfall, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chipeta attributed the high rainfall to the inter-tropical
convergence zone (rain-belt) which has generally been active over
the northern and central areas of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Senior forecasts officer Jacob Nknomki was quoted as saying
that the rainfall distribution should not surprise people as the
El Nino phenomenon is associated with both normal and above
normal rainfall distribution in different areas.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Department has in the last three weeks come
under attack for its reports that the country is likely to
experience a drought following the advent of the El Nino
phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Not to Attend S. Korean Leader's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela would not attend the inauguration ceremony of
South Korean president-elect Kim Dae-jung later this month,
presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, Mankahlana also
denied foreign news reports that Mandela had called Kim on Sunday
and asked for presence at the February 25 ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where they got that from," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press (AP) quoted Kim's spokesman as saying on
Monday that Mandela called Kim on Sunday and that an invitation
was mailed Monday to Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"Like Mandela in South Africa, Kim was once a symbol of the
pro-democracy struggle in South Korea, and the two have known and
supported each other for years," AP said.
</P>
<P>
When Kim won his party's presidential nomination last summer,
Mandela sent him an old wristwatch as a personal gift and wished
him luck in the December 18 election, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It was the watch Mandela apparently wore throughout much of
his turbulent political career under apartheid, including his 27
years in prison, AP reported.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 74, has spent 40 years as an opposition politician,
including seven and half years in prison or under house arrest,
and four years in exile under a succession of military dictators.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Protect HIV/AIDS Employees from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has adopted an
employment code on HIV/AIDS to protect employees from
discrimination, The Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Labor Ministry Permanent Secretary
Arthur Yoyo as saying here Monday that the government is
committed to protecting employees with HIV/AIDS from
discrimination at work places.
</P>
<P>
Yoyo told a three-day workshop for people living with AIDS,
"Whilst maintaining the impetus of the various information
campaigns to examine affirmative strategies aimed at preventing
and counter-racing discriminatory practices, it is clear that
there is need for protection to ensure that the HIV/AIDS infected
persons are sheltered from discriminatory practices in
employment."
</P>
<P>
Among the key points in the code is the pre-employment AIDS
testing which has been viewed as undesirable.
</P>
<P>
Others are that HIV/AIDS infection being ruled out as a ground
for termination of employment and dismissal of employees on the
basis of HIV infection is not justified.
</P>
<P>
"We must realize that the most affected group is the
productive and reproductive group which also constitutes the
labor forces in our country," Yoyo said.
</P>
<P>
Garry Davies, resident representative of the U.N. Development
Program, told the workshop that there is need to support people
with HIV/AIDS by creating employment opportunities to enable them
to contribute to the development of nations.
</P>
<P>
Davies urged participants from all the provinces to advocate
for behavioral changes to help curb the rising spread of AIDS
through their testimonies of personal experiences.

dialogue aimed at supporting Malaysia's own effort to address
social and poverty issues.
</P>

He expressed satisfaction over the harmonious and effective
implementation of the bank's projects in the country, saying "in
the case of Malaysia, it had been a great success story of
partnership between the bank and the effective government".
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank's lending to Malaysia, mainly for
agriculture and rural development, has yielded impressive results
in terms of productivity improvement, employment creation and
poverty alleviation in rural areas.

<P>
The World Bank has approved 99 loans for projects in the
industrial sector, agriculture, education, population settlement,
power, water supply, sewerage, telecommunications, ports,
railways, roads and urban transport.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Fluoridate Water Supplies by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African public
water supplies are likely to be fluoridated by the end of the
year to prevent tooth decay in the country, the Health Department
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By fluoridation, fluoride presence in water could be adjusted
to the best level, thus preventing tooth decay, the department
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Draft regulations for water fluoridation has been drawn up and
they will become part of the Health Act once approved by Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Departments of water affairs, environment, and agriculture
supported the plan, which will soon be published in the
Government Gazette for public scrutiny and comment, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of adults in the country experienced some
dental caries, or tooth decay, and the disease is on the
increase, especially among the poor who are unable to pay for
oral health services, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The addition of fluoride to water supplies is the cheapest and
safest way to prevent dental decay, and optimum fluoride level in
the water strengthens teeth and reduces decay by up to 60
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Fluoridated water would be 18 times less expensive than
toothpaste and 61 times less expensive than having a tooth
filled," said Johan Smit, director of Oral Health of the Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
He said children will get the greatest benefits as fluorides
would be incorporated into the structure of developing teeth of
children and remain there for lifetime to protect against decay.

<HEADLINE> Job Creation Still Slow in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Job creation in South
Africa is taking place in some sectors of the economy, but the
overall picture remains bleak, the Business Day newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, consumer spending on durables and financial services
were generating employment, while mining, manufacturing and
construction were losing jobs, the paper quoted latest Central
Statistical Service figures up to September last year.
</P>
<P>
Overall employment in the formal economy fell about two
percent or by more than 116,000 employees in the 12 months up to
September, 1997, bringing the total number of people employed to
5.13 million, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Average monthly salaries and wages rose by 0.7 percent in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
Trade, catering and accommodation employment was up 1.2
percent over the 12 months. But the downward trend in employment
in mining, manufacturing and construction continued, with fairly
large declines in the number of employees in each sector.
</P>
<P>
However, more recent figures for the manufacturing industry
suggest that the trend is reaching the bottom, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some economists argue that employment figures for
the construction industry understate the situation because of
informal sector activity.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Boosts Agriculture with Huge Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria gives a boost to the
development of agriculture with the release of nine billion Naira
(about 113 million U.S. Dollars) to all the 36 states for
executing agricultural programs this year.
</P>
<P>
The 250 million Naira (3.13 million Dollars) granted to each
state would definitely improve on agriculture produce, said Frank
Adejuwon, Minister of State for Agriculture, according to local
press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Lagos State Administrator Mohammed
Marwa here on Monday, the minister urged all state governments to
involve local governments in agricultural production for maximum
benefit.
</P>
<P>
He also advised state governments to ensure the money is
judiciously used while pledging continued assistance by the
federal government in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, once the number one foreign exchange maker of the
country, has been dwindling since the oil boom in late 1970s.
Although about 70 percent of the over 100 million population are
involved in farming, the country has to import quite a number of
grain to feed domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
Several programs nationwide have been launched in Nigeria in a
bid to promote the development of agriculture, but with poor
results.
</P>
<P>
The federal government, in its 1998 budget, has given priority
to the sector and more funds have been planned for the fresh
endeavor.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) surged across the board at the close
Tuesday as players who returned from the week-long festive break,
pushed the market up.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse put up its best performance since the currency
turmoil in early July last year with the 100-stocks Composite
Index Tuesday rising 131.80 points or 23.14 percent to 701.31.
</P>
<P>
The all main board Emas Index also added 29.57 points to
172.76, the Industrial Index was up 188.84 points to 1,344.69, and
the second board index rose 14.53 points to 166.67.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE was playing a "catching up game" following the rise of
regional stock markets and Wall Street Monday, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE was closed Monday for the Federal Territory Day
celebration which fell on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gainers overwhelmed losers by 825 to 19 while 16 counters were
unchanged and 68 untraded.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover rose sharply to stand at 912.696 million shares
valued at 3.189 billion ringgit (797.25 million U.S. dollars) with
the main board turnover increasing to 829.645 million shares
valued at 2.987 billion ringgit (746.75 million U.S. dollars) from
148.797 million shares valued at 290.688 million ringgit (72.672
million U.S. dollars) traded Monday last week, the only trading
day for that week, and the second board turnover jumping to 83.051
million shares valued at 202.738 million ringgit (50.684 million
U.S. dollars) from 30.602 million shares valued at 60.719 million
ringgit (7.65 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off-market transactions also rose to 11.853 million shares
valued at 64.626 million ringgit (16.156 million U.S. dollars)
from 10.618 million shares valued at 27.452 million ringgit (6.683
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The market soared in the morning with the CI crossing the 700
point level 15 minutes after the opening as the players, after the
long break, were eager to jump into the market to follow the
upward trend of other regional bourses Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, in the afternoon, the CI moved in a narrow range
between 715 and 700 points as investors took more cautious stance.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said investors were optimistic that regional
economies will recover despite the current tough time and selling
pressures in the mid-morning and afternoon session were well
absorbed by the market.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the local bourse could go higher Wednesday
but this will depend on the regional markets and the stability of
the ringgit which ended higher Tuesday at 4.0500/700 to the U.S.
dollar against last Tuesday's closing of 4.4350/47.
</P>
<P>
The dealers said there may be some profit taking Wednesday or
before the end of the week following the sharp gains.

TEHRAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri left here Tuesday morning for his
first five-day visit to Syria and Lebanon to coordinate stances
over the stalled Middle East peace process and the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nouri will meet Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam and his Lebanese counterpart Nabih
Berri, according to Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Nouri said that he would discuss with
Syrian and Lebanese officials inter-parliamentary relations among
Islamic countries and issues related to the world, Islamic
countries and the region.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that Nouri's visit was mainly aimed at
coordinating stance with Syria and Lebanon over the deadlocked
Middle East peace process and the current Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The (Nouri's) visit is significant because of the
sensitivities currently prevailing in the region," Syrian
ambassador to Iran Ahmad al-Hassan was quoted by Tehran Times as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Middle East peace process is in impasse
because of irrationality of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's refusal to fulfill the commitments made under the
Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
"Another equally important issue is the Iraqi-U.S. crisis and
there are words in the air that the U.S. is going to attack
Iraq," al-Hassan said, stressing that Iran and Syria are against
military option to end the Iraqi crisis and believe that more
diplomatic efforts should be made.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Help to Unemployed Filipinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
 Tuesday issued a series of directives to ensure livelihood and
jobs for unemployed Filipino workers as a result of the ongoing
regional currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the orders in response to the
recommendations submitted by the participants in the National
Employment Conference held Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos directed Acting Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano to
formulate a comprehensive package of interventions for farmers and
workers who lost jobs due to the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The package shall include employment facilitation assistance,
training, production development, credit and marketing assistance
and livelihood programs.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the package should be formulated in coordination
with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of
Agriculture and the Technical Education and Skills Development
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also ordered Trajano to establish and operationalize the
Labor Market Information System to promote effective employment
facilitation intervention.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Filipino workers lost their jobs last month due to
the currency crisis which forced many firms to downsize their
business and lay off employees. More are expected to lose jobs
this year in the country as the adverse effects of the crisis on
the economy emerge.
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment situation is expected to worsen as
an estimated 50,000 overseas Filipino workers will have to come
home this year from other Asian countries affected by the currency
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Albright: No Decision Taken on Using Force Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has said that "no decision has been taken to
resort to force against the Iraqi regime as we hope that the
diplomatic efforts would succeed in containing the (Iraqi)
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks at a news conference at Riyadh
Airport before leaving for Bahrain Monday, Kuwait News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have agreed to give
maximum time for diplomatic bids to resolve the crisis between the
U.N. and Iraq over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she reviewed with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz all potential options to resolve the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that the super powers would not back off unless
the regime in Baghdad allows the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
in charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to
resume its inspection without obstacles and allow the
U.N. personnel to search suspected sites or installations without
prior notification.
</P>
<P>
Albright rebuffed a reported Iraqi offer to allow the UNSCOM
inspectors search only eight sites in Iraqi presidential palaces,
saying "a conditional search is unacceptable and Saddam is aware
of this quite well."
</P>
<P>
She said that she carried to leaders of the regional states a
message from U.S. President Bill Clinton to the effect that Iraq
retained the capacity to resume production and development of mass
destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued following Monday night meetings
between Albright and the Saudi crown prince warned that both the
U.S. and Saudi Arabia would hold the Iraqi regime fully
responsible for "regrettable consequences" if Baghdad "adamantly"
continues to abstain from implementing U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement also condemned the Iraqi government for
continuously trying to derail mission of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Albright is on a Middle East tour in a bid to drum up support
from Arab and Gulf countries for possible U.S. military actions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The trip has taken her to Jordan, Israel, Palestinian self-rule
areas, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and will also take her to
Egypt Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Footwear Industry Develops Swiftly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shoes, sandals and leatherwear are Vietnam major export items,
ranking the third in export turnover with 1.1 billion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Sales of footwear in 1995 were 292 million dollars, marking an
82.5 percent increase from the previous year. the sales jumped to
540 million dollars in 1996, or an 85 percent increase from 1995.
</P>
<P>
A very good reason for this big jump is that Vietnam's footwear
export to the EU and other industrialized countries is not
regulated by quotas like garments and enjoys some import tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Leather and Footwear Association has invest 1000
million dollars to renovate the industry with imported new
machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
This has boosted the production of footwear from 6 million pairs
in 1992 to 250 million pairs a year.

30 who were workers at a factory in the Pandamaran Light
Industrial Estate.
</P>

The victims suffer burns on from 80 to 99 percent of their
bodies, the reports said. Hospital authorities were quoted as
saying that though they are conscious, their conditions are

victims joined him later. While putting out the fire they also
splashed water on the tank to cool it. Instead the tank exploded
and injured them, the reports quoted a local police officer as

<HEADLINE> Soeharto on Sino-Indonesian Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here Tuesday expressed the hope that Indonesia and China should
continue to develop their cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The president made the expression when meeting with Chinese
Ambassador to Indonesia Zhou Gang at the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said Indonesia and China have been sticking to the
principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs since the two counties restored their
diplomatic relations seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our common goal is making efforts to promote mutually
beneficial cooperation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president said cooperation between Indonesia and China
should expanded. "(Cooperation) not only among state-owned firms,
but the private sectors should also be encouraged," he added.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two countries should develop barter trade
as Indonesia is short of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Gang, who will soon complete his term of service here,
said it will make positive contributions not only to the region
but also to the world at large when China and Indonesia, as two
big countries in Asia, strengthen their cooperation and develop
friendship.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they also discussed the current monetary
crisis in Southeast Asian countries. They expressed the conviction
that those countries will soon overcome the crisis and their
economies will recover through the unity of the people of each
country, the cooperation among the ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) countries as well as support from the international
community.

<HEADLINE> Conflicting Reports on Survivors in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine passenger plane
which crashed in a mountain area in southern Mindanao Island
Monday exploded on impact and there may be no survivors, an
official army report said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency said the report was
submitted by Col. Jake Legot, commander of the ground rescue team
of the official Task Force Pacific, a combined ground and air
rescue team mobilized by the Air Transport Office (ATO), at 11:30
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The army report ran counter to earlier reports of alleged
recovery of 30 dead and 15 survivors of the ill-fated Cebu Pacific
Airways DC-9 plane.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine aircraft carrying 99 passengers and five
crewmen had been missing since it failed to land Monday morning in
the southern Philippine city of Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Searchers Tuesday morning found the wreckage of the plane near
the summit of Mount Sumagaya, a steep ridge in Calveria about 45
kilometers northeast of the destination.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Larry Zurita, spokesman of Cebu Pacific Airways,
said the airlines was no longer convinced that 15 people survived
the accident on the basis of new information from military rescue
teams.
</P>
<P>
The airways had initially quoted Calveria's mayor as saying
villagers had been able to spot 15 survivors at the crash site.
But the mayor later said he was unable to confirm that any people
were still alive.
</P>
<P>
A volunteer radio organization also reported Tuesday morning
that a team of volunteer villagers has spotted 30 bodies and 15
survivors in the vicinity of the crash site.
</P>
<P>
But Army Col. Henry Cinco, spokesman of Task Force Pacific,
said there may be no signs of survivors at the crash site.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the task force's initial reports indicated that there
were no signs of survivors and the team has not spotted the rescue
team in the area," Cinco said.
</P>
<P>
Cinco, however, said that until the task force's rescue team
has reached the crash site, the possibility of survivors can not
be discounted.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft's wreckage was spotted at about 9:30 Tuesday
morning, 150 meter down of Mt. Sumagaya's peak, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cinco said the army report indicated that the aircraft may have
exploded upon impact as indicated by the wreckage in the area.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Tanega, head of the ATO and over-all coordinator of Task
Force Pacific, has not released any statement yet and has
proceeded to the site on board a helicopter to investigate the
crash site.

<HEADLINE> Israel Moves to Allay Fear About Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- To prevent public panic
about the threat of Iraqi biological and chemical attacks, the
Israeli government started Tuesday an information campaign to
allay the public concerns about security.
</P>
<P>
This decision to inform the public about the Iraqi crisis was
made Monday night by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai following the public outcry
over the government's policy of secret over the Gulf situation.
</P>
<P>
"From Tuesday, information will be given to the public by
relevant representatives," Mordechai's spokesman Aviv Benyahu
said.
</P>
<P>
Only on Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet decided to adopt the policy
of secret, banning officials from talking publicly about the
Iraqi crisis. Medical experts were also barred from being
interviewed by reporters on the danger of biological and chemical
attacks and ways to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's media spokesman, said the policy
of secret was attempting to keep as many hands as possible off the
panic button, or "to prevent unauthorized statements which could
cause alarm."
</P>
<P>
The policy was also seen as part of the government's promise to
the U.S. to keep a low profile in the Iraqi crisis in order to
avoid provoking an attack. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who visited here Sunday, urged Israel to avoid being
involved in the crisis by toning down its public rhetoric and
actions.
</P>
<P>
But this policy immediately came under strong fire from
opposition politicians and medical experts, who insisted the
public should be informed of the danger of chemical warfare and
ways to deal with. They also warned about a public panic fueled by
rumors in the absence of government information.
</P>
<P>
In the first step to inform the public about the current
crisis, a news conference is to be held Tuesday by
directors-general of the health and defense ministries and the
army's chief medical officers, in which the public will be assured
about the country's medical preparedness for possible Iraqi
biological and chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to use military strike against Iraq to
force it to comply with U.N. resolutions and allow arms inspectors
to go inside its presidential palaces to search for suspected
banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> Australian Shares Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Profit taking and concern of
Asia-related write-offs accompanying company results in the
imminent profit season caused a sell-down in industrial stocks
Tuesday, dragging the Australian market lower.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 15.7 points lower at 2654.4,
with falls in industrials - particularly banks - overshadowing
continued gains in resource stocks.
</P>
<P>
"We are coming into reporting season and they are going to have
to disclose any downgrades if they feel it will be in the next six
months. I think there is a fear of downgrades after results come
out," Stuart Smith from Henderson Charlton Jones said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian share market opened higher in initial trading on
expectations of a bumper day on the coat-tails of a 2.5 percent
rise on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
However brokers said sellers came in quickly as bond yields
improved and futures turned downward, and the market soon went
into negative territory.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed 41.2 points lower at 4503.7,
with banking stocks weaker due to further hesitation on Asia and
the sufficiency of bad debt provisions.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank led the way down among the major banks,
losing 31 cents, Westpac fell 12.7 cents, Commonwealth lost 21
cents while ANZ shed only two cents to close.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index rose 6.8 points to 1185.8 amid climbs
by most of the major companies.
</P>
<P>
BHP gained 16 cents to 15.06 Australian dollars, WMC rose 12
cents, while Rio Tinto added 28 cents.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were generally stronger as the index rose 5.8
points to 1170.9 while the bullion price closed at 302.25 U.S.
dollars per ounce, down 1.00 on Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 343.44 million shares at a value of
992.79 million Australian dollars (675.09 million U.S. dollars),
with falls outnumbering rises 602 to 544.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Climbs Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger Tuesday as it continues to beat a path towards 69 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished the session at 68.62 U.S. cents,
from 68.19 U.S. cents here late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It's been well contained under the 68.80 U.S. cent level,
which is a region that it seems to have trouble getting through,"
said IBJ Australia Bank senior foreign exchange trader Darrin
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
"It's only a matter of time before we push through the 68.80
U.S. cent level and move into the lower 69 U.S. cent level," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Citibank chief economist Stephen Koukoulas said the
local currency was set for a near term pull back.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar appears to have overshot on the upside
with the move from 63.20 U.S. cent to above 68 cents, all in the
space of a few weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is quite an outstanding achievement in the face of a
Moody's change in the credit watch from 'positive' to 'stable' and
the severe deterioration in the December balance of goods and
services," he added.
</P>
<P>
Koukoulas said he expected the local currency to drift lower
over the next few months to a range of 63 U.S. cents to 68 cents,
with weakness in future trade data and further negative sentiment
from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the session at 86.50 Japanese
yen, up from 86.19 Monday, and at 1.2459 German marks, down from
1.2406.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The cholera epidemic has
killed 74 people in Uganda's eastern district of Mbale, The
Monitor reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,410 cholera patients are still under treatment,
according to Mathias Akabwai, resident District Councilor in
Mbale.
</P>
<P>
The official spoke highly of the cholera task force in the
district for their efforts to save local patients and spread the
knowledge to local residents for the prevention of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Cholera killed over 30 people in Mbale last December, and the
epidemic has so far killed over 340 people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Crispus Kiyonga, Uganda's Health Minister, has attributed
the spread of the epidemic to poor hygienic condition.
The government has spent 270 billion Uganda Shillings
(some 250 million U.S. Dollars) to improve the poor sanitation.
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 of Uganda's total 45 districts had been hit by
cholera since last December.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Crime Rate Drops with No Definite Reasons Known </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- California and the rest of
the United States have reported continuing drop in crime rates,
but it seems difficult for police as well as criminologists to
explain why.
</P>
<P>
California state law enforcement authorities point to community
policing and tougher sentences as the primary factors for the drop
of crime. But even law enforcement-oriented sources note that
increase in police staffing levels and hard-line enforcement and
prosecution policies fail to totally account for falling crime
rates.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there is not a single soundbite that has the
answer. Nationwide, the recent improvement in the economy,
age-demographics, gang-war cycles, the waning interest in drugs
like crack, and community policing are often used by experts to
explain the decline.
</P>
<P>
Violent crime nationwide declined by five percent in the first
six months of 1997, according to FBI statistics, and property
crimes dropped by four percent.
</P>
<P>
Victimization survey by the U.S. Department of Justice shows
violent crime down nationwide by 10 percent and property crime
down by eight percent. Some types of criminal activity had dropped
by as much as 44 percent in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Many academics and law enforcement sources note that crime
always seems to drop when employment rates are high. A study of
declining homicide rate in seven cities by the National Institute
of Justice also found a potential connection between employment
and crime. But this hypothesis does not apply to some cities,
where economic conditions have improved since 1992 but some crimes
climbed steeply.
</P>
<P>
The country's aging population is also a common explanation for
falling crime rates. According to this hypothesis, the number of
people between the ages of 18 and 40, an age group in which most
potential offenders are to be found, has declined by more than
seven percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in
the nation's crack cocaine problem, which is associated with large
increase in violence crime among young people in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement advocates tend to credit the recent apparent
decline in crime to a nationwide tougher sentencing laws and more
aggressive policing strategies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, noting that crime had
decreased steadily since 1994, one said that tougher sentences and
hiring more local police officers are "one of the most important
reason."
</P>
<P>
California's "three strikes," which dealing with repeated
offenders with heavy prison terms, is often cited as an example
for tougher sentencing laws. Under the "three strikes, you'er out"
law which was enacted in 1994, a person, who has two previous
violent or serious felony convictions, must by sentenced to a term
of 25 years to life in person for each new felony conviction,
whether or not violent or serious, which must by served
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the law say that it has had a minimal impact on
crime rates, but has tied up public resources on prison expansion
and construction that could have been used on other governmental
programs.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Justice, in a study of the national
"three strike" movement, also says that it is still too early to
tell whether California's tougher sentencing law is having any
substantial impact on crime rates, although it has had a major
effect on the state's prison capacity and criminal court caseloads.
</P>
<P>
"Three strikes" is not the only thing special in
California. Politicians and police through Southern California are
pushing architects and developers to tailor their projects with
subtle crime-fighting features such as better lighting,
strategically placed thorny bougainvillea bushes and even pouring
rose-colored concrete for walkways. The system is known in
government circles as "crime prevention through environmental
design." The idea is that troublemakers don't want to be seen and
buildings should be designed so the owners can see them. Now Los
Angeles is in the forefront of promoting the system on a
metropolitan scale.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Britain Resume Talks on Aviation Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Britain will resume
talks today in Nigerian capital Abuja on the aviation row that
has led to a mutual flight ban since last May.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the British Department of Transport and those
of the Nigerian Airways will be at today's talks, a leading
Nigerian newspaper This Day said today.
</P>
<P>
The row started in May last year after Britain banned Nigeria
Airways from flying to London on the ground that its planes do
not meet international standard. Nigeria retaliated by banning
British Airways from flying to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Britain lifted the ban on Nigeria Airways late last year, but
Nigeria is not ready to do the same, insisting that the bilateral
air agreement between them should be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is reportedly demanding that the British Airways
reduces its number of flights so that it will be at the same
level with the Nigeria Airways.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Nigeria is also demanding that its
planes be allowed to fly to the Gatewick Airport aside of the
Heathrow Airport, just as the British Airways flies both Lagos
and Kano.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urged to Allow UN Inspections of Suspected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan urged Iraq to allow "full U.N. inspections of suspected
weapons sites" to avoid putting the Iraqi people under more
sufferings.
</P>
<P>
In an article published by local English daily Arab Times
Tuesday, Annan said that Iraqi President "Saddam Hussein has gone
to the brink by persisting in his foolhardy resistance to full
U.N. inspections of suspected weapons sites."
</P>
<P>
"Let us hope" he backed away once again as in the past to
"avoid putting his people through even more sufferings than they
are already experiencing," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq refused to allow U.N. inspectors to go inside the
presidential palaces, where the banned weapons are suspected to be
hidden, on the ground of sovereignty, triggering a strong reaction
from the U.S. who has threatened to use force to pressure Saddam
Hussein to back down from his position.
</P>
<P>
Annan said "if Saddam Hussein were to cooperate and agree to
have his weapons destroyed, then the United States could
conceivably relent."
</P>
<P>
"For Iraq to get into this kind of confrontation and risk
being hit again is just something that is not understandable by
rational people," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to launch a "substantial" strike
against Iraq this time "quite different" from what was done
before if diplomacy failed to solve the crisis between Iraq and
the U.N. over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
A Russian envoy is currently in Baghdad to try to solve the
problem and France will also send a senior official to Baghdad to
deliver a warning to the Iraqi authorities about the risks of its
current behavior in defying the U.N. inspections of suspected
sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan said "for the sake of his people, I would hope that
Saddam would listen to the French and the Russians who are
talking to him now and asking him to work constructively in
complying with the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
On the oil-for-food deal between the U.N. and Iraq, Annan said
he has submitted his report to expand this program to the Security
Council for its decision, which will probably come out this week.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "this has nothing to do with the ongoing
discussions about the use of force," adding that "my
recommendations are not a 'sweetener' to lure Iraq to comply."
</P>
<P>
Annan proposed in his recommendation to increase the
oil-for-food deal to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars from the current 2
billion dollars over a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Annan warned Iraq Monday that it must cooperate with the U.N.
arms inspectors or risk "another round of devastating military
action."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2
billion dollars worth of oil over a six month period to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods for its people.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Industrial Investment Drops Sharply in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel's industrial
investment dropped by 15 percent in 1997 to an estimated 13.3
billion shekels (about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars), local newspaper
The Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted economists of Israeli Manufactures
Association as saying that the drop in investment will
significantly hurt industrial growth in the coming years and
manufactures' ability to compete in export markets and the local
market.
</P>
<P>
"The figures are a result of the government's tight monetary
and fiscal policies and the subsequent low inflation," said Shaul
Kobrinsky, chairman of the association's economics committee.
</P>
<P>
"Factories see the drop in local demand and they must then
invest less, " he said. "Export markets are not in the best
situation either. The international situation is unclear because
of the Asian economic crisis. Israeli companies will have to
complete harder for markets."
</P>
<P>
"Factories which deal in both export and local markets are
using their existing equipment to invest in exports, which will
result in diminishing their stocks," Kobrinsky said.
</P>
<P>
According to the association, investment in imported equipment
and machinery dropped 17 percent in the first nine months of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The drop in investment also included the high-tech sector,
where investment in communications equipment dropped 45 percent,
compared to a growth of 59 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investment in electronic components fell 24 percent
in the first nine months of 1997, while chemical companies reduced
investment by 8 percent, and textile and clothing companies by 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, investment in plastics and rubber sectors increased by
2 percent, metals and vehicles by 6-7 percent, and supervision
equipment by 15 percent.

LHASA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Forty trucks loaded with disaster
relief goods from the central government have arrived in Lhasa,
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, through the Qinghai-Tibet
highway.
</P>
<P>
The relief goods will be distributed in snow-hit areas in
Ngari, Xigaze and Qamdo.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The new relief goods include 325,000 cotton-padded clothes and
quilts and 10,000 cotton-padded or fur gloves.
</P>
<P>
Since Nagqu and some other areas in Tibet were hit by heavy
snows at the end of last year, the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, the State Council and the Central
Military Commission attached great importance to disaster relief
operations.
</P>
<P>
The State Council held special meetings for making disaster
relief arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan MPs-Elect to Be Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The 224 Members of Kenya's
eighth Parliament are scheduled to be sworn in on Tuesday when
the House convenes for the first time since the general elections
held on December 29-30 last year.
</P>
<P>
The House will be meeting just for a day to elect the Speaker,
Deputy Speaker and for the swearing-in of MPs, before it is
officially opened in March.
</P>
<P>
In the race for the Speaker, front runner Francis Ole Kaparo,
who steered the seventh Parliament from hostility to a harmonious
House, is expected to recapture his seat easily against
Githunguri MP Njehu Gatabaki.
</P>
<P>
The hottest seat is that of Deputy Speaker, which has
attracted four candidates from opposition Democratic Party of
kenya (DP), Ford-Kenya and Social Democratic Party, and ruling
Kenya African National Union.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 opposition MPs-elect announced plans Monday to disrupt
Tuesday's parliamentary proceedings to protest against Kenyan
government's "inability" to contain ethnic violence in parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by Mwai Kibaki, Leader of official
opposition in Parliament, said opposition parties would hold a
procession followed by a rally at Uhuru Park in central Nairobi
on Thursday for "peace prayers".
</P>
<P>
DP Chairman, Kibaki, said that the opposition MPs were
outraged with what he called "genocide" in Laikipia, Njoro,
Baringo, Likoni, Nyambene, Trans Mara and Gucha in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition National Development Party (NDP) and
Ford-Kenya rejected the calls on Monday to disrupt Tuesday's
swearing-in ceremony of MPs to protest the on-going ethnic
clashes.
</P>
<P>
But the NDP condemned the escalating violence in parts of Rift
Valley and Nyanza provinces and accused the government of failing
to protect Kenyans.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sri Lanka Ready for Golden Jubilee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- With less than one day to go
for the 50th independence day of Sri Lanka, the country seems to
be ready to celebrate the Golden Jubilee amid extremely tight
security.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are in the final stage. In the capital city of
Colombo, thousands of national flags have been hoisted over the
main streets, roundabouts and buildings.
</P>
<P>
Many drivers erect miniature national flags in the front of
their cars, vans and three-wheelers to mark the February 4
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
At the main entrance of the Bandaranaike Memorial International
Conference Hall, which will be the venue for a grand exhibition
Thursday that features the country's achievements during the past
half century, a grand ornamental arch has been erected with
pictures highlighting some historic events of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to a string of celebration activities to be held
in the Indian Ocean island nation, the National Independence
Memorial Photographic Exhibition was opened in Colombo Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Independence Day, a cultural show in which
Sri Lanka's leading artists will perform is scheduled to be held
in downtown Colombo. A large crowd is expected to go to the show.
</P>
<P>
Colored lights for holiday decorations have been installed to
beautify the city. However, traveling through the city, one can
always find more road blocks, barriers and barbed wires than
colored lights.
</P>
<P>
Actually, security is a major concern both for the authorities
and the visiting foreign guests, including Prince Charles of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
To prevent any sabotage, hundreds of new road blocks have
sprung up in Colombo while thousands of security personnel are
reported to be patrolling the city.
</P>
<P>
The capital is virtually sealed off when the Defense Ministry
announced to impose a complete ban on the entry of all vehicles,
except for cars, motorcycles, passenger vans and buses, into the
city and moving within the city from Tuesday to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, due to the traffic restriction measures in the Fort
area in Colombo, attendance of staff at all government or private
institutions located in that area is expected to be adversely
affected.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the government has requested that February 5
be made a special holiday for employees in those institutions.
</P>
<P>
Ananda Dharmapiriya, an official of the organizing committee
for the celebrations, said everything seemed fine up to now. He
said the chances for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to mar
the celebrations are very little, as the security forces of the
three services and the police have been on high alert.
</P>
<P>
The biggest ever security operation in Colombo has caused
certain inconvenience to the civilians.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers going to work were stranded on road Monday
and Tuesday due to the closure of some main roads. Many people
complained they had to be waiting inside crowded buses for two
hours because the authorities closed roads for rehearsals for
Wednesday's main celebration function.
</P>
<P>
Traffic authorities have announced that part of the city will
be cordoned off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a key Tamil party, the Tamil United Liberation Front
has decided not to participate in the celebrations. Party Leader
M. Sivasithamparam said since 1948, the party has not been
participating in independence day celebrations because it believes
the Tamils have no share in the independence.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Buy Used Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The trend of buying used
cars is strengthening throughout the United States because of high
price of new cars, according to a survey released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
People who said they are most likely to buy a used car from a
dealership increased to 32 percent from 27 percent a year ago,
said the survey by the Dohring Co..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the percentage of people who said they are most
likely to but a new vehicle at a dealership fell to 68 percent
from 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted last month involving 1,253 Americans who
plan to buy a vehicle and the results was released at the National
Automobile Dealers Association meeting in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, American consumers bought 41 million used cars,
compared to about 15.1 million new vehicles. Both figures have
remained roughly steady for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, the top two reasons consumers gave for
preferring used cars was high price of new cars and the
affodability of used cars.
</P>
<P>
New vehicles on average cost 20,200 dollars last year while
average price for a used car is about 9,000 dollars, according to
CNW Marketing Research and ADT Automotive, which auctions used
cars.
</P>
<P>
ADT said in its separate report that the cost of new cars is a
barrier for many consumers. The median annual income of new car
buyers last year was 60,430 dollars, compared to 35,500 dollars
for average American families.

Washington against the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, winners of 54 games a year ago, are just 21-24
this season. Despite signing center Brian Williams as a free agent
in the off-season and trading for guard Jerry Stackhouse in
December, the Pistons rank 11th out of the 15 teams in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Besides the disappointing record, it was believed that
Collins's emotional style of coaching was wearing thin with the
players in this his third season. Collins was also fired by the
Chicago Bulls in 1989 after three seasons as head coach.
</P>
<P>
Detroit lost 10 of its first 15 games to start the season.
After finally reaching the .500 mark (20-20) with a win against
the Los Angeles Clippers on January 22, the Pistons have dropped
four of their last five games.
</P>
<P>
Collins, 46, led the Pistons to the playoffs in each of his
first two seasons.

<P>
DHAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' World Food
Program (WFP) has provided support to Bangladesh in coordinating
two countrywide food-assisted development projects, a report from
the WFP Dhaka Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Vulnerable Groups Development (VGI) project, over
500,000 of the poorest women have received food assistance for a
period of 18 months, which enable them to participate in training
and awareness activities with the WFP's partner organizations.
</P>
<P>
The women are given groups support and access to credit to
become self-reliant through sustainable income-generating
activities.
</P>
<P>
The impact evaluation of the 1992/94 VGD project showed that
the average monthly income of the participants doubled through the
period in the women's households, and food intake from food grains
increased.
</P>
<P>
And the rural development project in the 1996-97 work season
generated 33 million workdays for about half a million poor rural
dwellers in the country, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis to Cut Australia's Export Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian crisis prompted the
Australian federal government's chief commodity adviser Tuesday to
write off about 198 million U.S. dollars in export earnings for
the fiscal year of 1997 ending on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
But Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) Executive Director Brian Fisher said a lower Australian
dollar was expected to help offset the impact of the Asian
contagion by spurring on sales to countries not directly affected
by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
ABARE's latest forecasts, released at its annual Outlook
conference, estimate Australian commodity exports will earn 63.3
billion Australian dollars (41.7 billion U.S. dollars) in this
fiscal year, up 4.2 percent on the previous year but half a
percent under than the previous growth forecast.
</P>
<P>
Mineral resource exports are expected to contribute 39.2
billion Australian dollars (25.8 billion U.S. dollars) in this
fiscal year, a rise of about seven percent.
</P>
<P>
This compares with the previous forecasts, released just seven
weeks ago, of 63.6 billion Australian dollars and 39.3 billion
Australian dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the uncertainties in Asian markets, the value of
Australian commodity exports is forecast to rise by 4.2 percent to
63.3 billion Australian dollars in (the fiscal year of) 1997-1998,
and to rise again, although more modestly, to 64 billion
Australian dollars in (the fiscal year of) 1998-1999," Fisher said
in his commodity overview.
</P>
<P>
"The projected changes in Australia's food exports to all
regions indicate that the negative impacts on Australian food
exports of the Asian economic crisis are likely to be somewhat
offset by an increase in Australian producers' competitiveness
resulting from the depreciation of the Australian dollar," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in competitiveness is estimated to result in
increased Australian food exports to countries not directly
affected by the events in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fisher expected Australia's processed agricultural exporters to
be worst hit.
</P>
<P>
But the nation's minerals and energy sector was expected to
grow over the medium term, supported by new mine and minerals
processing developments.
</P>
<P>
ABARE cut dairy export projections for 1997-1998 to 1.18
billion from 1.32 billion U.S. dollars, citing a short-term
slowdown in Asian demand.
</P>
<P>
Cotton consumption and live cattle and wool demand were also
expected to be sluggish over the short-term.
</P>
<P>
But the outlook for these commodities should pick up over the
medium term, the forecaster said.
</P>
<P>
The weaker Australian dollar, expected to average around 68
U.S. cents in the fiscal year of 1997 and 1998, was also expected
to help offset lower world wheat prices with Australian Standard
White (ASW) projected to earn 190 Australian dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices, however, were set to remain sluggish over the
medium term and average 290 U.S. dollars per ounce in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka in Negotiations With Emirates Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
begun exclusive negotiations with the Emirates Airlines of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a bid to privatize its national
carrier, the Air Lanka, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Public Enterprises Reform Commission
Mano Tittawella said the government is considering the divestiture
of its 40 percent equity stake in the Air Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said current negotiations followed recommendations by a
technical evaluation committee report which said the Emirates
submitted the only proposal that met the technical requirements.
</P>
<P>
A government appointed financial advisory group also
recommended the Emirates be selected as a partner.
</P>
<P>
At present no details of the negotiations are available.
</P>
<P>
The process of finding a suitable strategic partner for the
national carrier began in August 1995 when the cabinet appointed
the financial advisory group, which comprises the Chase Manhattan
Bank, the aviation consultancy firm SH &AMP; E and the People's
Merchant Bank, to help restructure the Air Lanka by divesting 40
percent of its ordinary shares.
</P>
<P>
Tittawella said when the privatization is completed, the
government will still retain board control. The government will
appoint four directors, including chairman of the board, while the
partner will appoint another three directors.

<HEADLINE> 30 Confirmed Dead, 15 Injured in Philippine Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 people were
confirmed dead and 15 others survived as the wreckage of the
ill-fated Cebu Pacific aircraft was located at Mt. Sumagaya in
Mindanao, early Tuesday, according to the official Philippine News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ground rescuers led by an independent Oro Rescue Club in
Cagayan de Oro City spotted the wreckage of the plane carrying 104
people in Sitio San Roque, a remote village in Manibay, Claveria,
Misamis Oriental, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the initial report on the discovery of the
ill-fated plane was relayed by Nestor Tan, president of Oro
Jaycees Radio Club, to the office of the mayor in Gingoog City at
09:00 Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Nestor Ampalayo, a staff member of the mayor's office, had
confirmed the findings and called on all public and private
ambulances to proceed to the area, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Inspector Apolonio Santos of Misamis Oriental Police
also confirmed that a group of rescuers who trekked the mountain
area between Gingoog city and Claveria, carried 30 corpses and 15
injured survivors on foot down the rugged terrain toward Claveria.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports said that the survivors have been sent to
nearby hospitals. But there is no word about other passengers.
</P>
<P>
The search for the missing started Monday afternoon and
suspended around 17:00 due to bad weather and low visibility.
</P>
<P>
Ground and air rescue operations resumed early Tuesday morning.
Several teams have been sent to comb a mountainous area northeast
of the airport on the Southern Island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft on flight 387 carrying 99 passengers and five crew
members left Manila at 09:30 Monday and was expected to land at
the Lumbia Airport of the Cagayan de Oro City at 11:00. The crew
radioed the Lumbia Airport that it was about to land in 15 minutes
before it perished.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Tanege, head of the Air Transport Office (ATO) in
Manila, flew to Cagayan de Oro City to lead the government rescue
team.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
start implementing a 50-million US dollar project from July this
year to deal with arsenic contamination of ground water, The Daily
Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the World Bank-financed 15-year project is to
provide safe or arsenic-free water to the people in the affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will involve increasing water supply and
development of existing water sources, will look into alternative
ways for water resources management in 4,000 severely affected
villages and 64 cities.
</P>
<P>
A national arsenic mitigation center will be set up to collect
data for implementing the project.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic contamination is spreading fast in the country, and the
number of districts believed to be contaminated has risen to 48
districts of the total 64.
</P>
<P>
About 2,200 people have been confirmed with cases of
arsenicosis. To address the problem, the country has formed a
national steering committee headed by the health minister, and
formulated a draft national drinking water supply and sanitation
policy.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia-Herzegovina Introduces New License Plates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina introduced on
Monday new license plates, which would considerably improve
freedom of movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Klein, Deputy High Representative for implementation of
the Dayton agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Monday presented new
license plates for in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of uniform license plates which will not identify
vehicles by entity or any other type of affiliation is a big step
forward, said Klein at a ceremony held in front of the Sarajevo Canton
Interior Ministry building.
</P>
<P>
With the new plates, drivers in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able
to travel without fear through the whole country, Klein said,
adding this has brought Bosnia closer to other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, there were at least five different types of license
plates in Bosnia, mainly with national symbols.
</P>
<P>
The new license plates will have standard dimensions and a white
background. They will have combinations of six numbers and one letter,
shared by both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Combinations will be
determined by the method of random choice by computer systems in
canton interior ministries.
</P>
<P>
The international community has secured DM 30,000 for each entity
to make license plates. The process of exchanging license plates will
have to be completed by 31 July.
</P>
<P>
In the next several days Bosnia-Herzegovina will have a new flag as
well, Klein said, announcing that convertible marks would be put into
circulation as well as new passports for the whole country.
</P>
<P>
But the Bosnian Presidency member Momcilo Krajisnik Monday
expressed dissatisfaction with the solution for the appearance of new
registration plates.
</P>
<P>
The new registration plates "will cause revolt and will always be
Westendorp's or Klein's plates, and not of the people accepting them",
said Krajisnik commenting on the presentation of Bosnia's uniform
vehicle registration plates, expected to ensure bigger freedom of
movement.
</P>
<P>
Before an agreement was reached between interior ministers of the
Croat-Muslim Bosnian Federation and the Bosnian Serb entity, Bosnian's
Serbs wanted registration plates to retain the insignia of Bosnia's
two entities.

<HEADLINE> India to Launch Ocean Satellite This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- India plans to launch its
first ocean satellite, Oceansat-1, this year as part of the
celebrations of the International Year of the Ocean.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with a local newspaper The Hindustan
Times, which was made public Tuesday, Secretary of the Department
of Ocean Development A. E. Muthunayagam said that Oceansat-1 would
be the first in the series of ocean satellites to be launched by
India.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will have two payloads: an ocean color monitor
(OCM) and a multi-frequency scanning microwave radiometer (MSMR).
While the OCM would make oceanographic observations for research
on fisheries, the MSMR would be used for oceanographic related
climate and weather predictions.
</P>
<P>
The OCM will have a sensor for measuring the optical properties
of water which would produce different shades of pigmentation.
From this, it would be possible to estimate the presence of
chlorophyll which forms a crucial part of the food chain of fish.
The biological productivity of an area in the ocean is an
important criterion for gaining complete knowledge regarding
fishing zones, Muthunayagam said.
</P>
<P>
The OCM would also estimate the turbidity of the ocean thus
providing knowledge regarding pollution and the general state of
health of the sea, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economic Growth Moderates in 1998: ABARE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's economic growth
would moderate in the financial year of 1998 due to the Asian
financial crisis but without jeopardizing low inflation and
interest rates, Australia's chief commodity forecaster said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But in its 1998 outlook, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural
and Resource Economics (ABARE) warned that while its assumptions
already embodied a subdued outlook for Asia, "There is a
significant downside risk if economic prospects for Asia worsen
significantly further."
</P>
<P>
"The main impetus to the Australian growth is currently assumed
to be domestic demand," ABARE said in its Outlook 98 document.
</P>
<P>
"A further deterioration in business and consumer confidence as
a result of a worsening outlook for Asia could markedly affect
private consumption expenditure and business investment spending
in Australia, resulting in lower economic growth than assumed."
</P>
<P>
ABARE assumed the Australian dollar would average about 68
cents against the United States currency in 1997-98 due to the
influence of Asia's financial upheavals, remaining at that level
in the financial year of 1998, which begins on July 1, 1998, due
to an increase in the current account deficit as a share of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Economic growth was assumed to average about 3.7 percent in the
financial year of 1997 ending on June 30, before moderating to
around three percent in the following financial year, and growing
by an average 3.5 percent beyond the financial year of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The above assessment of the economic prospects for Australia
centers around the view that considerable excess capacity exists
in the economy and therefore relatively strong growth will be
possible without jeopardizing much of the recent gains in lowering
inflation and interest rates," ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
While the local dollar had depreciated markedly against the US
dollar since the beginning of the turmoil in Asia, it fell only
slightly on an import-weighted basis, ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, any upward pressure on Australia's inflation rate
from recent movements in the Australian dollar is not expected to
be significant," it said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's headline inflation rate was assumed to average
about 0.7 percent in the financial year of 1997 before increasing
to 2.5 percent in the following year and three percent in the
medium term.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Discuss Iraq Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
discussed the Iraqi situation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
through telephone and both agreed Iraq's defiance of the
U.N. resolutions over weapons inspections was unacceptable, a
White House official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They "agreed that it was essential for the Security Council
to seek unity on this issue and the President agreed with
Yeltsin that diplomacy was the preferred approach to the extent
possible," the official said.
</P>
<P>
But the official did not said whether the two leaders talked
over possible military action against Iraq. Russia has been
opposed to any military strike and has sent special envoy, Deputy
Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, to Baghdad in an effort to
defuse the increasingly tense situation in the Gulf as the United
States is preparing for a possible attack to force Iraq to comply
with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Russian news agencies reported that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein had agreed to let U.N. weapons
inspectors to monitor up to eight new sites and to meet chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler as a compromise for a
settlement of the crisis over the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the reports, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said that it was something "we will look at."
</P>
<P>
But he said it was not a solution to the standoff with Iraq
over the weapons inspections. "I don't think it's an appropriate
solution at this time ... The best solution is for the inspectors
to have unfettered access," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later Iraq denied there existed any such kind of compromise
proposal, saying what the Russian news agencies' reports were
"totally incorrect."

reported the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation treaty was signed by Armenian President Levon
Ter-Pertrosyan and Russian President Boris Yeltsin last August in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
It also won approval from Russia's State Duma and the Federal
Assembly in January.
</P>
<P>
Once it comes into effect, the treaty will take the place of a
bilateral treaty signed by Armenia and Russia in 1991.

SOFIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has been invited to take
part in extending Georgia's Port Poti and in transporting goods
and raw materials from Caucasia and Central Asia to Europe.

<P>
The proposed renovation project, said Bulgarian Deputy Prime
Minister Alexander Bozhkov on Monday, involves Georgia's most
important port city on the east bank of the Black Sea.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rescuers Find 30 Bodies, 15 Survivors in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine rescuers found
Tuesday morning 30 bodies of passengers of the ill-fated Cebu
Pacific DC-9 passenger plane in the remote Mount Sumagaya,
Claveria, in Mindanao, and 15 survivors were also found, police
said.
</P>
<P>
Inspector Apolonio Santos of Misamis Oriental, Mindanao, said
that a group of rescuers, who trekked the mountainous area between
Gingood city and Claveria town, carried the dead bodies and 15
survivors on foot down the rugged terrain toward Claveria, Misamis
Oriental in the Southern Island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Santos said rescuers, when contacted by two-way radio, cannot
tell whether or not they saw the wreckage of the aircraft carrying
104 people.
</P>
<P>
But a local television said that the plane crash was confirmed
by local officials.
</P>
<P>
The passenger plane went missing Monday on a flight from the
Philippine capital of Manila to Cagayan de Oro city, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Air Force, Cebu Pacific Air and the Air
Transportation Office suspended their air search operations for
the plane late Monday afternoon due to bad weather and low
visibility. Ground and air rescue operations resumed early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Cagayan de Oro City Lumbia Airport told
reporters that several teams have been sent to comb a mountainous
area northeast of the airport on the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area is on the flight route of the ill-fated
passenger plane which lost radio contact with the Lumbia airport
air tower while flying over the area before approaching the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which took off from the Manila Domestic Airport at
9:30 a.m. (Local time) Monday, was scheduled to land in the Lumbia
airport, some 500 miles south of Manila, at about 11:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
But the plane, which made a brief stopover in Tacloban city,
failed to arrive at the destination.
</P>
<P>
Air transport officials said the pilot of the aircraft Captain
Paulo Justo made a last radio contact 13 minutes before
approaching the runway of the Lumbia airport.
</P>
<P>
In the radio call, the 16-year-old plane, about 60 kilometers
from the airport, reported no trouble but asked for a priority
landing.
</P>
<P>
The Cebu Pacific Air, owned 49 percent by Filipino-Chinese
billionaire John Gokongwei, started operations in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The airline is one of several new airlines established after
the Philippine government deregulated the aviation industry two
and a half years ago. It has had no previous accidents.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov said Monday that Bulgaria should try its hardest to
attract more foreign investment in its scientific research
projects.
</P>
<P>
He was meeting 25 scientists from the Academy of Sciences and
Sofia University.
</P>
<P>
What matters is that Bulgaria should occupy an important place
in the world's scientific and technological fields, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Bulgarian scientists working abroad would help
introduce more foreign investors to the country. Overseas scholars
should establish their scientific research bases in Bulgaria, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Because of the country's poor economic situation, Bulgarian
scientists lack enough funds for research projects. More and more
young and middle-aged intellectuals have to move abroad for
personal development.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Limits Foreign Exchange Deposits Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, has limited the growth of foreign currency deposits and
foreign exchange non-trade and trade related liabilities to a
maximum of 2 percent a month as part of efforts to encourage banks
to operate more prudently.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Governor J. Soedradjad Djiwandono said here Monday
night the ceiling for the growth of foreign currency deposits and
liabilities, including letters of credit, should not exceed 25
percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways to maintain their prudent operations is to be
not too expansive in their foreign currency deposits. In an
uncertainty condition like now, excessive foreign currency
deposits could endanger banks' liquidity management," Soedradjad
said.
</P>
<P>
The decision has raised concern in the financial community over
the possibility of Indonesia changing its foreign exchange regime.
But Soedradjad stressed that the free foreign exchange regime will
be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The limitation on foreign currency deposits growth and growth
of obligations in foreign currency to other banks is aimed at
supporting the government's program for rehabilitation of the
banking industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to rebuild faltering confidence in the country's
banking industry, the government last week announced a blanket
guarantee of deposits and debts of all banks incorporated in the
country, including joint venture banks, and set up the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency in charge of rehabilitating the banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
Following the sharp fall of the Indonesian rupiah against the
U.S. dollar (the rupiah traded at 10,300/10,900 per dollar on
Monday, about 80 percent down from last July) and the closing down
of 16 private banks in November last year, confidence in the
country's banking sector waned. The public withdrew deposits, and
foreign banks became increasingly reluctant to accept letters of
credit issued by Indonesian banks.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to introduce
legislation soon to jail students involved in ragging in
universities and other higher educational institutes, the official
newspaper Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a spokesman for the Education Ministry as
saying that under the proposed legislation, students found guilty
will face a five-year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
Those taken into custody in connection with ragging incidents
can be detained by police for up to six months without bail and
will not be allowed to continue their study in universities or
institutes if found guilty, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Failure to report a ragging incident will also be an offense
under the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
The legislation proposals have been submitted to the Attorney
General's office for approval, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation followed incidents of ragging which have
resulted in the deaths of two university students last year. The
incidents led to a public outcry on banning inhuman ragging in
higher educational institutes.

WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 current and past
heads of state and civilian leaders called for immediate action on
Monday to reduce the nuclear threat and abolish weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release by Weber Professional Media
Consulting, a statement signed by representatives from five
nuclear weapon nations and those under the nuclear umbrella and
others called for removing nuclear weapons from alert status and
placing them in storage.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called for an end to nuclear testing,

<P>
Other declared and undeclared nuclear weapon states were also
required to join the reduction process within an international
system of inspection, verification and safeguards, in an effort to
eliminate nuclear weapons once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The statement urges other nations to adopt a `No First Use'
policy immediately, to ban production and possession of large,
long-range ballistic missiles, to account for all materials
needed to produce nuclear weapons, and to place them under
international safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Qian Jiadong, former Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations
and Chen Jifeng, Secretary General of Chinese People's Association
for Peace and Disarmament signed their names to the statement.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht's Appreciation Pushes Bourse Index Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Investors were buoyed by the
appreciation of the baht in the last two days, which pushed the
Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index up in "crazy" trade,
according to the Bangkok Post on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There were aggressive buying across the board at the SET on
Monday, mostly by foreigners, a dealer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There was too much money chasing too few stocks and fund
managers were anxious to increase their exposure to the Thai
market, said Rod McMillan, head of sales at ABN Amro Hoare Govett.
</P>
<P>
The SET index jumped 12.02 percent, or 59.52 points, to close
at 554.74 on massive volume worth 15.29 billion baht. The jump of
the index and volume were the highest since the baht's flotation
on July 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
That baht closed on Monday at 50.9 to the US dollar, compared
with 52.7 on the last trading day, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see the surge as investors' optimism about the baht's
stability and a positive sentiment on the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's two-tier exchange-rate system, i.e., domestic and
overseas, was abolished on Friday. The step was widely welcome.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Foreign Minister
Alexander Arzumanyan submitted his resignation on Monday and
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan accepted it, the presidential press
service said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Ter-Petrosyan also accepted the resignation
of Yerevan Mayor Vano Siradegyan, who handed in his resignation
last Friday, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The resignations come amid growing republic concern over the
Armenian government's policy towards the disputed ethnic Armenian
enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, officially part of neighboring
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno Karabakh, largely populated by Armenians, effectively
fell into Armenian hands during a bloody five-year war which the
territory waged in plain support for Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
However, the status of this enclave remains a unresolved issue
between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Armenian parliament is split
over the government's policy towards Nagorno Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan, as head of state, has come under heavy fire by
the parliamentary opposition, which accused him of following a
conciliatory line with Azerbaijan over Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Both Arzumanyan and Siradegyan are supporters of the
president.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Discuss Iraq Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin agree that Iraq's
defiance of the United Nations resolutions over weapons
inspections is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said on Monday that the presidents
reached the agreement after Clinton discussed the Iraqi situation
with Yeltsin by telephone.
</P>
<P>
They "agreed that it was essential for the Security Council to
seek unity on this issue and President Clinton agreed with Yeltsin
that diplomacy was the preferred approach to the extent possible,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
But the official did not say whether the two leaders talked
over possible military action against Iraq. Russia has been
opposed to any military strike and has sent special envoy, Deputy
Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, to Baghdad in a effort to
defuse the increasingly tense situation in the Gulf as the U.S.
prepares for a possible attack to force Iraq to comply with
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Russian news agencies reported that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein had agreed to let U.N. weapons inspectors
monitor up to eight new sites and to meet chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler as a compromise for a settlement of the
crisis over the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the reports, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said it was something "we will look at."
</P>
<P>
But he said it was not a solution to the standoff with Iraq
over the weapons inspections. "I don't think it's an appropriate
solution at this time ... The best solution is for the inspectors
to have unfettered access," he said.
</P>
<P>
Later, Iraq denied there existed any such kind of compromise
proposal. It said the Russian news agencies' reports were "totally
incorrect."

<HEADLINE> Havel Sworn in for Second Term as Czech President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel was
sworn in for a second five-year term on Monday, two weeks after he
was narrowly re-elected in a second round of parliamentary voting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a crowd from a balcony at Prague Castle, the
61-year-old president promised to do everything possible to
improve the political, moral and spiritual climate of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have certain economic and social difficulties; the
political scene does not look good. The atmosphere in the country
is not good," Havel said.
</P>
<P>
He said something should be done to solve the problems in the
fields of economy, education, culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Only half of the members from the two houses of parliament
attended the ceremony, which was boycotted by deputies from the
Czech and Moravia Communist parties and the Civic Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Havel, the former president of Czechoslovakia, was elected
first president of the Czech Republic in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After two rounds of voting on January 20, he won 99 lower house
votes from the 197 deputies present, and 47 in the 81-member upper
house, just the majority needed for his return to office.
</P>
<P>
The vote came after the collapse of the previous cabinet headed
by Vaclav Klaus, who was forced to step down amid a party funding
scandal.

WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Arizona Governor Fife
Symington was sentenced Monday to 30 months in detention for lying
to obtain millions of dollars in loans to shore up his failing
real estate empire.
</P>
<P>
United States District Judge Roger Strand also ordered
Symington to pay 60,000 dollars in a fine, and serve five years'
probation. Symington was ordered to report to a minimum-security
federal work camp on March 20, Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Symington, 52, resigned immediately following his conviction in
September on multiple counts of providing false financial
statements to lenders in order to win loans and gain concessions
for his real estate developments.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutor David Schindler said Symington's sentence
"sent the message that white-collar crime will not be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference later on the courthouse steps, however,
Symington remained defiant.
</P>
<P>
"The extraordinary length of this case and struggle made me
feel from the very beginning that it was politically motivated,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Schindler denied the charge, saying "Mr. Symington was treated
like any other" defendant.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Shougang
Corp, with a steel output of eight million tons secured a profit
of 350 million yuan (42.17 million US dollars) last year,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Shougang hit a total sales of 36.44 billion yuan last year, and
its profits increased 7.86 percent from those in 1996, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The company produced 7.46 million tons of iron last year,
growing 2.15 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the output of steel last year increased by only 0.97
percent from 1996 and rolled steel by 0.44 percent. The company
produced 6.86 million tons of rolled steel in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Shougang stood fourth on the list of steel companies making
profits last year, behind Baoshan Steel, Handan Steel and Wuhan
Steel.
</P>
<P>
The company's sound performance achieved last year appeared at
a time when the price of domestic steel kept plunging and energy
costs increased by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
China produced 107.6 million tons of steel and 113.8 million
tons of pig iron last year.
</P>
<P>
Shougang President Luo Bingsheng, speaking at the national
working conference of the metallurgical industry, attributed the
company's profit increase to capital restructuring,
diversification of products and the reduction of costs, effective
measures adopted last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has
promised to do all it can to keep HIV/AIDS infection at a
comparatively low prevalence level in China, according to today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The transmission of HIV through blood plasma will be halted by
the end of the century, said Shen Jie, division chief in charge of

Other objectives include bringing the spread of HIV/AIDS among
drug users under control and limiting the annual rise in cases of
STDs to less than 15 percent in the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
These goals have been included in a National Medium-/Long term
Plan for AIDS Prevention and Control being drafted jointly by four
related ministries and commissions.
</P>
<P>
The plan will come into effect after final approval by the
State Council, said Shen.
</P>
<P>
China had recorded 8,303 HIV-positive cases by the end of
October last year in all provinces, with the exception of
Qinghai. of these cases, 209 have developed into AIDS, and 119
people have died.
</P>
<P>
Roughly two-thirds of reported cases of HIV infection are due
to intravenous drug use with another eight percent resulting from
sexual relations. Cases of mother-to-child transmission have also
been reported.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Regulation to Ensure Safety on Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public Security
issued a new regulation requiring vehicles to install fog lights
to ensure safety on expressways.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily said the regulation comes out in the wake
of a series of tailgating accidents in December last year on
expressways on the outskirts of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that drivers must turn on fog lights
and limit their speed to 60 kilometers per hour when visibility on
expressways is between 100 and 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Speed is required to be reduced to 40 kilometers per hour if
visibility falls below 100 meters with a safe distance of at least
50 meters.
</P>
<P>
Expressways should be closed when heavy fog reduces visibility
to less than 50 meters, the new regulation says.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing Public Security and Traffic
Administration, nine people died and at least 34 were injured in
the two major accidents on 17 December on the
Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu and Beijing-Shijiazhuang expressways when
heavy fog shrouded the expressways and cut visibility in most
parts of provinces and cities in the northern part of China.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Wu Jun, the ministry's traffic administration
department spokesman as saying that "heavy fog and drivers'
carelessness were the principal causes of the accidents."
</P>
<P>
Wu added that the insufficient safety measures such as absence
of fog lights, poor vehicle quality and inadequate driver training
also contributed to the accidents.
</P>
<P>
There were 6,796 expressway accidents in 1996, which killed 864
people and injured 2,215 people.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks 3 Billion Dollars in Fresh Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Board, the
policy-making body of the Philippine Central Bank, has approved to
borrow 3 billion U.S. dollars in fresh loans from various
commercial sources to beef up its dwindling gross international
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer reported on Tuesday
that the negotiations for the loans could be completed by the end
of the month or by the first week of March.
</P>
<P>
The fresh loans would include 500 million to 1 billion dollars
in "club loans" being arranged with international commercial
banks, which would carry a bullet maturity of three years, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under a club loan, the participating institutions will pour in
funds on an equal-sharing basis, unlike a loan syndicate in which
a leading arranger will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
Other components of the loans are 200 million dollars in
five-year Europeso bonds, 250 million dollars in a special deposit
arrangement with international banks, 300 million dollars in bonds
issued by the national government and 1.5 billion dollars in a
syndicated loan.
</P>
<P>
The loans will come on top of some 2.7 billion dollars the
country is seeking from the International Monetary Fund as a
standby facility, plus more than 600 million dollars in parallel
financing from Japan's Export-Import Bank, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The loans present no problem. We can borrow this much,"
Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying. He
added that the country's gross international reserve will rise
within the next three months.

MANILA -- Philippine Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson said
the government can use the deposit of former President Ferdinand
Marcos, local press reported on Tuesday.

The report quoted Singson as saying that the money, still to be

Bank from a holding bank, whether sold or redeposited.

Either way, the deposit would flow into the economy and
increase the country's international reserve which dropped to 8.8

<HEADLINE> Manila, Leftist Rebels Forge Accord on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and a
major leftist rebel group have concluded a human rights accord,
marking a breakthrough in their peace talks aimed at ending
decades of insurgencies by the group, local press reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accord will be signed February 8 in the Netherlands, where
the talks have been proceeding sporadically since 1997, the
reports quoted Jose Ma. Sison, leader of the National Democratic
Front (NDF), as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Sison, who is also leader of the Communist Party
of the Philippines, two related short agreements will also be
signed.
</P>
<P>
The accord, called the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for
Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, is the first of
four agreements the two sides hope to reach in a political
settlement ending the NDF's nearly three decades of insurgency.
</P>
<P>
"The entire agreement is ready for signing... on February 8 in
the Netherlands," Sison said in a statement issued in that
country, where he is living in exile.
</P>
<P>
Last month, negotiators from both sides said they had signed
the first three parts of the agreement on human rights and
international law but the government had balked at signing the
remaining three parts.
</P>
<P>
Although negotiators concede that a full peace deal is still a
long way off, they say the agreement on human rights represents a
breakthrough in the talks.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement is signed, the two sides will address
issues of governance and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, an umbrella group of 14 leftist groups, began its
rebellion in the late 1960s which peaked in the mid-1980s. Since
then, the group have weakened because of battle casualties,
surrenders and factionalism.

<HEADLINE> China's Guangdong Province Reports Near-Zero Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, the country's showcase of market reforms, reported
near-zero price rise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index of the province rose 0.1 percent last
year, while its consumer price index, which also covers the cost
of services, was up 1.9 percent, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The two indices were very insignificant when compared with the
official price-control targets of 5.5 and 8 percent, respectively,
and with double-digit increases just several years
ago. Guangdong's retail price index jumped 18.1 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The success in macro-economic control and negative growth in
food prices were the major factors forcing down the overall price
level, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Market prices in Guangdong dropped on a monthly basis in seven
months last year, in addition to zero growth for another two
months.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's gross domestic product grew an average 15.4 percent
each year between 1993 and 1997, during which its sales of
consumer goods surged 24.4 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The provincial price bureau predicts that price growth will
remain at a low level in the first half of this year, with the
yearly retail and consumer price indices expected to stand at
around 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Manila Can Use Marcos' Deposit: Central Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank governor
Gabriel Singson said the government can use the deposit of former
President Ferdinand Marcos, local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Singson as saying that the money, still to be
transferred from the Switzerland, is likely to end with the
Central Bank from a holding bank, whether sold or redeposited.
</P>
<P>
Either way, the deposit would flow into the economy and
increase the country's international reserve which dropped to 8.8
billion U.S. dollars at the end of January, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of the Switzerland ruled earlier that 100
million dollars, about one-fifth of Marcos' deposits in Swiss
banks, would be transferred to the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the holding bank, possibly the Philippine National
Bank (PNB), would have to take the burden of paying the interest
of the deposit.
</P>
<P>
"In such case, it has to invest or lend this deposit to earn
and enable it to service the deposit," he said, adding the PNB can
sell or redeposit the money to the Central Bank, therefore
increasing the country's gross international reserve.
</P>
<P>
Singson's statement contradicted the allegation of a senator
who reportedly argued that the government can not touch the money
because "it is just like any deposit that is a liability."

<HEADLINE> January Sees Stock Index Plunging in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 2 (xinhua)-- The Lima Stock Exchange registered
a deep plunge of market average in January following financial
crisis in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The overall stock index plummeted an average 9.37 percent in
the year's first month while the selective index covering the 15
most important stocks dropped 9.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume fluctuated between 2 and 15 million U.S. dollars,
compared with the average 16 million dollars per day in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the drop to abrupt devaluation of
currencies in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of mining and labor sectors reported the most serious
lose of 18.5 and 17.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The falling of the mining sector stocks is for the fear of
lower prices in the international metal market, especially the
prices of tin, zinc and gold.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts remained pessimistic over the stock market in
February.
</P>
<P>
If measures adopted to motivate Asian economies do work, They
said, the recovery of Lima's stock market would be seen at the
beginning of April.

<HEADLINE> Search for Missing Philippine Plane Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Ground and air rescue operations
resumed early Tuesday morning for a Philippine jetliner which went
missing on a domestic flight with 104 crew and passengers on
board, rescue officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Cagayan de Oro City Lumbia Airport told
reporters that several teams have been sent to comb a mountainous
area northeast of the airport on the southern island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area is on the flight route of the ill-fated
Cebu Pacific DC-9 passenger plane which lost radio contact with
the Lumbia airport air tower while flying over the area before
approaching the airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed reports that the 110-seat jet
plane had crashed in the mountainous area with peaks ranging from
7,300 feet to 8,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports quoted some officials from Cagayan de
Oro city as saying the wreckage of the missing aircraft had been
spotted by villagers on Mount Balatocan near the Lumbia airport.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Air Force, Cebu Pacific Air and the Air
Transportation Office suspended their air search operations for
the plane late Monday afternoon due to bad weather and low
visibility.
</P>
<P>
Before undergoing the rescue operation, air transport officials
had conducted communication search for the plane among all nearby
airports and cities.
</P>
<P>
But air transport officials said all airports and cities near
Cagayan de Oro city had reported no landing of the plane, carrying
99 passengers, including four foreigners, and five crew.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which took off from the Manila Domestic Airport at
9:30 a.m. (Local time) Monday, was scheduled to land in the Lumbia
airport, some 500 miles south of Manila, at about 11:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
But the plane, which made a brief stopover in Tacloban city,
failed to arrive at the destination.
</P>
<P>
Air transport officials said the pilot of the aircraft Captain
Paulo Justo made a last radio contact 13 minutes before
approaching the runway of the Lumbia airport.
</P>
<P>
In the radio call, the 16-year-old plane, about 60 kilometers
from the airport, reported no trouble but asked for a priority
landing.
</P>
<P>
The Cebu Pacific Air, owned 49 percent by Filipino-Chinese
billionaire John Gokongwei, started operations in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The airline is one of several new airlines established after
the Philippine government deregulated the aviation industry two
and a half years ago. It has had no previous accidents.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Reaffirms Central Goal of Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
reaffirmed the central importance of poverty reduction and the
urgent need to narrow the wide disparities between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "Poverty Reduction and the World Bank:
Progress in Fiscal 1996 and 1997", the World Bank outlined its
strategy for better monitoring, assessment and inclusion of the
low-income people who benefit from the World Bank-assisted projects
and programs. The Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM)
Network was recently formed to help push forward its strategy and
reduce globle poverty.
</P>
<P>
Despite huge strides in reducing poverty over the last 40
years, 1.3 billion people still live on less than 1 U.S. dollar a
day, which is regarded as the poverty line and almost 3 billion
people live on less than 2 dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
According to the 182-page report, the World Bank's efforts to
help governments reduce poverty include analytical work, policy
dialogue, advice and lending. In recent years, the Bank
successfully stepped up its poverty reduction analysis and lending
through a series of early 1990s poverty assessments and the
Program of Targeted Interventions (PTI).
</P>
<P>
During fiscal 1997, PTI lending accounted for some 4.1 billion
dollars, or about 29 percent of the World Bank investment lending,
as against 5.4 billion dollars, or 32 percent in fiscal 1995 and
1996. For those poorest countries eligible for concessional
International Development Association (IDA), lending to PTI
projects was 53 percent of investment lending in fiscal 1997,down
from 63 percent in fiscal 1996, but about the same level as fiscal
1995. The fall in fiscal 1997 reflects the unusually high level
and share in fiscal 1996 which were due to the greater number of
large PTI loans approved in the year and to the decline in
aggregate lending in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in adjustment operations, both the share of
poverty-focused operations and the amount of the World Bank
lending for those operations increased steadily between fiscal
1995 and 1997. Poverty-focused operations as a share of all
adjustment operations increased from 52 percent of adjustment
operations in fiscal 1995 to 59 percent in fiscal 1996 and 62
percent in fiscal 1997. The amount of lending for such operations
in fiscal year 1997, which include structural adjustment loans,
sector adjustment loans and rehabilitation import loans, totaled
2.65 billion dollars as compared with 2.23 billion dollars in
fiscal 1996.

<HEADLINE> EU to Increase Controls on Nuclear Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is due
this week to step up controls on nuclear activities within the
15-member bloc to help improve the nuclear non-proliferation
regime, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision will act as part of international moves to
strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime, an EU source said
in Brussels Monday.
</P>
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last May decided
that the international nuclear safeguard system, which covers
nuclear facilities declared by IAEA states, should be extended to
cover undeclared nuclear activities such as import controls and
research programs.
</P>
<P>
The source said discussions on how IAEA states, including the
15 EU member states, will implement the stricter controls, would
begin in Vienna on February 16 aimed at reaching agreement by
mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France are the only two EU members which have
nuclear safeguard inspectorates. Other non-nuclear EU countries
like Belgium and Germany have no authority competent to carry out
such controls.
</P>
<P>
It will be decided this week that the European Commission, the
EU's executive body, should receive how much power to carry out
inspections, according to the EU source.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Turkish Speakers Call for Reviving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Parliament
Speaker Dan Tichon said Monday that all the parties should make
efforts to revive the stalled Middle East peace process as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Tichon, who arrived here earlier Monday for an eight-day
official visit, made the remark following a meeting with his
Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin, the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Tichon admitted that the Middle East peace process is such a
complex problem that it can not be solved easily.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Cetin said that Turkey and Israel as two
important countries in the region should make their significant
contribution to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Our region is conflict-torn. We need durable peace and
tranquility in the region," Cetin said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the two sides expressed satisfaction with the
achievements in bilateral relations due to the efforts of both
sides.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Turkey and Israel have made remarkable
progress in establishing a closer relationship between the two
non-Arab countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
But their military and defense cooperation has prompted
criticism from Iran and Arab countries, which have accused Turkey
of betraying the interests of the Muslim world.

BONN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany and France have agreed on
close coordination to help Turkey in its bid to join the European
Union (EU), foreign ministers of the two country said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a position paper issued after a meeting between German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his French counterpart Hubert
Vedrine Monday in Bonn, the two ministers said that Bonn and Paris
have a common interest in "a lasting integration of Turkey in
Europe".
</P>
<P>
They also noted that decisions made by EU leaders at their
December summit in Luxembourg had underscored the prospect for
Turkey to join the EU later, though they had not invited Ankara to
join 11 other countries, mainly from eastern Europe, to start
membership negotiations with EU.
</P>
<P>
While expressing recognition of Turkey's political and economic
reforms, Kinkel and Vederine also called on both Turkey and Greece
to make constructive contributions to solve the Cyprus issue and
settle their conflict in the Aegean.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Hit Record on Drug Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all sustained their recent rally and ended at record highs Monday,
boosted by strong gains in the drug sector and a recovery in Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares rocketed to a new
record high, finishing just under the 5,600 level on news of a
merger in the pharmaceutical sector.
</P>
<P>
The proposed link between Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham
saw Glaxo shares shoot up at one stage to 345 pence, boosting
their value by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Soaring Far East markets, with Hong Kong up 15 percent and
Singapore 12 percent, also helped London stocks to gain 140.5
points or 2.6 percent to close at 5,599.0, its fourth consecutive
record closing high.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed sharply higher in moderate
trading, with the market deriving support from the strength of
the pharmaceutical stocks following merger rumors.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index was up 82.43 points or 1.86 percent at
4,522.81 by the close of the session, a new record closing level.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Chief Visits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- General (Air) Joseph Ralston,
vice-chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived here
later Monday for a one-day visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Ralston, who came here from Turkey, is
expected to discuss with Greece's military leadership issues of
mutual interest and defense cooperation, the Greek Defense
Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
He will also inspect Greek military units.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military chief's arrival coincides with a five-day
visit of the U.S. Sixth Fleet flagship "USS La Salle" in the
northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival on Saturday, Vice Admiral Charles Abbot,
captain and the fleet's commander, said that the two countries'
military leaderships were working together for peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, some 200 demonstrators from Greece's peace groups and
the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) gathered in the docks of
Thessaloniki to protest against the U.S. policy in the region.

<HEADLINE> EU Members Disagree on Plans for Fuel Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Plans to have harmonized tax
rates on solid fuel, electricity and gas within the European Union
(EU) are floundering, it was learned here Monday.
</P>
<P>
An EU source said Monday that a certain number of EU members
were having difficulties with the proposal. But liquid fuels such
as petrol and kerosene are already subject to a minimum rate of
taxation throughout the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, last year
proposed that similar measures be extended to other fossil fuels
and electricity in order to create a more level playing field
throughout the EU's single market and improve environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the agreement of all EU members was needed
before the plans could become law, adding that a number of issues
have bogged down the talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain, though prepared to consider taxing industrial users,
is unlikely to accept an EU directive if it forces the government
to introduce a standard tax for household fuel use, according to
the source.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Ireland, which had no tax on domestic or
industrial consumption of coal, gas and electricity, did not want
to introduce such a tax at all.
</P>
<P>
Germany has expressed the concern that taxing energy-intensive
industries would render them less competitive while Spain and
Portugal said any tax on industry should be voluntary.
</P>
<P>
EU economy and finance ministers are due to discuss the
proposals at a meeting in Brussels in late April. But the source
said the outcome of the ministerial talks was unclear.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Compromise on Presidential Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq denied a Russian news
report that Baghdad has agreed to open eight presidential sites to
inspection and President Saddam Hussein will meet chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
Riyad al-Qaisi, Iraq's deputy foreign minister, made the denial
at an emergency news conference Monday evening, saying the report
was "totally, totally incorrect."
</P>
<P>
Russia's Interfax News Agency and CNN's Moscow branch reported
earlier that Saddam shifted position on weapons inspection during
his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy
Viktor Posuvalyuk.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy is on his second visit in a week to Iraq in
an effort to defuse the crisis over weapons inspections. "No such
thing was discussed" during Saddam's talks with Posuvalyuk,
al-Qaisi said.
</P>
<P>
He said "discussions are going on and this is a good sign," but
refused to go into details.
</P>
<P>
He said Posuvalyuk himself was astonished to hear the report
and talked with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on
telephone, saying that he has got the impression that diplomatic
efforts could continue and nobody wanted to use biological or
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qaisi said Posuvalyuk stressed the current crisis should be
resolved through diplomatic avenues, not by use of force.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts are underway to avert a military
confrontation between Iraq and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy, Bertrand Deforo, is expected here Tuesday and
Secretary General of the Arab League Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Official: Turkey to Suffer if US Strikes Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said on Monday that Turkey will suffer another
economic loss if the United States launches a military strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Turkey's largest city Istanbul, Ecevit
said Turkey has lost an estimated 35 billion U.S. dollars since
the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey will not take part in a possible military
operation against Iraq by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
But he said that due to its geographical proximity, Turkey
might be involved in some events if the U.S. attacks Iraq. He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from inspecting
presidential palaces suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to force Iraqi compliance with the
U.N. resolutions through military actions.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage Iraq to abide by the relevant U.N. resolutions
and we also hope that U.S. government could be patient enough,"
Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he indicated that Iraq should not be allowed to have
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem is to visit Baghdad in the
coming days to mediate a peaceful settlement of the arms
inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Marc Grossman told
reporters Monday that Washington welcomes Turkey's mediation
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Talks with Arab Leaders on UN-Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has begun a series of consultations with Arab leaders to line up
support for defusing the crisis between Iraq and the United
Nations, the Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held telephone conversations with leaders of Syria,
Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocoo, Saudi Arabian, Oman,
Kuwait, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Qatar, Bahrain and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had sent a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in
an attempt to contain the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, he stressed the importance of giving political
and diplomatic efforts a chance to find a solution to ensure
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and avoid
possible armed clashes which could have wide-ranging repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been denying U.N. arms inspectors access to
presidential and sovereign sites and demanding the U.N. lifting of
the seven-year-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Washington, threatening military strike to force Iraqi
compliance, has sent Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
Europe and the Middle East to enlist support to its possible use
of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, most Arab countries joined the U.S.-led international
coalition to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. This time, however,
an Arab support for military operation seems hard to come by.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Seeking Documents from White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Whitewater prosecutors are
trying to gather evidence of an alleged presidential affair and
cover-up from the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration lawyers hope to meet with prosecutors
this week over how to respond to subpoenas in the Monica Lewinsky
controversy.
</P>
<P>
White House officials are publicly pledging cooperation with
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
Starr said on Monday that "we've been focused hard on some of
the questions and issues."
</P>
<P>
"We're continuing to move forward," Starr told CNN.
</P>
<P>
On one issue, the Secret Service already is raising concerns
about the kinds of questions that Starr might want to ask agents.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge agreed with the Secret Service last week that
complying with subpoenas in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton might expose critical information on how
the agency functions.
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service's position is less likely to prevail in the
face of a Whitewater grand jury subpoena. But contesting the
matter in the courts could seriously delay the probe, said John
Barrett, a former prosecutor in the six-year Iran-Contra
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's lawyer William Ginsburg said his client would be
going back to California this week to visit her father. That could
take a bit of the steam out of the story in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The American people are "fed up and they've given up" trying to
sort out "revelations and counter-revelations... and inaccuracies
and inconsistencies" in the story, said Senate Democratic Leader
Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
The country's attention is on the budget and wants Congress "to
complete the work of the president," Daschle said.
