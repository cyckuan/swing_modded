<HEADLINE> India Regrets Withdrawal of Ceasefire by Hizbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government statement said, "The government of India notes
with deep regret the announcement of Syed Salahuddin from Pakistan
that the offer of ceasefire with Indian Security forces in Jammu
and Kashmir is withdrawn."
</P>
<P>
The offer of ceasefire was made in Srinagar on July 24 by Majid
Dar, Hizbul's chief commander, and received overwhelming support
of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement made it clear that India remained firmly
committed to the peace process and called on all those who have
taken to arms to the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
It said that the question of dialogue with Pakistan was a
separate matter. "India is willing to talk with Pakistan on all
matters of bilateral concern when Pakistan puts an end to cross-
border terrorism," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Assembly Gives Critical Opinions to Wahid's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Most of factions in the Indonesia
's People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest law-
making body, gave here Tuesday critical opinions to incumbent
President Abdurrahman Wahid over his policies for nearly ten
months in office.
</P>
<P>
They were mostly "quite satisfied" with the president's
progress report delivered on Monday at the MPR session, but
however strongly urged him to be more serious in handling the
ongoing economic and political reform programs as well as creating
a conducive climate for economic and investment activities.
</P>
<P>
In a plenary session of the Assembly's annual meeting on
Tuesday, as many as 11 factions in the MPR delivered general views
on the implementation of the State Policy Guidelines (GBHN) by the
government which has been reported by President Abdurrahman Wahid
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It seems that Wahid has been under pressure to soon overcome
the protracted complex problem which has been faced by the
Indonesian people over past three years following the financial,
economic and political crisis which broke out in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his report, the president said that the country's economy
has moved away from the crisis. Wahid also said that the recovery
program has been implemented but admitting a lot of things have
not been handled yet.
</P>
<P>
The President also pledged to tackle the separatist threats
which he suggested mainly came from the riot-torn provinces of
Aceh, Maluku, and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
But the Reform Party faction in the Assembly said that what has
been delivered by the President on Monday was not a progress
report speech as there were no quantity data confirming that the
government (President has been successful in carrying out the
Assembly's mandate granted in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The faction even accused Wahid of failing to deal with the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is too bad that the President in fact has exacerbated the
crisis, instead of overcoming it. The president has not yet been
successful to recover the people's hope," Spokesman of the Reform
Party faction Nurdiaty Akmal said before the session.
</P>
<P>
But, on the same occasion, faction of the National Awakening
party (FKB considered that the government has been successful in
dealing with the huge complex problems resulted from the economic
and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Generally the report of the President has shown a honesty and
empirically that is a reasonable one," spokesman of the FKB
faction Mohammad Anwar Iskandar said before the session, adding
that the government has also been successful in carrying out
political and economic reform program.

<HEADLINE> Hizbul Mujahideen Calls Off Ceasefire in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Hizbul Mujahideen, the Kashmiri
militant group, Tuesday withdrew its unilateral ceasefire offer
after India refused to open tripartite talks aimed at resolving
the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Hizb's Supreme Commander Syed
Salahuddin at a press conference after the expiry of the deadline
of 5 p.m. set by the Kashmiri group for India to respond
positively to its goodwill gesture, the Associated Press of
Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
Hizbul Mujahideen has announced unilateral cease-fire on July
24 and invited India for unconditional talks to resolve the
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Hizb leadership urged India to open three way talks between
Islamabad, New Delhi and Kashmiris for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi refused to involve Pakistan in the dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
Salahuddin said, "Indian leadership has failed to respond to
our ice-breaking move, which could have become productive and
meaningful if India (had) accepted unconditional tripartite talks
between India, Pakistan and Kashmiris."

<TEXT>
<P>
Iskandar added that what have been reached by the government
under the leadership of President Wahid could be considered as a "
significant achievement", but citing there are still many things
should be done.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the government has been successful in
carrying out the economic reform program outlined in the letter of
intent.
</P>
<P>
"The government has also been successful in maintaining the
macroeconomic stability. That showed that the economic reforms
programs have been fully implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the president to create security condition to
attract more foreign investors to come to the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, faction of the National Police and the Indonesian
Military, the Crescent and Star Party (FPBB) as well as the
Democratic and Love Nation Faction (FDKB) underscored the
importance of maintaining security and national stability.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the government to pay more attention in handling
communal bloodshed in Maluku and North Maluku provinces as well as
handling conflict in Aceh province and taking immediate and
concrete measures to prevent it from spreading," spokesman of the
TNI faction Benyamin Baluk said, warning that the country now has
been facing a serious disintegration threat.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian National and Unity faction (FKKI), meanwhile,
said that in order to achieve the effectiveness of the cabinet
working, Wahid should make job division with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
"It is better for the president to pay attention on foreign
affairs while the domestic affairs are put on the shoulders of the
vice president," FKKI spokesman Sutradara Ginting said, adding
that the FKKI faction backed Wahid's plan to reshuffle his cabinet
and appoint the First Minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the President's statement on the economic progress,
the United Development Party Faction (FPPP) considered that such a
thing has not yet happened, saying that the national economy even
moved "nowhere", while the exchange rate of rupiah continued to
drop to a lower level.
</P>
<P>
"In the field of the national economy there is no progress made
by the Wahid's government," spokesman of the FPPP Burhanuddin
Somawinata said, citing the number of foreign investment in the
first six month of this year only reached 2.1 billion U.S. dollars,
a significant down compared to the same period of last year when
the figure stood at 10.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Somawinata also voiced his faction's disappointment over what
he said as a "sluggish process" of investigation into former
president Soeharto's corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the Golkar Party faction Asep Rukiman
Sujana viewed that the progress report of the president was still
too general and too normative and didn't cover problems in detail.
</P>
<P>
The administration of President Wahid, he said, has not yet
succeeded in dealing with the crisis, saying that the economic
condition even has been deteriorating as the economic growth is
only recorded at 3 percent within the current year or lower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
"And the exchange rate of rupiah also continues to drop and
even surpass the 9,000 rupiah level per U.S. dollar while the
Jakarta composite index on the Jakarta bourse dropped under 500
points," he added
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the biggest group in the Assembly, the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI Perjuangan) spotlighted the
President's working in combating rampant corruption, collusion and
nepotistic practices (KKN) in the country, saying that Wahid in
fact has created "a neo-KKN" in his administration.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the PDI Perjuanagn faction, Pramono Anung Wibowo
said, "the government's efforts to combat KKN is still not optimum.
"
</P>
<P>
But he said that in nearly ten months in office Wahid has
succeeded in promoting process of democratization in the country.
"We appreciate and give our support to the president in promoting
such a process," he said.
</P>
<P>
After receiving critical opinions, Wahid is expected to give a
"reply speech" on the general views of the Assembly's factions on
Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills Seven in Central Moscow, More Blasts Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A rush hour explosion that hit
central Moscow Tuesday afternoon has killed seven people and
injured 33 others.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at around 18:00 local time (1400 GMT) at an
underground passage near Pushkinskaya Ploshchad, a public square
not far away from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua reporter at the scene saw blood stains in the clearing
below the monument to Alexander Pushkin, the great Russian poet.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agents have reportedly defused a second
explosive device in the passage way as the Federal Security
Service (FSB) warned of more possible terrorist acts in the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the blast happened at one of the kiosks in the
underground passage way.
</P>
<P>
This has been the most powerful blast hitting Moscow so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Moscow was shocked by a series of apartment building
explosions that left hundreds of people dead and numerous more
injured. Authorities linked the blasts to Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
Emergency workers are still working at the scene but traffic
control has been somewhat eased. Traces of explosives could still
be smelt in the air following a bout of light rain.
</P>
<P>
Smoke could still be seen billowing from the walkway exit near
the monument to Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
A police office at the scene said the Pushkin square will be
closed until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, who rushed to the scene shortly
after the blast, branded the incident as a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the bombing occurred in a crowded area during
rush hour is indicative of this, Interfax quoted Luzhkov as saying.
</P>
<P>
City police have been put on heightened alert in the wake of
the blast and the Interior Ministry said underground walkways and
other crowded areas will be thoroughly checked.

<HEADLINE> Goh Chok Tong: Talents, Key to Singapore's Continued Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has fixed talents as the key to Singapore's development
and vowed to take measures to absorb global talents.
</P>
<P>
In his message Tuesday evening to mark the 35 anniversary of
Singapore's founding, the prime minister said the key to Singapore
's continued growth is talents and Singapore needs people,
Singaporeans and foreigners, to create opportunities for the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Singapore's economy grew by better than expected 8.
8 percent in the first half of this year and the Ministry of Trade
and Industry has raised its growth forecast to 7.5-8.5 percent for
the whole year.
</P>
<P>
"But we should recognize several realities around us and the
challenges they pose to our prosperity and national cohesion," he
said, referring to Singapore's fierce competition against the rest
of the world, the decreasing reliance on Southeast Asia as its
hinterland, the continuous retrenchments as a results of speeding-
up economic restructuring and the widening gap in the income
between the top and the bottom.
</P>
<P>
"We must do our best to strengthen our competitiveness to
create wealth in our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore has to absorb foreign talents, saying "
Singapore's own talent pool is too small for all the things we
want to do. We need to top it up with global talent."
</P>
<P>
Goh said another reason Singapore needs foreign talent is
because Singaporeans are not reproducing themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Far too many of our women remain unmarried and Singaporeans
who are married are not having big enough families to make up for
those who remain single," he said.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that the government will introduce more measures
to help Singaporeans overcome obstacles to marriage and having
children, adding this is not only in the long-term interest of the
nation but will also bring balance and fulfillment to lives.

<HEADLINE> Bidding for Istanbul Strait Tunnel Project Ends on August 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said on Wednesday that the
final technical bids for the Istanbul strait tunnel project linking
the Asian side and the European side of the city with another
railway, must be submitted on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Directorate General of Turkish State Ports and Airports
announced that the bidding consortia should hand in their final
technical bids before the deadline for evaluation, Anatolia news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After the evaluation, the Directorate General will hold

<HEADLINE> Yemen Reaffirms Support for Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
reaffirmed, in his meeting with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Edward Walker here on Wednesday, his country's support for
the Middle East peace process and the U.S. efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Saleh and Walker also reviewed bilateral ties as well as
regional and international issues of common concern, according to
the Yemeni News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Walker conveyed to Saleh a message from U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the latest developments in the peace process and the
results of the Camp David summit held last month in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The summit between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Clinton concluded on July 25 after
the Palestinian and Israeli sides failed to reach an agreement,
mainly due to disputes over the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive and lasting peace can not be established in the
Middle East unless the Arab legitimate rights are guaranteed, Saleh
told the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
The rights include the ending of Israeli occupation of Arab
land, the return of the Palestinian refugees, and the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its
capital in line with relevant United Nations resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace should be fair and balanced among all parties concerned,"
the Yemen leader said, stressing his country's support for the
choices of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Walker hailed the Yemeni-Saudi border agreement that
settled the long-standing border dispute between the two Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in June, is a significant contribution to
the protection of peace, security and stability in the region and a
rational ideal example that should be followed in solving regional
and international border disputes, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Abdul Qader Ba Jammal had a meeting with Walker on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Walker and his party arrived here on Tuesday on an official
visit to Yemen, the eighth leg of his regional tour that had taken
him to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait and
Oman.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Achieve Budget Balance in 2001: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia will have a balanced
federal budget next year, with the budget revenues and spending
both equal to 1.87 trillion rubles (62.3 billion U.S. dollars),
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 2001 budget plan projects gross domestic product (GDP) of 7.
75 trillion rubles (258.3 billion dollars), and an annual
inflation of 12 percent, Kudrin told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan for next year is based on an exchange rate of
30 rubles to one dollar. The rate is expected by Finance Ministry
specialists in accordance with the 2001 budget revenues and
spending and the forecast that world oil prices next year will "
reach the average level for the past decade," he said.
</P>
<P>
The budget draft eyes an oil price of 18 to 19 dollars per
barrel, and the government is not planning any monetary emissions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia plans to pay 14.5 billion dollars on its foreign debt
next year if the government does not manage to secure a
restructuring deal for Soviet-era debts to the Paris Club of
creditors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kudrin said that 56.4 percent of overall revenues will go into
federal coffers and 43.6 percent to the budgets of constituent
members of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the Finance Ministry will discuss the budget
parameters for next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new budget, the needs for Russia's security and for
combating terrorism will be fully financed. "All the financial
problems facing the law-enforcement agencies will be solved,"
stressed the minister.
</P>
<P>
The exact spending needs for national defense and anti-
terrorist operations will be taken up by senior Finance Ministry
officials Thursday and by the state's Security Council on Friday,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"I can't give any figures, but spending on national defense
will remain at this year's level," Kudrin said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that Russia will have an overall federal
budget surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP this year, while the primary
budget surplus, before debt repayment to foreign lenders, is
expected to be 4.7 percent of GDP.

WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Dara Torres, who ended her
seven-year retirement, got off to a stunning start at the U.S.
Olympic swimming trials in Indianapolis on Wednesday, by setting a
national record in the 100-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Torres, 33, who tried to be the first American to swim in four
Olympics, clocked a stunning time of 57.58 seconds, eclipsing
Jenny Thompson's mark of 57.88 set up in the Pan Pacific
Championships last year which beat Mary Meagher's 18-year-old
world record.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has the most Olympic golds of five without a
single one, also qualified in her heat with another strong time of
57.89.
</P>
<P>
Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands eclipsed Thompson's world
record in May, becoming the first woman to break the 57-second
barrier in a time of 56.64.
</P>
<P>
Torres competed in her first Olympics at Los Angeles in 1984
with a gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle relay, captured a
bronze and silver in the 1988 Games and another gold in the 400
relay in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
She only came out of retirement in July 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The value of commodities smuggled
into Peru from Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, and Brazil this year will
be more than one billion U.S. dollars, said a local business
leader Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Romulo Fernandez, Chamber of the Industry of Footwear, Leather

figure of 700 million dollars that supposedly would enter during
the year 2000 to this country is very low if compared with reality.
</P>
<P>
There was an increase of contraband through the northern border,
caused in a big measure by Ecuadoran dolarization process,
according to the National Industries Society (SNI).
</P>
<P>
Fernandez warned the Peruvian authorities about the increase of
smuggling in that zone, where the government has relaxed the
customs control.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Haiti's Electoral Process Marred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Wednesday that Haiti's legislative election on
May 21 went unexpectedly well, with the highest turnout for a
Haitian election since 1990, little violence and a visible and
disciplined police presence.
</P>
<P>
In his first report to the General Assembly on the work of the
United Nations International Civilian Support Mission to Haiti (
MICAH), Annan also said signs of electoral mismanagement abounded,
and the electoral process overall unfortunately was marred by a
climate of violence and intimidation, poor organization and
disregard for the Electoral Law in the calculation of the Senate
results.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the political crisis in the country had deepened,
the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rule of law in Haiti had suffered as a result
of the passivity or even complicity of some police and judicial
authorities in the face of violent demonstrations by members of so-
called popular organizations which targeted opposition parties,
journalists and the general population.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief stressed the importance of an independent police
force that respects the rights, and warned against any
politicization of the Haitian National Police.
</P>
<P>
MICAH, established in March 2000, aimed to promote justice,
human rights and train the police in the country.

RIYADH, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi soldier was killed and two
others injured in a shooting as a gunman attacked a compound
housing foreign military personnel in the south of the kingdom
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official SPA news agency reported the assailant, a Saudi
university student named Yasser Ahmed al-Qussadi, was arrested
shortly after the attack on the residential complex in Asir
province, more than 1,000 kilometers southwest of the capital
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The complex, reportedly housing American, British and Pakistani
military personnel and their families, is close to King Faisal Air
Base, one of seven military bases in the kingdom. The foreigners
help maintain the base and the Saudi air force.
</P>
<P>
The gunman is being interrogated, SPA said, without giving any
clue to the possible motivation of the attack.

<P>
A British Aerospace employee was also slightly injured in the

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Says to Take Precautionary Measures Against Iraqi Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said on Wednesday it
would take all precautionary measures against the latest threats
made by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday "against Kuwaiti
security and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said he had invited the ambassadors of the United
Nations Security Council's permanent members and Arab countries for
a meeting on the serious situation caused by Saddam's threats.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait should look into the situation cautiously and carefully,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also briefed the Non-Alignment Movement and Organization
of the Islamic Conference on the status quo and tensions caused by
Saddam's statements not only in the Gulf but in the entire Middle
East region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president delivered a speech Tuesday on the occasion
of the 12th anniversary of the end of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War,
condemning its Gulf neighbors of having "sold their souls" to the
United States and Israel for hosting Western military bases since
1990-1991 Gulf conflict.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British military planes stationed in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait patrol southern and northern Iraq to enforce the "no-fly"
zones they imposed there without authorization of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Saddam named Saudi Arabia in his televised speech, but did not
directly mention Kuwait, which it invaded in 1990 and occupied for
seven months before being driven out by the U.S.-led allied forces
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
August 2 marked the 10th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. An anti-Kuwait propaganda campaign was also launched in
Iraq's state-controlled media. An influential Iraqi newspaper said
Iraq was still capable of teaching Kuwait "an additional lesson."
</P>
<P>
Sabah told the Kuwaiti News Agency on Tuesday that Kuwait
condemned and rejected such statements.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi regime still has aggressive attitudes towards Kuwait
and the whole region, violating the Security Council resolutions
which provides for making sure of Iraq's good intention, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti National Assembly (parliament) Speaker Jasim
al-Kharafi on Wednesday sent a message to the Arab Inter-
Parliamentary Union President Abdul Qadir Bin Saleh, asking him to
issue a release denouncing Iraq's threats against Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Opposes Evacuating Jewish Communities From Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Moshe Katsav
said here on Wednesday that he is opposed to evacuating Jews from
the West Bank city of Hebron as part of an agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Katsav was reacting to Palestinian claims that Israel had agreed
to Jewish communities being evacuated from Hebron at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat earlier told a
Palestinian newspaper that Israeli negotiators at Camp David raised
the idea of vacating 63 West Bank settlements as well as the Jewish
enclaves of 450 settlers in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Touring Jerusalem for the first time after he officially took
office, Katsav said that Hebron had been Israel's first capital.
Jews had always been there and they should remain there, he added.
</P>
<P>
The eighth president of Israel, who took pains not to make
political statement about the status of Jerusalem, said he had a
definite idea of keeping the city united. However, he noted the
municipal border must be determined by the Knesset (parliament) and
the government.
</P>
<P>
Viewing the city from a vantage point of Mount Scopus in east
Jerusalem, the new president said "I prefer to remain above
political differences. Jerusalem should remain as a Jewish
capital."
</P>
<P>
Katsav, who ended his tour in a new archaeological park opposite
the Old City wall in east Jerusalem, called for the unity among the
Jews despite their political and religious differences. He said the
main reason for the destruction of the Holy Temple 2000 years ago
was because the Jewish people at that time were not untied.
</P>
<P>
The president refused to comment on the proposal of building a
synagogue on the Temple Mount, the most sacred site in Judaism and
also home to Islamic shrines, but expressed the confidence that a
solution will be found for the Jews and Muslims to pray without
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prime Minister Ehud Barak denied reports that Israel
offered to give the Palestinians Jerusalem's Mount of Olives, a
Jewish holy site in east Jerusalem from which Jesus was said to
enter the holy city a week prior to his death and that they agreed
to the eventual evacuation of the Jewish communities in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party led by Barak also issued a statement, saying
Jews will never be evacuated from Hebron, where about 450 Jewish
settlers live among 130,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Jews will not be uprooted and will
continue to live there for another 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
In an angry response to the Palestinian report, Jewish settlers
in Hebron vowed to start a "struggle without limits" on the
issue. "At all costs, we will not abandon Hebron," one Jewish
resident of the city told Israel Radio on Wednesday. "The
government will fall but we will remain here," the resident said.
</P>
<P>
The future of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one
of the tough issues to be settled by the Israelis and Palestinians
in the final status negotiations, along with the status of
Jerusalem, borders and security.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians failed to solve their difference
over the tough issues during the July 11-25 Camp David summit
brokered by the Untied States. Both sides are now conducting an
international campaign to win support for their positions in the
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> UAE Vows to Back Decisions in Forthcoming OPEC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has stressed its commitment to any resolutions to be adopted in the
coming summit of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi crown prince and deputy
supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces made the remarks
Wednesday in meeting with visiting Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
He said UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan will
support any resolutions that will be adopted at the coming OPEC
summit scheduled for September in Venezuelan capital Caracas,
according to the official news agency WAM.
</P>
<P>
Chavez is on a tour to the 10 other members of the oil cartel.
Inviting them to attend the September summit is the focus of
Chavez's current tour. The Caracas summit, the first in 25 years
and also the second in OPEC's history, is to mark the 40th birthday
of the 11-member oil cartel.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining stability of the world oil market and enhancing
cooperation with other OPEC members and between OPEC and non-OPEC
members are also brought up in Chavez's trip.
</P>
<P>
The 10 countries are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, Iraq,
Iran, Indonesia, Algeria, Libya and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Chavez is accompanied by Venezuelan Energy Minister Ali
Rodriguez, who is also the current OPEC president.
</P>
<P>
About the random breach of the OPEC strategies by some member
countries, Khalifa said the problem could be resolved through
serious measures to end individual decisions and concentrate more
on unified ones, adding that the loopholes in the cartel's policies
should also be blocked.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been working hard to ensure stability on the world
oil market by implementing the group's strategies, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa also called on OPEC members to agree on any prospected
plans to be raised in the Caracas summit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chavez praised the UAE for its commitment to OPEC resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed bilateral ties and cooperation
between the two countries, the latest developments on the world oil
market and ways to maintain the market stability.

<HEADLINE> EU Merger Scrutiny on Hold for Media Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday put on hold its scrutiny of merging media giants Vivendi,
Canal Plus and Seagram.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, explained that it had suspended its probe into the
competition aspects of the merger deal worth 34 billion U.S.
dollars to wait for more data regarding the deal.
</P>
<P>
The commission was originally set to decide whether to clear
the merger deal on August 21 or send it for an extended four-month
full investigation on any breach of the commission's competition
rules.
</P>
<P>
Once it has received the extra yet unspecified information from
the companies involved the commission will start again its one-
month review of the merging attempt.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi, a media, telecoms and utilities group, said in June
that it had planned to merge with pay-TV Canal Plus and Seagram to
form a media giant to be called Vivendi Universal to rival AOL-
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission already subjected to its in-depth
investigation the merger of American-Online (AOL) and Time Warner.
That is a signal of the commission's concern at the possible
implication of the mega media merger.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi and Canal Plus, however, said they remain confident
that the European Union's competition watchdog would rule in their
favor of the tie-up with Seagram before the end of September.

<HEADLINE> New Revelation on Assassination of Former Congolese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian parliamentary
investigators into the assassination of the former Congolese prime
minister got a new clue, local television network reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
RTBF, the radio and television network for the French-speaking
part of Belgium, said that American archives had linked the
assassination of Patrice Lumumba to ex-U.S. President Dwight
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
The television network quoted the achieves as saying that the
American president had given the order "to eliminate" the leader
of the independence movement.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has formed a parliamentary commission specializing in
the investigation of the politically-motivated murder of the
Congolese leader of the independence of the African country.
</P>
<P>
Not long after the Congolese independence in 1960, Lumumba was
kidnapped and handed to a rebel group, and was later killed and
his body mysteriously disappeared.
</P>
<P>
One Belgian police officer working at the time in the Congo, a
colony of Belgium before its independence, admitted that he had
taken part in the execution of the Congolese prime minister and
the destruction of his body afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian parliamentary commission has met twice already and
is scheduled to meet a third time after the summer recess to
define the role Belgium had played in the assassination of Lumumba.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia's "Name Issue" Likely to be Solved Soon, Says Georgievski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- After years of fierce wrangling,
Greece and Macedonia will eventually find a solution to the
problem of Macedonia's name issue soon, which is believed to be
the only difference between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Greece's northwest island of Corfu where he
arrived for a summer holiday, Macedonian Premier Ljubco
Georgievski said Wednesday that his country's name dispute with
Greece would be resolved by the end of the year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski also voiced his satisfaction over the development
of economic relations between Macedonia and Greece.
</P>
<P>
In Corfu, Georgievski also met with Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou, who said that bilateral relations between the
two countries were particularly stable.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said there were differences, but a good
relationship could lead to a positive conclusion over the name
issue that separates the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, which declared independence from the former
Yugoslavia in 1991, was admitted to the U.N. in 1993 under the
provisional name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (
FYROM) pending a definitive solution.
</P>
<P>
Greece disputes Macedonia's right to use that name, saying
that it implies that the Skopje government has territorial designs
on the Greek Macedonia, a major northern province of Greece.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Greece has imposed two trade embargoes against the
former Yugoslav republic in order to force Skopje not to use the
name of Macedonia. In 1995, the two countries signed an interim
agreement to normalize their relations and left the name issue to
be decided through U.N. mediation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the name dispute, the two countries have witnessed the
increasingly development of trade relations in recent years.

<HEADLINE> BP Profits Leap On Surging Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) - Oil giant BP has announed a giant
surge in profits for the first six months of this year, as its
recent mergers with Arco and Amoco begins to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
The company saw its profits jump 175 percent to 5.5 billion
pounds in the first half of this year, compared with 2 billion
pounds in the corresponding period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
It said the increase was largely attributed to its recent
merges with the US giant oil company Amoco, with Arco and the
takeover of Burmah Castrol, which it completed in July.
</P>
<P>
BP's Chairman John Browne said that "these results represent
the cumulative impact of the progress we've made over the last few
years -- growth in volume and, eqully important, growth in total
productivity resulting from the way in which we work."
</P>
<P>
However, BP's total oil production continued to fall in the
second quarter, reflecting disposals, although gas production
surged on gains from the takeover of Amoco.
</P>
<P>
The company is planing to increase investment in the North Sea
in an effort to accelerate growth in the group's sluggish oil
output.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the company had to assure investors that it could
cut costs and maintain growth in times when the oil price is not
soaring to new highs, unlike at the current time.

vital for the development of the society, Gurirab said in his
message on the occasion of the observance. He praised youth's "
unique perspectives that need to be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. official noted, the needs and aspirations of
young people are "largely unmet" as economic difficulties in many
developing countries pose problems for them.
</P>
<P>
Even in industrialized nations, youths face uncertainties
regarding the future, due in part to limited employment
opportunities, Gurirab said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. defines youth as the age group between 15 and 24 years
old, which make up one sixth of the world population exceeding six
billion.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has targeted several priority areas to work for youth.
They include education, employment, poverty eradication, health,
environment, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and leisure-time
activities.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Vows to Seize Moscow Blast Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
pledged Wednesday to find and chastise the organizers of the
Tuesday explosion in Central Moscow which killed seven people and
injured nearly a hundred of others.
</P>
<P>
Putin has ordered state power agencies to do all possible to
avoid more of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
"The conspirators behind the Tuesday evening bombing at Moscow'
s Pushkin Square will be tracked down and the authorities'
crackdown on terrorist crime will be doubled, proportionate,"
Putin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, immediately after the tragedy in the heart of
Moscow, two scenarios were considered: an accident and a
premeditated crime. Initial investigation show it was a crime: a
consequence of rivalry between criminal groups, or a terrorist act,
" Putin told the press.
</P>
<P>
"If one views this as a terrorist act, I have to say that it
would be wrong to seek a Chechen or any other ethnic connection in
the crime," he noted. "It's wrong to brand a whole people, as
criminals and terrorists have neither nationality nor religion."
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is not Russia's specific ailment, but also an
international illness. However, the terrorism problem is
especially relevant in Russia because "we have allowed an enclave
of terrorism inside this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorists always strike where there are many people. They
expect blood, sensation, panic and hysteria. Disorganization and
disorder is the best possible gift for them," Putin stressed.
</P>
<P>
Political will, systematic efforts of the law enforcement
agencies, the vigilance of the people and better coordination
between federal agencies should be and must be thrown up in front
of terrorists, he said.
</P>
<P>
A proper response to terrorist threat is the sole remedy,"
emphasized the president, reaffirming that Russia's military
operation in the North Caucasus will be pursued to its completion
and "the terrorists will be finished off in their breeding grounds.
"
</P>
<P>
He instructed the state law enforcement agencies to make every
effort to protect the population in other regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will find the names of the perpetrators and sponsors of the
crime on Pushkin Square. We have seized those who committed the
crimes in Moscow, Dagestan and Northern Ossetia earlier. The state
will not let them go unpunished," Putin said in a determined tone.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Putin decided to personally oversee the investigation
into the shocking bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow police force has been put on high alert to guard
especially important installations, crowded areas and transport
systems as well as residential districts where over 33,000 multi-
story apartment buildings stand.
</P>
<P>
Preventive steps have also been taken in other Russian cities
and regions, said the Russian Interior Ministry Wednesday.

<P>
ABU DHABI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday afternoon from
Doha on a short visit as part of his tour of member states of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The president was inviting heads of state of OPEC members for a
second OPEC summit, also the first such summit in 25 years, to be
held in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas late September, to mark
the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the cartel.
</P>
<P>
He will also discuss with UAE leaders other issues such as how
to maintain stability of the oil market and how to cooperate with
other OPEC members and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who had already visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the
ongoing 10-nation tour, has urged the Gulf countries to form a "
strategic" alliance with Venezuela to help it develop its
petrochemical and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, accompanied by Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez, who is
also the current OPEC president, was received on his arrival by
Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi crown prince and deputy
supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces, according to the
official news agency WAM.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Rodriguez, who had visited the UAE last month, called
on OPEC members to comply with output quotas to prevent further
erosion in prices, which have come off their recent peaks. He had
earlier warned of a possible price crash to low levels seen in 1998
and early in 1999 if OPEC members continue to glut the market.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Raps Israeli Rabbi's Anti-Arab Statements as Anti-Semitic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
denounced on Wednesday statements by Rabbi Ovedia Youssef,
spiritual leader of Israeli ultra-Orthodox Shas party, against
Arabs and Muslims as "anti-Semitic" and out of an apartheid
perspective.
</P>
<P>
Youssef in his weekly sermon on Saturday described Arabs,
particularly the Palestinians, as "snakes" and "accursed people"
and said that God would be sorry for creating them.
</P>
<P>
The rabbi, who represents Sephardic Jews of Middle East origin,
also said the 6 million Jews, mostly Ashkenazi, or European, Jews,
killed in the Nazi Holocaust were reincarnations of souls seeking
atonement for their past sins.
</P>
<P>
Youssef's statements represented an insult to the Arabs as a
race and a nation, Moussa said, quoted by the state-run Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that such statements, in addition to an earlier
statement by a former Israeli cabinet minister that the Arabs could
be "placed inside a bottle as bugs," indicate extremely dangerous
racist convictions.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that such statements could interpret
a lot about the Israeli political positions on the Middle East
peace process and other issues.
</P>
<P>
People who made these comments have no reason to accuse anyone
of anti-Semitism, a charge Israel has often levelled against the
Egyptian press.
</P>
<P>
According to Islam, both the Arabs and Jews are descendants of
Prophet Ibrahim, the Koranic equivalent of the biblical Abraham.

JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Wednesday evening that he will restructure his
cabinet and make the country's bureaucracy more slim in a bid to
increase the efficiency of the government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Assembly's annual session, Wahid said that he
also will delegate Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputeri to carry
out the government's technical daily activities, such as arranging
the agenda of cabinet working and determine the focus and priority
of the government.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president is expected to give a regular report to the
President on her duties," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Spontaneously, Wahid's statement was hailed by all members of
the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's cabinet has been under fire for its alleged failure in
dealing with the ongoing economic and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president has indicated that he will reshuffle his
cabinet and may appoint a first minister to be in charge of
coordinating cabinet working, but such a plan was strongly opposed
by many.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I have been wondering to restructure the cabinet,
not only (make) a reshuffle," Wahid said, adding that with this
move the effectiveness of the cabinet working is expected to be
reached.
</P>
<P>
He said the re-structurization of the cabinet is in line with
the spirit of the decentralization policy which now has been
carried out by the government.
</P>
<P>
However, Wahid gave no details on how the cabinet would be
restructured and when it will take place.

of apartment buildings. Telephone calls reporting suspected
packages of explosives have increased rapidly, said the city
police department, adding that all the reports have turned out to
be false alarms.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 policemen had been deployed in Moscow's subway
system, the Moscow General Police Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Dog handlers with bomb-sniffing dogs are also working along the
subway, checking for explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the bombing, the Kremlin Security Service has
intensified measures to guard the buildings in which state
agencies are housed, said the security service, giving no details
of the measures.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua reporter learned that security around the Kremlin, the
buildings of both houses of parliament, the government residence
and the buildings in which state agencies are headquartered and
their adjacent territories, has been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
Security at the key communications and other transportation
facilities has also been tightened.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Mayor's Office has given instructions to citizens on
what to do if suspicious objects are found on public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Apartment buildings and uninhabited premises were checked last
night in Moscow. According to the Moscow Main Department of
Internal Affairs, about 6,000 apartments, 7,000 entrance halls, as
well as attics and basements were checked throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
Over 650 of the city's vital facilities, including reservoirs,
heat and power plants and gas lines have been put under
intensified security.
</P>
<P>
Security has been specially tightened in crowded areas,
underground walkways near metro stations and ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Atomic Energy Ministry ordered Wednesday morning
that security at all Russian nuclear facilities be tightened, the
ministry press service told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Russian special services have detained two men suspected of
organizing the Tuesday evening bombing -- one from Chechnya and
another from the Caucasian republic of Dagestan, said Vladimir
Pronichev, head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) operating
headquarters in charge of investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Russia's ORT television Wednesday, the FSB
chief did not rule out "a Chechen connection" in the organization
of the terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential envoy to the Southern Federal District
Viktor Kazantsev on Wednesday described the bombing as "a ruthless
and brazen bandit challenge," urging law enforcement agencies to "
respond to this challenge quickly and professionally, not only in
Moscow but elsewhere in Russia."
</P>
<P>
Seven people were killed in Tuesday's blast, including five
women and two men. Two female victims have been identified: Olga
Udalova, 18, and Anna Fyodorova, 20, the Moscow civil defense and
emergency situations authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Documents of a person called Alexander Kolbin, 38, were found
near the body of one of the victims. But experts were not sure
whether they belonged to that victim.

<HEADLINE> Russia Steps Up Strikes on Chechen Rebels After Moscow Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia has strengthened air and
ground strikes against Chechen rebels, killing scores of militants
after a terrorist blast rocking central Moscow Tuesday evening,
Russian news agencies reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion during rush hour in an underground walkway in
downtown Moscow near Pushkin Square, just hundreds of meters away
from the Kremlin tore up the marketplace there, leaving seven
civilians dead and nearly 100 injured.
</P>
<P>
Russian special services believed that Chechen terrorists are
behind the explosion as they did in the apartment bloc blasts in
Moscow one year ago which claimed over 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, just hours after the
blast, Russian servicemen "eliminated" a large rebel group led by
Chechen field commander Abu Khadzhiyev in the village of Gekhi,
south Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were tracked down shortly after two armored vehicles
of Russia's Interior Ministry were blown up by a mine outside the
village of Samashki and Khadzhiyev was killed in the following
clash, Interfax cited the Russian forces' press center in the
North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khadzhiyev had a criminal record of murdering 12 federal
policemen and often used the identification cards of the policemen
he had killed while committing crimes outside Chechnya, said the
press center.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, Russian troops killed five rebels,
including Khadzhiyev, and captured 56 militants.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces scored a number of successes in battles
against prominent Chechen field commanders on Tuesday, said Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, the spokesman of the Kremlin office on Chechnya on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Federal aircraft have carried out a series of missile and bomb
attacks against rebel positions in the Argun and Vedeno gorges in
the southern mountains of war-ravaged Chechnya, destroying three
rebel strongholds and two mountains passes.
</P>
<P>
During one of the battles, a Chechen field commander, "
Brigadier General Israilov" was seized by federal troops in
Chechnya, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three armed rebels "specializing in subversive
operations" were captured outside Chechen-Aul, it said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on whether Tuesday's blast in Moscow bore any
hallmark of Chechen involvement, the office said: "Several
versions are being considered, including the Chechen connection,"
citing the rebels' recent threats to stage a wave of terrorist
acts throughout Russia during the first anniversary of the so-
called Ichkeria (rebels' Chechen republic) independence.
</P>
<P>
However, Chechen "President" Aslan Maskhadov on Wednesday in a
statement denied rebels' involvement in the bombing, according to
Western media.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chechen rebels were continuing to shoot at
federal positions and booby-trap possible routes for Russian
convoy movements, as over 800 rebel fighters were reported to have
moved down to Chechen flatlands, the Itar-Tass news agencies
quoted the headquarters of the Russian forces in the North
Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military said that the rebel leaders had not
changed their plans to attack populated areas on the republic's
plains and their formations had gathered in the republic's Urus-
Martan, Shali and Gudermes districts.

<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Strasbourg-based Council of
Europe Wednesday condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Russia,
Spain and France.
</P>
<P>
"Violence cannot lead to solutions, but only new violence,"
said Council of Europe's Secretary General Walter Schwimmer in a
communique.
</P>
<P>
He described the recent terrorist attacks in Corsica in France,
Basque region in Spain and Moscow in Russia as simple criminal
acts which should be condemned by all who want political solutions
to disputes.
</P>
<P>
"There should never be any international support to those who
committed these absurd assassinations. On the contrary, we need a
reinforcement of international cooperation for fighting terrorism,
" Schwimmer said.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were killed in a bomb blast in a commercial
underground center in Moscow on Tuesday, while five people were
killed in two car bomb attacks in the Basque region of Spain on

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Not to Pressure Palestinians Over Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
reiterated on Wednesday that Cairo will not pressure Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to make concessions over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It is unimaginable that any Arab or Islamic country or any state
that has sense of justice will ask Arafat to be so flexible as to
concede Jerusalem to Israel, Moussa told reporters after a meeting
between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed hope that the Palestinians and Israelis will
resume peace talks in a few weeks without Israel's so-called red
lines which, he alleged, have caused the current breakdown of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He called for joint efforts to advance the peace process on the
basis of international law and United Nations Security Council
resolutions in a bid to reach a comprehensive and balanced peace in
the region, which will secure Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He added that Arafat's talks with Mubarak focused on the
Jerusalem issue and what the Arab and Islamic world can do to
preserve the Palestinians' and Arabs' rights and to protect the
mosques and churches in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it
and declared the whole city its "eternal and undivided capital," a
claim not recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolution 242, East Jerusalem is part of the
occupied Arab land and should be returned. The Palestinians want
this part as the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here late Tuesday on his third visit since the
Palestinian-Israeli Camp David summit collapsed in the United
States on July 25. He left for Gaza after the meeting with Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Convert Rebel Camp to Eco-Zone by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the government will work to convert
the former secessionist base Camp Abubakar into an economic zone
by 2004 as it pursues peace and development efforts in Mindanao,.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, Estrada made this clear
as he presided over the first meeting in Mindanao of the Mindanao
Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
"Camp Abubakar, where the soldiers proudly raised the
Philippine flag, will be developed into a special economic zone.
We will do all of these before I step down as President in the
year 2004," he declared in Davao City.
</P>
<P>
Camp Abubakar, once the headquarters of the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), was seized by government troops on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will not tolerate the MILF's guerrilla tactics
and harassment activities against the military and the civilian
population, in the same way that he will never allow the
government to relax its guard against crime.
</P>
<P>
The president noted he already has a list of names of
government officials suspected of coddling the MILF, and has
ordered investigators to build cases against them.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that he will pursue his bid to seek extra
powers from Congress to fast-track the rehabilitation and
development of Mindanao. "I am again asking Congress to speed up
its passage," said the president.
</P>
<P>
However, he maintained that he is ready to implement Mindanao's
rehabilitation with or without these special powers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that with the MILF's war machinery broken, it is
time to win the peace and turn Mindanao into a food basket, as he
has always envisioned.

destroyed some of its facilities will resume normal runs on August
16, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Carlos Borromeo, undersecretary of the Department
of Transportation and Communications, the government will assure

In Tuesday's accident, a train pared at the LRT depot was hit
by another train entering the garage. No people was hurt and the
damage to the coaches appeared not extensive, Borromeo said.

affected the system which serve an average of about 400,000
passengers daily.
</P>
<P>
The strikers occupied LRT stations and blocked some of the rail
lines. A return-to-work order was issued July 26 by the labor
department, but most of the strikers defied it.
</P>
<P>
They were dispersed on July 26 and the LRT runs resumed August
2, but only on a limited basis, one in the morning, from 6:00 a.m.
to 9:00 a.m. and the other in the afternoon from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00

<HEADLINE> SAARC Cumulation Rule to Help Bangladesh Expand Garments Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Garment
Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) Wednesday told
newsmen that the Cumulation Rule of South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC will help expand market for the
country's ready-made garments.
</P>
<P>
Fresh employment opportunities will be created and closed
garment factories will be reopened with establishment of more new
factories following market expansion due to this rule, the BGMEA
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC Cumulation Rule, when coming in force fully, will allow
the local garment manufacturers to use fabrics imported from any
of the SAARC countries for exporting finished products to 15
European Union (EU countries to receive the Generalized System of
Preference GSP) facilities
</P>
<P>
Previously they were supposed to use the local fabrics for
exporting to EU countries to be entitled to get the GSP facilities.
</P>
<P>
BGMEA has already hailed the government for its acceptance of
the rule, while the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, fearing
the garment exporters will prefer fabrics from other countries
under the rule, has said it will "destroy the local textile sector.
"
</P>
<P>
The garment sector leaders pointed out that the local textile
sector, which hardly meets 10 percent of total requirement of
fabrics of the garment factories, can not even supply the products
on time, adding that the price of the local fabrics is high and
the quality is not up to the mark.

for Lebanon, which was deployed there Monday.

"It confirms the commitment by the Lebanese government to
assume the part of their responsibility which belongs to it as the
only legitimate authority for ensuring the return to public order
and interior security in all the former (Israeli) occupied zone in
southern Lebanon," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of marketing
professionals from across the Asian region gathered at the
MarComAsia2000 Conference here Wednesday to offer insights on
advertising skills and seek new development in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain an edge in today's highly competitive global
market, international marketing professionals need a high degree
of innovation and responsiveness," said Frederick Lam, Deputy
Executive of the Trade Development Council of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming remarks to the two-day conference, Lam said
that, with the economic transformation and the opening up of the
Chinese mainland market, the advertising, marketing and
communications industries have undergone rapid growth in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the advent of the Internet age has created enormous
new challenges and opportunities for these industries," Lam added.
</P>
<P>
In reference to Hong Kong, Lam pointed out that the advertising,
marketing and communications industries underpin Hong Kong's
status as a leading regional marketing and communications hub, and
form an important part of its services sector.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, these industries have proven crucial to Hong
Kong's economic development, bridging the gap between supply and
demand and stimulating business development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dedicated to the advertising, marketing and communications
industries, the annual MarComAsia Conference provides a platform
for industry practitioners to exchange information and to share
their experience.
</P>
<P>
This year's conference covers four areas, including advertising,
marketing, the Internet and the Chinese mainland market.
</P>
<P>
Prominent industry experts from leading international
advertising and marketing firms will share their experience on
advertising skills, case studies of successful marketing and brand-
building, Internet marketing and latest researches on the Chinese
mainland market.
</P>
<P>
The MarComAsia2000 Conference is part of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council's efforts to help enhance Hong Kong's position
as Asia's media, advertising and marketing center.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a leading exporter of advertising and market
research services. In 1998, Hong Kong's exports of these services
amounted to 2,149 million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 societies and
associations throughout the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) jointly issued a statement Wednesday to support the
government to continue its efforts to build Hong Kong into a more
beautiful, world-class city.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, entitled "Hong Kong Is My Home", leaders from
these organizations called on the whole community to support the
SAR government to implement the principle of "One Country, Two
Systems" and the Basic Law to further the maintenance of Hong Kong
's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
They said that the current reforms introduced by the SAR
government in education, health care, environmental protection,
property and pubic servant system conform to the development of
the global new economy and help enhance Hong Kong's
competitiveness as a whole and lay a solid foundation for its long-
term development.
</P>
<P>
It is quite normal that problems may rise in the course of the
reforms and it is understandable that attitudes and opinions to
the reforms may be different, but the opinions should be
constructive and taken into consideration the overall situation,
the leaders said.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their firm support to the government's
action to crack down on the lawbreakers who were identified to set
fire on a government building recently, in order to maintain Hong
Kong's legal system and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The statement hailed the great achievements the SAR government
led by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa made in maintaining Hong Kong
's democracy and legal system over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the good social order, the unchanged life style
and the success of economic recovery from the Asian financial
crisis to the joint efforts made by the government and the whole
community.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued at a forum organized by 12 major Hong
Kong non-governmental societies and associations. Secretary for
Justice Elsie Leung delivered at the meeting a speech on the
implementation of the Basic Law.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks closed down
slightly Wednesday, as the decline of China Mobile dragged down
the early gains of blue chips.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index shed 29.85 points, or 0.17 percent, to
close at 17,181.99. The turnover was 16.099 billion HK dollars (2.
064 billion U.S. dollars), compared with Tuesday's 15.529 billion
HK dollars (1.991 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The blue chips opened 94.35 points higher at 17,306.19, but the
selling pressure of China Mobile soon offset the gains of the Hang
Seng Index that reached the day's high of 17,446.67.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said that the word that China Telecom, former parent of
China Mobile, would get a mobile phone license triggered the
selling.
</P>
<P>
Of the four sub-indexes, only Finance gained 0.21 percent,
while Utilities, Properties and Commerce &AMP; Industry fell 0.23
percent, 0.04 percent and 0.41 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China
has accelerated its efforts to turn low-yield hillside farmland
into grassland and woodland.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, more than 40,000 hectares of farmland on
mountain slopes in the province on the middle reaches of the
Yellow River has been turned into grassland or forest, a
provincial government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The province is concentrating this work on 16 counties along
the river, which suffer from serious soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has set up a special organ to take
charge of the work, and formulated specific plans and methods for
turning the farmland over to growing grass and trees, and for
farmers to enjoy state subsidies and grain allowances after they
give up their farmland.
</P>
<P>
The province has stressed that the trees to be planted on the
former farmland should be favorable for soil improvement, and
urged farmers to fence in their cattle and sheep to protect the
young trees.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The customs in Xiamen, a port city
in east China's Fujian Province, has closed down an underground
center for pirating VCDs, confiscating four imported VCD
production lines and raw materials, a local customs official said
today.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest case involving VCD pirating in recent years,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The VCD pirating center was located in the Jinnan Industrial
Development Park in Jinjiang City, and the illegal work was
carried on under the guise of the production of polyester fiber.
</P>
<P>
The four VCD production lines were imported in 1999, and the
daily output was 80,000 VCDs. The head of the VCD pirating center
has been detained, and the case is now being prosecuted, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> IT Talents Continue to be in High Demand in HK: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The survey, released Wednesday by a global management
consulting firm, showed that most Hong Kong companies believe the
top four skills expected to be in highest demand in the future are
all related to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The top four are Web design and development, Web infrastructure,
Web security and Electronic data interchange and electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
"These four Internet skills are likely to see the fastest
growth in demand over the next 6 months and the trend is likely to
continue afterwards," said Felix Li, consultant with Hewitt
Associates, which carried out the hot skills survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, currently, the highest paid IT people
are skilled in relational database management systems. Coming in
second and third are database analysis and development, and
information security.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed the instable nature of the IT
workforce in Hong Kong as though Hong Kong companies are paying
top dollar for employees with "hot" technology skills, nearly one
in four employees leave their jobs each year, almost twice the
turnover rate seen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Staff turnover can cost a company up to three times the
departed employee's pay, which makes this a significant issue for
Hong Kong companies," said Catherine Mudford, managing consultant
at Hewitt Associates.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt Associates' Hong Kong Hot Skills survey also showed that
Hong Kong demands multi-talented workforce. About three-quarters
of all incumbents use at least two hot skills, in contrast to only
about a quarter in the U.S., it said.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt Associates is a global management consulting firm
specializing in strategic workforce solutions. With 1999 revenues
of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars, the firm serves more than 75 percent
of the Fortune 500 and more than a third of the Global 500

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Seoul has
installed 10 security cameras in the trees in front of its
compound in downtown Seoul, the South Korean daily Hankyoreh
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the U.S. embassy has recently placed 10 lamp-
shaped security cameras in the middle of the trees just outside
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The super-modern cameras, which are products of Japan's
Panasonic, can take images of any person or material with light as
low as 0.2 luxes, and can rotate 360 degrees and take close-ups of
faces 30 meters away.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. embassy declined to comment on the cameras, citing
security reasons," the Hankyoreh said.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the cameras came amid strong anti-U.S.
sentiments in South Korea after the United States Forces Korea (
USFK) was accused of discharging poisonous chemicals formaldehyde
into the Han River and the USFK bombing practice in Maehyang-ri
along the west coast that caused great damage and injuries to the
local residents.

CHENGDU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A female giant panda in the
Wolong Giant Panda Protection Center, in southwest China's Sichuan

<HEADLINE> China Developing Southwestern Sea Outlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China is smoothing out traffic
barriers from the landlocked western region to the southwestern
sea-outlet in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which faces
the Beibu Gulf, in a bid to re-open an old shortcut for sea
exports.
</P>
<P>
Advanced port facilities, processing factories, and roads are
under construction in the region. Sea ports there are taking on a
bustling scene, which very much resembles their past glory 2,000
years ago when ancient sea trade to middle and western Asia was
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese merchants sent their goods from Guangxi to
other Asian countries, to Europe, and to America. The busy sea
route was known as the "Silk Road on the sea," which became
deserted with the weakening of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
After the policy of reform and opening to the outside world was
adopted more than 20 years ago, Guangxi has achieved rapid
development and attracted an increasing number of business people
from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
To lower transport costs, provinces in southwestern China began
to send their export goods to Guangxi rather than the eastern
coast as they did before. The shortcut will save 100-1,000 km of
land journey for export freights sent from landlocked Yunnan,
Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces, and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
China has so far pooled 100 billion yuan (12 billion U.S.
dollars) to improve traffic links, including railways, waterways,
roads, and airports to help smooth traffic barriers in the
resource-rich western areas, which boast the country's principal
mineral reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's strategy to develop the western region,
which officially kicked off last year, is going on smoothly and
swiftly, due to high expectation and credit. A number of highways
and railways from inland areas to sea ports in Guangxi have become
operational.
</P>
<P>
Improved transport facilities have also resulted in flourishing
trade between southwestern China provinces and neighboring Myanmar,
Viet Nam, Thailand and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Obese Students Busy Loosing Weight During Summer Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- This summer vacation may have
been one of the happiest times in the life of Meng Qinggang's.
Meng, who weighs 265 kilograms, or 583.7 pounds, has successfully
lost more than 50 kilograms of weight following one month's
treatment at Tianjin Aimin Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Meng is one of the thousands of persons to have lost weight at
Tianjin Aimin Hospital, the only hospital in China that
specializes in weight loss by means of acupuncture and traditional
Chinese medicine. The hospital has been crowded with students
hoping to lose weight since this year's summer vacation began in
late July.
</P>
<P>
Everyday over 1,200 people come to the hospital for outpatient
services, according to Doctor Li, a member of the hospital staff.
More than half of people using the services are students. During
the eight-week vacation students have time to focus on weight loss.
</P>
<P>
Cases of obesity has been increasing among China's 300 million
children at an annual rate of eight percent. According to doctors
at Aimin Hospital, the number of middle and elementary school
students in Tianjin, an industrial city in north China with double
the standard weight has surpassed 600.
</P>
<P>
The health of obese children is worrying to parents. Obesity
can not only be an inconvenience to children's everyday lives, but
it can also lead to psychological and physical diseases.
</P>
<P>
Obese children often suffer from low self-esteem and often have
inferiority complexes. They may also be excluded from their school
peer groups.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nutritionists have pointed out that obesity, which
is often the result of an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle,
may lead to high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
and related complications.
</P>
<P>
The latest studies also show that overweight children are
likely to have low levels of sexual activity when they reach
adulthood, and in the worst cases they may have difficulty in
leading normal sexual lives or even they may suffer lifetime
sterility.

<HEADLINE> Gas Pipeline Project to Help Shanghai to Readjust Energy Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- As the preparatory work for the
China's west-east gas pipeline project is going well, this eastern
China metropolis will readjust its energy structure in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
The city will cease to build coal-burning power plants and coal
gas plants, and will bring coal-burning facilities under control,
a government official said today.
</P>
<P>
It will also accelerate the construction of gas-burning power
plants and expand natural gas services to residents, the official
said at a meeting on readjusting the city's energy structure.
</P>
<P>
The west-east gas pipeline project is aimed at transferring
over 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually to Shanghai
from the Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, home
to one of China's largest oil and natural gas reserves, with more
than 200 billion cubic meters of proven natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline's construction, which will take about six years to
complete, is scheduled to begin next year. The 4,200-km-long
pipeline will wind its way through nine autonomous regions and
provinces before entering Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Now the annual coal consumption in Shanghai is about 42 million
tons, accounting for 70 percent of the total energy consumption in
the city, resulting in heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Shanghai will speed up the
construction of a gas pipe network with diversified investment. By
2005, the natural gas consumption in the city will reach three
billion cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Defers Former Interior Minister's Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court ruled
Wednesday that Aryeh Deri, the former interior minister and former
leader of the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party, will not begin
serving his three-year imprisonment sentence on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deri submitted to the Court a request for rehearing his case
last Friday, arguing that there are reasonable chances to cancel
his conviction on charges of bribery taking, breach of trust and
aggravated fraud, or even to overturn his three-year jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli High Court Justice Aharon Barak ruled Wednesday that
since the prison term had not begun, the imprisonment could be
postponed until the appeal for a new hearing is debated, court
officials announced.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling said the postponement should last only "for
a short while."
</P>
<P>
Deri, the country's youngest interior minister in history and a
once rising political star, was sentenced to four years in prison
in March 1999 on charges of bribery taking, breach of trust and
fraud while he served as the interior minister in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Shas party later astonished the country by seizing 17 seats in
the 120-member parliament in the 1999 general elections, arguing
that Deri's conviction was ethnical discrimination against Sephardi
Jews, who are Shas's major constituents and originate from Arab
countries in North Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Deri resigned from Shas party leadership soon after the
elections, clearing the way for the party to join in the coalition
led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Deri case has been the haunting specter plaguing
the relationship between Barak and the Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the High Court upheld Deri's bribery conviction but
reduced his sentence term to three years. Deri was also ordered to
begin to serve his prison term on August 13.
</P>
<P>
If the charismatic young politician, who enjoys father-son-like
ties with Shas's spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is thrown
behind the bars finally, he will be prohibited from running for
public office, or acting as ministers, for 10 years after he
finishes his prison term.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Export Tractors to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran will export 22 of its
domestic-made Model 285 tractors to Kenya in a sign of expanded
technical and engineering cooperation between the two countries,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal has been approved by the Kenyan Agriculture Ministry,
which expressed its satisfaction with the quality of Iranian-made
tractors, said Abbas Arjmandi, an official of the Tabriz Tractor
Manufacturing Company, in Iran's northeastern East Azarbaijan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Iran signed a technical-engineering agreement with Kenya for the
export of tractors and technical services during a visit to Tehran
by the Kenyan president last year.
</P>
<P>
The export of tractors to Kenya will also pave the way for
exporting Iranian products to other east African countries such as
Ethiopia and Uganda, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Tabriz Tractor Manufacturing Company produced 7,436 tractors
during the last Iranian year (ended March 19, 2000). The figure is
expected to more than double this year and reach 16,500, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Currently some 60 tractors are produced at the company daily and
80 percent of the tractors' parts are made in Iranian factories.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Troops Deployed in South, Starts Patrol 1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to exercise its
sovereignty over the former Israeli-occupied south, the Lebanese
government on Wednesday morning deployed in the region its 1,000-
strong troops which have started patrol along main roads.
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. local time (0400GMT), some 700 soldiers and security
troops arrived at a former barrack of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) in the city of Marajayoun, 60 kilometers southeast of
the country's capital Beirut. The other 300 troops were deployed in
the town of Bint Jbeil at the eastern sector of the border.
</P>
<P>
Bint Jbeil is a predominantly Shiite Muslim township.
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m. local time, several armed security forces began to
patrol along the key roads near the barrack. Although they refused
to answer any question, their smile bespoke the pride to exercise
sovereignty on the Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. local time, a patrol team on armed vehicles set off
from the barrack and patrolled in the central region of southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A storekeeper near the barrack said he feels much safer by the
presence of Lebanese troops in the Christian-populated town.
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting for the moment for more than two months,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Murr Tuesday issued an order
to deploy forces into towns and villages in south Lebanon. The task
force, which was set up on June 5, is under the command of the
Internal Security Force rather than the Lebanese military command.
</P>
<P>
The task force will take charge of internal security affairs of
towns and villages in the liberated zone, leaving the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to patrol the U.N.-drawn Blue Line. It is
the biggest security consignment ever sent to the area since Israel
withdrew its troops from south Lebanon on May 24 after a 22-year-
long occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has not announced the size of the
operation zone of the task force, but it was reported that it will
initially cover the western and central sectors of the border line.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Israeli groups, Hezbollah guerrillas and Amal militiamen,
were dismantling their positions and taking down their flags in the
area shortly before the deployment. The two groups had taken
effective control of the vacated zone after the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese official, refusing to be identified, said the force
will set up checkpoints at key road intersections and dispatch
armored patrols to oversee law and order in most of the 750-square-
kilometer vacated region.
</P>
<P>
The government has been under pressure to curtail hostilities
across the Fatma Gate border post, where four civilians, including
two journalists, were wounded by Israeli gunfire in response to
Lebanese youths' stone-throwing.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon initially said it will put security forces rather than
army in southern towns after Israel ended its border encroachments
and UNIFIL concluded the first phase of deployment along the U.N.-
drawn Blue Line. The Lebanese forces went into the south before the
UNIFIL announced the end of its deployment.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL set up 18 positions in the past 10 days and will take
over 10 more in the next few days along the Blue Line. UNIFIL
spokesman Timour Goksel said that the UNIFIL has not completed its
deployment and will decide with the Lebanese government on the next
phase of the peacekeepers' roll-out.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL has formally requested Lebanon's consent to set up a
deployment position at the Fatma Gate, but the plea is still under
consideration.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Medical
Association (MMA) Wednesday suggested to ban all forms of tobacco
and tobacco brand promotions.
</P>
<P>
The MMA urged the government to develop a long term strategy to
phase out tobacco as a commercial product to curb smoking among
the Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Effective actions are needed to control tobacco activities

Krishnan stressed, suggesting that a fund be set up to assist
sports' bodies which might be affected by the loss of tobacco
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
In term of taxes, the government could increase tobacco taxes
by at least 15 percent per year in real terms and the taxes could
then be set aside to establish fund to assist sports' bodies, he
told reporters after presenting prizes to winners of International
Quit Smoking and Win Competition here.
</P>
<P>
He said the MMA had submitted its recommendations on tobacco
control activities to the Health Ministry, which include formation
of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) clubs in all schools in the
country, and rules that tobacco products to be kept behind the
counter and available only by asking the shop assistant.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Awarded for being First Asian Nation to Eradicate Guinea Worm Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has been awarded by an
international organization, Carter Center of the USA, for being
the first Asian country to eradicate the Guinea Worm disease, the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The award was presented to the representative of the Embassy of
Pakistan in the United States by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter at a special ceremony held in Atlanta recently.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimated in 1986 that more than
3 million people annually became infested with Guinea Worm in
tropical Africa, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan initiated its Guinea Worm Eradication Program in 1987,
and was the first country in Asia to eradicate the disease two
years ahead of the global target.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the disease get the roundworms from stagnant,
untreated drinking water, which could grow in the body to reach a
length of two to three feet.
</P>
<P>
The mature worms burrow toward the skin and release poison that
destroys tissue, causing a blister or abscess. As many as 40 worms
wriggle from one person.

BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Expanded and updated for the
1990s, the new edition of China's most prestigious Chinese
dictionary "Xinhua" will be published at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Youth Daily, in the dictionary's new

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tightens Control on Elevator Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing city officials have
decided to make a thorough quality check of its more than 30,000
elevators citywide, in an effort to guarantee the security and
safety of the elevators.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city's quality and technical supervision
bureau will open a hotline for citizens to call in and report
elevator related problems, according to the Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Beijing say the move is the government's effort to
trumpet support for hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Generally, elevators in such places like star hotels and
restaurants face little security problems, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
However, the problems lie in the 5,000-odd elevators now
operating in the city's numerous residential buildings, according
to the paper. "Most of them are products of the 1970s and 1980s,
and usually are not of high quality."
</P>
<P>
The government has urged that the old elevators be replaced
with new and high quality ones over the past few years and has
prevented over 100,000 potential accidents from happening,
according to the news report.
</P>
<P>
To further ward off the threat caused by old elevators, the
bureau will soon adopt a regulation, banning non-professional
companies from involvement in the maintenance and control of the
elevators in residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
Security has gained more and more attention from Chinese
government in recent years. Currently an all-round security checks
are also being carried out across the country, in the fields of
transportation, production and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Li Ping Sentenced to Life Imprisonment (Details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ping, mistress of Cheng Kejie,
was sentenced to life imprisonment today by the No.1 Intermediate
People's Court of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kejie, former vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, was sentenced to death on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Cheng was found guilty collaborating with Li and taking 41
million yuan in bribes when he served as deputy secretary of the
Party Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and
Chairman of the people's government of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Li was convicted of smuggling and taking bribes. According to
the court verdict, Li is deprived of her political rights. Her
personal possessions of 26.88 million HK dollars are to be
confiscated in addition to a fine of 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing held a public
hearing on July 27 concerning Li's accepting of bribes and
smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Li, a Hong Kong businesswoman, and the former leader
of Guangxi reached a deal that they would divorce their respective
spouses and then get married. They also agreed that they would
collaborate in making illegal profits by using Cheng's political
connections.
</P>
<P>
From early 1994 and early 1998, the pair accumulated wealth by
taking bribes. The two deposited all their illegal earnings in
Hong Kong, with the help of a Hong Kong businessman, Zhang Jinghai.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1994, Li and Zhang sold four duty-free import
cars, evading 380,000 yuan in custom duties.
</P>
<P>
Li confessed to all the criminal activities she has been
involved along with Cheng and Zhang. Meanwhile, she has returned
all her illegal earnings and told the court of crimes committed by
Cheng.
</P>
<P>
With Li's confession, all the illegal money including 11.5
million yuan paid to Zhang for his help in transferring and
cashing the deposits has been reclaimed.

<HEADLINE> 24 Arrested in Turkey over Export-Credit Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police have detained 24
suspects implicated in a 92-million-U.S.-dollar fake exports case
and are looking for 30 others involved in the scam, Turkish Daily
News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The police announced that after interrogation, they will be sent
to the State Security Court.
</P>
<P>
In a recent anti-fraud operation, policemen of the western
province Izmir busted a swindling network, which is centered in the
city but has expended to 15 provinces, and seized fake receipts and
fictitious documents of exports to 11 countries, worth a total of
92 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Izmir Police Chief Hasan Yucesan said on Tuesday that some 20
suspects have been taken into custody in the operation codenamed "
Whale Operation."
</P>
<P>
But he refused to elaborate, saying early revelations might lead
to the destruction of criminal evidence by other suspects.
</P>
<P>
One member of the Izmir Bar Association, Sukru Acar, was among
the 24 detained. He is the son of well-known businessman Mehmet
Niyazoglu, who is allegedly a key figure in the scam and is wanted
by the police, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, Niyazoglu is expected to surrender to
the prosecutor in the near future. In a statement, the wanted
magnate said that he is innocent and has been used by others,
adding he does not know any of the people taken into custody by the
police.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's news conference in Izmir, Yucesan said that "not a
single penny has arrived in Turkey from the importers of these
goods. There has been no shipment. It's a hoax."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that six companies were involved in the
fictitious exports. They sent cloth scraps to non-existent
overseas-based companies from which they had earned illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
The police head of the city did not name the six companies
involved in the scandal, but two of them were identified by local
press as Yeser Textile and Genckar Textile.
</P>
<P>
Hasan Celebioglu, chairman of the Exporters' Union of the
Aegean, reacted to the case by saying that "for four days we, as
exporters, have been hearing about the false exports from Izmir. We
are bored with it."
</P>
<P>
He argued that these fictitious exports were not made in
Izmir. "If they originated in Izmir, they should have been
registered with us. No such registrations indicate that these
unlawful actions took place and centered in Izmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the misunderstanding about Izmir, likely to hit the
city's exports and even the whole Aegean Sea region, should be
cleared up.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the Izmir police have been investigating
similar cases in collaboration with the provincial fiscal
administration and have discovered tax evasion through fictitious
exports worth 1.5 quadrillion Turkish lira (300 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yucesan said that "the unfolding of these scams is being traced.
The figure is growing. What should actually be done to prevent such
crimes is to rewrite export regulations. Trillions of lira have
been guzzled through abusing export legislation, and these figures
could grow."
</P>
<P>
In June, Turkish police launched a similar anti-export fraud
operation, in which a Turkish family business named Altinbas was
accused of conducting fictitious exports worth 500 trillion Lira (1
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some governors and high-ranking officials were implicated in the
case.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Release 728 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran will release 728 remaining
Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) on Thursday and Friday in two
separate stages, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The POWs, captured during the 1980-1988 war between the two
neighbors, are to be released on the border point of Khosrawi in
the western Kermanshah Province under the supervision of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
Iran's special commission in charge of POW affairs had announced
on Saturday that it would release 721 Iraqi POWs, but the number
has now been changed to 728, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The new releases will bring to 4,117 the total number of Iraqi
POWs freed since the start of the current Iranian year on March 20.
The last POW releases took place in June.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the eight-year bloody war between Iraq and
Iran, the ICRC has supervised the repatriation of some 98,000 POWs
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
But the issue of POWs is still one of the thorniest issues
hindering the improvement of ties between Iran and Iraq since the
end the war in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Iran says it has documents showing more than 3,000 Iranian POWs
are still being held in Iraq, while Iraq claims that almost 9,000
more Iraqi soldiers are still in Iranian prisons despite Tehran's
claim that a large number of Iraqis released are not willing to
return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year war claimed the lives of some one million people
and caused severe damages to the two countries' economy.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S., Britain for Blocking Oil Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday slammed the U.S.
and British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking
oil contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries within the
framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Because of the obstruction by the U.S. and Britain, a total of
1,313 oil contracts worth 790 million U.S. dollars have been put on
hold by the U.N. Sanctions Committee since the beginning of this
year, Faleh Hassan Al-Heiyad, general director of the Studying and
Planning Office of the Iraqi Oil Ministry, said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
As a result, only 20 percent of the contracts valued at some 360
million dollars were approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
"The obstructing and delaying of contracts will definitely lead
to the diminishing of the oil sector's capabilities to fulfill its
obligation of production and exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
What has been done in the U.N. Sanctions Committee is not "
conducive" to Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from Xinhua, the official pledged that Iraq
will continue its oil output increase "to maximize the financial
input to the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has an obligation to let Iraq produce as much oil as
it can to maximize the financial input," he said, adding that Iraq
still does not reach the production level of 3.2 million barrels a
day in July 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's current oil production stands at 3.1 million barrels a
day, of which 600,000 barrels are consumed domestically and the
rest for exports.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has frequently accused the U.S. and British members at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the implementation of the
U.N. oil-for-food program by blocking vital oil contracts for Iraq
to buy oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Since the humanitarian program was launched in late 1996, the U.
S. and Britain have blocked contracts worth over 3 billion dollars,
according to U.N. statistics released last April.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions ever since its
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Senate President Removed From Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate President Chuba
Okadigbo, the country's third highest ranking official after
president and vice president, has been removed from his post in a
impeachment in the upper house of the National Assembly, local
media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment vote, which was passed by 81 to 14 in the 109-
member Senate, came after an earlier motion calling for Okadigbo
to tender honorable resignation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the impeachment, Deputy Senate President Haruna
Abubakar and the majority leader Samaila Mamman resigned from
their posts to avoid being forced to step down.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Senate was caused by a probe panel report
allegedly accusing the senate leadership of violating the anti-
corruption law by awarding contracts.
</P>
<P>
Okadigbo, who protested his innocence ahead of the impeachment
by saying he would not be "stampeded" out of office, was accused
of inflating contracts, overspending on furnishing his official
home, accepting 200,000 U.S. dollars as a Christmas "welfare gift"
and acquiring eight unauthorized cars to bring his official fleet
to 32.
</P>
<P>
Senators were scheduled to meet late Wednesday to pick a
successor to Okadigbo and Pius Ayim, a 39-year-old lawyer from
southeastern Nigeria, appeared to be the strongest candidate.

LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
considering to set up three stand-by battalions that could be

reported Wednesday.

four battalions and a tank company. And we will be ready to
contribute more if necessary," Ogohi said.
</P>
<P>
Tonje expressed his country's concerns over the U.N. force's
mandate, saying "if you want to bring peace, you must lay the
conditions for that peace to prosper."
</P>
<P>
"The UNAMSIL must change its mandate from peacekeeping to peace-
making, or Kenya may consider the withdrawal of its soldiers from
the peacekeeping mission," he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened, Two Suspects Detained After Blast in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Moscow's situation remains tense
Wednesday after a powerful blast here, police have stepped up
security measures and confirmed two suspects involving in the
bombing had been detained.
</P>
<P>
The police have increased security measures in the capital.
Vigilantes have appeared in some Moscow yards and near entrances
of apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls reporting suspected packages of explosive have
increased rapidly, said the city police department, assuring that
all the reports have turned out to be false alarms.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 policemen have been tasked with ensuring passenger
security in the Moscow subway system. Dog handlers with bomb-
sniffing dogs are also working along the subway, checking for
explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
The the security around the Kremlin, the buildings of both
houses of parliament, the government residence and the buildings
in which state agencies are headquartered and their adjacent
territories, has been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
Russian special services have detained two men suspected of
organizing the Tuesday evening bombing: one Chechen and another
person from the Caucasian republic of Dagestan, said Vladimir
Pronichev, head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) operating
headquarters in charge of investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential envoy to the Southern Federal District
Viktor Kazantsev Wednesday described the bombing as "a ruthless
and brazen bandit challenge," urging law enforcement agencies to "
respond to this challenge quickly and professionally, not only in
Moscow but elsewhere in Russia."

<HEADLINE> Drug Test Results Taint Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tour de France is back at the
centre of a drugs controversy.
</P>
<P>
A French anti-drugs agency sparked the row on Tuesday when it
released preliminary findings that 45 percent of riders tested
during this year's race showed signs of banned substances in their
urine.
</P>
<P>
The International Cycling Union (UCI), which had earlier
announced no positive tests during the race, promptly dismissed
the results released by the Council for Prevention of Drug Use (
CPLD).
</P>
<P>
While the French Cycling Federation and the government muttered
their discontent over the positive tests, Tour de France race
director Jean-Marie Leblanc was annoyed at the premature release
of the results.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc said: "I am concerned that the CPLD has decided to
release its findings before the UCI has completed its own testing
procedures."
</P>
<P>
The CPLD said 96 tests had been performed on 71 riders during
the race.
</P>
<P>
Of those, 28 tests came back positive for cortico-steroids,
which reduce fatigue and act as painkillers, and 10 tests were
positive for stimulants salbutamol and terbutaline, which aid
breathing.
</P>
<P>
The CPLD, set up by the French government in March 1999, is an
independent body that carries out its own test analyses.
</P>
<P>
It has the right under French law to impose sanctions on both
French and foreign riders if it is not satisfied with the actions
taken by sporting bodies.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Denies Hebron Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin Wednesday morning denied reports that the Israeli government
is planning to evacuate Jews in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said, according to an
interview published by a Palestinian newspaper Wednesday, that
during the Camp David summit last month, Israel agreed "to cleanse
Hebron of the Jewish residents in the implementation of the final
status agreement."
</P>
<P>
But Beilin, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's confidant, said
he does not believe there is a reason for Jews to leave Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"The Jews are living alongside the Arabs there now and there is
no reason for them not to continue... especially since Hebron is so
important to the Jews," Beilin told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, a religious holy city both for the Jews and for the
Muslims, has been a Palestinian-controlled city in the south of the
West Bank since Israeli withdrawal in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still 500 Jewish settlers living in the city
under heavy military protection by Israeli forces, while the city
has an Arab population of about 130,000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Barak's office also denied Erekat's remarks
that there are proposals dealing with the uprooting of all Jews
from the city in the final status stage of the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the office stated that at Camp David, all the three
sides - Israel, the Palestinians and the United States - raised
various proposals and exchanged ideas, but no proposals were
accepted or decided upon.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the remarks by Erekat remains in the realm of
speculation and carries no significance at this time, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day-long summit talks, attended by Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, failed to
reach any agreement but reportedly made some progress last month.
</P>
<P>
In response to Erekat's remarks, leaders of the Hebron Jewish
community stated they will prevent any attempt to give Hebron to
the Palestinians "at all costs" and "without limits."
</P>
<P>
In another development, Beilin announced Wednesday morning that
he is due to leave for Washington later Wednesday to attend an
international conference and hold talks on the peace process with
U.S. officials, probably including Clinton's National Security
Advisor Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
The tour is part of a series of shuttle visits by Israeli
ministers to explain to the world leaders Israeli views on the
peace process, in order to counteract Arafat's similar efforts in
the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Transport and
Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak will also be dispatched to
several countries in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Beilin denied he is going to the U.S. for preparing a possible
second summit next week.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe there will be a summit in the same form as the
previous one now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Camp David summit failure, Arafat and other
Palestinian officials has stated that it is possible to arrange
another summit to add a final stroke for an Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel's leading opposition Likud party also claimed that they
has information that Barak will go to Washington again on August 27
for a second summit with Arafat.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine Al-Ma'unah
members who were charged pleaded not guilty in the High Court here
Wednesday to a charge of waging war against the Yang di-Pertuan
Agong (King).
</P>
<P>
Justice S. Augustine Paul fixed September 11 for the
commencement of the hearing of the case classified as a security
case.
</P>
<P>
The 29, including 27 who were involved in the arms heist on

to have waged war against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong from June to
July 6 this year at several places in the northern state of Perak
where the arms heist took place.
</P>
<P>
They are charged under Section 121 of the Penal Code which

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Governor Expects Lower GDP Growth in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Central Bank Governor Chatu
Mongkul Sonakul said here Wednesday that the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) growth next year is expected to be slightly
lower than earlier anticipated.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to the cabinet, he said that Thailand's
GDP expansion in 2001 is expected to be around 4 percent, compared
with 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year, due to a number of pending
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
The chief reason he cited for the lower growth rate is the
slower pace of economic expansion of Thailand's major trading
partners, with signs that the U.S. economy is cooling down.
</P>
<P>
The plan to increase value added tax (VAT) from 7 percent to 10
percent next year is also a concern, which can dampen consumer
spending and cause inflation to rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that generally speaking, current conditions
favor continued economic recovery, citing ongoing export growth
and government expenditure to encourage consumers, as well as
growing private investment as contributing factors.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Summons Pro-Reform Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Branch Three of Tehran's
revolutionary court on Tuesday summoned two reformist journalists
for attending a controversial conference in Berlin, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two, Hamid Jalaeipour and Ali Reza Alavitabar, attended a
seminar on "Iran after the February parliamentary election" held in
Berlin, Germany on April 7-9.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the German Heinrich Boell Foundation,
was condemned by Iran's conservatives, who called it a conspiracy
formed by foreign and domestic forces to undermine the Islamic
system.
</P>
<P>
A number of Iranian reformers who attended the seminar have been
arrested upon returning home on charges of advocating "pro-American
reforms" in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Jalaeipour, who was managing director of the now banned daily
Jame-e (Society), told IRNA that his summon had something to do
with his attendance at the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyer, however, informed him that he was being
subpoenaed to answer a complaint lodged against him in the press
court.
</P>
<P>
Alavitabar, who sat at the editorial board of another banned
daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning), also indicated that his summon
is connected with the Berlin conference. It was the third time he
had been summoned.
</P>
<P>
The move came after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
highest authority in the country who stands by the conservatives,
ordered the reformist-controlled Majlis (parliament) to forgo
amendments to the tough press law, which has so far dealt heavy
blows to the pro-reform press and journalists.
</P>
<P>
Some 22 papers and periodicals, most of them support President
Mohammad Khatami's reform programs, have been ordered to close by
the conservative judiciary in the past few months on the basis of
the restrictive press law.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Pay Brief Visit to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
due to arrive here on Thursday for a brief visit to discuss with
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on the Palestinian issue, the
Iranian Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit was arranged upon Arafat's request to talk with
Khatami, who is the current chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has visited several European, Arab and Muslim countries
since a U.S.-sponsored summit at Camp David with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak failed to reach an agreement due to differences
over the thorniest issue of the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Iran had voiced strong opposition to the 15-day Camp David
summit held last month.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has launched wide-range contacts and consultations with
Islamic states and Palestinian groups, calling for common stance
among the Muslim countries toward the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president has sent Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab
and African Affairs Mohammad Sadr as his envoy to deliver his
messages to leaders of Jordan, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi
Arabia on the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Sadr left the Syrian capital of Damascus for the Lebanese
capital of Beirut on Wednesday after holding talks with Syrian
leaders, in which he called for strengthening solidarity among
Muslim countries in their struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concerns over the U.S. statement to move its embassy
in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Iran underlined the
sovereignty of Jerusalem belongs to Palestine and the Palestinians
have the right to establish an independent state with Jerusalem as
its capital.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Begin Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
began a session of talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday morning on the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meeting were not immediately available. But
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Tuesday the two
leaders will discuss the latest developments of the Middle East
peace process, especially the negotiations on the Palestinian
track.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was expected to brief Mubarak on his ongoing Arab and
international tour to rally support for the Palestinians' position
on the peace talks with Israel, in particular on Jerusalem, Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here late Tuesday, frequently visits Egypt
to consult with Mubarak and get advice from him on the Mideast
peace talks. He last saw the Egyptian leader in the Egyptian port
city of Alexandria on August 2 after visiting some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Since last Thursday, Arafat has also traveled to South Africa,
Turkey, Libya, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> India Accuses Pak of "Sabotaging" Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home Minister L.K. Advani told the Upper House in a statement,
"The nature, location, context and content of the announcement by
Hizbul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahuddin can leave no doubt in
anybody's mind that it is Pakistan which has sabotaged the
prospects of peace in the state."
</P>
<P>
The offer of ceasefire was made by Majid Dar, a leader of
Hizbul Mujahideen in Srinagar and it was withdrawn by Salahuddin
in Islamabad, he said, declaring Indian security forces are ready
to face the challenge and threat of renewed militancy in Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the voice that made the announcement may have
been Salahuddin's, but the words came from the ruling
establishment in Islamabad which is the arch patron for numerous
militant groups engaged in state-sponsored cross-border terrorism
in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of India," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the Indian government regretted the
withdrawal of ceasefire by Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen (HM)
and accused Islamabad of "derailing" the peace process by seeking
to involve itself as a party in discussions between the government
and the militant group to settle the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said, "The government of India notes
with deep regret the announcement of Syed Salahuddin from Pakistan
that the offer of ceasefire with Indian Security forces in Jammu
and Kashmir is withdrawn."
</P>
<P>
The offer of ceasefire was made in Srinagar on July 24 by
Majid Dar, Hizbul's chief commander, and received overwhelming
support of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will continue
its policy of sending Myanmar students staying at a holding center
in Ratchaburi province to third countries for resettlement, the
Thai News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

Council (NSC) Khachadpai Burusapatana was quoted as saying that
about 800 Myanmar students at the Maneeloy holding center had been
sent to third countries so far, and the rest of about 1,000 would
follow suit.
</P>
<P>

Myanmar exiles from Bangkok to the Umpium camp in the western
province, forcing the UNHCR to suspend the relocation plan, the
report noted.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Shortage Hits Kenyan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A severe sugar shortage has hit
Kenya's capital Nairobi and its environs following a shortfall in
production from the main factories, media here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Uchumi and Nakumatt, two leading supermarkets in the city,
reported lack of the commodity on Tuesday. At Uchumi Kimathi House
branch, the management had put up a notice reminding customers of
the absence of sugar.
</P>
<P>
Reports from other parts of the country showed that prices of
sugar had gone up considerably.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation, the country's leading newspaper, reported that
the price of sugar in western Kenya had gone up by 30 percent. In
Nakuru, the capital of Rift Valley Province in central Kenya,
traders raised the price of sugar by more than 1,000 shillings (
about 13.5 U.S. dollars) per 50-kilogram bag.
</P>
<P>
Sugar was sold at around 43 shillings (about 0.58 dollar) a
kilogram before the price hike.
</P>
<P>
The sugar shortage was reportedly attributed to the breakdown
of Mumias Sugar Factory, the country's leading sugar mill, and low
production at Chemilil, the country's second largest sugar
producer, due to low supply of canes.

TOKYO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan has knocked back an offer
from world football governing body FIFA to co-host next year's
Confederations Cup soccer tournament with South Korea, officials
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A Japan Football Association (JFA) official said they had
rejected a request from FIFA to host the event because of
insufficient preparation time.
</P>
<P>
The JFA official said: "We told FIFA we cannot accept the offer,
because we received no information beforehand and it's almost
impossible to change the schedule now."
</P>
<P>
FIFA had announced Japan and South Korea as Confederations Cup
hosts during last week's meeting in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Michel Zen Ruffinen, FIFA's general secretary, said: "This
competition will be a sort of rehearsal for the World Cup, a
little like the Tournoi de France in 1997."

HEFEI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zurich-based Asea Brown Boveri (ABB)
, one of the world's top 500 transnational corporations, recently
invested 20 million US dollars to sponsor a distribution
transformer corporation in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui
Province.
</P>
<P>
The solely foreign-funded enterprise, the ABB Distribution
Transformer (Hefei) Co. Ltd, will go into production this year.
Its annual output will reach 10,000 and income from sales will be
240 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1992, ABB and the Hefei Transformer Plant sponsored
a joint venture, specializing in producing transformers.
</P>
<P>
An official from ABB said that Anhui's good investment
environment and local government's support for the company made
ABB decide to expand business in Hefei.
</P>
<P>
ABB's investment in China is expected to climb to one billion
US dollars in the early 21st century, the official added.

<HEADLINE> China to Restore Impaired Mangroves (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts like Fan have been strongly advocating for mangrove's
effects in filtering sea pollution and transforming sunlight
energy into organic compounds, which provide plenitudinous
nutrition to sustain varied ecosystems for over 2,000 varieties of
wildlife and cash aquatics.
</P>
<P>
A well-preserved mangrove swamp can yield 34,500-64,500 yuan (4,
156-7,771 U.S. dollars) per ha. of economic value a year without
any production cost, according to Fan, who is also head of Guangxi
Mangrove Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The knowledge has aroused the Chinese government's strong
attention. In order to combat the mangrove deforestation, China
has set up seven provincial-level mangrove protected areas, which
encase 33 percent of the resources. The State Council has called
on the local governments to restore impaired mangrove swamps by
reforestation.
</P>
<P>
China introduced a law on maritime environment protection on
April 1 this year, which has brought the mangrove resources into
legal protection. The country is also actively supporting
international biosphere protection programs. Its annual
appropriation for the purpose runs up to over 50 billion yuan (6
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With an improved awareness, more Chinese are expected to join
people like Liao Liezhong in planting mangrove trees along China's
coastline. The project is just as ambitious as the construction of
ecologically-sound forests in the upper-reach of China's major
rivers.

</P>
<P>
Local sources said establishing export-oriented processing
zones is part of China's efforts to standardize and boost its
processing-for-export sector.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate exports and imports from the sector
increased by 69.7 times between 1981 and 1998 in China. The sector

<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The most severe drought that
Jilin Province, in northeast China, has ever had in its history,
has so far cut grain output by 5 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial vice governor Yang Qingcai, 3.265
million ha of crops has been affected by the drought, with 976,000
ha of farmland producing nothing, causing 6.59 billion yuan in
direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
An investigation said that Jilin's drought-affected farmland
accounts for 74 percent of the province's total farmland.
</P>
<P>
Grain production in a dozen counties and cities was cut by half
compared with previous years, the vice governor said, adding that
local government has allocated 27 million yuan in disaster-relief
funds.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Kaifeng, the capital of seven Chinese dynasties in Henan Province,
central China, is stepping up efforts to construct five Song
dynasty (960-1279) tourism projects.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the project involve a total investment of
318 million yuan and is expected to be completed by April next
year.
</P>
<P>
Kaifeng was the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127).
It was then called Bianliang. The dynasty is well known for Bao
Zhen (Bao Gong), a honest and upright official, as well as other
well-known historical figures such as Ou Yangxiu, Kou Zhun, Fan
Zhongyan and other historical characters.
</P>
<P>
The five projects include reconstruction of a Kaifeng official
residence, a museum featuring ancient city walls and the Guzhou
Bridge, built in Tang Dynasty (618-907) and buried by Yellow River
's mud and sand during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
The local government plans to turn the old city into a modern
tourist center in three years.

<P>
NANNING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Liao Liezhong, a Chinese
fisherman, doesn't mind planting mangrove trees in the shoal land
of Behai City, a sea outlet of the Beibu Gulf in southwest China.
Liao knows it will work against the damage done by villagers who
converted some 100 ha of mangrove swamps into aquaculture
enclosures, which hurts the environment there.
</P>
<P>
Without the protection of the natural bulwark that holds back
tidal waves, sea water is eroding the rich swamp, as witnessed
Liao, who likes to see egrets fluttering over the mangrove
branches and droves of crabs and fish dwelling under the tree
roots.
</P>
<P>
The deforestation of the mangroves is the reason for an
increasing frequency of red tide, typhoons and a decreasing
aquatic output inshore, which has threatened the mariculture
industry, said Fan Hangqing, professor with the International
Mangrove Ecosystem Association.
</P>
<P>
His research in the subtropical Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China showed that the region, which has the
largest acreage of mangrove swamps in China, 40 percent of the
country's total, has seen the coverage drop by 10 percent, 5,600
ha., over the past decade. The resource-rich region is the home to
China's unique island and sandbank mangrove reserves at the
interior bay of Beibu Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The shrinkage of mangrove habitats has taken place in nearly
all the resource areas, as a result of the booming mariculture
industry along coastal regions and downgrading sea pollution.
Nowadays, China's total of 15,000 ha. of mangrove are intersected
only in Guangxi, some coastline sections of Guangdong and Fujian
provinces in south China and the southernmost island province of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
What also caused the loss were red tides that have struck China
's coast more often in the 1990s than before, which has averaged
out to about 20 cases annually, according to the figures with the
State Oceanic Administration.

XI'AN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Some Tang Dynasty (618-907)
imperial tombs in Shaanxi Province are to be reconstructed to
attract tourists, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
To be rebuilt at their original sites on Mount Jiuzong in
Liquan County are an altar and the tombs of an emperor's wife and
a princess during the first construction stage, Liu Wenli, a local
official said.
</P>
<P>
Of these tombs, the most famous one is the Zhaolin Tomb of Li
Shimin, the second emperor of the dynasty, whose reign was the
most prosperous period in the dynasty, and even in China's whole
feudal history. It used to lure a lot of tourists in the 1970s and
1980s, but its appeal has been declining for lack of new
attractions.
</P>
<P>
The construction work is now under way. A tourism road costing
three million yuan (about 361,000 US dollars) has already been
completed. The whole project is scheduled to be completed in 2005,
according to Liu.

JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- New elections will "probably" take place in the near future,
former Foreign Minister David Levy predicted Tuesday after meeting
at a Tel Aviv hotel with Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon, who said he
is making "immense efforts" to topple the Barak government.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also met with Center party legislator Yitzhak Mordechai,
who has retained his Knesset (parliament) seat despite his upcoming
trial on sexual assault charges. Despite his legal woes, Mordechai
is considered as an important player for Sharon, a potentially
critical 61st vote for either no-confidence motion or dissolving
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Likud leader and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met Tuesday with Shas leader Eli Yishai. Netanyahu has
made public appearances recently, indicating that he is, at least,
considering a bid to challenge Sharon for the Likud leadership and
run as the party's candidate for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel expects the Lebanese army to take full responsibility
for security along the new international border between the two
countries, Israel Defense Forces Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz
warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army is expected to begin its first deployment in
the south of the country Wednesday, after numerous delays and
postponements.
</P>
<P>
However, there will only be a partial military presence. The
Lebanese say that the forces will be concerned mainly with
maintaining public order and with the internal security of the
villages in the south. Thus, the Lebanese military will not be
deployed along the border.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
Tuesday downplayed the furor over his dismissal of Foreign Ministry
director-general Eytan Bentsur, saying it is natural for a new
minister to appoint his own director-general.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said the dismissal of four diplomats was not a "
purge" of those in the ministry close to former Foreign Minister
David Levy, but rather that he had simply decided not to renew
their contracts.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Quality Government Tuesday issued a show-cause
order forcing Barak to explain his dismissal of Bentsur, a move it
called "brutal and destructive." The petition is to be heard
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's summer break from the
Knesset (Parliament)is to be interrupted next week, as the
opposition Likud party Tuesday summoned a session of the
legislature. Next Tuesday, the Knesset is to discuss two Likud
motions to the agenda.
</P>
<P>
One discussion is to be held on the nature of Barak's rule, the
other on the possibility of Barak holding another summit with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Likud whip Reuven Rivlin said Barak "does not have a majority in
the Knesset" to back the talks with the Palestinians.

Tuesday regarding the retraining of Israeli workers for high-tech
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The extent of Israel's high-tech labor shortage is a matter of

some 10,000 workers, while other estimates place the figure at 1,
000 to 3,000 workers.

ANKARA -- The Turkish Association of Travel Agents (TURSAB) has
made efforts to boost faith tourism, believing that Turkey could be
the third most popular country after Israel and Italy in the
sector, reported Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
TURSAB Chairman Alex Baltazzi told reporters Tuesday that
because this year is the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus
Christ, Turkey wants to participate in the 50-billion-U.S.-dollar
and 100-million-strong tourist global market for faith tourism.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel and Italy had been promoting faith tourism
for a long time and that Turkey should also develop its tactics to
compete with these countries.
</P>
<P>
In Turkey there are some 316 sites of interest concerning faith
tourism, he said.

JERUSALEM -- Israel is expected to see its apple production in
2000 totalling 100,000 tons, only half of last year's level,
according to figures from the Fruit Board.

apple growers, 85 percent of whom are located in the northern
Galilee and Golan areas.
</P>
<P>
As required under a 1994 agreement with the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) organization, Israel will be allowed to
import 3,000 tons of apples this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Egypt Resolve Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The trade dispute between Egypt
and Kenya over tea and rice tariffs has been resolved after the
two governments officially announced the rationalization of
tariffs on the two commodities, the official newspaper Kenya Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Kenya Refaat el Ansary, flanked by
Kenyan Minister Nicholas Biwott for Trade, Tourism and Industry,
said here on Tuesday that the dispute was resolved amicably.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has agreed to remove suspended duty on Egypt's rice and
apply tariffs of members of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), he said.
</P>
<P>
Ansary also announced the release of Kenya's tea worth 450
million shillings (about 6 million U.S. dollars) held by the
Egyptian government in protest of the introduction of non-COMESA
tariffs on its rice by Kenya.
</P>
<P>
About one month ago, Kenya decided to levy 35 percent of
suspended duty on rice imported from Egypt and Egypt in turn held
Kenya's tea at its port, announcing to impose the same duty on tea
from Kenya and requesting Kenya to apply the COMESA tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Both Kenya and Egypt are COMESA member states which are moving
towards a COMESA free trade area which is to be launched at the
end of October this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Ansary, although a big trade imbalance exists
between Kenya and Egypt, in Kenya's favor, there is need for the
two countries to have harmonious trade relations in order to
foster economic growth.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Biwott said the Kenyan government has valued Egypt
and all other COMESA markets. The Kenyan government has put in
place necessary measures to rationalize trade in the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Egyptian government to import other products
from Kenya, such as beef, tobacco, marine fish, flowers and
tropical food, which are in abundance in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Prisoners Might Starve: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan prisoners are likely to
starve this year because of the inadequate 2000-2001 budgetary
allocation, the Monitor daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Internal Affairs Minister Edward Rugumayo was quoted
as saying that feeding prisoners this year has been estimated to
cost 6.2 billion Uganda shillings (about 4 million U.S. dollars),
but only 4.3 billion shillings (about 2.8 million dollars) was
approved.
</P>
<P>
He told the Parliament Committee on Defense and Internal
Affairs that even with an estimated food production worth 550
million shillings by the Prisons Department, there will be a
shortfall of 1.4 billion shillings.
</P>
<P>
"And this could lead to prisoners starving... The funds are
grossly inadequate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The total budget for the Ministry of Internal Affairs stands
roughly at 74 billion shillings (49 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Urges for Pre-primary Education Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's parliamentary committee
on social services has proposed that the Ministry of Education and
Sports should come up with a policy on pre-primary education in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee made the proposal Tuesday while discussing the
ministry's policy statement for the financial year 2000-2001, the
New Vision newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, nursery schools have been in
existence for many years in the country yet there is no policy on
pre-primary education from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We should have a policy that a child should go through nursery,
" said Victoria Mwaka, a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
She said it was unfair to have some children go into a class
when they were far ahead of those who did not have the opportunity
to attend pre-primary education.
</P>
<P>
By doing this the government is instituting double standards,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Another lawmaker Kibaale Wambi complained that it seemed as if
the education ministry was only concerned about the urban elite
regarding pre-primary education.
</P>
<P>
Those in the villages who could not afford to have their
children attend nursery were in a disadvantaged position, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has declared AIDS
a national disaster because of its serious impact on socioeconomic
development, newspapers here reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mariam Mwaffisi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health,
said in a statement issued here on Tuesday that the killer disease
is gradually disrupting development in various sectors of the
country and resulting in reduction in life expectancy of its
people.
</P>
<P>
Mwaffisi called for concerted efforts from all sectors, non-
governmental organizations, religious groups and other
institutions to join the war against the epidemic in order to
reduce its spread and mitigate its impacts.
</P>
<P>
She said her ministry intends to sensitize political parties to
campaign against HIV/AIDS in their political rallies for the
coming general elections which will be held on October 29.
</P>
<P>
This will help the parties understand the current situation of
the epidemic in the country, the responses being undertaken and
the various challenges posed, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mwaffisi, the health ministry has set up five
experimental centers in different regions of the country for
counseling and offering treatment to expectant mothers who have
been affected by HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death among adults in Tanzania.
About 1.3 million people in the eastern African country, 4 percent
of its total population, had been infected with HIV/AIDS as of the
end of 1999, a recent U.N. report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cities competing for the
host of the country's planned second board stock market may see
the result by the end of the year, said Shenzhen's Mayor Yu Youjun.
</P>
<P>
Yu was quoted by today's "China Securities" as saying that
Shenzhen is the best choice for the second board market, adding
that the city will make every effort to ensure that the market is
located in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese regulators' decision to set up a second board
market sparked off competition among Chinese cities for the host
of the market earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are major competitors.
But others also suggested Xi'an in the northwest, citing the
potential impact on China's strategy to develop its western
regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, Shenzhen has everything that is needed for a
second board. The special economic zone is the cradle of China's
market economy and has a prospering high-tech industry. Shenzhen
and the Zhujiang River Delta have a highly developed private
sector as well.
</P>
<P>
The mayor denied that the much-speculated merger of the
Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses would have a serious impact on the
city's revenue, implying that the new bourse would be located in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Observers said if this happens, regulators might put the second
board market in Shenzhen.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully reproduced sheep skulls, chicken muscle tendons and
pig joint cartilage through bioengineering technology and used
them in repairing real ones.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attending the appraisal meeting here recently
said the success signifies a step toward the reproduction of human
tissues and organs.
</P>
<P>
The research project was carried out by a group of scientists
headed by Cao Yilin, professor with the No.9 People's Hospital
part of the Shanghai No.2 Medical University in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
They first grafted stromal stem cells from a sheep's marrow on
a type of polymer material and made them differentiate into bone
cells, which then combined themselves with the polymer material
and developed into a compound the same as a sheep's skull.
</P>
<P>
Further experiments indicated the reproduced skull, when used
to repair the sheep's real one, integrated perfectly with the
sheep's original bone tissues, with no immunological rejection
detected.
</P>
<P>
The scientists reproduced chicken muscle tendons and pig joint
cartilage and transplanted them into chickens and pigs in the same
way.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Benefits From Desert-Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The decades long fight toward
restoring the desert-plagued Liaoning Province in northeast China
to the tree-filled forest it once was has paid off.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province has seen a total economic return of
more than 6.1 billion yuan (735 million U.S. dollars) for its
control efforts over the desert, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The desert area in Liaoning is now 2.42 million ha, or one-
sixth of the province's total area.
</P>
<P>
Local people began to plant trees in desert areas in the early
1950s, and planted 160,000 ha of trees in sand areas. The
province's forest coverage rate has risen from 2.8 percent in
1950s to present 23.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation not only improves the ecological environment,
but also provides large amounts of timber. Statistics show that
over the past 50 years the province has turned out 650,000 cubic
meters of timber in desert areas, valuing 163 million yuan (19.6
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Besides, trees planted has helped protect 1.7 million ha of
farmland and 110,000 ha of pasture, increasing an accumulative
grain output of 7.6 billion kilograms and 253 million yuan (30.5
million U.S. dollars) worth of animal husbandry.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Fails to Expand It's Export Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has failed to expand its
export markets over the years due to absence of a proper marketing
drive, the Financial Express said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's exports have been largely dependent
on some limited countries, which is one of the major obstacles to
boost the export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Although the country has now around 173 countries on export
lists, the majority of its export earnings comes from some
selected markets.
</P>
<P>
At present, the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Belgium
and Netherlands are the major export markets for the Bangladeshi
products.
</P>
<P>
Despite having a huge scope to expand the country's market
shares in various markets including Asia, Europe and some African
countries, the country has failed to boost its exports to the
countries due to lack of necessary measures by both the government
and the exporters.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the United States has been
topping the list of importers of Bangladeshi products, followed by
Germany, France and Italy over the years.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Bangladesh earns some 40 per cent of its total
export earnings from the United States.
</P>
<P>
In 1999-2000 fiscal, the country exported goods worth 2.273
billion U.S. dollars which was 39.52 per cent of Bangladesh's
total export receipts.
</P>
<P>
The United States imported products from Bangladesh amounting
to 1.967 billion dollars in 1998-99 fiscal year, 1.929 billion
dollars in 1997-98. The figures show that Bangladesh's exports to
the United States gradually increased over the years.
</P>
<P>
The United States mainly imports ready-made garments, frozen
shrimps and jute-yarn from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the second largest importer of Bangladeshi products.
More than 11 per cent of the country's total export receipts comes
from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exported products amounting to 658.02 million
dollars to Germany during 1999-2000 fiscal year, which was 11.44
per cent of the total export receipts.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exported products worth about 367 million dollars to
France and products valued at 247 million dollars to Italy in 1999-
2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the country's exports to Japan, Iran,
Singapore, China, India and Pakistan were not satisfactory as it
exported products amounting to 97 million dollars to Japan, 19
million dollars to Singapore and only 10 million dollars to China
in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the country exported products worth 64.
88 million dollars to India and 31.75 million dollars to Pakistan
in 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Although Bangladesh exports products to a large number of
countries, the export receipts from the markets are still at
negligible levels.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's export growth is
continuing at twice the rate of its import growth, according to
latest export figures released here Wednesday by the Statistics
New Zealand for the month of June this year.
</P>
<P>
The export growth has resulted in a progressive reduction in
the deficit in the merchandise trade balance trend. The monthly
deficit has been revised to 24 million NZ dollars (11 million U.S.
dollars) from the previously estimated 52 million NZ dollars (23.7
million U.S.dollars), giving a 3.187 billion NZ dollars (1.45
billion U.S.dollars) deficit for the year from July 1999 to June
2000.
</P>
<P>
The latest quarterly analysis suggests a steady increase in
returns for most New Zealand export commodities. New Zealand
merchandise exports rose by 5.4 percent in the second quarter of
this year. This follows an increase of 7.4 percent last quarter.
</P>
<P>
The rise in export values was assisted by the 1.1 percent fall
in the New Zealand dollar in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's export value of logs, wood and wood articles was
9.9 percent higher in the second quarter compared with the
previous quarter. The increased price of logs and continued strong
demand for logs, wood and wood articles have contributed to this
growth.
</P>
<P>
Its exports of milk powder, butter and cheese were 2.2 percent
higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter. The
increase in value was largely due to rising milk powder prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The city of Nagasaki in
southwestern Japan on Wednesday commemorated the 55th anniversary
of the city's atomic bombing with a call for the anti-nuclear
movement to return to its original spirit.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, representatives from
seven of Japan's leading political parties, as well as atomic-bomb
survivors and bereaved family members attended an annual Peace
Memorial Ceremony at Nagasaki's Peace Park.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the ceremony, Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito
presented a list of 2,603 people whom the city office has newly
recognized as victims of the bombing over the period between
August 1 last year and July 31 this year, bringing the total
number of deaths from the bombing to 121,458.
</P>
<P>
Ito delivered a peace declaration, calling on nuclear powers to
immediately begin multilateral negotiations for the early
conclusion of a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Nagasaki has remained the last battle field where nuclear
weapons have been used, with the unspeakable tragic experience of
Nagasaki and Hiroshima having served as preventative forces," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As the first and only country to have suffered nuclear attacks,
Japan must take a leading role in efforts for their elimination,
Ito said.
</P>
<P>
At 11:02 a.m. (0202 GMT), the exact time of the blast, Nagasaki
citizens offered a minute of silent prayer.

<P>
The bomb dropped from a U.S. B-29 bomber on August 9, 1945,
killed an estimated 74,000 people and injured some 75,000 others
immediately after the attack.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Nagasaki, three days after that of Hiroshima,
was followed by Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II
six days later.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Fails to Realize Decade Socio-Economic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has failed to realize most
of its socio-economic targets in the past five years as well as
targets for the past decade, local business newspaper the Saigon
Times Daily (SGT) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If Vietnam is to achieve an annual gross domestic product (GDP)
grow rate of 7 percent this year, the average annual GDP rate for
the past five years will also be 7 per cent against the target
rate of between 9 percent and 10 percent set out at the start of
the last five-year plan, SGT quoted a report of Vietnam's Ministry
of Planning and Investment (MPI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual industrial growth in the past five years
has only been posted at 13 percent compared to the target of 14-15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The service sector of the country also grew at a stagnant rate
of 7 percent annually against an ambitious target of between 12-13
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's agriculture sector saw its growth
surpassing the target, at 5.5 percent versus 4.5-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although Vietnam's GDP increases more than double in 2000
compared to the 1990 GDP, its GDP per capita this year is expected
to grow by 80 percent from a decade ago, falling short of the
target of a 100 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The total investment capital in the past five years was
estimated at 36 billion U.S. dollars compared to a planned 42
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year 2000, agriculture will still account for
a large proportion of 25 percent (compared to the target of 19-20
percent) in Vietnam's GDP structure, while industrial production
34.5 percent and the service sector 40.5 percent.

<P>
The cabinet decided not to reduce the sales tax to keep the
prices of petroleum products down, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the government will allocate an additional 321 million
baht (8 million U.S. dollars) to subsidize diesel for fishermen.
The current subsidy expires at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government raised gasoline and diesel prices Tuesday
to all-time highs due to the increase in global prices and the
weakening of the Thai baht against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Due to higher oil prices, the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand announced it will raise electricity prices starting on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Mass Transit Authority also wants to increase fares
for buses to counter the fuel-price hikes that have hit operating
costs.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi called for nation-
wide energy conservation, saying that unless the country conserved
energy, there could be another financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to allow substantial oil imports, it could
cause future problems as our trade surplus will disappear quickly,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said Thailand's oil-import bills increased by 113.5
percent year-on-year in June while total national imports for the
same month increased by just 18.3 percent year-on-year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Takes Measures Against Hepatitis Transmission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is taking measures to
prevent or reduce the transmission of hepatitis C, one of the
communicable diseases emerging in the country.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA), Myanmar is now able to provide test kits to the blood
banks in Yangon for screening of hepatitis C, Myanmar Minister of
Health Major-General Ket Sein was quoted Wednesday by official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony here Tuesday of a seminar on
control of hepatitis C infection, Ket Sein stressed the need to
expand the donor screening for the disease to all blood banks in
the country for nationwide coverage.
</P>
<P>
As hepatitis C infection is transmitted mainly through blood
transfusion, screening of the disease in donated blood at all
blood banks are being considered as an important step for
controlling the hepatitis C virus infection in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Ket Sein emphasized the major role played by the country's
Department of Medical Research in the conduct of both basic as
well as applied research, disclosing that the department has
successfully made the vaccine available to be included in the
national immunization program for the children in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He pledged the continuation to strengthen collaboration with
other countries and agencies, especially in the field of research,
in order to enhance research capacity and keep up with the latest
technological advances, citing the technical support rendered by
the JICA in health development.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1990s, it has been observed that there is a rising
trend in the prevalence of hepatitis C infection in Myanmar. Until
March this year, a significant step was taken with the
commencement of hepatitis C screening program in blood banks in
Yangon under the JICA-assisted project of the control of the
disease infection in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar will focus on the control of the hepatitis
C infection and the seeking of ways of improving blood banking
system in the country.

<HEADLINE> German Joblessness Slightly Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- German unemployment in July edged
up to 3.8 million, or 9.3 percent of the working population, the
Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Office reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 79,300 persons compared
with June, when the jobless rate was 9.1 percent. However, the
July figure was down substantially from a year ago, confirming a
steady improvement in Germany's employment, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The number of the jobless in July declined by 223,500, or 5.6
percent, than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Otto Semmler, deputy director of the labor office, said healthy
and continuous increases in western Germany's economy helped
create new jobs, but the situation in the east was poor.
</P>
<P>
In western Germany, the number of the jobless in July rose by
39,700 to 2.47 million, with the jobless rate remaining stable at
7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the unemployment rate in the east increased to 17 percent
with 1.34 million out of work, up from 1.3 million in June.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the monthly increase in
unemployment is mainly due to a seasonal factor. Companies usually
do not employ new staff during summer holidays while new graduates
pour into the labor market. The situation is expected to improve
in September or October.

<HEADLINE> Chilean President Calls For Understanding in Pinochet Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chile's President Ricardo Lagos
made a plea Tuesday for understanding and respect for the Supreme
Court's decision to strip Augusto Pinochet of parliamentary
immunity by a 14-6 vote.
</P>
<P>
This decision in particular stirs emotions and passions because
it involves a person who has played fundamentally different roles
during Chile's history in recent years, Lagos affirmed.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that this historic decision affects Pinochet
supporters and opponents in different ways. He explained that for
many this is a time of joy, for others it is disagreeable,
thankless and unjust."
</P>
<P>
"As President, I direct myself to all Chileans. First of all,
my request is for restraint at this time, and secondly, I want to
ask them to behave with understanding and respect as to the
tribunal's decision," said President Ricardo Lagos.
</P>
<P>
After the court decision, there were different reactions.
Chile's Army Commander-in-Chief Ricardo Izurieta immediately
expressed support for General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"Chile's Army, represented by its commander-in-chief and the
group of generals, together with me, have come to express and
deliver our support and solidarity during this distasteful moment
for General Pinochet," Izurieta said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Pinochet foes, who had waited outside the country's
highest tribunal for the formal ruling, jumped for joy. Others
hugged each other, and celebrated what they regarded as a human
rights victory over the military's father figure.
</P>
<P>
Chile's Supreme Court Tuesday stripped Augusto Pinochet, former
Chilean president and commander-in-chief of the Army, of his
immunity from prosecution, paving the way for the 84-year-old man
to be forced to stand trial for alleged human rights abuses.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Terrorists Engaged by Uzbek Army </HEADLINE>

<P>
ALMA ATA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Uzbek army engaged about 100
Islamic terrorists in a battle Tuesday when the group entered the
border area of southern Uzbekistan, according to the Uzbek
Telegraph Agency (Uztag).
</P>
<P>
Uztag reported deaths and injuries on both sides from the
fighting but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying the well-
equipped Islamic militants entered Uzbekistan on Saturday from
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
A Tajik army spokesman, however, denied the possibility that
the terrorists had entered Uzbekistan from Tajikistan. He said the
Tajik army had dispatched more men and resources to guard the
border area as of last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic terrorists are reported to be followers of an
Islamic separatist movement that aims to create an anti-government
terrorist base in southern Uzbekistan. The movement plotted a
massive terrorist invasion into southern Kyrgyzstan a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Miller Reportedly Agrees to Stay with Pacers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Miller, who scored the most points for the team, was entering
his 14th season in the NBA and still looking forward to winning
his first NBA title.
</P>
<P>
"It won't happen today but I think we're close," said Pacers
president Donnie Walsh.
</P>
<P>
Miller, one of the NBA's best shooters, was eligible to receive
up to 14 million dollars next season, but reportedly settled for
12 million for each of the next three years instead. He earned
more than 9 million last year when he averaged 18.1 points per
game, the lowest since 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
Led by Miller, the Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conference
finals five of the last seven years, and won their first
conference title and reached the NBA Finals for the first time,
losing in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers in June.
</P>
<P>
A five-time All-Star, Miller has played 1,023 games and scored
19,792 points, with NBA 3-point records of 1,867 baskets and 4,629
attempts.
</P>
<P>
Miller would become the fourth of the Pacers' six free agents
to re-sign after Jalen Rose agreed to a seven-year deal worth 93
million dollars, forward Austin Croshere signed a seven-year
contract of 51 million dollars and Sam Perkins for a one-year
contract for 2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Official Refutes Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) has refuted the allegation over "match fixing" in
the women's doubles between Indonesian players at the Sanyo
Indonesia Open here last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post Wednesday, the International
Badminton Federation (IBF) has questioned the PBSI over the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
PBSI Secretary-General Leo Chandra Wiranata said that a letter
dated August 4 was sent to PBSI after the Badminton Association of
England sent a complaint letter to IBF about the suspected problem.
</P>
<P>
"England head coach Lars Sologub protested to the IBF about
the allegation of Indonesian players fixing the result of the
match as it disgraced sportsmanship. They asked for an explanation
as soon as possible but we'll discuss it with officials in charge
of athletes development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sologub suspected Indonesian women's doubles Indarti Issoliana
and Vita Marissa were forced to intentionally lose to Etty Tantri
and Cynthia Tuwankotta, Olympic Games qualifiers, in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Vita complained after the match that they had to bow out to
their teammates.
</P>
<P>
But PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar refuted the allegation.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, Indarti suffered an ankle injury before the
match. I discussed the problem with training director Christian
Hadinata and Leo. Leo will officially answer IBF's questions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said match fixing was conducted by European countries
prior to the deadline of the qualifying players on May 1.
</P>
<P>
"Christian was really upset about this. If they didn't fix the
matches, how could Europeans jump to the world top 16 and take
over Asian leads in the rankings," he added.
</P>
<P>
Leo said that should IBF prove the allegation and if PBSI was
blamed, the federation could punish either the association or the
players.
</P>
<P>
"The players can be banned for life or lose their points in
the IBF rankings while the association could have to pay a fine.
People can protest anything," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Weightlifter Seeks Fair Decision in Evaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Weightlifter Supeni
expects a fair judgment in the final evaluation of Olympic Games
qualifiers this month.
</P>
<P>
Supeni said she would accept the results of the evaluation,
whatever they were, as long as the process was fair.
</P>
<P>
"As an athlete I only want to focus my attention on preparing
for the Olympics in Sydney in September. After the evaluation, the
judges will see which of us is able to represent the country at
the event," she was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I will show them that I will go to Sydney and fight as best I
can, not just go there for a picnic. I will contribute everything
for my country," said the mother of a 3-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Weightlifting, Powerlifting and Bodybuilding
Association (PABBSI) had planned to hold the evaluation before the
15th National Games (PON) in Surabaya in June.
</P>
<P>
However, the evaluation was delayed and on Monday the
association's new officials, named during its national congress
during PON, sparked controversy by issuing a letter expelling
Supeni from the Olympic training program.
</P>
<P>
PABBSI chairman Dharma Surya declined to discuss the dispute,
only saying the decision was in the hands of the National Sports
Council (KONI).
</P>
<P>
Olympic weightlifting team manager Djoko Pramono protested the
decision, claiming he had not been notified about the letter.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was resolved on Monday night when KONI vice
chairman and Olympic executive training director Arie Wibowo said
the council had canceled the letter and would only use it as a
reference point when naming the three lifters who will join the
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia can send three female weightlifters to the Olympics,
while it has been training four athletes: Sri Indriyani and Lisa
Rumbe in the 48-kilogram division, and Winarni and Supeni in the
53-kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Both Sri and Winarni finished second in the World
Championships, which also served as an Olympic qualification, in
Athens in September. Supeni finished fourth while Lisa was eighth.

mineral ores, and is rich in oil and hot springs.
</P>
<P>
However, these natural resources had been kept intact as the
region has a harsh climate and lacks oxygen owing to an elevation
of 4,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of China's "go west" strategy, the China National
Star Petroleum Corporation (CNSPC) and the China National Oil and
Gas Exploration and Development Corporation came to northern Tibet
for oil prospecting.
</P>
<P>
The CNSPC sank the first oil well last year in the Lunpola
Basin, which has a proven oil reserve of three million tons.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Henan Province sent three study teams to
northern Tibet this year. They have opened two alluvial gold mines
in Nagqu and built a gem-processing plant in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome inland and foreign investors to exploit the gold,
oil and antimony resources on the plateau of northern Tibet," said
Soinam Dorje, an official of Nagqu Prefecture.

<HEADLINE> China Has More Ethnic-Minority Writers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of ethnic-minority
writers in China is growing rapidly, and now there are 100 times
as many as there were fifty years ago, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
China's 55 ethnic-minority groups all have their own writers,
no matter how small the populations of some of them.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 6,000 such writers in China's national or
provincial writers' societies. In addition, the China Society of
Ethnic Literature and the China Association of Ethnic Writers have
600 members each, according to Liang Tingwang, a professor at the
Central Nationalities University and vice-chairman of the China
Society of Ethnic Literature.
</P>
<P>
Wang Pizhen, an ethnic Naxi writer, has written some 100
historical novels, and Mongolian writers have published more than
70 novels over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, only about a dozen ethnic-minorities has
professional writers, due to a lack of education for ethnic groups.
Many others had just oral literature or recorded events only by
carving notches on wood.
</P>
<P>
Chinese writers of some nationalities are transcending their
folk literature and joining in the mainstream of China's
literature and even becoming part of world literature, critics
said.

<HEADLINE> Amaechi Re-signs with Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Spurning a more lucrative long-
term deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, center John Amaechi signed
a one-year, 600,000 U.S. dollars contract with the Orlando Magic,
it was reported from Orlando.
</P>
<P>
Amaechi started Orlando's final 53 games and appeared in 80
overall last season, averaging 10.5 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.2
assists in 21 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
He attracted interest from several teams as a free agent,
including the NBA champion Lakers, who offered him a six-year, 17
million U.S. dollars deal last month.
</P>
<P>
But Amaechi, who played three seasons overseas before joining
the Magic last year, opted to remain in Orlando because the team
gave him a chance to play when no other NBA team offered him an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old can make more in a multiyear deal with the
Magic than with the Lakers _ as much as 27 million U.S. dollars
over six years _ but not until after this season, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Because of salary cap rules, the Magic was only able to
increase Amaechi's salary 20 percent for the upcoming season _ 450,
000 to roughly 600,000. The Lakers could have paid him 2.2 million
in the first year of a deal.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Police Crack Down on Fake Cigarette Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- the Sichuan Provincial Public
Security Department and the provincial tobacco monopoly bureau
have jointly launched a battle against the manufacturing of fake
cigarettes and closed down an illegal cigarette plant.
</P>
<P>
The case is said to be the biggest of its kind in this
southwest China province since the founding of new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of August 4, local police and inspectors from
the provincial tobacco monopoly bureau discovered and shut down
the plant, confiscating large quantities of finished and semi-
finished fake cigarettes, cut tobacco and tobacco leaves. They
also seized six sets of advanced equipment for making cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The suspects used a large abandoned warehouse to make fake
cigarettes under the pretext of producing fodder, according to the
local police. The plant, located beside the section of the Chengdu-
Chongqing highway in Longchang County, Neijiang City, could
produce 50 to 100 cases of cigarettes a day, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The local police are now hunting for the suspects.

and lower reaches of the river, is inviting bids and building a
road leading to the construction site.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Manwan Station was completed in 1995, at
a cost of 3.7 billion yuan (about 456 million U.S. dollars). The
five generating units at the station produce an average of six
billion kwh of electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Dachaoshan Station started in 1997, with
funds pooled by the state, Yunnan Province and the Hongta Group,
the leading tobacco conglomerate in China. Dachaoshan's first
generating unit is expected to start operation next year.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study for the Jinghong Station has been
completed. The governments of China and Thailand signed a letter
of intent on the construction of the Jinghong Station last June.
The station will provide Thailand with 1.5 million kw of
electricity by 2013, and doubled that amount in the following year.

<HEADLINE> TV Series on Private Business in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A 20-segment TV series which
reflects the development of private businesses in China is being
shot in this municipality in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
"Chaotianmen" tells the story of a private businesswoman who
started her business by selling small commodities on a stall in
the Chaotianmen Trade and Wholesale Market in Chongqing after she
resigned from a loss-making factory.
</P>
<P>
The Chaotianmen Trade and Wholesale Market, set up ten years
ago, has become the largest clothing and general merchandise
distribution center in southwest China. The transaction volume at
the market reached seven billion yuan (about 840 U.S. dollars)
last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has nearly three million
individual investors who own a total of one trillion yuan in
registered capital. They run some 1.5 million enterprises,
employing more than 18 million workers.
</P>
<P>
There were over 1.5 million individual employees in Chongqing
by the end of October last year.
</P>
<P>
China has included the status and role of the individual,
private and other non-state businesses in the Constitution, and
promulgated the Law on Enterprises under Sole Individual
Proprietorship, which became effective on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state has given preferential treatment to
private businesses in terms of autonomy in imports and exports,
and in getting bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Insiders pointed out that the TV series, which hails the
contributions private businesses have made to the country's
economic development, is part of the efforts of the Chinese
government to create an environment in which private businesses
can develop smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Taxi Drivers Prefer LPG to Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Continuing hikes of gasoline
prices in China have caused more and more taxi drivers in this
east China metropolis to turn to filling their sedans with
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), according to a local office
promoting LPG use in transportation.
</P>
<P>
The number of taxis which are charged with LPG increases by 40
every day in Shanghai, and there are so far 16,000 LPG-powered
taxis. This figure is expected to rise to 25,000 by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The drivers of taxis filled with LPG can save 30 yuan per day,
or nearly 1,000 yuan monthly, compared to those driving gasoline-
charged taxis.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will increase the number of LPG filling stations from
the current 50 or so to 80 by the end of the year, with the number
of repair centers for LPG-charged vehicles rising to more than 20.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2001, all of the 40,000 taxis in Shanghai will be
charged with LPG, and by the end of this year 300 of the city's
buses will also use LPG.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Accuses India of Insincerity in Kashmir Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has accused India of
taking negative and insincere responses to the ceasefire offer by
Hizbul Mujahideen in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Negative and transparently insincere responses by the Indian
prime minister and other Indian officials have destroyed the
possibility for a peace process," said the Pakistani Foreign
Office spokesman in a statement.
</P>
<P>
India must follow the path to a peaceful negotiated settlement
in accordance with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions
and respect for the wishes of the Kashmiri people, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged India to "engage in a meaningful and result oriented
dialogue with Pakistan and the Kashmiri leadership."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Pakistan has noted the announcement made
Tuesday by the Hizbul Mujahideen to withdraw their ceasefire
declared on July 24.
</P>
<P>
India demanded that the freedom fighters accept talks within
the Indian constitution and insisted on excluding Pakistan from
any dialogue process," thus, rejecting international calls for a
dialogue with Pakistan and the U.N. decisions which recognize
Pakistan and India as the principal parties to the Kashmir dispute,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Kevin Johnson Retires again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Guard Kevin Johnson of
Phoenis Sun, who came out of retirement in March when the team
needed him, announced his quits again.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Tuesday when he announced his retirement in
Phoenix that he would work as a television analyst during the
upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
A 12-year NBA veteran who joined the Suns midway through his
first season in the league, Johnson averaged 17.9 points, 9.1
assists and 3.3 rebounds in 735 career games and helped lead
Phoenix to the 1993 Western Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
After sitting out most of last season, Johnson returned to the
Suns on March 25 following the season-ending ankle injury of
starting point guard, Jason Kidd. Johnson played in six regular-
season games and all nine playoff contests as the Suns reached the
Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's average of 9.1 assists per game ranks sixth in NBA
history behind only John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson,
Kidd and Isiah Thomas. His 6,711 career assists in 10th on the all-
time list.
</P>
<P>
A three-time All-Star, Johnson is one of only six players in
NBA history to collect at least 11,500 points, 6,000 assists, 2,
000 rebounds and 1,000 steals. He averaged 20-plus points and 10-
plus assists in three straight seasons from 1988-91, becoming the
fifth player to accomplish that feat.
</P>
<P>
Johnson won a gold medal with Team USA at the 1994 World
Championships and finished his career third on the Suns' all-time
scoring list with 12,747 points.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was originally drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in
1987. On February 25, 1988 he was traded to the Suns.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Renews Call for Arab Summit on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT City, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani renewed his call on Tuesday for holding an Arab
summit to discuss the issue of Jerusalem, the Kuwaiti News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar is ready for attending such a summit," he said in a joint
press conference with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
Doha, capital of Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is always ready for attending any Arab summit to discuss
an Arab issue of common concern, he said, noting that Jerusalem
concerns all Arabs and Muslims. Arafat has called for an Arab or
Islamic summit to secure formal backing for the Palestinian
position on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is on a foreign tour to rally support for Palestinian
stand following the failure of the Camp David Talks with Israel
last month in the U.S.. The status of Jerusalem, which is claimed
by both Israel and the Palestinians as their capital, is the
sticking point in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the Palestinian track proved to be very difficult,
Sheikh Hamad said, but stressed "Qatar will always support the
Palestinian position in the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat said the Palestinians faced grave
challenges from both Israeli extremists and negotiators in the Camp
David talks on sovereignty over Jerusalem. "The holy city concerns
the Arab, Muslim and Christian nations worldwide," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Qatari emir called in Sanaa, capital of Yemen,
for holding an Arab summit on Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood
declaration.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has arrived in Bahrain from Qatar to continue his trip.
During the coming days, Arafat will also visit Egypt and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Camp David talks, hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton, were
designed to solve final status issues, such as the fate of
Jerusalem, the future of Palestinian refugees, the future of
Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, final borders
and security, to pave the way for the conclusion of a permanent
peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. But the talks broke
down on July 25 after 15 days of higgling.

<P>
CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Fuaad Saragedin, leader of Egypt's
New Wafd Party, the country's main opposition party, died on
Wednesday at the age of 90 after suffering breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
Saragedin had been suffering breathing problems in the weeks
before his death and had been taken to a hospital in Cairo on
Monday, state-run Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Born in the Nile Delta on November 2, 1910, Saragedin served as
government minister several times in the days of Egypt's monarchy
and was appointed secretary general of the Wafd Party in 1948.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the 1952 revolution, when a group of young army
officers toppled King Farouq, he was interior minister and finance
minister, and went into opposition after all political parties were
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
After the revolution he was sentenced to 15 years in jail, but
only served three years before being released.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he formed the liberal New Wafd Party and was party
chairman and chairman of the board of its newspaper Al-Wafd until
he died.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases Last Group of Iraqi POWs: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday released the last
group of Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) captured during the 1980-
1988 war between the two neighbors, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
All the remaining Iraqi POWs were released by Iran and
repatriated to their country through the Khosrawi border crossing
in the western Kermanshah Province, said the public relations
department of Iran's special committee for POWs.
</P>
<P>
General Mohammad Balar of the department pointed out that this
was the last group of Iraqi POWs who left Iran, but he did not tell
the exact number of the POWs released on Wednesday. He stressed
that no more Iraqi POWs are detained in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA reported earlier in the day that Iran was to release
728 Iraqi POWs on Thursday and Friday in two stages.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the last group of Iraqi POWs were
released by Iran unilaterally under an agreement with the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Officials from
both Iran and Iraq witnessed the release of the POWs.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has supervised the release of some 98,000 POWs from
both sides since the end of the eight-year war.
</P>
<P>
But the issue of POWs is still one of the thorniest issues
hindering the improvement of ties between Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran says it has documents showing that more than 3,000 Iranian
POWs are still being held in Iraq, while Iraq claims that almost 9,
000 more Iraqi soldiers are still in Iranian prisons despite
Tehran's claim that a large number of Iraqis released are not
willing to return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year war cost some 1 million lives and caused severe
damage to the two countries' economy.

MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Soyuz-u rocket
successfully put two German-made scientific satellites into orbit
Wednesday, the press service of the Russian Strategic Missile
Forces announced.
</P>
<P>
The two German Cluster-2 satellites were launched from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:23 p.m. Moscow time (1123
GMT) and entered a working orbit at 6:11 p.m. (1411 GMT) Moscow
time after separating from the Russian boosting block Fregat, the
Interfax news agency quoted the press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The calculated parameters of the satellites' orbits include a
maximum distance from the Earth of 18,000 kilometers and the
minimum distance of 244 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The satellites are designed for purely scientific purposes.
They are equipped with instruments and installations for studying
the sun's influence on the Earth's magnetosphere, said the press
service.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Deficit Up to Over 1 Bln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's financial
deficit rose to the unprecedented level of 1.025 billion U.S.
dollars in July, the Economy Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government's capability to achieve the budget
targets agreed on with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has
been questioned, according to analysts quoted by the press
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The financial target for the third quarter of 2000 agreed on
with the IMF is 1.3 billion dollars, meaning that there is a 170
million dollar imbalance for the months of August and September.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mario Vicens explained that the July increase
is due in a good measure to seasonal variances, which in this case
were reflected in an increase of transferences to the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Vicens said that the government expects to fulfill its
commitments because the next month's cuts in privileged salaries
and pension fund will be seen in the amounts.
</P>
<P>
Private analysts say that it will be difficult to reach the
goals agreed on with the IMF of 4.7 billion dollars for this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Albright Condemn Moscow Bombing Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have sent letters to
their Russian counterparts, condemning the deadly bombing attack
in Moscow and offering sympathy for the people killed and injured
in the bombing, the State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The explosion in Moscow was a very deplorable act of violence,
" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a briefing. "
It was committed, apparently, with the sole intent to kill, maim
and terrorize innocent civilians."
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack took place during the evening rush hour
Tuesday just blocks away from Red Square, which killed seven
people and injured nearly 100, including two Americans.
</P>
<P>
Boucher declined to comment on who might be responsible for the
bombing attack, which some Russian authorities said may have been
the work of Chechen separatists, but Boucher said Washington
welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin's statement that the
people of Chechnya should not be blamed for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We do agree with President Putin's comments that in the search
for perpetrators, it's incorrect to stigmatize a whole people," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Reward for Return of Missing Laptop Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
offered a 25,000 dollar reward for the return of a missing State
Department laptop computer containing classified information.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the reward might generate new leads in the case
and those would be actively investigated as well," State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The laptop was reported missing in January, and investigators
have not yet discovered whether it was stolen for its contents or
merely for its value as hardware.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the reward was directed mainly at someone who
stole the laptop to sell it, without interest in the contents.
</P>
<P>
"If people with nefarious goals took it, then they probably
know what they're got already," he said.
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the laptop was the third serious security
lapse at the State Department in two years.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Federal agents found a listening device in a State
Department conference room. The United States expelled a Russian
diplomat accused of using the device to eavesdrop on internal
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a mysterious man in a tweed coat walked into a State
Department office while employees were present and left with
classified briefing papers.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the investigators had followed many leads in the
case of the laptop but had not drawn any conclusions. That was why
the State Department publicly announced the reward, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Plants Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Thursday urged farmers,
local communities and conservation authorities to cement their
partnerships to protect the threatened lowland habitats in Western
Cape and Eastern Cape provinces.
</P>
<P>
The council warned in a study by researchers working for the
Cape Action Plan for the Environment (CAPE), that some 40 percent
of lowland fynbos and 90 percent of renosterveld have been cleared
for agriculture or forestry, according to a report by the South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Both vegetation types occurred only in the Cape Floral Kingdom,
a region that covers less than 0.04 percent of the land surface of
the earth but includes the highest concentration of endangered
plant species in the world.
</P>
<P>
The CAPE project, which is co-ordinated by the World Wide Fund
for Nature and sponsored by the Global Environmental Facility,
aims to develop a long-term strategy for the conservation and
sustainable use of the Cape Floral Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Proposals will be presented at a conference in Cape Town by the
end of next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the CSIR, there are not enough reserves to
conserve lowland habitats.
</P>
<P>
"These areas are often privately owned and we need to develop
innovative partnerships with local communities and farmers to
identify associated benefits such as tourism," said CSIR
environmental scientist Paul Lochner.
</P>
<P>
"Areas of lowland habitat have now been mapped and captured in
a comprehensive database, and to ensure these areas are
effectively conserved this information must be used by planners
and incorporated into regional planning processes," Lochner added.
</P>
<P>
The South African Institute for Plant Conservation has also
urged the creation of about three "mega conservation areas" that
are large enough to sustain natural processes and maintain bio-
diversity.

with HIV virus that causes AIDS, according to a report reaching

In Mozambique, the number of people living with AIDS under the

percent of the country's 18 million population.

that 1,394 Angolan and Congolese refugees have crossed border into
Zambia in the last five days.
</P>

The refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
cited the deteriorating security situation in their country due to
the civil war as the reason for fleeing to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, the refugee population at Mwange, which
can hold 25,000, has now reached 24,000. However, contingency
arrangements are being made to open a new camp at Kala in the same

ADDIS ABABA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
established military liaison offices in capitals of Ethiopia and
Eritrea to facilitate the earliest implementation of the ceasefire
agreement between the two countries, a UN official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In Addis Ababa, we have now three military liaison officers.
We are waiting for two more officers to come," UN chief liaison
officer Jukka Pollanen told Xinhua, adding the number of UN
liaison officers in Asmara, Eritrea, will also be five.
</P>
<P>
"We are here simply doing preparations," Pollanen said, adding
they were now working in a temporary office room belonging to the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The UN peacekeeping forces are expected to begin deployment
along the Ethio-Eritrean border before the end of current rainy
season, he said.
</P>
<P>
The current rainy season normally ends in late September or
early October.
</P>
<P>
Pollanen declined to describe the exact size of the
peacekeeping forces, but he said the number of the UN troops might
be between 2,000 and 4,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far the liaison office had got no report about
clashes between the two countries, since they signed a ceasefire
agreement in Algiers, Algeria, on June 18. The agreement, aimed
to end the two-year border conflict, was signed under the auspices
of the Organization of African Unity.

Thursday for a two-day meeting to map out the strategies on
mobilizing more resources to fight HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The theme of this meeting, mobilizing resources for an
expanded response to HIV/AIDS in east, cental and southern Africa,
can not be more appropriate at this point at this time in this
part of the world," Kenyan Minister for Health Sam Ongeri said at
the opening of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
About 24.5 million people live with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa,
accounting for 71.4 percent of the world's total, he said, adding
that however, most African countries spent more on debt repayment
than on control of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He urged participants to particularly take into account the
prohibitive and astronomical cost of HIV/AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that when governments commit their
political prestige and financial resources, they are able to limit
the spread of the AIDS epidemic and attract international support,
said UNAIDS Executive Director Peter Piot in his message to the
conference, read by his colleague. UNAIDS is a United Nations
agency focused on the international crusade against the HIV/AIDS
scourge.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Wednesday with the blue chips falling on profit-taking. But the
tech shares rose a bit.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 71.06 at 10,905.83.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also fell 9.93 at 1,427.87.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 4.95 at 3,
853.50, bouncing back from a loss of 14.44 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell today as investors took profits from a
strong rally despite a Federal Reserve's encouraging report
showing a slowdown in the U.S. economy. The blue chip index rose
465.72 points in the previous seven sessions in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book report that the red-
hot U.S. economy began to slow in the late spring and early summer
after six hikes in interest rates since last summer. The report
could prompt Federal Reserve's policy makers to leave rates alone
at the August 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Dow was also dragged lower by Wal-Mart. Stocks of the giant
retailer fell sharply despite posting strong earnings in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index rose mainly because Internet bellwether Cisco
Systems Inc. reported that the company earned 1.2 billion dollars,
or 16 cents per share, in its fourth fiscal quarter, beating
analysts' earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
The index gained more than 2 percent earlier in the trading but
gave up most of the gains in late profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.13 at 660.57 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 6.99 at 907.31. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 1.22 at 507.50.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered narrowly decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,459 up, 1,424 down and 477 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.05 billion shares from 986.83
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Vehicles at Most Affordable Level in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Vehicles are currently at the
most affordable combination of price and financing in the United
States since 1980, a U.S. bank reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of an average-priced new vehicle during the second
quarter of 2000 required 23 weeks of median family income, before
taxes, according to the Auto Affordability Index compiled by
Detroit-based Comerica Bank.
</P>
<P>
This compared with 23.3 weeks of income required for purchase
in the first quarter. During the second quarter a year ago, a new
vehicle purchase took 24.5 weeks of income, Comerica reported.
</P>
<P>
The previous most affordable level was registered in the first
quarter of 1980, when a new vehicle purchase required 22.9 weeks
of work, according to the index.
</P>
<P>
Despite the half-point increase in financing rates from a year
ago, the bank said, the key to auto affordability improvement in
the latest quarter was the impressive 6.5 percent gain in median
family income over the same period.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Women Fertility Rate Slightly Down: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Women fertility rate in
Ethiopia has slightly declined over the last six years, the latest
survey by Ethiopian Central Statistics Authority shows.
</P>
<P>
Abdulahi Hassen, general manager of the Central Statistics
Authority, said Wednesday that women fertility rate in Ethiopia
has dropped from 6.9 children in 1994 to 6.5 children presently.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the population rate of growth in the
country has been around 2.92 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
"If it continues to increase at the observed rate of growth,
the (Ethiopian) population is expected to reach about 83.5 million
by 2010, and it would double in 30 years to 129.1 million by 2030,
" Abdulahi said.
</P>
<P>
The estimated rate of growth will apparently pose a serious
challenge to the country, particularly in the provision of health
and educational services, employment, housing as well as
environment degradation, the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia once registered a 3.9 percent increase in population
growth, one of the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide survey was conducted on more than 15,000 women
aged between 15 and 49 and on over 2,000 men within the age group
of 15 to 59.

NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) will launch an Information Center in
the Rwandan capital Kigali in September, Rwandan Representative
Martin Ngoga to the ICTR told Rwanda News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngoga, the center is aimed at making the
activities of the ICTR known to both Rwandans and foreigners who
visit Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
However, Ngoga criticized the ICTR based in Arusha, Tanzania,
for deliberately slowing down trials and urged the ICTR to set up
a committee to identify the causes of delay in trials.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was established by the U.N. to try all the
perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which more than 800,
000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus perished.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Cooperate With Colombia for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will keep cooperation
with the Colombian government in search for peace, Vice President
Isaias Rodriguez said Wednesday in relation to the kidnapping of
Venezuelan businessman Richard Boulton by Colombian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
He said Venezuela will maintain cooperation with Colombia "
because it is also our peace."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said there is no evidence that it is the
Colombian guerrillas, not even a sector of the National Liberation
Army (ELN), which have kept Boulton hostage since July 15 in the
state of Carabobo.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president said he does not doubt what the
businessman family says, that it got a call, supposedly from ELN
guerrillas, to demand a 30 million U.S. dollar ransom for Boulton.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has said that his country will
cease collaborating in the peace talks between the Colombian
government and the guerrillas if a link between the Colombian
guerrillas and the kidnapping of Boulton were found.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,000 people of
the Lebanese Internal Security Force has left Beirut to deploy in
southern Lebanon, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said these
personnel will be based in two cities: Marjayoun in the southeast
and Bint Jubayl in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
The deployment represents the first step toward the gradual
restoration of Lebanese authority over southern Lebanon, and the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was supporting the effort
in accordance of the Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Lebanese Internal Security Force, the United
Nations peacekeeping force has deployed some 400 troops to 17 new
points in southern Lebanon in recent days, including nine along
the "Blue Line". It intends to deploy to 11 other positions in the
coming days, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced a complete withdrawal of its troops from
southern Lebanon on May 24, ending its 22 years of occupation of
the area.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland's Belfast Parade Re-routed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Parades Commission in Northern
Ireland Wednesday banned a parade by the pro-British Protestant
Apprentice Boys group to be held at the flashpoint nationalist
Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling by the Parades Commission is expected to clear
the way for a demonstration by up to 30,000 members and bandsmen
in the Northern Irish city of Londonderry on Saturday, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
The re-routing of the Belfast parade means that no loyal order
march has been allowed into the Lower Ormeau Road this year. But
the Commission held out the possibility that there might be a
march within the next five months.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, damage worth millions of pounds was caused in
Londonderry when nationalist youths rioted after the Apprentice
Boys paraded on the city's historic walls overlooking the Catholic
Bogside. Clashes occurred on the Ormeau Road when police cleared
nationalists attempting to block the march.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, nationalist residents and the Protestant
Apprentice Boys ended their talks over a parade in Londonderry on
Saturday with an "understanding" being reached.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Bogside Residents Group (BRG)
spokesman Donncha MacNiallais said there would be no opposition to
the Apprentice Boys parade.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration every August commemorates the Relief of Derry
from the forces of the Catholic King James II in 1689.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Parades Commission was established in 1997
to determine whether conditions should be placed on contentious
parades in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The new commissioners were appointed in February under new
chairman Tony Holland, a prominent solicitor and former ombudsman.

ROME, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Italy's GDP growth can be expected
to hit 3 percent annually in 2001-2003, a leading economic think-
tank said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic report, the European Research Center (
CER) said that in the next three years, the government should be
giving more attention to microeconomic than macroeconomic factors
and searching for ways of improving the country's "structural
competitivity".
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that this year's GDP growth can be
attributed entirely to a 1.6 percent growth in net exports, thanks
to expanding world trade and the euro's "substantial depreciation"
against the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
According to CER, exports will grow by only 6.3 percent next
year compared to 8.9 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Calls for More Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish
Republican Army's political wing of Sinn Fein, Wednesday called
for further movement from the British government on
demilitarization in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the extent of security force presence in
south Armagh, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the British army dismantled one of its main
observation posts in the area as part of the demilitarization
program announced by the police force in May.
</P>
<P>
The scaling down of the army presence came about as a result of
a security assessment which indicated the threat of paramilitary
violence had been reduced.
</P>
<P>
But Adams said the lack of action by the army to remove its
bases was giving dissident republicans more credibility.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the process of scaling down the army
presence had started, Adams said it had been "very small and
minimal."
</P>
<P>
He said that there was one member of the army for every eight
civilians living in the south Armagh area.
</P>
<P>
Adams also said there were five major military bases in the
area, 31 watch towers, 14 hilltop forts and 4,000 helicopter
flights in one year to one fort.
</P>
<P>
He noted the British government had "made a commitment" in the
1998 Good Friday Agreement to demilitarization.

<HEADLINE> Fears of vCJD Epidemic Unfounded: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Fears that thousands or even
millions of people may succumb to the human form of mad cow
disease appear to be unfounded, according to new findings released
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A study predicting the effect of variant CJD in Britain
concludes that the disease will ultimately claim between 63 and
136,000 lives, depending on the length of its incubation period.
</P>
<P>
This is consistent with fewer than two cases, on average,
arising from the consumption of one animal infected with the
cattle disease BSE - bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
Previously, a suggestion by European Union scientific advisers
that a single infected cow or bull could expose up to 500,000
people to BSE had fueled speculation that millions of people could
be at risk.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1996, around 750,000 cattle infected with BSE
were slaughtered for human consumption in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The new forecast, from Neil Ferguson and colleagues at the
Wellcome Trust Center for the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases
at Oxford University, is based on a study of more than five
million combinations of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
The team related the number of infected cattle slaughtered for
consumption to the incidence of vCJD, assuming that only the 40
percent of the population who are genetically susceptible to the
disease were at risk.
</P>
<P>
The results, reported in the journal Nature, imply that people
under the age of 40 must either be more susceptible to vCJD
infection or have been more exposed to the disease than the
average population.
</P>
<P>
Clive Evers, chairman of the CJD Support Network, said: "We
might take some encouragement from these figures. However, we have
to be cautious, there have already been 15 cases of vCJD this year
which is a significant increase on last year."
</P>
<P>
"It could still be the case that we are talking about thousands
of people being affected in the future. This possibility should
not be ignored," he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Health Department figures show there were 14 definite
and probable cases of vCJD last year, 18 in 1998, 10 in 1997 and
10 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Dataquest: China Becomes Largest Cellular Market in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China, for the time, became
the largest cellular phone service market in Asia-Pacific in the
first quarter of 2000, according to a report released Wednesday by
U.S. market research firm Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter, China had 51.7 million cellular phone
subscribers, while the region swelled to 170.7 million subscribers,
a 47 percent increase over the same period last year. Japan had
been the top country in the region, but it fell to the No. 2 spot
with 51.1 subscribers, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
The market dynamics varies from country to country in the Asia-
Pacific region, Dataquest said. In markets like Indonesia and the
Philippines, growth has been driven by prepaid services. In Japan
and Korea, new Internet services have been the catalyst, whereas
in Singapore and China, increased competition has been the prime
mover.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest analysts said that the industry has received a boost
by the growth in prepaid cellular phone services. The prepaid
segment had 12 million subscribers at the end of March. While the
prepaid market only presents 7 percent of the total cellular
service subscriber base, it has experienced stronger growth than
the overall market.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was the largest prepaid country in the region
with 2.7 million prepaid users. Dataquest said the country to
watch is China, which registered the largest net increase of
prepaid customers with more than 1.3 million new users.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The privatization of South
Africa's state assets is expected to yield 12 billion rand (1.7
billion U.S. dollars) on an annual average over the next three
years, a senior official said in Pretoria on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will greatly surpass the originally budgeted figure of 21
billion rand (about 3 billion dollars) during the period and will
be used to reduce state debt, South African Public Enterprises
Minister Jeff Radebe said at the unveiling of an accelerated
privatization plan by the government.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said at the same function that
the previous estimate of 21 billion rand on the proceeds of the
envisaged privatization is conservative.
</P>
<P>
"We have budgeted for 5 billion rand (about 714 million dollars)
for this financial year, 6 billion rand (860 million dollars) for
2001-2002 and 10 billion rand (1.4 billion dollars) for 2002-2003.
This now looks extremely conservative and we will be reviewing the
figure when we update our medium-term expenditure framework in
October," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mediators Upbeat on Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Mediators said on Thursday
they are still upbeat that the heads of the 19 Burundian parties
in peace talks may be able to iron out major differences on a
draft peace agreement aimed at ending a seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 10 pro-Tutsi parties on Wednesday suspended the
negotiations, which began in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha on
Monday, declaring a "day of mourning" after 28 cadets and six
civilians were killed in a rebel ambush last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the all-inclusive talks resumed on Thursday and the closed-
door negotiations are reportedly making headway towards settling
the differences between seven pro-Hutu parties and 10 pro-Tutsi
parties.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing with the facilitation of the talks and
expect to wrap things up on Sunday," said head of the mediation
team Mark Bomani.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement was distributed to the parties last month
by chief Burundi peace facilitator, former South African president
Nelson Mandela, but the parties are still at odds on a number of
issues including the leadership of a transitional government, the
cease-fire arrangement, integration of the rebels into the Tutsi-
led army and the proposed electoral system.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-dominated Burundian government led by President
Pierre Buyoya, and the two major armed Hutu rebel groups, CNDD-FDD
and PALIPEHUTU-FNL, have rejected to sign the document until
certain conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
The government has demanded cease-fire before signing the peace
agreement and control of the transitional government while CNDD-
FDD wants all political prisoners freed and dismantling of the "
regroupment" camps set up by the government for majority Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony has been postponed to August 28 due to
those outstanding points.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Rejects Former Minister's Application for New Party Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian authorities on
Thursday rejected application by former Zambian Environment
Minister Ben Mwila, who was expelled from the ruling party, for
registration of his newly formed party.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa told a press briefing
that the government rejected the application because the party's
name "Zambia Republic Party" is similar to "Republic Party" which
was registered on Tuesday. Mwila presented his application on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the rejection is that the constitution of
Mwila's party is the same as that of Republic Party Machungwa said.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa said that Mwila has been informed of the rejection.
</P>
<P>
On July 27 this year Mwila announced the formation of his party
but did not give the name of party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila lost his ministerial portfolio early last month after he
was expelled from the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (
MMD) on a charge of involvement in anti-party activities.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Start Titanium Mining Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will start
titanium mining in the southeastern country's Coast Province early
next year, Minister for Environment and Natural Resources Jackson
Kalweo said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said his government was only waiting for a feasibility study
by Tiomin Resources Incorporated before granting a lease, adding
that the mining will begin in Kwale District due to the high
presence of ores containing titanium.
</P>
<P>
Exploration for minerals at the coast, which began in 1996,
revealed four potential areas: Kwale with 200 million tons of
deposits; Mamburi, 700 million tons; Mombasa, 500 million tons and
Sokoke, 1,700 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Due to high presence of heavy metals including rutile, zircon
and ilmenite at the Kwale site, the company recommended that the
area be exploited first," said Kalweo.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the minister said, the company applied to the
government for a mining lease for an area of 56 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that a licence will be granted only when the
feasibility study was completed to the government's satisfaction.
The study is expected to be finished by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Management and Co-ordination Bill which came
into effect in January grants the company powers to conduct both
an environmental impact assessment and feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
According to Kalweo, the company has so far spent nearly 250
million shillings (about 3.73 million U.S. dollars) on exploration
and sand tests. It is estimated that exploitation of the minerals
at Kwale requires an investment estimated at 96 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investment of the project, the minister argued, would
employ 200 people, upgrade a 50-km road, and earn Kenya foreign
exchange estimated at 42 million dollars annually, and other
benefits expected are tax revenue from the company and income tax
revenue from employees.
</P>
<P>
Kalweo also dismissed complaints about the project, saying "the
environmental impact assessment by the company has so far showed
the project will not threaten the environment or the inhabitants
in any way."
</P>
<P>
The project is vigorous opposed by some politicians, wildlife
experts and environmentalists who claim it will expose residents
to harmful radioactivity, damage the environment on both land and
in the sea, and harm tourism.
